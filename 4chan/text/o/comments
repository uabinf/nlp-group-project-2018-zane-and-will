cars that you thought were cool when you were a kid that you hate now
a lot of supercars
bmw cars
hummer h2
  h2   thats very understandable anon ill keep you in my prayers
  poor frankie wanted to be a racecar driver
  this all the wedgeshaped ones for sure
  yeah i remember that old stunt he tried to pull
  ive seen his jetta around town a few times its for sale now for a ridicules price   
mustang
  what wtf is going on  i missed this shit
z32  foxbody  every shitty 80s car that looked kinda sporty  80s cars in general really
  dodge ram i think trucks are fucking retarded now
  i completely agree with this one
  fucking jeep wrangler
tesla model 3
the final gen toyota celica i thought they were fast back then though
  when you were a kid     how old are you
  this looks like a film set
      theyve been doing this for a while
  celica because i played nfsu2 and thought it looked cool then grew up and found out that its fwd only ill never forgive it for playing with my emotions like that
  only the last gen i believe
  saleen s7
  really nobody fkng this oh wait i forgot most of you are either white or ken block
3rd gen mitsubishi eclipse
  celica was generally fwd from 19862005      i said foxbody im not contrarian enough to hate every mustang because theyre popular
  i used to think the pt cruiser was super cool
  got em
  bruce jenner won twice
there isnt a single bad episode of malcolm in the middle
  this but for any fwd piece of shit
  foxbody  fight me busrider
  once they visited canada or family from canada visited them the series dropped horribly where every other episode was trash
  even if you dont love the mustang i think its hard to actually hate it it is extremely cheap and decently fast 11 move into really god damn fast
these       dodge viper  mini cooper
fj cruiser
  thats one ugly car shit
  always liked that color scheme
  i see what you did there
audi tt    i was always warned that it was a faggy car when i was young but only realised it myself when i became 17 or some shit
this thing just screams early 2000s
  seriously between this and the crossfire what the fuck was chrysler doing then
  rails of coke
new edge mustangs
  i think everyone born in the early to mid 90s thought the h2s were cool especially the truck version       i didnt care really care for the new edges but i though the sn197s were cool as shit       i had a landbarge phase when i was 1415 but having a civic has a first car made me fall in love with small jap cars still a hondafag to this day
  modern ones are overstyled to shit old ones however look like literal doorstops
  audis
  i just saw one of these last month god did it make me happy
  its some sort of bastard child of the pt cruiser
        these
i only thought helicopters and space shuttles were cool when i was a kid
  le mans prototypes weirdly enough
  the pt cruiser was the son compared to that god machine
  yeah i fail for the meme too
  why 3rd specifically
    my local toyota dealer has been trying to get rid of this thing for like 6 months
  come and say that to my face and see what happens that generation of hot wheels is untouchable
  remove god awful plastic blinker things  change out 4spd auto for a 6 spd manual  wouldve been a pretty fun car desu
  two supercharged v12s  absolute  madman
  vw beetle   i had dozens of toys and models and posters of the shitbox i even had a beetle telephone
all cars are shit to me now i grew into realizing there isnt a single car on the planet that doesnt compromise some aspect that defines a positive driving experience
  when they stopped making them in 03 i was 12 and i thought it was the death of muscle cars now i think theyre ugly with a shit interior and boomer fanbase
the plymouth prowler i think i was 10 when it came out and to me it was the coolest new car on the road later on as i learned more i found out it came with a shitty v6 and was pretty slow very disappointing still if you were to buy one today and v8 swap it it would be pretty cool
  what a gay opinion  everything is beneath me  gay
can you roll coal in a 90s tdi jetta
why wouldnt you be able to
  i understand conceptually that any modified diesel should be able to do it    i also cannot reconcile a tiny little hippy fag car with giant black smoke clouds choking out cyclists its like imagining a midget doing a pole jump
imagine being american and driving a tdi jetta in the 90s
  is this s o y or autism
  german vehicle  not autism
  tfw no diesel swapped na miata to roll coal in
  no cummins swapped rx7 to roll coal in
  tfw no cummins swapped s13 convertible to roll coal in
i mean  technically yeah  but youd look like a royal goofball doing it
  tfw no powerstroke 60 swapped skyline to roll coal vape coolant and break down in
hey lets use a cvt in our car  brilliant  uh it looks like people find the lack of shifting akward  well make the cvt shift  brilliant  uh well it looks like cvts are wearing out mostly during acceleration  well add a first gear  brilliant
  well make the cvt shift  and in the process eliminate the inherent advantage of cvt  brilliant
what is the most unsafe car on the road these days    pic unrelated
korean built cars
  fpbp
  depends what you mean by unsafe  do you mean how well its occupants survive a crash  how dangerous the car is to other people  or how easy the car is to crash    also do ancient retardedly fast hard to control homologation cars with bodies that will squish like tin foil count  if so then probably those
  any one of those just unsafe in general
  pretty much anything normal sized and sub 2700lbs from the early 2000s and back my 2600lb wagon is pretty much a tin can and if any modern 5000lb crossover hits me im fucked
anything not driven by a white male
brings a peel p50 to a street race with gtrs and supras
brings a dildo to a gunfight
the only thing that matters is skill
  it probably has a turbocharged motorcycle engine and awd
engine swaps a peel p50 with a litrebike engine  drags the gtrs and supras
blemp
tapes autozone spoiler on top  400 pounds of downforce
  a skilled p50 can beat any gtr
itt forzafags jerk off to their meme car
  awd  it has three wheels how the cunt would you awd that
  you go to drive train layout and select awd
holy shit just buy a scooter
  but 3wd is awd because it gi es power to all 4 wheels
  it was a top gear meme first nigger
like a rock
  a man you just get one a dem chevy turk ya mean man shieeet like a dang old rokc man
good thread    i would post image but this is new computer merry christmas
  like a planet
what ever happened to that guy with the modded suburban with escalade parts on it
  they should have never ditched that ad campaign
  i was strong as i could be
  you know chevy commercials are bad when progressive insurance commercials make fun of you
  glad im not the only one who remembers burbalade
everyone here is too young to remember this cringe 
  i mean it was bad 
  tfw i like it i mean sure its basic and targeting hunters but shit i like the vehicles and commercials more then the new shit i cant stand all the cuvsuv commericals being sporty
      youre going to call that bad when kia has fucking hamster commercials
  this when did commercials stop showing cars doing what the cars will actually be doing    leabians dont even like camping yet every subaru commercial shows how out in the wild this vehicle allows you to be its such garbage that says nothing about the vehicle truck commercials are the only ones that have ever made sense
    too young to remember the commercials but i owned one of these bad boys years ago and i could shoot myself for selling it
  hell ya brotha    the last 4 seconds of this one never fails to make me laugh 
the basedboi runs back to his hybrid crossover when he hears this
  thats sexy
  like a fucking atom bomb
  what happened he died
  thank you i loved that truck
  holy shit thats bad    this is not that bad   both of these are better than that smug asshole and his real people talking about how great the chevy malibu is
    ive had 6 or 7 of these 2nd best truck chevy ever built would gladly buy 6 or 7 more
like a kek
    based lads remaining unperturbed by the joy and the madness that they encounter everywhere they turn
    oh fuck i hadnt seen this  holy shit this is great
  whats the 1st best
  ive seen it all along 
    imagine being such a piece of shit company you need to resort to muh patriotism in order to sell your junk
  yeah that totally never happened at renault or vw or any other manufactures that are partially owned by their government
  ironically all the german engineering commercials are from the us its not exactly considered a unique selling point in germany  most vw commercials are known for being funny read unfunny but funny by commercial standards
  most vw commercials are known for being funny read unfunny but funny by commercial standards    i had forgotten about these
  yeah we figured out it was a ruse also
    sits in your yard unmoving for several years at a time
    you what
  damn those commercials take me back
  if you listen real close you can hear the whales
i see plenty of rocks sitting by the side of the road not moving so like a rock fits chevy trucks pretty well
  should have been like a knock    that piston slap a cracking like a knock its completely normal like a knock
like a rock
  i sold it    now id buy one even if it was just a shell fucking rare as shit    mine was grey like this

  here have a pic of mine
  im the real one stop posting my car
dont listen to them im the real daytona poster
  i havent seen many that are the same i think theyre oem
    now hangon a second  theres only room for 1 insufferable faggot car on this board and thats me
honestly i like the daytona 90s dodges are cool and quirky
  not blue  even a hatchback  no subtle ur slow wordplay  0/10
selling my old bugeye sedan for something with a bit more room however this might be my second car ever so some sage advice would be appreciated 
  why would you sell a bugeye of all things for a dumbed down version of the wrx if anything go for a hawkeye or blobeye wagon if space is your main priority the time the impreza/wrx converted from the wagon to hatch platform is the absolute worst
if you want a wrx hatch by all means dont get the 20082010 model get the 20112014 model
  if its a daily driver yes buy the wrx if youre buying it as a weekend car/sports car spend the extra money for an sti its a higher quality vehicle with more basic and oldschool mechanics     and what    said is right for wrx but sti any year youll be good
  that particular wrx in your pic is rubbish everything except the engine is base model impreza if you want that shape get a newer one with a widebody
what is 1 horse power exactly how do we measure it and is there an international standard i find it hard to believe that they measure 1 horses power and just calculate upwards
1 horsepower  550 ftlbs/s
748 watts roughly the power the horse needs to pull a wagon at walking pace this measurement was used in the early days to demonstrate the superiority of a horseless carriage
some guy sat in a field watching his horse he then guessed no shit
  wrong  dates back to early steam power my dude  same amount of power 1 horse can make while making absolutely zero effort  its the power of one fucking lazy shit horse a 200hp car has nowhere near as much power as 200 real horses
  a human in peak physical condition can actually make more than 1 horsepower which i find kind of funny
  just google it retard
  so its a shit metric
  the funniest thing of all is when you discover a horse actually makes about 15hp    one horsepower is the amount of work one horse can do in an hour which is a completely arbitrary amount desu
  the amount of of power it takes to lift a mass of 75kg 1 meter up in the air within a single second  wikipedia is your friend zoomer
  1 horsepower doesnt actually equal the power of 1 horse because some cum guzzling brain damaged quadruple nigger thought that was somehow a good idea
  a horse can do 1hp continuous their peak is around 15hp they also make a lot of torque at 0 rpms
    it takes into account the fact that you cant work a horse 24/7 or it will die
pretty sure a normal horse has less hp than this big guy
horsepower is a measure of torques per minute
horsepower hp  torque t  rpm / 5252  using ftlbs as units for measuring torque
  s a g g y s h e a t h   a  g  g  y    s  h  e  a  t  h
  yeah try to pack while trying to hide it its impossible
  drafts always are like that
  why does his shirt say fuck my dick
  its a request
  so i could delete the engine and transaxle in an air cooled beetle and hitch two horses to it for a fucking powerful machine
  1hp is like 745 watts
  tfw show and grow
  id love to try on that one
  yes of course it is    it would have much more power  couldnt go faster though horses have shit gear ratios for speed could tow shit with it though lots of torque horses are basically diesels
  technically theyre like a big dc motor because they got that torque from a standstill    
  something tells me they have a bit more than 2 hp based on how effortlessly they got that truck moving more like 50 between them
  its 5uck so suck  have the same shirt
here is a small story that happened about 6 hours ago    me  driving home from work in unplowed snowy roads  so close to home i drove very well  come up to a left turn  think to myself it would be fucking crazy if i slid right now haha  start sliding on patch of ice gut wrenching understeer  horyfuckingshetmov  plant right front wheel into curb going about 7 mph  100db crunch  drive the 1/4 mile home to investigate damage because scared shitless  entire way car shaking pretty violently  arrive  hub cap missing  wheel clearly not straight when steering wheel is straight  giant dent in oem toyota steel wheel  look under lower control arm mangled liquid slowly coming out of cv axle connecting to knuckle  small panic attack  tell brother he actually goes to the spot and brings me back my cracked hub cap for fun  thinking about likely busted cv axle and power steering rack and needing replacement got me fucked up  go online searching for ebay aftermarket shit  now  i have to drive my rwd project car in the snow to work now until i repair it stay safe o i may update if i fuck that one up as well
  drive the 1/4 mile home to investigate damage because scared shitless  i remember being a teenager good times
ive got a story    me  driving home from work in unplowed snowy roads  come up to a left turn  think to myself it would be fucking crazy if i slid right now haha  especially since i have winter tires on my car  make the turn without incident  get home without incident
  oh gosh i have that samestory in my porsche boxster even
  i slid some on porpoise and it was fin but sometimes its scary if you slid when you did not mean to i slid on accident a couple of times
  thats an afternoon of work no big deal
when a fat fucking tree is blocking the road and you try to cut it into small pieces and pull them out of the way but one of the logs gets stuck and the steel cable snaps and shatters your rear window and you drive home freezing and contemplate suicide
when you live for winter and cant wait to do hekrik skids errywhere
  learn to drive faggot
  i dont think you have winters at the equator
  inb4 snow tires help on ice
  snow tires  nowhere in my post did i say snow tires i use studded winter tires
  they dont
be me   on summer tires  honda vtm4  on unplowed roads  wow it would really be crazy if i slid rn  kick parking brake have it jammed so it wont lock  do skids  fishtail about 5 times  dont hit anything  feels good
  
me  driving home from work in unplowed snowy roads  so close to home i drove very well  come up to a left turn  think to myself it would be fucking crazy if i farded right now haha  shidded  pic unrelated
me  driving home from work on salted roads after freezing rain  so close to home i drove very well  come up to a left turn  think to myself it would be fucking crazy if i slid right now haha  there was no ice on the road because it was salted  made it home safely  my amazon package arrived on time as well because the lack of ice allowed business to continue to operate  15 years later i start seeing some rust on the bolts on the lower side of my car  fucking government should be sued for ruining my car with that god damn salt
  fwd fucking sucks    protip if youre gunna hit a curb steer into the curb you wont cause thousands of dollars in damage if you do
  15 years   not a rotted out shitheap   floridian detected
  kentucky the roads are salted the majority of the time from november to march i never even wash my car and the only rust issues ive had are exhaust bolts bolts on the bottom of the front bumper and some tiny spots on the hood where the paint chipped off from rocks its a 19 year old toyota
me  driving home from work on 6 of fresh powder in my 05 civic  so close to home i drove very well  come up to a left turn  think to myself it would be fucking crazy if i understeered into the parked cars right now haha  start to turn  correct understeer with handbrake  made it home safely
  why would you not slow down for the turn if you werent confident
  oh you sweet summer child
  me  driving home from work after the roads rapidly froze over basically like a hockey rink  so close to home i drove very well  come up to a left turn  think to myself it would be fucking crazy if i slid right now haha  turn onto my street with literally zero incidents  walk inside to my cozy apartment  life goes on
hello fellow anons im a senior in high school and started to realize that prom is coming up knowing i wont get a date i was thinking about driving people around in my 03 pontiac montana drive people to prom and after prim etc for money i was wondering if would need a chauffers license in order to do this i live in indiana btw
no license if doing cash and will get luckier with dumped and drunk gals too
if you got the  try turo doug likes to shill it a lot but its actually not too bad to use for a single day or so
    op doesnt realize the liability exposure     oh boy
  just do it if its for one night for some hush schoolers nothing is really gonna happen plus youll get some decent money and maybe get lucky with a thottie
post rare or niche modern 19902010 british sports cars    this car is the invicta s1 20042012
heres your base premium audi q3 model sir the one without the touchscreen infotainment like you wanted    thatll be 34400    how to operate the radio through the digital cluster in front of you of course you just have to use the controls on your steering wheel    have a nice day and thanks for shipping at audi
our base model gets leather auto and a shitty pop out screen for the same price
  its not even the same model anon the one i posted is the newest model    with that said in your market people are way less cucked and brainwashed than europeanswe actually buy this shit and theres no hope for this cancer to end until vw group will be nuked
  does it fit a box of chicken nuggets
  its a lifted golf ill stick with my fk8
  nah we get screwed bad ours will be built in mexico
holy hell bro if i didnt see the audi badge i wouldve thought this was a 2018 honda civic interior shot absolutely pathetic for a base model
  at least the cucked trim of the golf costs 13000 less and looks like this inside without any single optional
heres your luxury polo dude
    pay more get less    your typical premium german car experience
  bbut every single car magazine told me tthat audi has the best insideoutside quality and that their cars are the benchmark everybody is trying to defeat without success
  ouch
heres your base a3 sir
  porkek
  that fucking steering wheel    it looks so sad much sadder then normal as you can tell it was designed for buttons
buying an audi for interior techcrap that you can get in any car these days  not buying an audi for fulltime awd and smooth sailing on the roads
  fulltime awd    not anymore anything a4 or below is haldex
  so that means the wife cant piss about changing the radio stations every five minutes good ill take fucking two
  the dutch are the biggest cucks on this cucked continent
  possibly true with the car industry but i think france is even worse imagine your leader keeps taxing up petrol and diesel and saying fuck you buy electric they at least have twisties mountain roads and good weather tho
  isnt even true  transverse  haldex
you just have to use the controls on your steering wheel  no     also touchscreens are shit
  kek good luck reaching that shit when driving    also you have to reach for your steering wheel buttons if you want to change source or do some shit like fiddling with menus and settings
  right next to the shifter   yeah good luck reaching for that shit when driving loser
heres your brand new 2019 model car  manual transmission  manual windows  manual side mirrors  no cruise control  full package android auto/apple car play entertainment system    ls sonics are weird cars
  holy fuck that looks like a 90s nissan micra lol
  yep except the engine puts out twice the power and it has a 6th gear
  the audi a3 s3 and tt all use a haldex frontdrivebased setup and have for a long time  its not much different from a typical haldex system    literally the only difference is the engine isnt sideways its no longer full time audi cucks btfo         
  ive never said this before but that car looks cheap as fuck
  it is cheap as fuck you get what you pay for
  then use the fucking buttons on the steering wheel if you dont want to lean forward to use that knob while simultaneously keep an eye on the street and the other on the cluster behind your wheel in order to see what station or song you skipped to  imagine be a krautcuck defending this shit
  wow thats pretty cool
  now thats what i call german engineering
    i think its worse in the us every shitbox on the dealers lot has to have leather and all the useless frills that just end up breaking and youre paying for it and theres never any base models because normies dont buy them
  usually because base models have manual transmissions still you have to hunt the whole country just to find two of them and pray one has a color that you dont despise
  shit like this makes me think we live in a country of sleazy scammers and ripoffs i mean just look at credit card debt and student loans
they started cheaping out around 2009 in the a3 at least our shitty 16 8l had alcantara seats and the 8p has rock solid interior and shit mechanically
  is that cubby standard 2din if so thats brilliant and i like it a lot if not what the fuck audi you had one job
  base golfs since mk6 only have rear torsion beam suspension too
  yknow what if its compatible with all the major standards carplay / auto bluetooth usb aux i actually dont mind the idea of a radio entirely contained within the wheel and dash cluster itd probably be a bitch to fix but its a sleek concept unfortunately audis designers didnt have any fucking clue what to do with the resulting gap in the dash
    give it 200hp and id buy one
  sonic  138hp  cruise  153hp or for an additional for an additional 3k 137hp diesel with 240lbs of torque    im not even going to pretend to understand
  buying new cars  bet you fuck robots too cuck    if it isnt torsen and full time awd i dont want it
  goalposts
  fun fact the new q5 audi units shipping from mexico have lower failure rates than euro models the us built passat is more reliable than the german built passat/cc    mexican vw products in general are less likely to fail than euro units though part of that us because its only simple i4 and v6 vw products coming out of mexico none of the super complicated fault prone complex performance/luxury stuff
  cheap but weirdly comfy
  lol nice troll  manual windows/mirrors are phased out over 10 years ago
  base models are common as fuck in my state i bought a base 5 speed econobox with no fuss or searching wasnt picky about the color because they were all awful  people actually drive manual here so that might be the cause
  you can literally see them in the picture you mongoloid
  must be shopped   i refuse to believe this is real
  base ukspec a1  still more bells and whistles
  german spec is always lower  the a1 comes with steel wheels and hubcaps
  i actually like the touchscreenless version you can stick a phone holder in there and have the nav system of your choice
  the problem with the cruze is that its a bloated colossal landbarge
post your interior
  buying new in the netherlands  not importing 23 year old cars from belgium or germany  not using the trucc tax loophole if youre self employed  its like you hate money
  nope they have multilink on powerful engines and the same goes for the a3 and derivated models seat leon skoda octavia
  thats only because you dont have the cucked diesel engines
  im pretty sure that says something about the newer generations of the ea888 though theyve improved that engine quite a bit

  whats it like to meme way after its stale wanna go planking
  i get upset with every meme that somehow relates to me so i must say that its stale to hide the fact that it applies    4chan has become nothing more than 30 year olds who cant have fun anymore
as a car guy who always had to speed and have a cool fast car and loves mods and just wants to go fast and look cool  seeing this is the biggest relief i can ever imagine no cats no echeck no 400 for exhaust work that does nothing    save yourself a shitload of money if ur under 19 and get a car that doesnt need echeck
  what is e check
  living in a cuck state
  this
  i think he means emissions check/state inspection i live in w texas and this is one of the many reasons im unironically considering moving to nm  more basededer gun laws  cheaper col/lower property taxes  no fucking state emissions/inspection
live in hippy shithole canada  no emissions testing  legal weed  at least we have something
  high insurance rates  weak dollar  worst fucking speed limits in the western world  terrible drivers  yea weve sure got something

  yeah but then youre spending 50k on a fwd toyota
      so this is actually a thing is toyota making this their ss like how gm would have fwd boats with ss on them for performance what does the trd add
all memes aside the new camry seems perfect for stable and comfortable high speed cruising
doesnt nearly everything slap the stis ass these days because its so out of date    pretty sure a shitty lease kia optima turbo with a 94 octane tune would give a stis ass a slap 300hp just isnt shit
slower than a 6k dollar bmw 3 series  these things are going to be absurdly expensive trash and the latest in a long line of toyota coasting on its 90s reliability meme
  what midsize isnt i had my 99 accord at 215kph and it felt the same as 100kph theres always been a huge highway difference between civic/corolla and accord/camry if you go further up the chain and get heavier cars theyre even more comfy
  mostly undercarriage stuff better suspension brakes and tires
  someone actually wants to track their land barge
  yeah and then you get the n54 assfucking

just got home from hooning fuck all of us have tiny cars there is a alto works and my wagon r turbo as the interesting ones but thats it from memory
  intresting ones in eu we dont see them very often
  the one on the right is my fully sick jdm as fug model the left one is a frankenstein engine swap to emulate mine     rust is their enemy thats why they disappeared in the eu they have a semi cult following in the uk and i think its thailand     dindus love them to but have terrible taste
only madmen drive the fiat seicento because theyre basically death traps    they were tin cans that shouldve never been produced from the beginning as they were extremely dangerous in case of accident even for their times    if theres a car fiat deserves all the memes for is the seicento
  russians have this thing the spare wheel is under the hood on drivers side so if you crash slowly enough to not turn into complete mush it cuts you in half therefore you drive it as fast as you can to not die a slow and painful death
i heart small engine bottom of the range cars

cinquecento and seicento are fucking trash you talk highly of them because youve never owned one unless youre a manlet youll never feel comfortable in one theyre known to be absolute rustbuckets the engines are the very definition of anemic if you somehow manage to put four adults in youd better keep off any hills cause good luck climbing up one without the engine boiling  owned both when i was younger and im glad ill never have to drive one again
  thats the spirit see also noncollapsible steering columns
how small is still a small
  if you can sit comfortably it isnt small anymore

  i wouldnt call modern fiesta small car to be honest
  tonys got a new motor  sr nova driving like a joyrider  speeding to the corner  your mother warned ya its a sound system banger
  its pretty dinky senpai
lets drive to clacton
  what is it called
  its bigger than a sierra not small at all its fucking huge even my mk7 fiesta dwarfs my friends seicento a mk8 is quite a bit bigger again
we sort of lived this in the 90s in our own way moded astras and the such slightly off topic but the hothatch was an undeniable thing
      yeah this is uncomfortable this is part of fun for me i wouldnt daily one if i dont have to but as part time toy is fine for me
its my dream a total battery hen mobile that dusts those bastard audis

i live in alaska home of some of the last free range ford festivas  theres also a very elusive 4wd justy that gets spotted sometimes
tfw no v6 busso powered fiat uno        why live
tfw no uno turbo engine powered fiat panda to flash random bmw 3 series on the road with    
tfw on tuned fiat uno turbo to smoke some alfa romeo giulia quadrifoglio with        why even survive
tfw no suzuki gsx r swapped panda 4x4 to do some mad skidz in the snow with        why even persisting in existence
  oka  oкa
  what part of alaska are you in i grew up in the matsu and ive never seen a festival there although i have seen a just or two even some older toyota all tracs
  girdwood one of the local pizza guys rolls a yellow festiva with 80s splash graphics and ive seen a few in south shankorage when i make a costco run  i did have a friend in talkeetna thst had a red festiva a few years back but he may have sold it it was really funny to see it puttering up the spur road with a canoe tied to the roof  a working alltrac corolla wagon is definitely one of those alaskan grail cars
my car next to its smaller cousin
  megane/clio rs
    these would be the perfect cars for a rockabilly midget couple
i love the smart brabus too bad they will only be evs in the future
  i used to have one a proper piece of shit but pretty light so niggers like to tune the shit out of the small 4 banger and get them to 130160hp
  looks like a 1970s television
could well be buying one of these today bois
  this isnt small
  same platform as the mk7 fiesta isnt it so sort of small by todays standards but in objective terms still a bit porky
  it is pretty small only just bigger than the cars itt    yes it was they stiffened up the suspension a bit for the mazda for better driving feel on country roads and the like     and btw i went to see the car today and it wasnt great so still looking
  what engine you are looking for
  13l/15l  15 is around 500800 pounds more but i think itll be worth it
  i daily one uk sport model 15l i average 37mpg fairly quick off the line thanks to the low weight but masses of cabin noise and the suspension is hard as fuck when combined with the skinny tyres fun to drive though steering is great and possibly the same gearbox as the mx5 nc not sure check the shocks before buying as they break quickly
peugeot 106 gti or a citoren saxo vts dont bother with the 8v just get the 16 16v 
    10/10 blocking that np
  possibly the same gearbox as the mx5    nigga wat

  sadly i see the wagonr everywhere since all the grannies drive them it has very high seating for a tiny ecobox
hey my dudes i have a 1987 gen 1 subaru vortex it has an ea82 in it which im fair sure is buggered i was wondering how hard it would be to just chuck an ej/fa20 in there instead does anyone know if the mounting points are the same or any hurdles i would have to look out for any advice really would be cool
apparently its a pretty simple swap depending on parts available    is it awd or fwd
its fwd but i wouldnt mind swapping all the stuff from an awd impreza or something from what i understand the awd gear fits into the fwd models pretty well just need a new tailshaft
also its currently a 3 speed auto
  ej swaps are well documented for the lseries thats probably a good starting point to figure out if youre up for it literal 500 and a weekend swaps though    the ea82 powered xts share the same underpinnings and most mechanical/suspension parts i cant imagine it would be terribly difficult and you can probably use swap mounts meant for lseries    in fact a lot of people will convert the leones to 5 lug using xt6 parts as the entire suspension is a direct swap    best of luck homie keep the dream alive
how buggered is the ea  you might be able to find a carb ej18 or ej22 for a super easy swap
  you a kiwi or ausfag due to vortex not xt
  
  yeah getting parts for a vortex or xt6 is super hard here in adelaide thats why i figure it will be easier to just swap something from an impreza i didnt know it was such a common swap in the leones though    ea hasnt run for 12 years cant figure out why    aus
    yikes youre probably much better off starting with a manual 4wd xt but thats easier said than done    that is youre after an ej xt and not just doing this out of desperation to fix your fucked ea82    as is the case with that swap into loyales it uses the entire stock drivetrain besides the motor itself    ofc you have to wire up the computers and shit which is apparently the hardest part and im not sure what options are still out there for bellhousing adapters
  ah yeah your location is a problem in itself in the southwest usa rust free 4wd xts are not horrendously difficult to find and tons of people ej swap leones in the states so its a much nicer proposition here
  i have only seen one other vortex for sale in the 3 years ive owned the car haha if i could get a turbo 4wd one i would i honestly just want the car to run  honestly i would love to just chuck in a 308 coz it would be super easy to make it fit there are 5 billion companies that make shit for holdens so it wouldnt be hard to get parts but at the same time i wasnt to keep it subaru because its easier to get a 4cyl engineered    there was apparently a stock na vortex that had 9000km on the clock that sold for 20k thats how rare they are here
  thats the most 80s car ive ever seen  thanks op for showing me a car i didnt know that exists

  those things will cost an arm and a leg regardless

  wonder what the chances are its in need of an overhaul its like two hours away theres really no way to diagnose it in that condition correct
  wonder what the chances are its in need of an overhaul    you will be constantly working on it anyways so what does it matter
  i doubt it does  needs a fluid change and a carb cleaned
  just dont want to essentially pay 500 for a frame yknow full disclosure this will be my first bike but im mechanically inclined and have no doubt i could get it running
  whos the other guy in sa thats not me
  nowhere yet but im about go buy some stuff for camping and trail riding this weekend yay

  thats some obvious joke hivemind
  it sucks because a lot of the staging areas in ohv parks get abused by people who want a place to party and have fires ohv registration was originally supposed to help set aside land for off raiding but the funds go to barbed wire these days
  i had to say it
  well people gotta party and have fires just a shame a lot of them cant do it responsibly and collect their litter afterwards
stand next to bike  some dude walks by and yells nice and beautiful bike  my baiku a cute
  all jokes aside the husky 125 was the best bang for the buck of the two stroke 125 market in 2013 one of the cheapest bikes on the line up 48mm forks and it came with a 144 piston kit from the factory i bought it from my best friend who i knew maintained it very well for 2000    oh yeah by all means i can agree with that things are getting tighter and more off road clubs are getting involved to help keep our areas clean and open
  its always guys guys commenting on bikes why dont girls comment on my bike    riding after work  school bus stops im stuck behind it  13 year old girl waves in the back of the bus  some kids get off  1 kid gives the throttle crank gesture  i give a little blip of the throttle he just turned around and walked away    fuck

   10 type of bikers you will meet
i know nobody actually rides here  but those who do do you ride in winter
top 10 nobikes you will meet on /dbt/
  i sort of like his wrenching video he seems out of his depth but at least he posts his fuck ups and i have something to laugh at   has potential for absolute kino if he fucks up the brakes and crashes the bike on the first test ride
  im in the tropics baby ride all day urry day
  my battery is fucked and carbs are fussy i hate to admit it but fuel injection is the future and i need a lithium ion battery but cant find the right model for my shitbike
  excuses my carbed bike is fine      i do but riding in on icy roads is pretty spoopy so i keep it to a minimum
  you
  i used to think like that but after he nearly killed someone then came back as if nothing happened like its ya wacky meme boi yaminoob i have zero respect for him as a human being
  whats the tldr on that situation im new
  i have owned two carbed bikes and they are just fine all year around as long as you tune them properly      thats understandable my current winter bike is a dt125re with studded tyres so its fine on ice
  he doesnt still make bike vids does he last i saw after he crashed his 2nd or 3rd bike he was considering stopping riding after several near death experiences and tens of thousands in medical bills
  
  he is considering getting a slow bike either ducati or triumph scrambler
  he drove into oncoming traffic    watching one right now  more motorcycle myths you shouldnt believe published today
  close to double yellows in a left turn  close to side of the road in a right turn  exactly the opposite of what you should do this shit doesnt make you faster it just gets you killed
  yeah he found a group of bikers and decided to ride along with them tried to show off and take a turn way too fast and went into the oncoming lane which was blind around the turn and went straighton into a porche this was months after going way too fast around another turn and went off into a boulder with little injury but the bike was certainly dead     i think hes got an alright presence on screen but overall hes a jackass that will be killed on a bike some day
  sooner rather than later
  why are the italians the absolute best at aesthetic design  bikes cars clothes shoes handbags suits buildingsyou name it theyre the most stylish have been for millennia now ever since the athenians got ottomand   its incredible really

  all vehicles must be fitted with proper winter tire between december 15 and march 15 as far as i know they dont make those for motorcycle i guess technically i could go darkside on both wheels but that sounds retarded
  yes  i sadly havent been able to ride for a week now and im already itching
  yes but not for fun because i hate knowing my bike is getting caked in road salt
  what country    i do its pretty chill   and it actually feels good to see another biker and wave at them in freezing temps
  heidenau k60 scout snow and mud tyres they have a cold climate compound version as well
  track and sled swap then bruh
  yes studded tiresare going back on shortly
  of course there are winter tires for bikes are you retarded or what is going on  but you dont need them unless you want to rossi lean in winter the difference to normal multi compound tires is miniscule
i crashed a little bit so i have to get a new helmet what do you guys think of this one to flashy
  only valid choice if youre carrying an ar15 on your back while riding tbph

  germany revoked that law for motorcycles  bretty based
  canada specifically quebec      theres more to being a roadlegal winter tire than the manufacturer saying its a winter tire i dont know the entire process but the tire must have the mountainsnowflake symbol on it its not a big deal depending on where you live we got snow in october this year i wouldnt risk riding my bike even with winter tires
  the tyres i said heidenaus have a ms symbol at least some versions    i dont care our winters arent strong enough for it to really matter
can i put some winter knobbies on my cb500f
tfw thousands of bikers drive through the winter  tfw pussy out  tfw will never go to elefantentreffen  how do i man up
  search for tire width alone    i found ms tires for my bike from heidenau continental and pirelli
  icy roads are scary   its ok anon
  also theres the triumph guy in fucking indonesia
  why is that r1150gs pretending to be a ktm
  correction 1100gs saw the second pipe running under the left cylinder
  are those training wheels but with skis
  i did find some roadlegal tires anlas winter grip plus apparently a guy was using them and got stopped by the police but they let him go i wouldnt bother as im too much of a pussy to ride in the snow i just want to be able to ride if the snow comes late or goes away early changing tires for a couple weeks of very cold weather riding doesnt seem worth it to me with a sidecar it might be cool though
what does dnt drive i have a little dodge dakota but the more i think about it the only reason i have it is to haul my bike have been playing with the idea of buying a car like a 240sx/mustang/challenger as a fun dd and then buying a work van on the side for hauling my bike tools and camping gear     any of you guys with more experience on the matter have advice such as maintainence registration expensive insurance on 2 vehicles that sort of thing    or should i just buy a compfy/dependable/durable truck or van and thats it i never get to have a fun dd i can enjoy from day to day only living for the weekend at the track
  get a turbobusa with tkc 80 tyres
  and went into the oncoming lane which was blind around the turn  actually he went to overtake during the blind turn which is infinitely more retarded
half tempted to order some womens riding pants because all of the mens i can find fit like bell bottom trousers other than hipster riding skinny jeans which are no good in the uk with the cold and rain

so i went and sat on a husqvarna terra today  confy as fuck seat good ergos smooth clutch  looks super nice up close it had some scratches here and there but looks in good shape sounds sexy too  has a touratech bash plate polisport handguards 12v usb thingy windshield and top case mount  i will go to test ride it some day next week    i talked the price down to 4500 including the top case and a new set of metzeler tyres installed  is it a good deal    pic related is the one
  could be worse  almost bought one too   check the swm 650 if you are looking for this type of bike is basically a husqvarna te 610 with different plastics
  they use comic sans in their website  my religion doesnt allow me to buy anything in comic sans
  sort of the arm the ski blade is mounted on can move up and down to allow the bike to lean over unlike bicycle stabilisers i think there are foot pegs on the arms too so its more like riding along with both your feet down and if you begin to go over you can exert pressure on the ski and keep yourself up likely also limits how far the bike can actually fall over
  get memed bro
  lean seems to be limited by the chain
  seems like a good deal
  post bike you dirty frenchman
  old european boomer fest  still looks kinda cool not sure how the fuck i would stay warm in my tent there though i almost froze multiple times during summer camping then again i was in a tropical rated sleeping bag
  a very beaky bike    tell the sales guy you will give him 4000 and no more because you know what you got cash
  by sleeping in a winter sleeping bag  i have one thats rated comfortable between 10 and 2c
  thats an idea they take up so much space though    have you actually slept in yours in those temps i dont really believe the ratings generally
  right here frogposter    
  yes i have the middle of summer in scotland can be harsh  im a space heater though so i was sweating in it while it was 5c outside  i also never use a winter blanket during winter only a summer one and leave the window open
  come to sem so i can key your baik
  i cant go to yurop their roads arent straight
  i also never use a winter blanket during winter only a summer one and leave the window open  wut
  you dont have extra warm and thick blankets for during winter
  what area you in
  you mean in the house i just use the same duvet all year if its chilly ill wear a tshirt to bed instead of being butt naked i tend to get sick when i leave the window open
  i tend to get sick when i leave the window open  but its more healthy
  alright so window open and an extra blanket then    also how the fuck did you have 5 in scotland in the middle of summer or was that a typing mistake
  just happened we were camping near fort william
  nice try fbi
  think i went there on a childhood family holiday long ago really should go over there again by myself

  why are the italians the absolute best at aesthetic design  because they sacrifice usability reliability and ease of maintenance without a second thought
if i got up from the couch dressed up and got on my bike it would be 1015pm completely black outside and wet as fuck and cold    but i really want to ride i just dont know where to go and wheelies are boring and i wont be able to lean a whole on these slippery roads    its not fair this is my first winter on a bike above 125cc and turns out it sucks  last winter i rode anyway and just laughed when i came off
  time to get another 125cc again
when will you join the club
  almost did when i was looking for my first 125cc bike there was a tidy 90s xt660 primarily black but with purple graphics or something it was really tasty already sold by the time i replied to the advert though
how gud do i have to git before im allowed on the map
  you just need to own a bike and be able to follow the instructions for being added
  i agree that leaning is more fun then wheelies you should get a bike with bigger tires next time that way you can lean even more

say something nice about my harley
  its moderately clean
  i just cant
  there are a few who watch and post webms from time to time at the end of the day theres only a certain amount of sport bike riders here and only a very small portion of them track their bikes so high level track racing is not really relevant to the majority of anons    youll barely hear a pip about the dakar when its on or the iom tt either
  its the most boring type of motorcycle racing
  its better than walking

  winglets are the greatest upgrade to sprots bikes styling of modern times and probably one of the biggest jumps forward in tech  anyone who doesnt like them and thinks theyre unsafe should be shot remember they said the same thing about fairings
  why dont you just fuck his boipussi while youre at it
  its pretty clean  front tire looks to be in good shape  the rotor has no blueing or grooves and likely never had any hard braking  fork gaiters have no cracks or splits from age or uv damage  lights work

  evening gents  anyone have any experience with installing bar end mirrors
  what kind of experience do you need isnt it just undoing 1 bolt and then later redoing that bolt with the mirror you want
  easy as hell itll take you 10 min if it was anything like my oxfords it comes with the singular tool you need pull off your handlebar weights most likely an allen key maybe in your toolkit on the bike unscrew your old mirrors should just turn left a whole bunch til they come off mirrors are fairly universal mount from my experience keep em on hand in case you or a buddy suddenly need a set then set up your barends if yours are anything like the universals i had you will have a expanding screw insert one longass screw and the mirror housing/body put the expanding housing in your handlebar then the mirror housing/body in the gap now run the screw through all of themtake out the allen key you should have gotten with your kit and just tighten that screw until your mirrors stop wobbling make sure the mirror on the right hand isnt hitting your grips having a sticky throttle from misaligned mirrors is a damn stupid way to drop a bike
  not riding your adventure bike like a mad bastard
  the gs500 is objectively the best beginner bike
  cruiser life best life
    apparently i need to get a longer bolt and get either an adapter or a piece of 1/2 pvc to mount the mirror to then screw the end bar weight back on with my bike was just wondering if anybody had done this

how much of a down payment do you need to finance a 8000 at a good rate with an average 700 credit score i have 1000 stuffed into my sock drawer and should have 1700 by my birthday in february or 2500 by may  inb4 financing

is there any car thats still enjoyable to drive after riding motorcycles
  i still love my subaru boxer twin turbo   nothing nothing beats the rush of ripping along on a sportbike   yet being able to cruise along in my subie listening to music and occasionally punching it is also a very rewarding feel   ive been skydiving and bunjy jumping and i still think riding a bike is a better rush than those two  i think the only thing that could beat that rush you get from biking is wingsuiting
  yes but only when the roads are clear i have a road bike with road tires and studded tires arent allowed on the road

is there an /o/ bike buying guide
  when yamaha fucking sells me one  t burger
  yes
  where do you live  budget  what do you like
should i put money into this
  straya  10k max but cheap is good considering ive never actually rode a road bike  i know nothing about bikes but like cb650f/some other honda naked for no other reason than they looks cool and someone once told me that honda bikes are easy to work on
  honda bikes are easy to work on  oh lel  they are reliable but fuck doing any sort of service on them  get a a 2k sv i guess
  cbr250rr  enjoy working on it
  tfw you own an mc22 and it puts out 18ftlbs which is fine until youre doing maintenance and the spark plugs need 12ftlbs such a tiny little thing
  wr 125
  any jap 650 if you dont know what you want    pretty much anything jap that isnt a gs500 or inazuma 250 desu
  10k  are we talking kangaroo dollars
why does honda recommend 10w30 its much harder to find compared to 10w40 from what i understand the lower the second number the less viscous thinner the oil when heated since ill be riding around in australian summer 35c average days should i just grab some 10w40
    ok is there anything similar that wont be a cunt to work on or service     would be a bit small for anyone over 8yo right    thx    dollarydoos
  yes  30 oil is cheap as shit tho dont worry about the winter value youre in australia and its probably a small motor
  old bimmers are cheap reliable and piss easy to work on
  yeah 400cc its just much easier to find 10w40 dont want to fuck anything up though
  do they recommend it for high temperatures too i ran 10w40 in my thumper and it was already too thin consumed oil like crazy so 10w30 would be even worse i needed 15w50 to stop the oil burning maybe you should try out 10w40 and see what happens
  10w40 is shitbox oil thats why its cheap  as a general guide  more power  thicker  bigger cylinders  thicker  less cylinders  thicker  hotter climate  thicker  you can use diesel oil to save even more rotella but using car oil is a nono    thumpers do like it thicc given the big cylinder size
mfw colombian anon hasnt replied to the email yet  pls dont be ded

  ive got a cbr650f its a good bike if you can get one for the right price its not easy to work on as theres a lot of stuff that should be simple that has remove all fairings as step 2 having said that it is reliable only mandatory changes on it were tank pads and new grips

posted this yesterday morning but why is this so cheap    even for non running 70s cbs this is cheap how much can i haggle down to    
  needs a lot of work i know what you got ill give you 250
  70s cb  dont  somebody stop him
  well since 60s variants are inflated because material used in production the next best thing is the 70s right  wow really 250 think the odometer is true or was it reset whats the deal with the gas tank you think garage kept 20 years less than 2k miles and it has no sidecovers and a fucked tank
  dude  believe me its not just the odometer
    i dont understand laymans terms
    sat for 20 years on wheels and suspension are done for if fluids werent drained its fucked if fluids were drained rust is gonna be everywhere might very well cost you 2k to get running again
errol glen sucks cocks
  thats a shame i cant imagine it was tended to in the 20 years it sat                other possibilities if any of you want to take a glance
  no  you should sell it to me

based or cringe
makes ol car of the year  anything but based
  cringe they went from copying japs to copying americans and now theyre copying europeans with little to no success the only cars id argue are decent stock are the genesis and the veloster
  cringe korean cars are junk
  maybe a decade and a half ago starting with the theta engine in 07ish hyundai starting making quality cars and drivetrains theyre rated in the top 3 of reliability by essentially every survey or ranking chart ive seen lately
  are you sure about that
  i keep hearing about this yet their resale value is still in the toilet i find it hard to believe that its only reputation hangover
    idk guys ive always held german made at the top of my list but that doesnt mean i cant be persuaded
  engineered
  thats due to past history korean cars are starting to hold their value a lot better    its not as bad as lincoln thats for sure
based and bluepilled
based
  theyre good now at this point theyve surpassed mazda in performance reliability and looks
when i first start my car it keeps kicking back and forth every few seconds for a few minutes then when it hits around 6080c it stops is this bad and can i avoid this it doesent really heat up to much if i sit a few minutes with it on
gay fag
yeah no your picture is pretty faggy youre on your own for this one
i recently bought my first miata i want to turn it into a cornering machine yall have any suggestions any tips would be much appreciated pic from google
  buy good tires and leave it the fuck alone
  not even coils
  good tires coil overs and adjustable sway bars drive the shit out of it and adjust the sway bars as necessary to tune out excessive over/understeer
  front license plate delete
  crunch
  10 4 that was the plan just making sure that was the right idea and eventually ill go turbo
  thats not my car i posted a car from google images cause im afraid of 4chan/doxing lol
  correct answer dont modify it until you know what you want to chance run it stock until you dont like something about it youre not smarter than a mazda engineer
  yeah i drive semis for a living so stock is absolutly fun enough ill drive it stock for a few months then when im used to it and want to go faster go one step at a time but i was driving it today and the stock 185s arent grippy enough so i will at least have to upgrade rims/ tires soon and maybe coil over to complement it but again thanks for the tips im drunk as fuck rn so sorry if my replie dont make a lot of sence
      new tires is pretty much required on new purchases if tire has a patch or is running flat just get new ones the tread may be fine but the tire may be 10 years old just get new ones
  the pics from google mi car doesnt have a front plate just dont want to show my car so found a car that looks similar mines beat up but runs perfectly might need some coolant system work though
  yeah they tires arent perfect but they arent 10 years old they are just modern shitty tires but they still let go sonner than i want grip is definatly the first upgrade on my list i was going on some backroads today testing it and it was letting go alot sooner than i wanted it to i have the money but once christmas rolls around ill have a reason to spend the money and ill get tires and rims
  i dont know how serious you are or how much money you want to spend but as far as cornering goes heres my best bang for buck imho    coilovers if youre on a budget go with some tiens from personal experience theyre quite soild however theres a rabbit hole of infinitely better more adjustable and more expensive coilovers pick a budget and see whats available but dont expect to pay any less than 1000 for good coilovers     chassis rigidity you can get this a few ways but i suggest making mods in this order  racing beat front and rear sway bar hard dog roll bar flyin miata butterfly brace aftermarket door bushings    rubber hands down the cheapest way to get better cornering is better tires if youve got the money for it right now i would suggest looking at some aftermarket wheels to increase your selection in tires as well as contact patch but if youre keeping it na i would suggest against getting 225 massive tires   if you want some cheap aftermarket wheels suggestions i would recommend either konig hypergrams or rpf1s    interior regardless of how race car you want your miata to be its some point your cars going to hang out handle your seat and you want something with more bolstering there are lots of options out there so ill leave it up to you to figure out what will work best but make sure that it can support a 6point or 4 point with asm harness as thatll probably be the next thing you want to do to keep you in your seat     pic related is my 97

  hello my name is jasmine
  cornering machine  thats got to be the gayest thing ive seen all day
  buy a hardtop and a set of good tires  hardtop improves the handling of the car 10 fold thats all you need
  guess your mom hasnt called your name yet give her a couple minutes chicken tendies dont cook instantly
  i went up to a 205 just beacause i like the look of it gives it a little meat on the tires personal preference tho
  its widely regarded in the spec miata comminity as the ideal tire size for grip and longevity
buy a roll bar first and foremost  idk what size ur wheels are if they are 14s id just suggest buying some black lion radials and saving up for some 15x7 konigs or something if 15s id suggest some federal 595ss   get some duralast gt brake pads from autozone lifetime warranty so when they wear out you can take em back and get a free set  then just drive for a while learn the car and whatever road ur driving on  after that u could think about buying serious tires and suspension upgrades
  i had all that done to my nb2 but was running 18 rear and 20 front really nice in tight course
  bigger front sway bar  good set of coilovers with a 2 drop at most  657 wide wheels with a minimum of 20 offset  a set of sticky 205/50 street tires  supermiata street alignment  a rollbar for safety  nothing crazy and not overly expensive either
  coils  swaybar   strutbar  tires   anti rollbar/cage maybe

rwd   offered with a manual  cheap  is a twingo  why dont you own one yet /o/
it doesnt have the twongi smile
not available in north america take out the rear seats drop a 62l v8 there and i guarantee we will buy it though
because i just got a twingo ii rs
  at 10k its a bit expensive for a twingo moreso its two engines are a 09 and a 10 which are abysmal in terms of giving a barely sufficient torque also there are so many electronic nannies that youre not gonna get it to slide ever
  i dont want people trying to put their penis inside my arsehole
  they dont sell them in my shithole country
  drives like an mpv  nanny state like esc and tc  cant turn off esc and tc  shitty 5 speed box  no front end feel due to having zero weight over the front    also because this exists
  seriously rating the up gti  you know its a bad car when id rather have the fucking twingo over it or the 595
  for the price of the 595 you may as well get a fist and the twingo in every comparison between it and the gti the gti has won and if it wasnt for the extra 6k id prefer the forfour brabus which is a much nicer twingo gt
  ill never unsee this
  
passed it very fast need id

  marker lights could tell exact year
  i should just buy it honestly really caught my eye just classic v8 boomer glory
cough    its looking like the new mazda3 will be a slow roll out with the various combinations coming slowly but
  that is potentially based i considered getting a cx3 and lowering it just to have an awd mazda 3 but the power to weight wasnt there to justify the cost even a 25l mazda 3 with the new engine plus awd sounds pretty fuckin fine to me
  we cant say well put it in but we can say it fits  absolutely based and proof mazda gives a fuck about all of its customers
anyone here know what kind of car this is

friendly reminder that ferrari died after the 599 gtb fiorano
enzo was an angry faggot
  ferrari would be nothing if it was for pic related    look at them now selling their cars to the same people this snake would be eatingwhat a fucking shame
  if it wasnt
  you mean brown people
  more than i can afford breh
  yes sand niggers mostly
  the cars arent that bad its the ferrari club unironically one of the most aids clubs in the auto community
  need to own 20 of their money pits and get on your knees and suck off their executive team to get on a list of people that might get a chance to buy one of their useless 3m hypercars    get your ass sued off if you god forbid wrap or put a sticker on one of their cars    their cars that normal wealthy people can afford are all slower on a track than 60k camaros and mustangs meh
  madmen sportscar company turned luxury nig/fag/thotmobile  gee i dunno
  mclaren does their thing better
  so alpha romeo or ferrari that is selling their cairs to sand niggers cant tell from your post
  guess who sells their cars to petrol niggers alfa romeo or ferrari
  salt
merchandise brand that sells cars on the side
    most people know theyll never be able to afford one most cant even afford to rent one for a day
  what
the blue fucking oval humiliated them over 50 years ago and because of that theyve been seen as joke even a little gmc pickup truck managed to beat a ferrari almost 30 years ago but i always loved the testarossa    ahh so that explains why so many horsefaggots drive ford mustangs
  a lot of people buy exotic sports cars like ferraris not because they care about the cars styling or performance but because its a status symbol and ferrari and most other exotic car manufactures know this full well but plenty of brands do exactly that and its always been that way and there are plenty of exotic car buyers that legitimately care more about the car than the imagined image of them driving the car the reason exotic car manufactures more than anything else get hate is they make the most visible symbols of wealth disparity available on the market and theyre portable     in america most people are subject to suburbia and horrible urban planning that forces people to own a vehicle just for basic survival and public transportation is an absolute joke a friend of mine i was helping out just recently had his car fixed he attempted to use the bus system around here to run basic errands it took what would be a 20 minute drive into a 3 hour ordeal because owning a vehicle is such a necessity in america its the closest thing we have to a universal class identifier now thats not to say rich people dont drive cheap cars and most people with decent credit and some kind of verifiable income can still lease/finance a car that at the very least looks sporty but the exotics are a whole other story because the pricing is so astronomical you have to be part of the upper elite wealth class to own a new one a ferrari portofino the cheapest new ferrari you can buy starts at 215000 for the vast majority of americans that is a completely unobtainable vehicle even if you just horded cash and lived in a shed for the rest of your life youd likely be dead of old age long before you came close to that amount    and thats precisely where the hate comes from youre driving around an extremely visible object that might as well have a giant neon banner that reads you will always be a poor loser
continued from   the wealth class have generally been able to seclude themselves away from the general public in most matters whether that is housing shopping dining air travel etc but they dont have their own private roads and for the time being air travel isnt practical for short distances and with the exception of a few areas there are not many places to live than guarantee rich only the way these cars are marketed and the way they are most often perceived is we know youre forced to share the road with poor people so why not visually advertise your wealth everywhere you go
/o/ tastemakers pls to advise whats wrong with the 488
  whats the retail on these things
  more than you can afford pal
  materazzi f40 designer said they punched a hole in it
  for comparisons sake the car he made does not have the intake straight onto the wheel
  hmmmm i wonder why the first thing they did was get rid of that hideous hole on the 488derived sp38
  and thats precisely where the hate comes from youre driving around an extremely visible object that might as well have a giant neon banner that reads you will always be a poor loser  thats how poor idiots interpret it and then they become aggressive when you experience that you want to be left the fuck alone and away from such pathetic people which is why wealthy areas exists and why the people rarely venture outside their enclaves rich dont mind any type of people they hate jealous idiots that try to get at the rich for their life when you experience the unnecessary hate you start despising the poor
  well ill be damned its monstrous
  besides the fact that it went from the kin/o/ brand to yet another status symbol car manufacturer 90 of /o/ cant afford a ferrari or will buy something more practical for the price  average price of a ferrari dino in italy 35k  ferrari mondial 45k  any other old ferrari 60k  delta fucking evos are cheaper and you get three times the fun out of them also ferrari literally cant say sht if you tune an older model
what does /o/ think of the laferrari
  inferior to the p1 and 918 both aesthetically and in performance 458 speciale is the best modern rari
  shit taste m8
  stupid name
  i like that they rejected lamborghiniks from buying one and then for months on end trash talked it on instagram
  enzo tells henry ford ii he can buy a ferrari but never buy la ferrari the ferrari for anglos  60 years later they release a car called laferrari  for fucks sake
  coz owners are entitled assholes nothing wrong with the car brand
  poorfags
other than the hypercar makers ferrari is the last classic sports car brand that doesnt have suv in its lineup yet    elaborate    humiliated  got them on the third try  i will never get this
  and completely ignoring the fact that the p4 took a 123 at daytona from the gt40
    massively overpriced for the performance bad paint jobs sometimes you find hair glued with the paint really bad uneven gap width between the parts generally extremely unreliable also a lot of the owners are really insecure and are victims of a massive stockholm complex not unlike apple customers
snobby brand snobby customers it is not even the wealth but the attitude for instance i think porsche owners are some of the nicest and most genuine enthusiasts out there
  ferrari has announced an suv this week i think
  its over
      i guess that leaves only mclaren now
  i dont hate ferrari but recent models are just ugly
they think theyre still the king when they havent won anything worthwhile in motorsports for over 10 years all their sales are just merch and status symbol    meanwhile a tuned beetle dominates the circuits and streets
35 grand  460 hp  how do they do it sure power isnt everything but nobody else even comes close at that price
because theyve been making the same engine for over 7 years now and the costs have slumped so they can afford to update rather than produce
  you can get the scat pak challenger for that price with the 392 485 bhp its still heavier and a bit slower though
  but way fucking cooler fuck the mustang
most sold sports car on the planet they dont have to profit a lot on individual sales
  must be cheaper in the us in canada the 392 chally and the mustang gt are like 10k apart i can get a pp2 stang for under 50k but a widebody 392 is over 60k
  if only it wasnt so fucking uglyalso  western cars  kek
  facelift looks gay
    no u
  its one of the last true affordable performance cars before the hybrid era
  because its incredibly underwhelming when you actually drive it
  you havent actually driven one have you
  same way they have always done cheap power relative to the rest of the contemporary market was always a selling point of the mustang    in 2005 it was 300hp for 25k not too many new my05 cars offered 300hp for less than 30k msrp
in my country they are double the price
  the interior is made of the cheapest recycled my little pony toy plastic
  put a big powerfull engine in to boost the tech sheet cheap out on everything else
  they spent all the development money under the hood and then built the rest of the car out of the ford parts bin thats how
       correct op if you dont care about fancy interiors and only want performance its a great performance per dollar sports car
  but you have free healthcare right
  no but i dont have to pay 100k  1000 tip after i get heavily injured
  its comfy as fuck on long drives also
the great debate corn oil vs windshield wiper fluid for boosted applications whats your opinion
methanol is for hardcore shit
  i always considered it to be the opposite i could run e85 but im wondering if i should just invest in a meth kit if i really want to push my setup
  why not just go straight for nitromethane
not doing a toluene build for maximum fucking boost
  isnt it cost prohibitive compared to e85 why go all special snowflake and try to make yourself poor
  depends on availability   e85 is like 13 a gallon here
lower compression and run 95 ron  use 98 ron  run 95 ron with meth kit  cant decide lads  for my turbo e46
      only 1300 dollars for 4 gallons of the p u r e shit
  depends methanol has a stoichiometric ratio of 646 ignites between lambda 034 and 20  has 1144 roz or 946 mon or 1045 burger octane about three times the evaporation enthalpy of gas and it combusts 2530 faster  main issue is that you need more of this stuff besides that it is a verry good fuel
  inb4 methanol is toxic  indeed but gas and diesel are even worse
  yeah this is my biggest deal  shitty pump gas but with meth  e85
  and its even harder to maintain lubrication methanol injection destroys engines in the long run its why this stuff was only really used in racing and war emergency power kits
e85  fuck the methanol jews who want 5 a gallon for their shit fuck saudia arabian niggers too just ride your car on ethanol all the time god damn it
  i know this is a meme post but im talking about meth injection not full on meth in the tank
  music stops   i dont do drugs and neither should you i might have a sip of e85 every now and then but thats it go get a vehicle play around with it instead of messing with this drug shit youll fry your brains
  you might want to see a professional sounds like you got a real problem hope you can get clean
e85 is what will save the ice when oil finally runs out enough to be impossible to make enoug gasoline
any anon has a link for that us government study on engine wear or did i imagine reading that
  methanol injection  i wasnt talking about methanol injection i was talking about using it as fuel  but no matter what you inject excessively it fucks with lubrication
  natgas and biogas work fine and dont need petroleum based fertilizer like cornohol
  not necessarily if swear ive seen a real study comparing engine wear and with e85 the wear was almost non existent even less than when using a 100 octane that 86 in the us fuel
  ive seen a real study comparing engine wear  source
    sure but e85 uses less if not no petroleum base right
  i cant fucking find it i have a feeling it was done by the us army or some shit
  found it
  gas and diesel cause metabolic acidosis and blindness    fuck the fermented corn jew youll need more frequent oil changes due to dilution too
    meth kits are fucking annoying if you arent already intercooled started there
  gas and diesel vapors are carcinogenic methanol only realy is an issue when you drink that stuff or inhale large quantities of it  methanol boils off when your oil reaches 65c ethanol at 78c so much faster than gas or even diesel
  they ran the engine at an oil temperature of only 119f or 48c of course that fucks up the wear rates for methanol that evaporates at 65c  after 50 hours at these ridiculously low oil temperatures they had 22 methanol in the oil  a normal engine runs its oil at about 90c a little more under high loads
  maybe theyve run it at such a low temp to simulate harsh climate or something maybe its an army thing
  oil temperatures as low as that arent a thing even during the harshest winters  anyway this is clearly not representative for your average car that hits at least 80c oil temperature after a few minutes of driving on a regular basis
  my patrol ran 90100 in minus 2025 celsius

  exactly my plan hoping to have my shit together better in 3/4 years and get a cayman or 911
  super human half spic    now thats a laugh who was the german your mother or father
  germans  aryan  fuck off shit skin nigger no one wants you here go back to your third world countries
  this color seriously fuckin gay dude
  any tips to those who are working on making it    doing the it meme so i just have to get more certs and work hard to make good money looking at starting monthly investment though robinhood once my finances are stabilized some mixture of high and low risk stocks perhaps look into mutual funds as well for a more stable portfolio small amounts in larger crpto coins like doge etherium etc blockchain has potential so its just waiting around to find a coin that has inherent value because of blockchain processing power
  i got a blue color job almost finished school for it also have tons of tech certifications for diesel mechanics dropped out of collage and im living the dream working hard manual labor is fulfilling for me honestly there isnt much money in it i wish i didnt waste my time and instead learned to be an electrition or something like that i have some 401k and some crypto investments too imho the key to making it is real estate but i got lucky and bought a house in 2009ish that doubled in value 3 years i sold it bought my house and took over some properties from my family that were upside down and they didnt want to take care of my wife and i have 2 rental properties currently right now seems like a bad time to buy best of luck anon its rough out there i dont agree with anything about how we are forced to live but i just play the game
op still hasnt posted bread therefore op is just another wannabe poser    end thread
  are 6bolts common in america theyre pretty uncommon here in nz evo13 vr4 eternas/galants but 90 of them are thrashed
  honestly thats good enough he isnt obligated to add to your bread on hood folder
no bread on hood no care
hey /o/  so my car battery has been dying after about 34 days after driving     battery is fine i even replaced but the new one died after 3 or 4 days   alternator is good since after i jump start it the car runs up even charges battery to a full 1260 or 1270 v  starter is fine once i connect my jump pack the car starts right up  everyday the battery drains a little bit if ive fully charged it to 126v the next day it will be 1220 or 1230v  after a week battery will drop to 10v    i checked for a parasitic draw but when i hook a multimeter in series through the battery the current drain only sits at a constant 20ma there is a blinking from the alarm led so it pulsates from 2025ma the only things i can find causing a current draw are the ecu plug and the radio plug but these have had no problems before and 20ma is well below threshold to kill a new battery in 3 days    this suddenly happened a couple months ago the only thing i remember doing when it started was there was a p0134 and p0135 i replaced the upstream o2 sensor cel went away but a couple weeks later this happened if i unplug the o2 sensor during the parasitic drain test nothing happens    plz help me /o/ this thing has been driving me nuts the past couple months 
  alternator is good since after i jump start it the car runs up even charges battery to a full 1260 or 1270 v    if its 127 while running your alternator is not good
  its 127v after shutting off the car and testing the battery immediately after a 1 or 2 hour drive  its 14v while the alternator is running    also had it tested out at vatozone they said the battery starter and alternator tested fine
did you check all fuses individually for drain
  then try a different multimeter it should be impossible to drain a 80ah battery with a 20ma drain sure its not 2 amps
  yeah i pulled all the fuses one by one except for the chunky 40a fuses  since the current drain rests around 25ma shouldnt that be fine and not kill the car after 3 days    the only thing i can think of is if something is waking up the car and using power after some extended period of time since when i did the parasitic draw test i only monitored it for about 30 minutes but that doesnt make any sense since my car was able to go a month without driving and was fine before that
  sure its not 2 amps  yup i tested this by turning on one the dome lights that will increase the drain to about 1a      it should be impossible to drain a 80ah battery with a 20ma drain  thats why im wondering if there anything thats waking the car up after an idle period like in     ive read online that if an alternator diode is bad it can drain the battery but shouldnt this show up in the parasitic drain test or does this bypass the test somehow
  anyone on this shitty board has a fucking clue about car electric circuits
  ddoes that mean i should i just give up and take it to the stealership 
  it should show up on the assumption youre checking the drain on the neg side of the battery speaking of how old is the battery itself
  the diode issue should have shown up on the alternator test you could also take the alternator off and have it specifically tested if youre not convinced    a year/make/model could also help
have you tried taking off the positive terminal and seeing if it arcs
just install a battery disconnect you hit everytime you park  cant be drained if its not even hooked up
  i think your leads or your wires are too krusty for an accurate reading does your dmm have autorange wire brush the cable ends and measure through the ground to the battery check the light switch on auto function remote start and ign switch jiggle it could be intermittent
  youre checking the drain on the neg side of the battery  yup for the parasitic drain test ive unplugged neg terminal and wired the multimeter in series through there i even tried something where i wired it in parallel set the car alarm then disconnected it so it would be in series to not fry the multimeter      speaking of how old is the battery itself  started with a 6 month old battery then i took it to vatozone and asked for warranty replacement too bad the next week that new battery died as well      have you tried taking off the positive terminal and seeing if it arcs  havent done this what is it upposed to do      ground to the battery  how to do this do i connect multimeter to negative battery terminal and some random steel part of car      could be intermittent  thats what im scared of  but its a 2005 civic shitbox so no remote start or anything id know that could trigger that
  you got it right negative cable to battery hazards ign switch alarm something with power when the cars off maybe proximity sensor shock sensor wakes it up
  its a 2005 civic shitbox no prox sensor or shock sensors   it could be the car alarm but i thought that only goes from the door switches    rip me gonna try the parasitic draw test again tomorrow after a 1 hour drive to charge the battery then see what happens might end up just taking it to my mechanic
  whats the date code on the new battery sometimes they sit for years in the store
  remove the glovebox/centre console globes as in completely remove and give it a few days to see what happens i have seen dicky switches turn hidden lights on and off inside the car causing weird drain issues
  checked car confirmed for cursed
post friendly cars that are excited to see you
mopar sucks deal with it libtards
muh demon runs 9s
  posting a shopped picture  also nobody really cares about energy density or output density when your thermal efficiency is 90 and your competitor 40 no emissions and less environmental impact from producing electricity vs obtaining and refining crude oil is also a benefit a vast majority of normies also really only care about torque and city driving so ev is more than sufficient for them    i hate these cars and i will never buy any of them but if you cant see why normies or the government wants you to drive them youre delusional
daily econbox ev is the future brainlet
  most people cant properly recharge a ev at home and the grid cant handle a bunch of supercharger stations
  your picture is shopped anon ice is over 13000 wh/kg
  its cheaper than having to physically haul fuel around the nation
  nope it would cost trillions to beef up the grid to support evs that trillions moves a lot of oil via rail or pipeline
only governments want ev  thats why theyre being pushed
  im willing to buy any ev that isnt a pos tesla i want what the arnie has but due to gms current situation itll never happen anytime soon
  check that x axis again  even with the best theoretical battery chemistry theyre only at 1/10th the density  so your 90 vs 40 efficiency argument goes out the window  also mazda is claiming nearly 60 efficiency
  wild claim  no source  i want an ev therefore youre wrong    if we know youre wrong about one thing we can extrapolate youre wrong about most things    its wrong to be a cocksucking faggot    therefore you are a cocksucking faggot    qed
  rip in peace anon
  buy surplused m998 for like 7k   buy totaled tesla for battery pack    am become governator
  if you build a solar carport or got solar panels on your roof charging is literally for free
  because they want to increase the price of electricity  also full ev should be good in a traffic jam  it could even autonomously and silently creep forward so you can just sleep for an hour or two
  solar panels are free
  an array of solar panels cant charge a large amount of evs fast enough expect around 3 days for 25
icecapacitor hybrids are the future theres zero need for 40 mile electric range most of the ice losses happen on acceleration and from inability to do regen braking
  who needs to charge their car when there are clouds nobody needs to drive a car on a cloudy day
  it is not that simple mazda claims just over 50 peak efficiency  that doesnt mean you average anywhere near that on your daily commute since it is only at a certain rpm and load on the engine typicaly about at maximum torque and 600800 hectopascall depending on your engine  however this already puts you over 50 of your engines maximum power output so you dont usually drive there since it is illegal to go that fast and the high aerodynamic drag kills your mpg  that is why small engines get better mpg they operate closer to their maximum efficiency in normal driving situations    with a verry efficient diesel engine you can reach up to about 2530 with a gas engine up to about 20 efficiency on your average commute if there is no stop and go traffic      serial hybrid makes more sense as you can run the ice exactly at its peak efficiency or not at all plus you can do your daily commute with no fuel at all
  awful post
  underage b
  imagine being so retarded you think that solar panels dont work on overcast days
  on a cloudy day typical solar panels can produce 1025 of their rated capacity   you stupid nigger
  solar panels will literally never improve  lmao
  physics will change lmao  are you even trying
  the sakichi battery doesnt even exist toyota basically said yeah well have batteries better than gasoline someday but we have no idea what that will actually involve to make it happen your image is irrelevant
  in many states total government incentives for installing a rooftop solar pv system actually exceeds the cost of doing so in some its even a very interesting investment
  youre gonna need a fuckload of panels to charge an electric car at a resonable rate
  government is free    bernie sanders please go
  im an adult because i use the government as a free stuff generator    please kiddo grow up
fuck ev and fuck elon musk
  all the panels on the iss wouldnt be able to supercharge a single tesla and theyre the best panels available
  what is a buffer
  you fucking tell me did you mean a battery
  the sakichi battery doesnt exist its a goal for battery research to strive to
  do you seriously think youre getting most of the energy out of ice youre losing the majority of it to heat and sound instead of getting mechanical energy out of it
  what is free cabinet heat
  if batteries were efficient they wouldnt need cooling systems
  no but the sheer energy density of the fuel and the speed at which we can generate power with it far outstrips current evs    plus the fact that we can just fuel up in 5 mins from empty and go for hundreds of miles is much better than currently available ev tech    admitting the shortcomings of current electric tech isnt the same thing as shitting all over it
  battery capaciator water getting pumped up in a hydroelectric powerplant inertia wheels compressed air and much more are options for a buffer
  its fine if your taxes end up in my pocket
  not handing out gibs for household electricity generation in states were electricity is already super cheap is bad policy  lmfao also 2 p/a for a 5 year cd and 7 p/a for stock investment is ridiculously shit
  acttutally from battery to wheel is about 9080  but idk if thats a true metric if u are concerned about costs you can lose like 5070 between a charging port and the battery and that percentage goes lower the faster you charge not saying that gasoline isnt going to fail to future technologies but anyone who says electric cars is a step forward rather than a step to the side is a moron
  compressed air powered cars when
  because western education systems are a total meme and people genuinely dont know how either combustion or batteries make car go vroom vroom and because people are relatively rich now and dont have any other problems they get emotionally invested in the dumbest shit like saving the climate
  do i sense sarcasim
  and now go and do the math on how big an inertia wheels must be to store the same amount of energy as a liter of petrol
  no im serious if you think that electric cars have any significant impact on climate you should do the world a favour and neck yourself
  if you could read you would know that sieze isnt realy that much of a factor for a stationary buffer  that is also why nife batteries are somewhat popular in this application as they last practicly forever
daily an ev gas for fun and road trips i look forward to when the fucking leaf has more range than the current model  i had one for a while and theyre decent cars i only wish the battery could last the entire week without having to recharge on the weekends id use a roadster or have a minivan on standby
  mass huge solar subsidy  literally one of the worst environments on earth for solar  pottery  inb4 muh pollution muh peak oil and muh hurr  the future is nuclear or some kind of regular hydro/geo in very narrow regions where the latter is plausibly able to meet local needs wind solar and the rest of the fad green subsidized shit are preppertier nonsense that can only be sold with massive subsidies to complete morons who want to larp like theyre off the grid when 90 of their power comes from local coal and theyre too up the ass of politics to realize the only reason they hate nuke plants and dammed rivers is because big coal and oil pay their brains to be scrambled with bullshit propaganda
  they got an significant impact on local air quality in my street for me this is very important the sooner electric cars are common the better for me also there would be less noise
  they got an significant impact on local air quality in my street  source we have the same retarded discussion in germany and its ridiculous the nox limits are fucking made up there has never been a study that suggests harmful effects of such small amounts on the human body a fucking candle emits more nox than youll experience directly next to a high way modern diesels already act as fine dust filters in many regions of this country muh air quality is a boogeyman to get individual transport banned
  also there would be less noise  above 20 mph tires become louder than most engines a highway of electric cars will be just as noisy
  today only solar and wind are competitive   nuclear and coal are the past simply because they more expensive investors already decided how future energy will look like
  its easy to understand electric cars produce no emissions no nox no co2 nothing no emissions means better local air quality in cities
  not when the coal fired power plant outside the city has to rump up 500
  thats like saying you should shave your head to take stress off your knee joints retarded
  fuck you elon give it back
  you just dont know what you are talking about iss is 20 years old and panels there are way outdated these panels produce 120 kilowatts of electricity  tesla can charge cars up to 120 kw   now drive your tesla up there
  energy here comes from wind turbines solar panels and a hydroelectric dam
  unless you have to drive more than 100 miles per day there is no reason to not have an electric vehicle the fuel costs 1/3rd to 1/4th as much money per mile you can charge it at home every night so youll never have to stop at a fuel station its quieter and smoother so it makes the commute more comfortable the only thing ice vehicles are better for is long trips and thats solely due to how much more available the fuel is and how fast they can be refueled compared to electric
  what is evacuations
  i dont know never happens here and never will does this really happen where you live must be a shit place nobody should live there
  delusion the post
  losing energy to amazing sounds  thinking this is a bad thing  go back to /g/ you faggot larper
  be you  3 years later 1/4 your ev batteries shit out because cindy mcshithead backed into your car in a parking lot while you were shopping  dealerships the only place that will work on your car quote you for 5000 due to price of batteries and maintenance   try to sell car instead  realize no one buys used evs because theyre shit    be you  living in your townhouse/apartment  come home with batteries on 10  charge them while you go do other things  not realizing how much copper is in your huge fucking charger  tyrone and cleetus steal your charger to sell on ebay or scrap for copper    being an ev cuck sounds horrible lmao neck yourself faggot gas is 218 rn
  if i want amazing sound i turn on music
so i make 370k a year but im cheap i liked the supra when it was the ft 1 concept but now it sounds shitty any reason i shouldnt get one of these instead for 1/3 of the price and with 400 hp quality leather interior bose etc ill buy used i dont care if there is something better
  so i make 370k a year  wow cool another fucking larp thread great
  wtf bro me too except i make 360k
  people make money doesnt mean they want to spend it
  buy a red sport throw a jb4 on it and enjoy whipping it its basically more refined baby gtr
  you sure as fuck dont make a clean six figures and shitpost about what car you should get on 4chins id understand showing off but if you had your shit together that much youd research your own car and get it
  very nice my man i only pulled in 285k last year so i cant afford something like the q60 went with a base trim gti instead but i am not a fan of nissan products so any infiniti is off limits for me go with something more refined imo lexus gs f for example
  implying making a lot of money means you have your shit together    lmao come spend a week in the bay area everyone here makes 300k and is completely retarded in most aspects of their life
  looks promising so get one 60k miles plus since the jb4 voids warranty im assuming is twin turbo kit pointless
  my wife already has an rx450h its nice but im sick of lexuses and i dont want to spend over 100k on an lc
  its even uglier than the supra
  375k isnt a lot of money here im in texas next to a lot of drug dealers on my way to work i pass a lot of porsches ferraris gtrs my neighbor has an audi r8 i could never imagine spending over 100k on a car my house is barely worth 350k
  but its only like 24 thousand used everyone is saying supra will be over 60k and only 330 hp
  i believe the red sport is 3l twin turbo already so maybe upgraded turbos and the works        lots of potential and if you want to go full beast mode cop a gtr
  my neighbor has a gtr this one seems nice    but id be spending a lot of money and itd just be another gtr on the block
  then just know that youre forever a poorfag that cheaped out on his fancy datsun nipbox
kia stinger
can anyone here offer their experiences personal or second hand with regards to the ford 4cyl 20l ecoboost engine    im looking at the ford falcon ecoboost but idk about how reliable/durable the engine will prove to be parents have a 2007 falcon with the barra i6 and the engine has been fine but it likes a fkn drink 13l/100km  18mpg in the   city powerwise the ecoboost is pretty similar to the barra save for the gobs of low end torque handling is improved due to 60kg less over front wheels  they seem to be a bit of a bargain cos most people skipped the 4 cyl or went for the lpi model
its good but dont buy one used a lot of people will say theyre shit engines because so many people went out and bought a focus and didnt know how to treat a turbo or dfi engine and ruined them through neglect or abuse
is it possible to own a miata and not get called gay
throw an ls in it
  miata is so old normies have forgotten about it forget about he gay thing no one even knows what it is anymore
  no not really but its more of an old people car now every time its nice out people are either driving top down in a mint na or an rf/fiata
doesnt happen to miata anymore that term is used for prius fiat smart cars
  this  op if you went afk once in a while youd know that people are happy to see them at car meets and oldfags will say nice things at red lights
  yes just be a woman
  burgerlander here the only thing anyone notices about it is that its fucking tiny
if you cant handle being called gay i think you have bigger issues
literally no one cares outside of 4chan drive whatever you like
  other than being called gay by friends i havent been called gay by anybody although when i drive around i always think about what other people think of me wow that car is so cute oh theres a boy driving it oh wow i wonder if hes gay doesnt bother me though
  yes its called a fiat 124 spider
yes
only person yhat i actually know who had one was flaming homosex only people i see driving them otherwise are elderly or very young    i think theyre neat for what its worth
  this pic is more master baiter than homosexual tbqh
  live in yuro optimally eastern europe i get praised for my miata everywhere no one ever says bad things about it
  a cute
  why do you care are you that insecure
  been called a hairdresser never gay though
  is it possible not to makes the same thread every 2 days
      same here    i cant go anywhere without someone 50 asking me what it is and how much it reminds them of their old mg that they still regret selling
  be a woman
  i thought that was the point as a signal to other men that youre down to take their dick in your ass and that youd probably let them blow their load on your goatee honestly thought was true since you never even see women driving them lmao
  sounds like youre experienced in this area
  he wouldnt be asking if he wasnt
  i always see girls smiling at me/the car  theyre probably laughing at me but its interesting
  when you drive a miata you automatically bwecome gway
  everybody in real life says that my miata is cool the only ones that call me gay are you guys
midf out in force in this thread
cut your dick   then you will be called trans not gay
no
ive only been called gay once while driving it for 2 years but it was from 4 dudes walking together so go figure
  thats not true just google forum posts about miatas anywhere other than on dedicated miata forums homosexuality and hairdressers willinevitably come up even if its just banter what you read online is what the boomer who complimented your miata will tell his buddies the moment you turn around
agreed     had this old woman professor stop me to ask what it was i told her it was a mazda miata and she just smiled and said something like that must be great to take up north in the canyons the only people who hate miatas are probably bro truck drivers desu
  
  /thread
  yes  leave america
  caring what others think about you
    when she said take it up north to the canyons she mean you take dick up your ass    its a gay car desu im not even a truck driver    i drive a bmw
   op  everybody in real life says that my miata is cool the only ones that call me gay are you guys    its just easier for people to be blunt and honest online
  i drive a bmw
no because youre driving around in a bar of soap
  iit means the same thing anon
  what are the wheel/tire specs   looks sweet
i changed my altenator with a new one about a week ago but the battery light came back plus the emergency brake one when measured the voltage was 123v or so when car was not running and after i started it it was down to 115v left it for about 10 minutes to idle then tried to restart and it wouldnt start again voltage is still 115v  what do the alternator is new and the belt also
  a quick check is to wiggle the red and black wires to the battery they shouldnt move at all also learn to voltage drop test wires especially the battery grounds intermittent charging could be in the computer but more likely just clean all the cable ends with a wire brush and make sure they are tight side post battery bolts should be replaced with the battery   do a google search is the regulator in your cars alternator or pcm
  perhaps you need a new battery
  but if it was the battery itself would the light on the dash still come up
  the battery is required to smooth out the power delivery to the electronics    without it the car will start acting wierd and you could fry something    id hazard a guess that its probably the battery
seen this problem corroded grounds start at the battery and check the rest
buy a new battery fit the new battery drive car
if i know which caliper got air into my break line can i just bleed the one in question or do i have to do all 4
  probably have to bleed the whole system     how you get this shit off
  other than your boyfriend what are you trying to get off 
  deep impact but why the fuck are you taking it off
  to install different shocks no impact wrench so that small nut at the top spins with it fucking a and its not a typical socket shape at the top
  bleed the whole system depending on what the leak was youd be likely to get most of the air out bleeding just the one but you wont get all of it dont take shortcuts on your brakes      impact wrench if you have one or use a ratcheting wrench on the nut and hold the stud portion with something like a large flat jawed visegrip regular pliers wont hold it and will most likely round the stud so you cant hold it anymore a small open end wrench of the correct size may work depending on how resistant to turning the nut is
  hold the top with vice grips or a wrench and spin the bottom nut with another wrench how is this difficult
  because millennials
can a car be fully restored after sustaining structural damage my 2013 civic was rear ended and the final bill was 7000 the floor of the trunk had to be reshaped and reinforced with high strength steel and now a lot of the gaps between panels are off a bit on that side    the steering wheel also shakes around 70 mph and new tires/rebalancing did not fix the issue at all so i think the car has something fundamentally wrong with it im about ready to just get rid of it and move on should i keep it or will it never be fully restored
my motorcycle leaks everywhere when its cold  brake fluid antifreeze even fork oil   what could cause this especially the brake fluid it never leaks when warm outside only below freezing
  unless youre only replacing 1 caliper and thats the source of your air how would you know where air got in its safer just to bleed the whole system with fresh fluid    the stud has wrench flats on the top hold the shaft from spinning with a wrench and use another wrench to spin the nut off
  i suppose anything can be fixed with enough time and the right fixer but its probably not worth it
  what could cause this  apparently coldness
    yeah imo they should have just totaled the car the initial estimate was 4000 with no structural damage and i think when they found a shitload more they had to cut corners to keep costs down
  im not familiar with rear suspension on a civic   is it within alignment  anything suspension related broken in the rear  was everything in the rear replaced  shocks and suspension components 
this thread is useless    now how do they know when to stop wiping
  they smell the wiped paper until it aint so smelly
    anything can be restored with enough time effort and money but it usually doesnt happen not many body shops actually do things the true right way and most insurance companies wouldnt pay for it anyway   some of it can probably be fixed without a huge amount of effort some of it wont be the easy answer is to get rid of it  i would take it back to the body shop regarding the panel gaps      cold obviously old seals are less flexible than new seals because seals harden with age old cold seals are even less flexible as low temperature also makes the material less flexible add in expansion/contraction of the metals from temperature fluctuation and you have leaks  i used to do a lot of dirt bike racing people would somewhat often have fork or shock seal failures on very cold mornings in the desert
  probably when the feeling of shit between their cheeks goes away or they could just take a couple extra safety wipes afterward or shower after the shit anyway
    the body shop sublet out to my usual mechanic for alignment/balancing and they said everything was good there    they replaced the rear wheel/tire but the only part of the suspension that was replaced was the trailing arm    after the accident my power steering light went on but there is no mention of that being diagnosed/fixed anywhere so im also wondering what happened with that the light is no longer on
im deciding between a nb or nc miata 6th or 7th gen celica or 7th or 8th gen civic si im selling my 2007 mustang gt because its not reliable at all and im going back to school so i cant afford the time or money to work on it i want something thats more reliable but still sorta fun to drive
  youll miss the torque of the gt compared with any of your options the miata is probably your best bet its a fun rwd sports car with a good aftermarket not a soulless econbox
  ive got one misfiring cylinder right now so im not getting to use most of that torque also its an autotragic so its not that fun to drive
how common is the oh the internet price is if you pay cash only if you want to finance you cant get that bait and switch im looking to buy a newer model cadillac and im noticing all the dealer pages work with conditional incentives being rolled into the offer price which is on its own separate cash deal tab
what happened to the australian threads
  not sure where i should ask but i find myself really into four and two wheels but besides industrial design can a graphic designer get into the field of automotive
how do i overcome the cold to work on my shitbox
  heated garage
  i want to buy a brz/frs/gt86 for 20k but i realized for the same price and daily inconvenience i could get a c6 corvette fuck if i spent 10k more i could get a z06 with 505bhp is there a reason not to do this
  maintenance is a bit more   tire selection is expensive i imagine as well
    these are the only reasons go with the c6 or hell even the c5 is a better value than the toyobaru    t c5 owner
  no i work on it in the middle of a feild
  heated tent then
  consumables like tires pads and oil will be a more for sure gas is 16c/26h for the chev and 21c/29h for the toybaru not to bad since i live where gas is cheap but the corvette has more than twice the power
  c5 come in yellow
  ive been working on my bronco in the middle of a corn field pinion gear snapped in 8 pieces on the rear diff im just swapping the rear end the trick is to not give a shit about the cold and just fucking get it done the truck runs otherwise so i do have a little heater plugged into the cigarette lighter that works ok good enough to unfreeze my hands
  pull the driveshaft and let it crawl out of the feild in fwd
  i would but the rear axle shafts fell out wheel and all id rather not drag the ass end across three miles of frozen soil
  those heated glove  boot inserts pic related   some of those warmasfuck long johns and windproof clothes
  aw man fuck that sucks
  poor rust bucket i miss her dearly i think im going to regear it in the spring its 355 right now
  411s could be fun
  i may end up doing it anyway i think the axle i picked up is supposed to be limited slip  but i fear they welded it what ever it was free and its just a mud truck
  hey if its free fuck it id probably open it up just in case they did some shit welding and lay a new bead
  good clothes    starting top to bottom this is what ill usually wear when working on something midwinter at a common temperature of 25c/13f    head  thin beanie  neck  buff  top  long sleeve wool shirt fleece jacket and maybe another thin jacket over  legs  long wool leggings merino wool thin pants and outside work pants that i get from work think ski pants but with more pockets and oil on it  feet  thicksoled boots with actually warm lining on the inside thick socks with a pair of woolen socks on the outside    for gloves ill typically wear some thicker mechanics winter gloves pic related and maybe a pair of very thin mechanics glovs on the inside of those if its very cold or ill be working on something a longer time
  thing is i do use this for work around the farm sometimes i rather not tear up my new trail grapplers because of a welded diff
never changed my calipers before now im doing all 4 at once there is only one thing im a little unsure of do i need to bleed each one individually as i go or will i need to do all of them at once when ive changed every caliper having all 4 wheels in the air at once isnt an option right now
  having all 4 wheels in the air at once isnt an option right now    so make it that way go get some jack stands you hack alternatively you could just bleed one side then bleed the other
  bleed individually if you cant have all 4 in the air at once just make sure you dont let the reservoir go dry cause if you do its fucktown for you
my accelerator pedal is too high and my seat is not adjustable forcing me to have my foot at an incredibly sharp angle to reach it what is the preferable way to remedy this
  bend the bracket if its made of metal but leave the portion that pulls the cable alone
  they wipe and do a second one with a clean piece then they try to fold it and open it if it sticks after folding they need more wiping it it doesnt its clean this doesnt mean every blind person does it this way though just the ones i asked  t med student who asked this to a blind person  some might also just use baby wipes
have automatic transmission  shifts just fine between park drive reverse etc  in drive i cant tell if the first two gears are incredibly low or if its shifting early  goes from first to second almost instantly second to third before 10mph then third gear up to 45    is my transmission fucked it doesnt act funny it just shifts at times that make no sense
  too much effort to fix a civic  not worth it still has to pass an inspection
  i dont know what youre saying but its probably fine it wont shift at the same speeds all the time it will shift a lot earlier if theres not much load on the engine
  okay thanks i might just be retarded
  if i know which caliper got air into my break line can i just bleed the one in question  you can do the one if you are in a hurry/ dont have enough brake fluid    how you get this shit off  anon you buy the correct shock mount tool  lisle 20400    the floor of the trunk had to be reshaped and reinforced with high strength steel and now a lot of the gaps between panels are off a bit on that side  that was a shitty rebuild anon floor panel should have been cut out and new panel installed  need to have your car four wheel aligned and checked for any bent control arm links and that the rear subframe is still square to the car check wheel bearings are tight might have to go to a frame shop to have the car checked proper not all body shops have a proper frame rig    i think when they found a shitload more they had to cut corners to keep costs down  bring it back and have them fix it they already fucked up by not fixing it the first time around    how do i overcome the cold to work on my shitbox  dont lie down on a cold surface if you have to work under the vehicle its amazing how much insulation cardboard provides homeless know whats up  long sleeves  warm pants well insulated shoes/boots gloves you can work in and definitely something you can wear around your kneck/head i can get stupid cold fast but something as simple as a bandanna around my neck and the brain does not freeze  do i need to bleed each one individually as i go or  thats the easy way  remove/replace/rebleed move on to next wheel just do the replacement in the order of the bleeding procedure    is my transmission fucked  if your trans is vacuum controlled with a modulator check the modulator  if your trans is throttle valvetv controlled check that the cable is properly adjusted some are pressure adjusted others just need the slack removed others are auto adjusted  depends on what make/model/year you have

what is hands down the best most reliable used hatchback as a first car auto or manual people have been telling me toyota matrix or a honda fit but how are golfs and mazda 3s
how do you stay motivated i sank too much money into a rustbucket 240 which promptly died and now its been over a year since it last ran ive honestly tried working on it so many times but since all i can do right now is tear it apart to eventually replace the head gasket and studs and inspect cylinder wear it doesnt feel like progress i got everything off the front of the engine and right side but now i have to deal with the horrible rats nest that is the intake side all the hoses are old and crumbling when i have to move them out of the way so not only is it going to be hard to match it all back up but ill need to buy all new hoses to boot i know im in over my head but i have friends who can help and mentally i feel like i have to fix it i would be massively disappointed in myself with any other outcome
  golf will be fine with the 25 and the mazda is fine too

axle backs are welded to mid pipe   dont like this anytime you need to change clutch or swap shit in the trans or whatever it makes it more difficult  1 cut where its welded on a straight section and then clamp it with those lap joints   2 wait until a stock used midpipe shows up on sale for 50  think i would get exhaust leaks with option 1
does anyone have a recommendation for a decent 1/2 drive impact socket set for around 100
  option 1 should be fine use a bit of muffler cement if youre worried about it leaking the key to sealing is making sure all of the area covered by the clamp is clean and levelish
does a 4 stroke at 6000 rpm have the same power as a 2 stroke at 3000

anyone got any info on how to turn a volvo 240 into an off road machine  all the stuff i can find online are old forum posts with dead links and broken images and not much else besides people doing full blown 4wd conversions with custom everything    me and some buddies are planning on entering the equivalent of the swede folk racing in our country and were eyeing a few cheap 240s in our area  rules say you are only allowed to change struts/springs and dampers and they cant be adjustable so it will only really be a mild offroad conversion just to get a lift and some reinforcements here and there    all the useful information i could find is to use springs meant for diesel engines at the front and jeep cherokee springs at the back and not much else     anyone here can share some more info or can direct me to a relevant discussion on the internet

not sure this is the right thread  i have a 2017 rav4 and the driver side window wont go back up once its down i did get it back up through sheer turning the car on and off about 10 times until it finally went all the way up    i am going out of the country for 3 weeks i cant get the car fixed right now because they cant get the part by the time i leave if the window is up now will it stay up i park outside and dont want it to come down while im gone
        thanks for your suggestions
  itll stay up
  cool thanks for the piece of mind  hopefully thisll be covered by the warranty     if it was raining recently is it possible some water got down in the window mechanism i did go through a drive thru while raining  but i figure they would account for that stuff when they make these cars
  its a possibility but that happens all the time its not your fault decent drizzles and i drive with the windows down    but thats still very unfortunate it crapped out and that car is fairly new      torque at low rpms look up the power/torque curves
theres a cts listed for 1k on my local clist its a 2003 with the 32 very tempting but the listing says needs alternator    1 can i drive this car for like 510 mins without being stranded so i can take it home  2 is it worth it to fix it and flip it alternator seems to be around 150 unsure about time itd take  3 do i go and check it out and try to lowball the dude as a winter beater second car id buy it if i could talk him down to 750 or so  4 what else can go wrong with these cars no mileage listed so idk   5 am i insane for wanting to willingly buy a gm product
  very tempting but the listing says needs alternator    its never just the alternator especially given the culture that typically owns them
  oh no 100 i agree with you im sure something more than the alternator is fucked with the car    the tempting part is to go and check the car out desu and thats about it
  what engine
  
      well if youre aware of that if it is just that and the mileage is reasonable you could probably stand to resell it closer to 4grand id imagine     you could theoretically drive it on battery alone but its sketchy and on some newer cars the ecu will throw a bitch fit if it is getting low voltage other than that im not too familiar with late model gm stuff i tend to avoid it because they had significant quality issues around the 00s

  why didnt insurance total it and buy you a new car
one of my car headlights goes out sometimes the bulb will flash fine when i unlock the car then when i start it one will be out then later it will come on by its self ive seen it be off then go on when i shift from park to reverse  is it just a bad bulb or could it be a wireing issue i have to unscrew the whole front to change the bulb and i dont feel like doing it
  on a track car with a hood/fender exit exhaust they have 2 diffrent size pipes unlike 4  2 for example why im assuming turbo related but had jo luck googling thisthanks in advance
  easiest thing would be to replace the bulb but since you dont feel like doing it then throw a few punches on the headlight and hope it fixes the problem
i got a rwd jeep xj with 160k from my uncle who babied it heater core is leaking but outside of that hes changed the oil every 3500 miles and had to replace two thermostats  how much could i sell it for

  this im an insurance claims adjuster and he shouldnt have accepted that repair and kicked it back to the insurance company again to either make it right or for them to cut him a check for the value of the car and take it in as salvage insurance is supposed to repair / replace your property back to its original condition or as close as is possible to do so panel gaps and possible frame / running gear damage is unacceptable if he was an idiot and signed off on that repair and closed the claim then the insurance company got one over on him its an expensive lesson to learn

  if a grand marquis listed as air springs w/coil springs  in the vin decoder does that mean it has air ride suspension or is it something else  front springs are conventional coils  rear springs are airbags  its not a full on air bag suspension  ford learned this lesson on the 80s continentals too many problems with the front end bags/sensors audi is still trying to learn this lesson with its pigs
  what are the redline speeds for 1st and 2nd gear with an aode transmission on a 94 mustang  depends on engine rear gear ratio and wheel diameter
  alright frens could an incorrectly installed clutch cause shuddering on braking / deceleration  if the disc was installed backwards you would notice other problems first but it could cause shuddering  where is the shuddering coming from  steering wheel  brake pedal  shift lever
  how do you stay motivated  its a hobby part of enjoying it is making the vehicle safe reliable and fun to drive  which is the end goal to make it enjoyable to drive
  do i need to wash it again with hot water and soap  wouldnt hurt to make sure the ports are clear espeically any heat riser/egr ports especially on multi bank v engines  might still have some media stuck in it  dry it off and paint it
  isnt that working as intended
  but then the key literally just doesnt turn again till 20 minutes of fiddling and trying
anyone familiar with electrical gremlins in early 2000s volvos got a swedish produced v70 p2 from 2001  the window and mirror switches and the power lock in the drivers door somewhat randomly fail temporarily  if its cold and humid they doesnt respond to anything the lock can only be locked/unlocked manually the rest of the locks respond to the remote and the window switches in each of the other doors also work perfectly  after driving for some time on dry days or during summer the electrics in the drivers door work fine on colder days the lights on the mirror switches sometimes flicker every couple seconds once they start working  i doubt its a bad connector as opening the door and closing it again or slamming it shut dont make a difference seeing how its limited to that door only a bad relay cant be the cause either
need to do an alignment and my steering wheel is crooked towards the left does this mean i need to align the opposite way
  had a 85p wagon manual non turbo that was good air went out at 130k but that was it then mom sold it but up until that point i think it only needed 1 motor mount then entire time
  ment 850 and heres the longterm review for the r i found     
  even if you wiggle the steering wheel while trying to unlock it
  it depends on which wheel is out of alignment if they are both unaligned by the same amount in the same direction then you just need to move everything a bit to the left if wheel is pointing left when going straight but if only one wheel is off then you need to check which one and which direction it is pointing before being able to correct the issue
  yeah doesnt matter which way if i pull the key out slightly etc nothing on the web really helps i think the cylinder is bad cause the key still unlocks the doors just fine and i dont get anything on the display if i put the key in but i have no clue whats causing it
  i have an 850 t5 sedan its pretty reliable ive driven mine across the country several times had to replace a starter and some solenoids cos autotragic has a really bad misfire right now probably the fuel system it handles pretty good and is a shit ton of fun i really need a truck but im really in love with the 850 if you are looking for soul and power an 850 t5/r is the way to go try and find a manual one though the auto tranny isnt great
  theres a facebook group called lifted volvos and its just a bunch of dudes who lift 200 700 and 900 series volvos and do stupid shit offroad
  you could try to disassemble the barrel to see if there is anything obviously wrong that can be fixed or you could always pull one out of a scrapped car and just transfer the tumbler yourself so you can keep using the same key

  if youre only gonna be here for 2 years then it might be worth it to just lease a vehicle instead of buying it that way when your 2 year lease is up you can just turn it back in and leave without having to worry about the hassle of trying to sell it yourself or get raped by selling it to a dealership

this is embarrassing but how do i learn to drive stick shift efficiently    unless you have 500 hours on stick shift i dont see how can anyone be proficient with it    so here are my questions    why do i have to go from n to 1 cant i just go from n to 2 and why  why do i have to switch from 2 to 1 when im braking and what happens if i dont  cant you randomly choose what gear you want to be on  how do you visualize all the different gears in your box isnt it dangerous to practice that shit in traffic  how fast do you hit the clutch do you just floor that fucker everytime you want to shift
  daihatsu charade
  time for the real question  why the fuck dont we have an italian cars general
  ho boy  you go from neutral to first because that way you use the ideal gear ratio for the low speed the engine is traveling with if you go from neutral to second youll put more strain on the engine  it depends on the circumstances if youre braking to a stop you can just clutch in until youve stopped then restart from first due to what i mentioned above in other circumstances its because the engine will end up stalling if you dont switch to firsts gear ratio  absolutely not the gears are sequential  you usually practice them blind first while standing still then while driving on some large space ideally a parking lot the usual pattern on a manual gearbox is an h so it will always be up leftdown leftup centraldown centralup right to advance through gears and down right if you have a sixth gear else the reverse gear is there  you dont hit the clutch you fully push it to the floor whilst letting go of the gas pedal then switch gears let go and press the gas pedal thats really the trickiest part of learning manual because you need to make sure your left foot is sensitive enough to the clutch
  why is this someone explain
  why is what    if he lets the reservoir go dry he has to start all over again

first time leasing and i have a 10th gen manual civic lx can i change any of the following for qol pedals muffler rims
  custom shifter handle    leasing  changing anything  lolno you need to actually own the car to do that
  whats the point of the owners manual talking about downshifting then if the accelerator is so fucking far to the right of and behind the brake pedal i never had an issue with tapping with the side of my shoe before and now i have to actually use my heel and suffer jerky brakin
is there a reason i want to buy rims and coilovers for a car i want to get rid of in the next year or two
  is it an auto use your left foot to brake is it a manual then you should clutch that in with your left feet while braking with your right it sounds like a ton of exercise in theory in practice its so fast you barely end up noticing once youve gotten used to it
  thats your heart telling you you really dont want to get rid of it
  you missed the conveyed message about braking while shifting down i dont want to have to double clutch into lower gear all the time
  oh thats gay i thought i might as well get new rims if i need new tires to get wider tires and coilovers or lowering springs/shocks for a bit of lowering but thats 2k pissed away if i do
  unless youre racing you dont really need to double clutch just brake and shift down once it should be enough unless youre driving at wangan speeds
  again throttle blipping
  but is it really necessary to do it
  have you never driven manual o
  unfortunately for you i have data on my side go cry somewhere else alfashill

dad never taught me manual so ive been trying to learn but its going horribly  all my friends drive manual  never got taught  sit in the passenger seat watching them memorize their movements  finally get behind the wheel of a friends 30 year old manual toyota to try it out in a parking lot  spend a good 10 minutes in neutral getting familiar with the bite point  im ready  slowly lets go of the clutch to let the car roll on its own like my friends and all the videos say  stall  gives it a little gas while letting off the clutch like all my friends and all the videos say  stall  fucking drops the clutch at 5k rpm like a retard like all the videos say not to do  didnt stall but burning smell  continues trying anyways  burning smell gets stronger  stop cry push car home    im sure this questions been asked a million times on this board but what are some tips for getting going in first gear    also how much damage would learning manual do to the transmission  its been well kept but im worried the gears will be smooth circles by the time im done    i know a guy who has a cheap shitbox that he doesnt care about  would i be better off learning in that or the car that i plan on driving

  nvm anyway try practicing finding the bite point of the clutch thats the key to it all you can let the clutch out quick just until you get to that bite point then keep it right there try that instead of slowly letting off the clutch which is what most people tell you to do again find the spot where the clutch starts to bite and basically keep it there while the car starts to roll forwards you might need to let up on the clutch a bit more if ots not engaging enough or if the engine starts to bog down below idle push it in quickly and back out again to the bite point once the car is moving 23 mph you can let off the clutch and give it gas   you might want to or need to blip the gas a bit too while letting the clutch engage i dont worry much about the throttle control just give it a little jab or keep a little pressure on the gas but most of my attention is in feeling the clutch and in clutch control while getting going from a stop i actually use the clutch to control the engine speed more than the gas
  also how much damage would learning manual do to the transmission  its been well kept but im worried the gears will be smooth circles by the time im done  probably not near as much as you think making the clutch smoke isnt good though let it cool down for a while if you notice it getting hot
  tips   keep the revs above the stalling point at all times this means either more throttle or more clutch slip just ease on more throttle as you slowly let off the clutch pedal past the bite point  damage  zero to fuck all unless youre trying to rip fat skids/clutch drops
  nah its fine to drive that way    just any basic elm327 bluetooth one off amazon will do

am i an asshole for wanting to see a vehicle twice  made plans with guy selling a bike for this past weekend but the weather sucked and neither of us wanted to bother with it   rescheduled for this weekend when its supposed to be less shitty   just got day off wednesday and its going to be fairly nice out  the guy is available but the guy i was bringing along who has actual riding experience isnt available until the weekend   so my plan was to see if i can go by myself wednesday and look it over and make sure it checks out visually and mechanically then id take my friend to see it on the weekend so he could make sure it drives well and then bring it back with us   i would probably be fine with that if i was the guy selling it but i dont want to make it seem like im trying to waste his time or anything

  thank you kind sirhave cute trash truck as payment
  what is this posting shit like this doesnt help unless you find someone with intimate knowledge of whatever vehicle this is which we are clueless
  on sorry its the lower control arm bushing in the front
  rx8  238hp in top trim when it works  112kg engine weight  2125 hp/kg  built versions would be even better  and youre going to rebuild it anyways i would also consider modern litrebike engines because they are peak n/a enjoyment especially with their sequential dogbox transmissions and they can reach 15 hp/kg  with a frame wheels fairings and all that other nonsense still attached
  left and right wont be major problems there but that will cause some pretty severe longitudinal changes when braking and accelerating    you can test this yourself by standing still having someone outside the car watching and you trying to launch a bit aggressively the wheel should move forward a bit while it picks up the slack in the bushing before the rest of the car starts to move as well you could also try to do this next to glass walls or shopping window so you can see that happening yourself in the reflection    same test could be done while braking just drive at walking speed and nail on the brake pedal the wheels should move backwards a bit in the wheel well before the whole car slows down    usually these movements of the wheels are accompanied by loud thumping noises whenever sudden changes of acceleration occur    it isnt necessarily bad from a safety point of view the arm is still going to stay there unless the bushing is completely destroyed which doesnt seem the case but it will cause some intense changes in suspension geometry while you drive and will wear your tires faster and unevenly  dont let that problem sit for too long
  holy shit thats na too
would /o/ recommend buying a car at auction a ton of them are garbage but ive seen a couple that look decent for cheap
  theres a reason wankels belong in lightweight stripped out weekend/track day cars not in mediocre shitboxes like the rx8 youre throwing away a perfectly good engine that can be awesome in something like a lotus seven or similar kitcar if you want to go midengined with your swap you can take the engine transaxle ecu and all straight from a formula mazda racecar
  url is still valid an me is curious amertards discuss  germanfag here
any catalytic converter will fit any car right and if my exhaust is the wrong size i can just use a couple of these things with some clamps right i wanna get the cheapest cat possible and i dont wanna have to do any welding or pay some mexican to do it for me
  what vehicle genius
  it needs to be welded or it will throw codes and gas you at stops
  i dont give a fuck about codes is there any way i can get it to not leak when im stopped
  imported skyline  that cheap  its either fucked or an auto m8
  weld it or it will leak and make noise
  i dont have a cat at all at the moment will the noise be worse or better than before
  is the current exhaust welded together pinholes will make whistling noises loud anything larger than a pencil hole will make it sound like you have no muffler also as i said before if you have any leaks your cab will be a hotbox of exhaust
  yeah its currently straight piped but with a muffler i didnt do it and i hate how loud it is
  a cat wont make a difference with the sound its only job is to reduce the amount of pollutants youd need a different muffler to make it quieter
can i substitute hydraulic fluid for automatic transmission fluid
  depends what are you replacing it in
  cats do muffle sound a bit they definitely can change the note of the exhaust
  afm/maf cold start valve injectors is probably where you need to start
looking for a good reliable pickup these both fit within my price range which do you guys think is the best value i have not seen either in person but im leaning towards the chevy despite the cringe humor       
  i blew my new cars clutch at 14k why did this happen i drive aggressively but theyve always lasted 6080k on other vehicles before now what did i do wrong
bought 3 different brands of tires 2 were shit and the last pair of i got goodyears are fine but all three brands i bought i had like a bumpy rough ride on the highway now my goodyears drive smooth and fine but now im starting to notice some vibrations and bumpiness around 60mph which is pissing me off cause this damn issue wont go away already had them rebalanced twice i dont know what else to try anything i can replace suspension wise to make my car drive smoother 10 civic 115k miles my commute to and from work is 99 highway so i cant stand this shit any longer
  i drive aggressively  ya blew it
2018 corolla se cpo / 8k mi / 165k  is this a decent idea or am i dumb  thx from /sci/
  i abuse the shit out of my miata and it still gets 60k on the clutch are other cars this weak do i actually have to watch the tachometer is my shifting technique bad
  maybe youre a shit fucking driver
  is my shifting technique bad    if you have to ask    my 540i is on its original clutch at 160k and has almost three times the the power of yours
    i will consider that it is my fault how do i correct this fault if the clutch fails again fuck the warranty im fixing everything myself
  how do i correct this fault    well youll have explain to us how exactly are you starting off and shifting  things like holding the clutch in at the light dropping the clutch with the rev limiter peaked holding the clutch longer than necessary to start off in first should take less than 2 seconds not smoothly engaging the clutch when starting off and shifting all are things that shorten the life of your clutch
  i dont ride the clutch at a light i disengage the stick set it in neutral and hold the break actually has reduced rear end damage in two situations i shift into neutral whenever i anticipate braking to a stop    the only thing i can think of is quick shifting during rapid acceleration do i let the rpm fall a little bit before shifting    seriously maybe i have some bad habits i dont recognize that will wreck an econobox
anyone know of a tuner in tampa that would tune a turbo shitbox
  you shouldnt be holding revs or your foot on the gas when upshifiting
  explain should i let revs fall a certain amount before i shift
  yes retard
my clear coat is peeling off if i buy some clear coat spray will i have to sand off the clear coat on the rest of the part or will spraying the parts without clear coat be enough the parts most affected are my hood and trunk
  70s corvette i have a shitload of hydraulic fluid for a leaky tractor
  okay i will try to be a better driver but if it doesnt work i will find you faggit
truck would not start/crank/click i switched the key to the run position then hotwired the starter it cranked and started immediately then i drove home    it will not crank or even click when turning the key it does start when hotwiring the starter the lights are bright the radio works the battery is less than a year old it reads 1257 volts how can find out whats wrong
  its clearly your ignition switch or ignition cylinder  your starter is always fed a hot and the solonoid finishes it in a space you cannot access so your start is working as intended
  wouldnt risk it certain hydraulic fluids have more in common with brake fluid if recall correctly
  yes if youre still on the gas youre burning clutch when you upshift
  it is a 2000 ford f250
  whati really want is an third gen rx7 know any problems with the c5 since thats as close as i can get to an fd
  you literally only have to bleed the caliper farthest from the master cylinder especially if you jack it up a little bit so its the high point as well
  not really once the frame or unibody in this case gets warped its pretty much impossible to get it back to original feel even if its technically sound
how do car companies know how many cars to ship to each country what do they do with the cars that arent bought
  ok
at lights idling  600 rpm  car is shaking like a motherfucker    i mean christ i know 4 bangers arent smooth but should i be worried
ay anyone know if the 2007 lexus is350 has hard points for a roof rack pic unrelated
  idling that low  lugging a 4 banger at idle poor thing
  they have whole departments of people to research how many cars are likely to sell and where
i wanna start doing some autocross eventually move up to more interesting forms of motorsport like hillclimb drift etc    what sort of car should i buy to start and learn on cheapest fwd shit box i can find or spend a little more to find a slightly less shit rwd car    is it worth spending the money or will i reck my starter car so badly anyway that it would be a big waste    or is autocross/drifitng a big fuckin meme and is offroading objectively better    any advice appreciated    cheers cunts
  miata desu
  checked plugs my 96 ford contour /mondeo did the same shit and would sometimes stall despite being auto1  i dont know if plugs would fix it because the car died of unrelated issues before i got around to changing them
i have a v6 new edge mustang that idles at 1000 rpm but will sometimes rev itself up to 1500 rpm without me touching it    i have a check engine with a code like intake manifold runner control stuck open dunno if this is relevant    what do br/o/s
  i have a check engine with a code like intake manifold runner control stuck open dunno if this is relevant  probably your cat or purge canister id get rid of them and stick it to the epa youll get the benefit of 20hp and sweet smell of freedom
  02 sensor is also rip so fuck the environment and fuel economy    cat could be giving me a rough idle i also am a stupid retart kid who threw a cai on so figured maybe thats whats throwing the code
  i have a check engine with a code  follow the code bro

 a/c is leaking oil and r134a   i diagnosed the compressor as the faulty part   mechanic charges 500 for replacement   jewing_intensifiesgif     how to get it done cheaper
  do it yourself
  how if i dont have the equipment  i could replace the compressor yes but i dont have the refrigerant or the machine to fill the ac
  and they said they wont fill empty acs and when you did something urself they wont fill it either
  you just summed it up anon  mechanic does have this equipment  mechanic legally captures and pays for disposal of residual gas  mechanic regasses your system  mechanic charges you for his time and the use of this equipment
  yes    but why cant i do the rest myself and they just regass the system  has anyone around here ever had a completely empty ac and the mech refused to refill it
    no i havent come across that specific problem ive replaced a compressor and dryer and had someone gas and leak check it for me
buy the new compressor from the local distributor if you want new it should be cheaper plus wrty
  already done that
  and had someone gas and leak check it  and thats exactly what i wanted to do  but none of the shops i asked would do that  guess ill have to take it as it is now
  yeah fair enough i only saw that added comment after i posted and its not something ive come across
  what if you just replace it then drive to another shop and tell em youve got an empty one to replace  i think people might be refusing you just to get you to pay for the full thing but thats me being paranoid of jewchanics as you should be
put a new one in and say you accidentally released it without knowing at another shop
  the problem is also i wont get the warranty unless i replace the dryer  i cant replace the dryer because missing tools fuck  shop will replace the entire heat exchanger  they claim it wont be leakproof
  this thing  into the left side of the heat exchanger
    this happened to me too  fucking ac shops are the biggest scammersthats why i learned everything i could about it to fix my own ac fuck those kikes now i know basically everything about refrigeration and i got cool ac    feels good
  who ya quotin
  but the equipment is so expensive
  me  greentext story
  no its not or it shouldnt be    first youll need ac gauges  cost me about 25 us pesos and the vacuum pump at around 150 bucks you will not need the pump if you got just a small leak in that case you can just do a top off
  i forgot to say that i did not buy the pump because i did the diagnosis with the gauges and everything was ok it was only low on refrigerant the gauges showed that a good amount of refrigerant was still present so i just did a top off its been like 3 years since i did that and all is good     i did have a problem with the thermostatic switch i bought a cheapo thermostat to do the testing for the air temp out of the vents it should cycle around 4c 
  thats rather cheap i have the same problem and got quoted 1100 the compressor alone is 800
itt maximum ripoff    op find another mechanic i did exactly this procedure compressor was fucked replaced compressor went to mechanic and got the system flushed vacced filled with oil  refridge 75 this was two years ago and the system is still ice fucking cold
    talk with a local refrigeration company and see if they will draw a vacuum and recharge for a lower cost    most local companies are willing to fudge the rules a little and have all of the equipment needed in their fleet trucks    an underpaid employee might be willing to help you out for 100 or so
  this   fuck that shop they are trying to scam you selling the whole package call some shops and ask around or just replace it yourself and drive to some shop and just tell them your ac seems to be low so they just fill up dont tell them about your replacement
    i just need to replace the compressor dont up sell me ill do it myself  replaces compressor  shrapnel filled drier bag and evaporator ko new compressor  why is this happening    you guys are fucking idiots
  thats actually not too bad chain store fag here new and even reman compressors cost 300 sometimes
  i did ac work myself there was a leakthat was simply impossible to find i heard these trucks have problems with the evaporators going bad so i replaced it and the receiver drier ac still works i got a cheapo harbor freight vacuum pump and ac gauge set took alot of time but the cost to fix it through an ac shop was just about 2k i did it for about 400 and it amazingly worked through the summer and fall i just filled it with ac pro
  op here  in my case i dont even think there are any shrapnels in the ac thus the evap and drier bag might just be fine   just the compressor is leaking oil
  if you google a/c system its more then just compressor make sure 100 it is that and replace take your time and do it right whole point of diy is to save money not make it worse
  how much does the pic related ebay turbo cost obvously chink shit just look at the size of the rotor joke of a power gains i know but i am just curious
  do you even
  yep  its made from two parts screwed together and at the point where they meet there is the leak
whats the best whip for converting into a book mobile actually wanting to make a mobile museum
honda crx
  used box / delivery truck like ups uses or school bus maybe
  a 90s white cargo van with serious rocker rust
  honestly if you have the skill and money to maintain it an old 90s winnebago would be perfect most of them are cheap because the interior and plumbing are shot but since you are gutting it and putting in bookshelves and maybe a reading chair or two it should be perfect
  perhaps something that is    mid engine  rear/awd   manual  supercharged
  
  youre thinking of rape van
  someone turned a delivery van into a mobile home could use one of those
  whats the best whip for converting into a book mobile  public libraries already exist and the administrators running them dont like competitors    eventually you run into the random crackhead that instructs their young daughter to jump up on your lap as youre sitting somewhere she grabs your hand and puts it in her crotch at that moment they take an incriminating picture you have to pay 5000 or else youll be accused of running the mobile exhibit as a way of meeting and touching children
  running the mobile exhibit as a way of meeting and touching children  i think youve rumbled ops master plan either that or fucking chickens
    i definitely do not want to fuck kids and honestly thank you for bringing up those points i thought being a mobile museum i could just operate during hours and at locations children frankly shouldnt be at but some peoples desparation to metoo someone anyone knows no bounds
i think i might want a trailer for this instead guys thanks for trying though
used schoolbus  duuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhh  paint it green  ive literally already seen like 5 of these
  some peoples desparation to metoo someone anyone knows no bounds    they even did the metoo to the invalid president george bush shortly before he died nov 30 2018 multiple women claimed the invalid and mentally woozy bush groped him they wanted to poison the last memories of that republican president
trucks of /o is making trruck driving a career worth it in 2018 and in the future asking because atm i work as a diesel mechanic for the ng 23 an hour and its become boring also because when i worked at a truckstop id hear drivers bitch n moan about elogs and def alot i already have some experience driving big vehicles mostly a hemmet and no social life plus driving semis has been a dream of mine since i was a kid which is why i became a mechanic to be around them and hauling equipment is the most enjoyable part of my job idk if its because i miss the hustle of working at a truckstop but anyway is trucking worth making a long term career out of
did you even try searching the catalog
  i mostly mean otr btw
  what the fuck do you think the thread i circled is about
52 mpg
  76 mpg
  how
95 mpg
  most bikes get above 50mpg unless its a 1000cc bike
  that would be cool if it had a turbo  sadly it doesnt so its pretty much wasted potential a non turbo diesel is pretty bad
  mine doesnt     i usually get 49 mpg city or highway same mpg
  it doesnt even have direct injection
  49 is good for a performance thumper
  250ccs  my current bike even gets 50mpg loaded up on the interstate cruising at 80
  all bikes in the thread are thumpers
  not performance thumpers    dat honda lean burn
784 mpg
  yeah but 76 mpg i want to be able to get 76 mpg at 80 my usual cruise speed im fucking jealous
  need a 2cyl for that  i get around 70mpg on my fz07 at 80mph
  50 mpg
  i got that on a 250cc dirtbike that didnt even go 80mph
  260 mpg
  that thing probably sucks ass to ride    as a middle class white person in a first world country i can afford to only get 4050 mpg out of my dirtbike in exchange for a decent riding experience
  its a multifuel military bike
whats the worst mpg you can get in a modernish vehicle
  610 mpg is easily doable on a track with a turbo h6/i6/v6
  i will take two
  bugatti veyron is 10mpg combined  jeep cherokee trackhawk is 13mpg all performance suvs drink fuel alot
  based xr
  i get about 2mpg average in my excursion towing anything more than a camper
cant be bothered to figure mpg
  3500 size trucks get 1314mpg
  probably you loose all that when you need to replace that custom made low order injection system

targa tops will never make a comeback  why even live if you cant get a quality targa top sports car    inb4 mx5 rf  no power and too expensive compared to the normal version
because a full convertible is objectively better
  but convertibles are for women and old people
  i like how a targa can maintain an attractive shape wheras a convertible doesnt have a real shape in the back half
  and people who are secure in their masculinity
  t miata driver
dont corvettes have targas
  corvettes the 911 and the exige probably other obscure cars that are targa
  yea but those are pretty expensive i think we need something in the brz price range with a targa something affordable when purchased brand new
  brz price range  without a full roof  so targa kei car
  targa kei car  could be cool something like a modern civic del sol would be nice
honda s660
  mx5 rf is not a targa it has a mechanised top for some reason
  honda s660  god machine that is japanese only
  they have the rollbars in the rear head rests which is why targa died
because targa tops are gay    ttops are better
  they do give better air flow to let your mullet flutter in the wind
  i have a targa top vehicle and they suck without some aftermarket targe brace  never heard of the flex  they leak
  targa tops absolutely ruin whatever car they leave their mark on the mk3 supra for example not only does it turn the chassis into a wet noodle it adds 100lbs to the cars already hefty curb weight     im glad targa tops are dead i hope they never come back
  they are sold in countries that japan likes though
  the problem with a lot of them was that they actually didnt maintain their shape and the top flew off at high speed
  why even live if you cant get a quality targa top sports car    modify one   oh you cant be arse to learn how and spend the time fabricating   an hero it is

  barely over 10000km a year  why are people like this allowed to post on /o/ they may as well be bus riders with that low mileage
  commuting milage / pleasure milage
  what is the point youre trying to make
  that the actual yearly mileage figure is irrelevant someone may take public transport to work and all their mileage may be simply driving for the sake of driving which is the most /o/ thing of all
  busrider spotted
  no i dont do public transport cope harder faggot
  huuurrr if you dont drive 80 000 km a year youre not a true car enthusiast    see  and kill yourself
  t busrider or scooter cuck
  if you dont drive at the very least 20000km a year you are not an auto enthusiast you belong on /n/ with the rest of the busriders and cyclists
  if you measure it in km you are not an auto enthusiast

daily reminder that you will never be a japanese teenager in the 90s
  that pic isnt a teenager either
  why the hell does half of the automotive community have a hardon for being a japanese buisnessman in the 80s its not like youd be able to afford the halo cars of that time back then anyway nor would you have any time to enjoy them
at least you were a american teenager
  its not like youd be able to afford the halo cars of that time  actually you could 80s japan was bubble economy as fuck everybody had more money than they knew what to do it thats why all the good anime came out of that era since everybody and their dog could dump millions into fucking ovas
as much as i love japanese cars of that era i dont romanticize it like some faggots you
same exact shit happened in north america californa etc    its just the cars that are different    get over it
  even if i was i somehow wouldve missed all the cool shit that was going on a mile from my house
  daily reminder to go fuck yourself for reminding me that we dont have shitboxes like those in most of europe op
  pants up to chest  why was this a thing again
  this being a teenager in the 90s was pretty overrated except that used cars were very cheap because of the 80s boom beyond the fond memories i have attached to my shitbox escort gt and some of the music i have to say that being an adult is way better
  tfw spent all my teenage years playing wow  ive never been a teenager
  the peak of human civilization was 19831992 japan its been downhill since then and was pretty shitty prior to that too
  i had a shitty 80s integra then also a aw11 i thought i was cool
  how do you even know how good it was when youve never even been there let alone in that time period are you a brainwashed weeaboo cuck
  and if i was i would probably be wishing i was an american teenager in the 50s its all perspective anon
  ive been there 3 times gaylord sorry nobody likes the shitty hell society we live in now unless you are a libertarian or faggot /pol/ poster the same fags who romanticize late 19th century europe
  it was all financed on bad loans
  meh    fuck knows hard pass from me
  rather be a teen in the 90s in merica cause 60s and 70s cars were dirt cheap and so was gas
  no argument there but they still had money then
  you mean the 80s by the mid 90s the whole economic collapse was evident
  who fucked you in the ass
  even earlier it started in late 91 but was in full force by 1993 the stagnation really hit in the 2000s which decimated the gt/sports market
  the whole idea of wanting to do 12 hours a day of school then more than that in secondary school to them commit suicide as an adult due to work related stress and depression
  cry more nigger
  why are you in this thread then stfu and move on
  no you i have no tears its 906 on a monday and im still at work to pay for my shit suck my dick trust fund ny jew homo
i wish i was a jap teenager in the 90s too  
  90 this guy drives gay ass charger or shitty base model 3 series owned by dad
  so why ask me a question id be moved on without that
could have been a japanese businessman in the 1980s or early 1990s  would have had a slick modified rx7  would have raced around the crowded touge at night  would have hung out near the wangan and talked cars with my tomodachi  would have enjoyed the pure otaku era before normalshits took it over  would have had a qt jpgf    instead entered the adult world fresh into the worst economic climate since the great depression  cars have stopped being considered cool and therefore the new fad is to take everything fun about them away  hypergamy in full swing worldwide gf shortage  entire decade thus far will be known for nothing beyond shit like identity politics and feminism in gaming   lie down to sleep each night and dont really care if i get back up
  good because i would have never be able to afford then what i got now
  hello brother
  i rather be a rich yuppie in 90s japan so i could actually afford their toptier cars
watch this bbc video        the guy was a successful yuppie in 80s japan then he lost it all
  that and they were buying the fuck out of lot of american companies at the time
  this is why in back to the future there was a easter egg about japan occupying the us because at the time japan owned a majority of our debt
  this made me depressed
was offered a thousand dollar rebate plus title/fees covered if i buy a 2018 mazda3 touring from the mazda dealership near me     should i go for it test drove it was pleased
  its a good car but an older model now are you going to regret not getting the new one
  also a memorandum title is like 6 what fees are they talking about if theyre talking about a zero interest financing type situation plus 1000 of thats a good deal id have to see the numbers probably its not nearly as good a deal as you can get though
  ive got a 2018 sedan and its a solid car if you can wait a year or two then id opt for the 2019/2020
  if this pleased you then you need to drive more things
  the 25l looks good to me desu theres probably a reason theyre offering rebates i dont think id utilize a 25 2019 any different
  ive driven a lot of things the 3 is a good car particularly with the more powerful engine
  title and doc fees im financing through my credit union and theyre still offering the rebate     better than the civic rav4 camry corolla id almost put it at the same level of comfort as the new accord but cheaper and funner its the best option for a newer car they also called me and offered an extended 7 year warranty just now to try to seal the deal
  they also called me and offered an extended 7 year warranty just now to try to seal the deal  that sounds desperate but id take it 7 years from now youre far passed paid off and can probably trade in for something newer
touring you mean theyre giving you 1k off the 26k mazda3    this is quite possibly the dumbest thing to buy tell them you want a base model or they can fuck off its not worth it to pay an extra 10k for led headlights and whatever the fuck else
  the mazda3 hops from 18k to 21k or 20k in this case i guess for more hp and amenities
  pardon 18k20k or 1921 without discount
so figure out vslue of  docs and fees  7 year warranty what is covered and what is deductible  1000    as soon ss the 2019 hits the lots the 2018s will be heavily discounted id want a pretty heavy discount on a 2018 upper trim levels cost them little extra to make id want loaded model at base model sticker or like 5k off you figure it out dont be in a hurry ask to see their invoice cost pay no more than that at the most they get a kick back for selling it the invoice price is kind of a lie
  you can get splan pricing for 100 and get a better deal than that
vehicles that make you lose respect for their drivers as human beings pic related
  hummer h2s are officially now more respectable than jeeps
  i dont get why the eternally based wrangler triggers some people so hard    its an offroad car and youre in a grocery store parking lot    yeah and i cant drive my car to the grocery store the wrangler has dabbed on all haters for decades and will continue to do so
  t 17 year old girl
  t memeboy in a classy used 2003 bmw econobox
  anything from this brand
  this specific car i can only assume this faggot browses this site
why are jeeps hated so much ive never owned or even been inside one but jeep drivers are usually the least of my concerns for people who will try to kill me on the road
  some autists on this board despise anything to do with offroad is my guess at this point
  tell us your story anon  what has he done to you
  its no worse than these faggot track cars in the grocery store parking lot
  because you cum guzzling faggots drive so fucking slow whenever theres along clusterfucked line of traffic theres always bound to be a fucking stacey ina fucking wrangler causing it theyre fucking annoying barbie toys      its mostly their drivers
  whats wrong with it    id take one of those over a neverreliable range rover any day
  they suck at everything but offroading but are still loads of fun and the number one panty dropper for girls who arent fat and also any dog owner
  i like jeeps and maybe its because i live in a beach town that i cant go a mile without seeing at least ten wranglers daily but theyre really starting to feel generic ridiculous amount of jeep club convoys in the summer too even seen goofy guys reaching their hand all the way out the window to wave kinda funny    the only dream i have is that because overlanding and jeeps are getting so popular maybe other auto makers will consider bringing new 4x4s to the us
what kind of headlights do you use for your car  i have to replace one and i am wondering if i should replace two just so they are exactly the same i want to keep the stock yellow because the white lights that assholes use are blinding
remember when this was considered a cool company
  honestly no
  maybe 40 years ago
  ive never been black so
  fpbp
  you mean when they were datsun
  i said cool not boomer shit
  the only thing cool was the overrated r33 or r34 i forget which one was more praised but they were both shit
  nope  always been cheap shit since they began
lol only blacks drive their cars now an altima if they are doing well and a v6 altima if they are working a nice 95 job
  now post the other one
  when i was younger i really liked the early 2000s maximas for some reason
hey i got a great idea a good way to bring back our heritage and the sportyness of our cars is to give all of our sedans and suvs a cvt transmission the enthusiasts will love it
theyve been shit since this happened
cool    the only thing cool about nissan is their terrible sales report it should be more like ice cold but shit brands get what they plan for    
hey br/o/thers im 18 years old and a highschool dropout and im really passionate about racing and motorsporting can anyone give me a few tips on how to make it to professional level circuit racing this is my only chance in life and im going to take it thanks for helping me
  highschool dropout
  get a gokart racing license work your way up into higher series  idk if there is another way for circuit racing
have you been karting since age 5  if no its too late
sadly motorsport is extremely expensive without sponsors an 18 year old dropout has no chance in hell to compete professionally sponsor are never going to sponsor someone who has no experience too your best bet is to look for lowcost shitbox racing or something to a find out if youre actually good enough to make racing your career and b hope you get noticed so you can move on up to actual sponsored racing
  kill yourself and try again next life
  be rich and just buy a seat some where
  first youre gonna want to at least get your ged then youd probably want to enter a trade school for mechanics or something chances are slim youll become a big racer to the point where it supports you
  are you independantly wealthy no sorry you cant be a professional race driver only the best make money at it and you dont get to be the best unless you have experience which costs a lot of money
front engined porsches  rear engined porsches
mid engined porsches  all
the only reason to get a porsche is the rear engine
  popup headlights  80s styling  inspired the rx7 fc  still the 944 is my favourite porsche
      what is the point of this thread
  whats the point of anything dude whoa
  ok so youre a fucking idiot got it
   the rx7 fc  now i see whats going on
  surprises me the 944 and 928 are popular but the 968 seems unheard of
  probably because its ugly as dogshit     just my opinion though
  this this was literally the car that turned me on to porsche until i realized all the other porsches were cookie cutter uncreative lawyer transport who didnt want to buy a bmw
  these are ugly as fuck fr poser porsches are shit
  correct
its not a porsche if it has more than 3 doors
  
bmw v engines  bmw inline sx engines        porsche fmr cars with that planned v10  porsche fmr cars  all
  is that a mercedes
  filename
  s65
  yes
  yup mercedes s65 in collab with bmw
  poor mans porsches
  tfw no s85 e30
  makes valid point over arguing opinions  calls him idiot  if that aint the kettle
dealership installs its own license plate frame and emblem    why is this allowed and why dont people remove them
  people dont care
  but i did remove mine replaced the dealers front plate with a nice looking black and gray metal american flag and replaced the rear plate frame with a nice blank rubbery plastic one
dealership installs a sticker
  dealership installs its own license plate frame and emblem  im changing mine as soon as i get my plates fuck them why the fuck would i drive around advertising them fuck no
  not installing your own decal before private sale  come on
so many cars in the uk have window stickers advertising the dealership
  tfw my car still has the dealerframe on it  one day il stop being a lazy nigger and remove it      they are basically giving you justification to go shoot up the dealership if they put a sticker on your paint
  remove sticker  paint under is less faded
make sure to put in contract that all dealer marking stickers etc will be removed  they arent removed
fill out contract  dealer states i cant anything to the car  go home remove plates add a sticker and mud guards  fucking faggots
  leasing your car
  yeah that will show them
rivetted dealer badges  truly the stuff of nightmares surely this will only promote rusting
  through my bank
  fucking why
  wanting to be stuck with a depreciating asset that needs 15k in repairs after 4 years
  cant do any mods to your car  cant track your car  can only put so many miles on your car per year  if you get any scratches on your car you have to pay for it  why
  ive had my shitbox for 6 years and havent even put half that into it including purchase price and its not exactly what comes first to most peoples minds as a bastion of reliability
  you wont do any of that with a brand new 60k car anyways 20k miles a year is plenty and they rarely care about scratches and dents      well thats a shitbox its a little different when you start looking at 50k cars with 355 tires that cost several grand to replace
  did u lease a car
  nope bought with cash in full
  well thats good then
  if you get any scratches on your car you have to pay for it    depends honda takes care of it and in the even of a total loss
  go to dealership to buy a car  say i want this car but do not want a dealership sticker  salesman immediately looks at my clothes to see if i have any branding on my clothes  do not so not a hypocrite  get car without the sticker
  who cares fuck them you are buying the car with your money youre the paying customer they are not
buy a shitbox accord from a porsche dealership  plate frame is stainless steel with porsche logo on the bottom    i kept it this thing is fucking nice
    that still wouldnt make you a hypocrite since your clothing wouldnt have an emblem of a 3rd party store
  why is this allowed  its their fucking car until you buy it  why dont people remove them  normies most people actually dont care personally i remove them but for those who keep it it helps understanding where the car comes from and as a result what kind of person the driver is
  that makes you look like such a pathetic poorfag though
  nah people will think thats his beater and has porsche in garage
  yeah no its not as bad a as a honda dealer frame on a porsche but still not great it just shows how desperate you were to get financing
  in car crew  car crew has a banner for all the cars  one member sells his gts25t  it still has the banner on it  new owner likes it and doesnt remove it  mfw there is some random skyline driving around with our banner on it
  that would only be the case when buying a new fca shitmobile buy a low mileage honda or toyota dont be a fuckwit
  this those stick on plastic emblems arent nearly as bad as stickers just get some dental floss and goo b gone and its like it was never there but paper stickers fuck up the paint
  i bet its illegal for europoors to frame the plates on their cars
  that didnt happen with either of the two cars i have bought from dealers things must be different where you are
im not letting a dealership put a sticker or badge on my next car theyre not paying me they dont get to advertise
  fun fact   when i was 16 i went full retard and for shits and giggles found the ceo of mattel and sent an email basically thanking him for keeping the company going as hot wheels was a big part of my childhood and now my kids childhoods   he ended up emailing me back and thanking me and sent me a few hotwheels decals and a hotwheels license plate holder    it was wild i gotta say
  be a man  make them remove the shit  so hard
  chucks discount shitbox emporium has the same brand prestige as even something like nike
  when youre so obsessed with your car that you get angry about this  but you still give your car to the stealership
rivets it to the plate
  go to car wash  they install a sticker of their logo in your back window
you can tell them you wont buy unless it is removed
  mines adhesive but its also 14 years old so taking it off would leave this disgusting glue residue
used car seller has text stamped black metal plates but no white paint
  buying from a stealership   ever
  it actually is  t runs dealer plate
  it is and thats a good thing
why is this allowed  because its not legally forbidden  why dont people remove them  the vast majority of people dont care me included i also dont give a shit about vanity plates or indeed the color of my car when shopping
  how so
  my accord needed less than a grand in repairs after like a decade of ownership
  as long as it doesnt obscure the registration its fine    t uk
notice the dealership emblem on my rear plate is a sticker  peel it off  different garages name and information underneath  i can appreciate the companies jewing each other like this but please dont use my car as a billboard
not caring about some shitty decals ruining the paint on your trunk    just ask the sales guy to leave theirs off i literally just did this two weeks ago and it wasnt a problem
took off the dealer plate cover and put on my own cringeworthy plate cover  still have their sticker and theres faded paint from the dealer sticker that it was bought from new    aaaaaaaah
  ok that just looks bad you werent supposed to add your own stickers until you removed the dealer sticker
  please drive into a concrete wall at speed
  modern hondas and toyotas have their fair share of pretty serious issues if you get a used car with these issues youre going to be fucked its not the 90s anymore fuckwit       yes and some people get a million miles out of a 100 civic that doesnt mean there isnt people stuck with tranny replacements at 30k miles
  is ur nan ok with what youve done to her shopping cart m8
  implying my x brand jeans from macys have macys embroidered on them  clothes tags and size stickers are exactly the same as the page sized sticker on the inside of the window of a new car    commit suicide
  dealership installs its own license plate frame and emblem  i left it on my new car front and back because i actually like that dealership i ignored the two closer stealerships to my home and drove to that other city to buy the car there

  we have cookies
  i gave up on adventure mode better to just host a lfg lobby
  we have free vbucks

  okay im in
do you buy premium
yep car wouldnt be happy at all with anything lower than 91
only for my cars that need it
i have a canned tune so yea
  yes always premium and alcohol free whenever possible
  only when the station runs out of regular and mid and gives it to you at the regular price
im starting a job soon possibly in a heavy rigid truck and have been putting off a job because im deathly afraid of messing up my absolute biggest worries are turns and not braking soon/hard enough im constantly afraid of mounting the curb hitting a car hitting a pole etc while going around a turn is this a common fear how can i overcome this ive got no experience other than a few hours the day i got my license and for the most part i did well even on turns i did have his assistance even though he wasnt meant to be assisting but yeah
on top of that when i did my test/license i was in something this size        my worries come from the thoughts of driving something of this size  
  looking back they seem to be the same size pretty much i mean the really long trucks im not qualified to drive anything articulated so im not even sure if my worries are justified but basically the length of an articulated truck but rigid
  common fear if you had not enough driving lessons how to overcome it drive go slowly get confidence and then you will notice you drive faster and better with each new route you can invest in a pc steering wheel with some big ass turning angle like g27 or so and play a bit of ets or else and experiment if you have no access to the truck in rl before going to job most important thing is to remember this truck wont stop easily so dont go over the limit hell even drive a bit under the limit to get the feel of the cunt rember that unless a big intersection you will have to use both lanes when turning so you wont rape the curb all these are just generics i know but really there is no other way to get confidence than to actually start driving if you need more lessons just catch with your instructor maybe and drive a bit more before applying to a job license is just a paper skill is something else rember that    t bus driver
  i actually have a g27 and ets haha i might reinstall it and try it out when i was doing the test i never went over the limit since the thought of plowing into anything or not stopping enough or anything horrifies me to no end usually was under the limit but the truck was so underpowered it struggled to go over 30 up a shallow hill i think the first day is just them showing me the ropes so i could be fine they have to legally teach you what you gotta do when you get a job driving trucks here even if youre qualified to on top of that its illegal for employers to rush truck drivers here from what ive heard so thats also great i suppose cheers for the tips mate gonna be a hassle getting the wheel set up but probably worth it
  not sure about the law in your country but for example in mine  poland i can drive an articulated bus on just a bus licence without a trailer licence as long as the articulated part of the bus is integral for example you cant disconnect them and the engine is in the artuculated part so for example i can drive this  but not this  since the engine wasnt in the trailer part of the bus but on the main chassis
  how did you get a job with no exp  and to answer your question just drive to make you feel safe if you feel youre going too fast then slow down  idk dude play some ets2 lol
  bro first few weeks of learning the ropes and possibly driving with a codriver who already knows the route you will have to learn the route and nobody will put you alone to oh well see these are the stops find yourself a way around maybe buy a gps we dont care unless the company you apply for is shite take your time there they cant rush you yeah totally worth it  i was learning in omsi 2 simulator along with my regular driving lessons and it helped a ton  mostly with the feeling of the size the turn radius and how much space i actually have to have to do even a simple left or right turn into a single lane two direction road
  most likely like me  there are companies in my hometown which will pay for your licence and once you get the licence they will hire you spot on train further and you can be a professional driver drawback is you have to sign like a 2 year contract or so if you break the deal you have to pay up for the licence out of your pocket not bad a deal in my opinion as it is so fucking hard to get on the road with no experience so it is basically a free experience for your cv and some kind of a starter
  connections      ah its not a bus but i think some sort of delivery meeting with the friend who helped me with it tomorrow to discuss everything i think the biggest difference between a simulator and the actual thing is the size of the wheel much harder to turn irl but i get what you mean thanks 
i started driving my companys straight job about six months ago my biggest thing was hill starts and the 13 foot total height the hill starts were ridiculously easy and the height has not fucked me over yet    does your truck have air brakes
  not sure any of the details id imagine it would since they generally do around here
  some trucks that come to my shop dont have them    you just have to feel them is all they work decently well and you downshift too the truck i drive is just under the weight you need a cdl for    good luck man dont stress yourself out too much worrying about it sometimes it is better being out on the road than being behind a desk
  lie on resume thay you have couple months of experience  at least thats what i did  after 3 months i started posting my real resume
which 2007/ cadillac cts engine is most reliable

  kymco movie 125
is it a bad idea to buy a used one off of craigslist
honda zoomer    yes
  not if youre looking for a honda helix those things are indestructible and have been around since like the 80s
  the fucking honda wave they are built like a fucking rock and can go up to 120 kmph
what are your thoughts on modern retro cars
into the trash they go
japanese do it well mitsuoka subaru sambar dias etc
  japanese do it well  mitsuoka    i do like their cars but man they got some misses
  true but the ones based on the k11 march sold well and doesnt look bad irl    daihatsu is also big on retro
  /thread    if they just used the same body design and used modern materials and drive train they would sell like crazy but they try to modernize the classic look and it just ends up like shit
  they cant use the same body design because of safety regulations    some do still look great though pic related
  this  they always end up looking trashy and/or wierd
  figaro came out almost 30 years ago though these conversions dont really have to worry about safety shit i dont think
  except japan has no safety regulations
      the modern mass produced chassis they usually base these retro cars do have safety regulation stuff because they are sold in other markets too
  looks like a mix of a classic mini with a generic ecobox
  yeah they do japan is one of the countries that follow uns car safety stuff
  its modern miata based so i wouldnt worry too much regardless your gonna die if you get tboned by a semi going 60
  is this a body kit for pt cruiser nace
  its actually a hand made car from a spanish company called hurtan  the chassis is from a renault clio lol
i wish automakers would do it more often and not that shitty neutered crap like the pt cruiser or hhr im talking about stuff like pic related that actually looks retro
i like them but they wont have feel of 1920 car driving
  yeah theyre a hundred years better in feeling
  no  cars feel soulless today  back then you needed understandings of mechanism to drive it
  looks like someone has never driven a modern gm econobox
  one of these in 3 door are for sale near me for 4k should i do it i dont wanna die in a crumpled kei car wreck
garbage the 5th gen mustang is the ugliest
   do you really want that feeling really
  dam bruh shoulda just used da cruiser
  do it faggot
love the new jimny
  why do people think that shittysoul cars never had a soul stop having nostalgia for an age that never existed  needed understandings of mechanism to drive it  yeah thats why a lot of old ads targeting women by saying how easy to drive they were some even saying your kids could drive it back then just about every gas station had a mechanic because the cars were so shitty
  yes why not not as weekend car or daily driver but me time car   its good once in while to go back to simplicity   travelling with 100yr old technology enjoying night under sky out of city having whisky
  monkey wouldnt understand
  apparently understands enough to bitch about modern cars though
  im looking thru his videos which one was this youtube search doesnt show anything
      its from his website
the california and the first and second incarnations of the modern retro mustangs are the only ones i think got it right
  wheel well proportions are all wrong
  oh hell ya thanks man
    i want this so bad if i won the lottery id lsx swap it and fly it to japan to have it kitted
    these two and the previous mustang generation look great mercedes sls was inspired by a retro look too
didnt see a greentext thread so here we go    be 25 yo frenchfag  finally decide to get my driving license  ask mom for 5 minutes behind the wheel of her car so i can get a feel for the clutch and brakes  we go to some empty street inna commercial zone nearby in the evening  get behind wheel  start car get in first gear ease in the clutch like a boss  get car to crawl ez pz  slow down stop a bit abruptly but whatever  first time behind the wheel btw  so far zero mistakes made apparently  few more tries perfect the braking  decide to try one last time  start ez stop ez  somehow fuck up with pedals stall the engine  whatever no biggie  engine decides it wont start anymore  what sounds like starter motor spinning like crazy but not engaging the flywheel or something  permanent electric motor whining but engine not cranking  have to unplug battery ground to stop it  have to call a tow truck    and that was the story how i somehow broke my moms car  to be fair  its a fiat  and it has hta shitty start/stop tech bullshit
pédé va
new car guy with some questions  what does it mean when someone says ive got a fully built motor some people say they just put new rods and pistons in it but others say they do that and head studs main bolts fuel pump injectors and much more what actually is involved when you build an engine what do you need at the bare minimum to say your engine is built vs fully built  also the same about a transmission what does it mean when someone says theyve built their trans how do you make your trans stronger  sorry guys websites and youtube isnt clear on this thought you would put it in simple terms for me
  i guess plastidipping wheels and cone filter is considered building desu
no set meaning for built could be new rods could be acid bathed and everything balanced and replaced
  that it was built/changed to handle the power its producing so if its now making 600hp its built to handle that fine
  built just means you changed something on the engine internals when someone says they have a fully build engine they mean theyve changed everything from the crankshaft rods pistons camshafts valves and probably had their head ported and polished
  this if someone says built i always imagine sleeved ready to go big numbers
  some companies make aftermarket heads/camshafts that are reinforced and designed to be stronger than what came factory for examples check out 4piston racings website
  wow a useful thread thanks op yes a built motor can mean partially built or fully built as stated normally fully built motors are on high hp cars such as 500whp less and you can probably bet its not fully built but just partially because you dont always have to fully build it
  important to note that while the proper meaning has been discussed here in most irl situations at car shows and organized meets the word built doesnt mean dick people will tell you their wheelsandwrap car is built because it has a different intake manifold or a fancier turbo  dont take anyone who just says built motor seriously if they dont have any further explanation  also ignore any car with a fancy audio system 9/10 times they are just there for attention and have nothing interesting to say
  if the engine is fully built anything short of new wear parts top end parts rods and pistons make it an outright lie a lot of engines come with an adequately strong crank for any sensible power goal from the factory so a crank is not necessary in all cases for fully built
  fully built  should mean all all major motor parts such as   rods  piston  crank  bearings  studs  hone  deck  rings  etc  injectors and pump dont have anything to do with building the engine i would just ask for receipts if buying and ignore anyone just yapping away at a car event   built trans manual  upgraded sychnros  different gears  or drag trans swap  auto  stall  upgraded internals on auto springs clutch packs etc
  sleeved  what kind of garbage cars are you looking at you dont need to sleeve good engines
  a thread with an actual question this doesnt seem right
  sorry not everybody has titanium 1000k super car
  you literally only need to sleeve cars with shit ass garbage cylinders are you a teenager  the only reason to sleeve a car is to hide damage or because it was overbored aka tiny as fucking fuck then modified or you run a boosted diesel
  or engines with an open deck and shitty thin factory sleeves like an n54
yo my fucking sti is a piece of shit and keeps having to be put in the shop every month i had to get a new steering rack camshaft sensor and had a piston misfire its 2017 what should i get /o/
  a pickup truck if you want something thats quicker to 60
    lemon law it and get a golf r civic type r or a focus rs
sti  i bet you live in massachusetts faggot
  big dick too
  whyd you have to get a new steering rack did the hydraulics overheat and fuck it up
  you could get a used s4 or m4 or a lexus rcf yes its heavy
  while you were out vaping  we were shitposting  while you were out picking up groceries from whole foods  we were wrenching on our shitboxes    you knew the memes and still bought a meme car  and now you have the audacity to ask us for help
  lemon law for sure id get my money back and get something like a corolla if you dont want issues with your car probably safer you dont have something with a whole 300 horsepower anyway    or be a man wrench that shit and hoon it every fucking day
  subaru steering racks love to leak    if not the racks the pumps have the worst quality seals ever and cost 400700 to replace so its not out of the realm of possibility    id just get a golf r or ctr both have pretty damn good reliability reports focus rs so so good option if youre not going to mod it crazy
  op youre not like the other subarufags you cool  there is hope for you    spoilerfuck obnoxious subaru homosexuals/spoiler
  i had to get a new steering rack  this is where i knew you are a larping retard    you dont even own an sti
  bait
  yeah i ask because i have an 18 and the steering wheel at low speeds sometimes sounds like darth vader breathing might be an oring seal but it came like this from factory brand new so idk if its normal
  same here 18 completely normal    keep in mind this is basically a 90s car in a recent year shell nothing new about it
  post your sti or this is bait
  shouldve gotten the evo op i know you considered it
how are traffic laws in your city   here they block euro3 diesels in the winters weekends but i can drive with an euro0 with lpg/cng kit no problems
  you can drive what ever you want here i saw a guy driving a gas powered skateboard with a plastic chair taped to it driving down the road the other day
diesel  lpg kit
  was he vaping and blasting jack johnson by any chance
  here they block euro3 diesels in the winters weekends but i can drive with an euro0  what are you even saying retard
im bored of my mustang and wanna trade it in ive been looking at the fiat spider is it any good
its like a miata but slower
i have an nd miata essentially the same car with a naturally aspirated engine instead of a turbo  the car is fucken great man not even being a fan boi i didnt even like miatas before i got this car driving it is so much fun its so lightweight so you always feel like your going fast braking is excellent handling is some of the best you can get under 40k also having a convertible is cool too drive majority of time top down random people wave at me try to talk to me    10/10 would recommend to anyone that wants a fun car      i also have been in mustang gt 2017 camaro ss 2012 ford lighting and some heavy modded cars    so i have been in some pretty quick cars      i can say that the miata is much funner than those    if your going to get an 124 get the abarth btw
  its not even that great yeah the mx5 feels like its floating and you can toss that bitch all over the place but it really just doesnt have any balls however the updated 2019 motor probably gives it just enough extra power to make it enjoyable     as far as the fiat lol just dont
itt manlets everywhere
  drive majority of time top down random people wave at me try to talk to me    tfw the idea of other people looking and trying to talk to while being seen by everybody at stops with the top down give me the autism     and i really want this car
  rf miata
  rf is butt ugly and not worth the extra weight added   unpopular opinion
i really wish i could fit comfortably in a miata but i just cant i need a slightly bigger miata for someone over 6 feet tall
  miata chassis with a fiat engine which is indestructible if you actually maintain it   fuck yeah dont except it to be faster than a mustang but the fun comes in other forms
  i hate attention like this but love the flashy fun cars one reason i love to have dark tints
  you can easily tune it to go up to 220 at the wheels
im thinking of buying a sporty everyday car because i cant daily drive my 570s
no sporty starts at 9 seconds this is /o/ benchracer central
anything under 10 is pretty decent in real life
  so with a wrx sti im expected to be faster than 80 of the cars on public roads
  even 6 to 60 will beat most cars on the road
  maybe in 1995
  so basically under 7 to beat most boremobiles
  not surprised the hondas are faster but its pretty funny to see the 4bangy altima is faster too
  moms fit is quicker than my dads brz lololololol i guess my mom should fuck my dad not the other way around
  the brz has a terrible auto transmission 90 of owners have the much faster manual cars
  regardless its a car with 12 less hp and 400 more lbs thats pretty funny
  bread on hood for 570s please   why has nobody else asked this    if you are asking because of the sti yeah its plenty quick and if fuel costs arent an issue for you it would be a great practical and quick daily
  i just assumed the whole premise of the thread was a shitpost making fun of benchracers    is a 060 in 47 seconds considered fast for an everyday car  of course it is but idiots here will argue that its not so op made this thread
  my car can do 060 in 45 seconds and i dont consider it to be particularly fast especially when everyone and their aunt has a mustang or camaro which can do it in like 39/40s
  nothing is considered fast on /o/
anything under 7 is quick  anything under 5 is fast  anything under 4 is face melting
  im thinking of buying a sporty everyday car  why do ameridiots think straight speed is the most important for sporty cars
  because it is
im a french conaisseur and drive a beat up reno 5 turbo with slighly raised wastegate pressure  mon ami with his 09 sti cant keep up  and whats worse slid off the road twice trying to catch up no damage to the car luckily    im terribly sorry but 47 is only fast if the year is 1955
  underaged b
    this is it by reasonable standards
anything under 10 is fast   top cars start from below 5 seconds   i mean this is /o/ so its full of playboys who ride around in lamborghinis and bugattis but this is how it is for us peasants
  anything under 10 is fast   by no ones standards is 9 seconds fast
fucking normies  where you all coming from
  it totally is though not something insane but its considered a faster car
  99s  see ya losers
anything more than 2 seconds is slow
  its absolutely not no one in the world is going to back you up on this 9s was slow 50 years ago
  i consider 5 to be the start of performance cars those cars that arent just economy boxes that start to sacrifice things for performance
  what the fuck are you talking about im talking about normal people and normal driving   jesus christ just look at the times of ordinary cars priced up to around 30000 euros   midtier models will have around 150 hp which translates to 89 seconds
  then thatd be considered average and not fast right
  normal people dont really think like that theres slower and faster cars faster ones start below 10 seconds generally
  a reasonable explanation of speed by /benchracer/ generalhmmm
  if 8 seconds is average then how is 10 seconds fast
  lol look at this my touge fag enjoy that shitbox and keep dream
  yuros   theres your explanation   look at this   that altima is 20000  in yurop that would be a 15l diesel with an 11 second 060 time  the average american cars is just faster
youre not going to get a real answer just test drive a shit ton of cars and see for yourself everyone is going to have different opinions go form your own opinion
  060 is a misleading anyway a wrx will struggle to shake off an ep3 type r despite being nearly a full second faster from a standing start because of the difference in powerband and awd vs fwd
  oh always thought the normal one was that slow
  this but for me its under 8  69 and under is fast  79 and over is slow
  in city sure  but on faster roads its prettt bad
so im not much of a car expert but i had the splash guard on the underside of the front of my car come off today to my knowledge i know its not a super crucial part but how long should i go without it might be another week before i can do anything for it    this is what the part looks like in case im retarded and this isnt a splash guard
its a fender liner a week should be fine hell even a year but im a bit irresponsible
its called a fender liner when you ask for a replacement its probably not the best to drive without one for an extended period of time because during the winter the salty melt can make its way to the wires plugins and other sensitive areas that arnt being protected by the liner anymore salt gets inside any way but now theres direct access also rocks and shit can chip up the wires and inside the fender
  another thing i should add is they are relatively easy to install you could probably save a couple bucks if you just buy the liner panel trim clips and some screws and do it yourself
  thats the kind of thing i was worried about but should i be ok for about a week like   said or am i more exposed than i thin
  nah if you can get it resolved within a few weeks youll be golden
  alright thank you anons    this car needs to last me so im glad this wasnt something that will fuck me over if not fixed now very glad to know i can get by for a few weeks
  those things are piss easy to put in and like others have said you should be fine without one for a short while
this tiny country with only like 500k people has a shitload of mountains choke full of lithium and graphite and they refuse to allow anyone to mine it since mountains are sacred to them  how long until the electric car cabal forces the us to declare humanitarian war on them
fuck bhutans got some mean touge
theres plenty of that shit in australia and china tho
when the number of spokes is not divisible by the number of lugs
do you mean to say without having a remainder    as long as a lug exists spokes can be divided by number of lugs    a five spoke design    5 lugs 5/5  1  4 lugs 5/4  125  5 lug 5/5  10
  a lug is a lug you cant say theres half a lug
  tj henry yoshi
  so are you saying a lug is absolute that if you break the lug in half it wont be a lug anymore    or will that be in its own category of not a complete lug
  obviously because it no longer functions as one
  when the pcd lines up with the spokes
this is fucking stupid
  lugs are quantized
4 or 7 spokes
  this is visually pleasing
5/4
  this one has 5 lugs
these    some of the best looking stockers ive ever seen also who cant love older bmw/euro wheels
having spokes
new style wheel  made just for this thread
  of course itll be on some honda trash
  you see a lug consists of 3 separate parts when it is off the car when it is being screwed on the car and when it is torqued to spec since we are not using the off the car portion of the lug we can say we effectively only use half of it
  when theres more than three spokes
  5 spoke 4 lug people should be rounded up and shot
  yo mane it come in tweny
  anything can be divided by wone
  based on a common six lug pcd there is a slight scale problem  1778px/130px1367  1397mmx136719096mm  751811024 inch
went to local drag event    90 of the cars are bone stock luxury sports sedans running 12s and 13s     why are post soviet countries so mentally backwards   what is with the obsession with m and amg badges
the best or nothing you homosexual
  drag event   are you kidding me
  the money u spend on that car you can build and rebuild 5 sub 10 second cars
in burgerland its mostly smallblock chebby/ls swapped everything here
  can confirm live beside a track/strip location
  because gm is the best company
  gm is the only company still making period performance engines     otherwise whoever makes a complete 1uz block again would become king of the strip
  its the retarded gangster culture from the 90s that people still romanticise also soulless npcs in these post soviet hellholes try to make up for lack of personality with cars     things are about to get worse when these subhumans start buying only suvs and crossovers   car culture in general is cringy as fuck now add soviet retardation and you have some great mix just avoid car events best thing is to like cars but not be a faggot about it and show off too much to others
slav car culture is the best      delusional gm cuckold
  gm and toyota fangirl    yikes literally the biggest npc
  because theyre cheap as shit  here in my post soviet country weve moved beyond that and mostly drag american cars street drag is mostly germans cause they are cheap as shit  circuit racing is a wide variety of everything
  government bail outs behind you  tips another government bail out  nothing bankrupsy kid  gets government bailed out yet again in your back
  slav car culture is same shit ass fucking bimmers retards think are worth anything on cheap wheels and lowering springs doing one wheel burnouts if they made the right choice or fwd burnouts if theyre retarded in a parking lot
  drag event  no nitromethane  hmm
  slavshit english    stop talking pls and stop hating on bmw
  its nothing special  people only like it cause its cheap as shit and everyone has like five that all look exact same  im tired of looking at the same fucking car x300 every meet
/ccg/  classic cars general    rattlecan everything edition    in the last episode   79sc bro gets wet  coastard is a tard  and lux gets his carb on only to let the magic smoke out    cars are considered classic at 25 years old but a vehicle really needs that certain something to be classic  everybody has their own taste but some tastes are wrong if you arent sure if your car is classic or not its not  american european japanese or whatever  however your honda miata doesnt count as a classic yet 80s hondas are better suited for their own generals as well everything else is fair game  post your classic your work on it your hackery and get advice  any and all discussion about classics welcome but may not necessarily generate responses dont get butthurt  period correct performance  cosmetics  metal  plastic  classic shitbox  modern shitbox  its required to use rtv ignore the haters  jbweld can fix almost anything  if you see rust there is probably more  rust and bodywork are by far the most difficult thing to repair  electrical work is second most difficult unless you stop reading forum posts and buy a multimeter  youre never actually going to finish that engine swap stop pretending  do not buy a classic and plan to pay somebody to work on it you need to be able to do 90 or greater of the work or you will go broke  you will inevitably spend twice your budget unless you have years of experience under your belt if all the salty old hands agree its probably true  no one cares about your mpg
  kek      im actually a texas fag so i have limited experience with that partypooper is the other bronco guy and he is a florida fag      only rust is on bottom of driver door  doubtpng  also that last one you sent me was a nigerian prince i doubt this one is legit
  just sending you those that might be of interest hell maybe even give you ideas for a build i still think you need to make a hammerhead replica
about the steam clean piston yea im gonna check the wall for cracks this weekend ran out of time yesterday still have another head to pull im just worried about ordering the new valve springs now as far as i can tell theres no part numbers on them and there definitley not oem since their dual springs should i pull the cam and measure the lift or a part number on the cam to guide me i guess
had a guy offer me 750 for the edsel i feel offended but should i feel that way
hey guys thinking about picking up an 87 dodge aries k on the fence but leaning towards getting it since its selling for dirt cheap anyone have any thoughts on these old sedans
  its more than scrap value so its a decent offer
blog and ccg post incoming    got some christmas shopping and found a mechanic/body guy a 1/4 mile from my house    got my mom a signed it poster and my dad a 53 merc front end fenders hood grill lights cut off about 2ft into the car for an awning for his shop i got it from the mech i met today of all places i searched through a junk yard and they were crazy boomer prices    so the mech is gonna unfuck my engine bay for me but hes also gonna look into doing the 7073 nose swap as well as fix anything else on the body for me considering hes been doing this and a custom bike shop for 40 years i think he may know what hes going on about he had a 64 impala that he was restoring and a 69 chevelle that he was repainting he had a wall of pics of cars hes restored over the years and there mustve been at least 150 up there
  white trash beaters i dont think anyone here would touch one let alone buy one      its pretty much rusted yard art right
  its a parts car with all the fancy trim optional backup lights and the front cunt is worth 20000 minimum not to mention the insanely expensive front and rear glass
  damn 
  then yes feel insulted put a sign in the window that says youre gonna fix it one day
  still paying for people to work on your car  big yikes
  i dont know how to work on cars ive always wanted a classic ive got a budget of about 28k and can spend about 5k in maintenance before it starts to become a financial problem
  mostly for the body work and wiring
  is there a minimum decade where i should look at are there any models in particular that are pretty reliable   i just want something sexy and american that i can daily drive  would a lincoln mk iii be a pain in the ass to take to work and back
  then you should buy a 14k car and save the 19k for repairs      and 85 for someone to unfuck my vacuum lines and tuning my carb is good enough for me
  where are you euro or state side generally gm or ford main stream cars mustangs impalas etc are going to be the easiest to keep running and finding parts a straight 6 engine gutless as they arrle are known for being unkillable read about a guy who drove a /6 without oil and only water for 100 miles and didnt fuck shit up
  19k in repairs  fuck man seriously there are some really low documented miles cars in my price range     yes stateside im mostly looking at 70s luxury barges but im open to 80s cars as well shit id be happy with an 87 caprice classic if i found the right one
  if youre planning on paying for every little repair youll spend more than you think in no time granted if you have 20k to drop on a car you can get a pretty mint vehicle    now for the years you want  70s   some early 70s land barges would be ok i guess there are some nice ones and 70s are pretty cheap    80s  shit you could buy a fleet of 80s barges for your money unless its the buick grand national or an ss monte carlo id just avoid the 80s    if you want style power and true americana get a 60s land barge drac is the king of barges here but im sure he would tell you to stay clear of the luxury brands as a first classic just due to cost/part availability alone
  thanks had a 75 lesabre that i bought at auction  brainlet move i know  was a shitbox and i felt lucky to get what i paid for it i know it can be a bit of a minefield out there id love a 60s car as well but for some reason i think theyd be less practical than 70s 80s cars id love a grand national but i wonder about the reliability of a turbod car
  id say 60s are just as practical  simple if any electrical systems  simple engines  same mpg  more power    in all reality its all about the condition of the car you buy if you want best of all worlds find a car that you love and drop a modern drive train in it youve got a bigger budget than most of us so you could get a great roller and a good drive train put in it
  this is pretty good well done      i disagree with 60s parts availability for nonboomer tier is nonexistent to use my imperial as an example nothing exists apart from 440 things and brake parts sounds like all you need right what about working windows youre looking at 2k to have the parts rebuilt on a 6k car    no boltin aftermarket radiator exists for my continental nor is there a transmission filter because the transmission was changed in 66 with a smaller unit that was just as effective and used for decades so nobody cares about one that was only around for about 7 years disc brakes not on a lincoln until 65 an imperial until 67 or 69 on a cadillac optional in 68 even later on lesser cars its not always necessary but dual master cylinders are also relatively rare id recommend a midlevel mid70s car for a first classic dont be afraid of 4doors be very afraid of rust and post what youre interested in before you buy
  as i stated earlier stay away from luxury brands if you have the money for the buy in boomer tier classics are the way to go they already got the market going so parts will be easy to find totally agree on the 4 door part hell im looking at a 4 door 64 galaxie 500 in very good condition for 6500 same car in 2 door would be near double that
  its not just luxury brands theres nothing being produced for almost any pre68 plymouth nothing for most buicks etc the 60s is a weird time in that retooling happened almost every year but it was minor minor enough that parts dont work from one year to the next but almost everything looked like a rectangle in the 70s designs started to endure for more than one year doubling and tripling the pool of cars to pull parts from
  ive got a 56 oldsmobile which is a nightmare for parts availability it has the added distiction of being a transition year between upgrades which mean some shit is specific to 56s built in certain months
  really i actually want one of those over a similar chevy thats actually good to know in a heart breaking kinda way
  i mean you can get a good example for decent prices there are advantages to owning cars that arent boomer magnets like trifive chevies they generally way more affordable compare prices of 57 ford to a 57 chevy you can get a lot more for alot less or a buick compared to a chevy
  cant into basic crankcase venting  cant into basic fuel tank venting  cant into basic pressurized cooling system   cant into basic front clip swap    yeah you can stop giving advice now youre doing more harm than good
  my edsel is the same a very early 58 built in 57 not only were there big and small edsels but each plant built them differently
summit is pretty lenient with exchanges they said to just bring the carb in and theyll swap it out i hope the next one doesnt have issues as well i dont think we messed anything up on it because the car never actually ran for more than 5 seconds i think something internally is wrong and it flooded immediately
  1 of 1 car utlra rare i know what i got
  for 750 ill cut the front end off and hang it on a wall
cant decide if i want a bumpside or dentside ford truck lads
my life is full of shit i cant wait to get the driveshaft on my truck and drive the fucking thing maybe ill want to kill myself a little less then its back to the shop for a bunch of stuff ill sell all my other cars and buy a little fiat spider to drive fast and stave off suicide kek
  driving this in the meanwhile its 25 years old so its a classic bite me
  shit thought you were dead       nvm kys
  classic  section 8mobile    wew lad
  post yours
  buy a 800cfm quad and fix your shit
  have you registered it as a classic or as an antique which ever youre state does
  whats up anon  just killin time before i kill myself
  heres my 77 the thing
big things unfolding in the 79 sc camaro guy camp
  hows that bank account looking
  good because i actually do my own labor
  if 200 is a big purchase for you you should reconsider your hobbies
  once again
  hey no need to throw insults i was just wondering since you went on a spending spree pretty recently correct
  i think the big thing is that the engine is coming out
  that too its probably looking at a rebuild to an extent
  lmao fucking rekt
i need advice cig        last night its available talked to the guy about he is willing to take 6k for it    worth the money
  81  hard pass
  i dont know much about gms of that time but it sounds like he has at least 34k in upgraded parts alone on it
im looking at a few model cars the wife got me an ebay gift card and since i cant use it to buy silver im trying to decide between these model cars    this one i would want to improve the quality and attention to detail of but i doubt i have the skill        this one at minimum i would like to repaint the green section red as well as improve the quality of with it it seems more manageable        this one i can live with the color scheme of but call me weird in that i prefer the 4door        which should i purchase
  id go for that four door one that looks nice
  12 or 3
  1
giving a shout out from cali    i picked up a mustang ii 8 rear banjo axle from what specs say the 8 used on the pintos and mustang iis are the exact same what i want to know is are the stock springs for either the pinto or mustang ii designed for more weight they look identical but i dont see any numbers anywhere
  if we lived closer id happily let you borrow mine
  also get those motor mounts in
  i would assume theyre the same because a mustang 2 is literally a pinto is that your pinto though looks fucking nice
  6k yeah id say thats fair desu i wouldnt do it unless you were deadset on the color and bodystyle
my bad wasnt trying to be rude coastie didnt realize how that sounded what i meant to say was yea i save a lot by doing all the work myself labor rates are ridiculous as fuck here my shop i like 190 an hour
  you stated an objective fact it would be dumber if he was offended by it
  jesus one of the shops i go to occasionally for parts and other stuff charges 90/hr and i think thats too much
  wtf man how can your shop justify charging that much  midas here where i work charges something like 119 an hour and even that is way too much now
is something with a spool rear end terrible to daily drive    will i be wheel hopping around corners
  i can pretty much guarantee youll break something especially if its a mini spool would suck to drive on pavement         were a european shop walking distance from the beach in southern california so i bet the cost of living jacks up the price nevertheless our only real competition is the actual dealerships and they charge like 225 or more an hour so we still get a ton of business my boss has been on the euro scene for over 30 years and has a degree in electrical engineering and the owner has been working on benz since the late 50s i think so they have a a huge rep as the go to guys for anything luxury german car related
  hopping mainly at low speeds same effect as driving with a welded diff those videos are easy to find on youtube
  but for perspective the shop i used to take my camaro to charges i wanna say 90 an hour and the guy next door whos also a big muscle car guy only charges 85 so yea were stupid overpriced my first day on the job i made over 1200 for the shop in like one car 16 spark plugs 8 coils an oil change and a auto trans service and i think say bar end links
  dont do it friend  unless you are made of money that car isnt worth it my brother had a laugh at the listed price i know cars are expensive where you live but an 81 is a terrible car  that 350 screams of sloppyness he didnt even bother to cover the holes when spraying it the wrong color i dont trust other peoples builds when they dont give the exact specs of all that they did when someone says monster or high performance cam just assume that they bought the biggest one they found on summet and fucked the car ask him for less vague mod list you wonder why there is no shaker its because the air filter is supposed to mate with a quadrajet specific to the cars engine not a 350 thats also why coasties is bolted to his fucking hood   the rims look like they came off my boat trailer and his basket weeves are not correct either snowflakes were also not correct for that year  he also says that it was a ws6 car that would make it a little more valuable but i would contact the pontiac historical society first i pay them to check out the cars past if im seriously considering buying it also the was part confuses me did he take out the steering and sway bars he said it still has the 4 wheel disks so what makes it a was   the cars interior he proudly admits he ruined like who the fuck admits that he cut up his dash in the ad does he relize how expensive t/a dashes are   the body looks ok from the shotty picture i see some dents here and there and some panel gap but shitty quality is expected in 81 the lack of flares and the flaps worry me he said he has them but i would bring my magnets check the a pillers those like to rust and you will need to cut of the roof and weld a new one on its not fun trust me also t tops suck ass    im not going to write a 4000 character essay on why 81 is a bad year again but just know that they were all low quality parts bin cars like the 69 corvair
  all this   do yourself a favor and get yourself a nice 79 z28 i heard theres a guy on here selling one with like 10k in performance mods alone he might let u get it for 25k since the heads are off the motor
    forgot to add that i think he has a different hood on it as he claims its a ws6 and ws6s were turbo cars
  hey mines not bolted but i dont have the proper air filter so it does sit loosely on it i also didnt know ta dashes were expensive    hows the new project car
havent driven it in a little while theres a pretty obnoxious clicking sound coming from what seems like the water pump once the car warms up i thought it was the sound of the headers expanding but its way too loud to be that
speshul number      lol        its a serviceable daily and while its not a classic its comfortably retro at this point mfw its only two years older than me      tfw ccg is also mental illness general
  forgot to add in tx you can register as a classic by supplying plates from that year but 93 plates are nothing special and antique plates are exhibition only i get the odometer emissions and other exemptions at inspection regardless though
    i went and saw the car its worse in person there was rust in the pillars and when i tried to start it up it didnt want to alternator is done ttops were leaking there was rust around the rear window the floor pans werent doing too well no paperwork  all of that is at the shop which has done all the work on the car the only thing he had was the original build sheet dash was fucked beyond the cutting there was cracks etc rear sway bar was bout 4/8 to 5/8th of an inch in diameter so i am pretty sure it was swapped i seem to remember ws6 having much thicker ones       there are a few camaros out here an 81 rs for 14k with a 30 bored out 350 a 76 lt for 10k and a 80 z28 with a 385 fast burn for 98k are the main options really
  i was fuckin around cuz thats what i have man listen to cutlass and dont get anything newer than like 75
can you drift on bias plies without dying
  well i mean idk if you can im sure i could because im an immortal demigod
  ya thats what i figured    the only exception to this is a 1977/78 t/a with the w72 xx bock 75/76 have a shit 400 and 7981 are not great
  i assumed because i never see it in your engine pics and its popular to do origonal t/a dashes are over a grand normally   hows the new project  havent got the car yet it comes in friday
drac thought you might like these    
  just realized he changed the ad it was originally 3 identical ones for 5k    im also at the movies on my day off and watched a c6 pull up take up 2 handicap spots and a boomer hobble out stereotypes all the way
  i have a similar car  although it is a classic it more just retro  and it belongs to another general      dont know the exact details but my grandad put antique plates on his truck in ar and it was exempt from pretty much everything never had to get the odo checked or anything and its a one and done reg once you get it on until you sell it
  that would have been a fair price but the sudden price change means that theyve got boomer vision
why do the 351m/400m get such bad reputations they may be smog motors but theyre literally just a tall deck cleveland and can make just as much power as one
  boomers are lazy and they require a little extra work
when you dont live in the desert   you guys have it nice          
  mental illness general  dont forget physical illness too a lot of us in here are pretty banged up mentally and physically       basically what drac said i get criticism because my 400 is a dog in factory form but just a simple heads and cam job will make it a screamer im going to do it when i get my shop up the building is on order and will be shipped in april
  although it is a classic it more just retro  wat  and it belongs to another general  oh i agree i dont post my subaru here that often its just that my other classics are always under the knife lately so i never get to post them      pretty banged up mentally and physically  they dont think it be like it is but it do
  dat amx
  how have you been doing lately youve been gone for a while
im new to /o/ is there a thread where people just post classic cars huge fan of classic cars but know literally nothing about automobiles in terms of stats or mechanics just enjoy looking at their aesthetic
  mentally and physically  didnt know that guess i came to the right general  felt like ive been on the verge of death for the pass two weeks like almost passing out and shit for no reason plus the other injuries sustained from my last job  mentally im just a nihlistic suicidal sad sack so pretty normal      my aw11 mr2 is a classic but it more fits into that whole retro vibe thingcause its got efi and cruise control and an ecu etc
  that would be here its a great place to learn
  yeah thats shitty man im sorry you should get checked out im pretty sure im bipolar but have never bothered to get diagnosed because i refuse to take meds for it so no point my ex destroyed me emotionally and i dont feel like i can ever love again i purchased a mail order waifu and im legitimately losing interest in real women i just went back to work recently from having a spinal fusion in july but am still having some issues   nihilism   yeah ive kind of reached that point too
  no need to be sorry thats life  it started just before i went to go visit family so im trying to push through until i get back next month  suck about your ex personally ive never dated so i cant say much  luckily my injuries were with mainly my kneesso its pretty tolerable most of the time  i just never want to get so fucked up i cant drive i would rather be dead at that point
so theorizing on my packard build i realized that the engine is over the wheels as opposed to behind the wheels on a 30s car i wonder if this can be addressed by lengthening the front of the frame
whats under a vinyl top paint primer bare metal we all know the real answer is rust but lets say by a miracle it isnt
  my aw11 mr2 is a classic but it more fits into that whole retro vibe thing  oh yeah its pretty clearly both of those things by now especially with the whole 80s/90s nostalgia wave going on or i should say 80s nostalgia since most of the people riding that fad werent even born until 1995 at the earliest    guess i came to the right general  maybe you just have to be a little crazy to willfully put up with the shit classic cars throw your way      alright i guess still unsure of my mental state its a fine line between repression and refusing to indulge oneself if that makes sense on the outside my life has mostly been moving forward made some new connections one of my new friends just got a job in utah unfortunately and will be moving pic related unbelievably we have the same name and he drives an 88 celica i just sold my 89 but he said hed try to recommend me for a position at his soontobeformer workplace so thatd be nice i think i did post on here before that my gf of 5 years and i broke up around july which was probably for the best but hurts i dont hate her for it at all but its lonelier      from the factory it probably came painted under there i imagine they would spray the whole body and then put all the trim on
  pic related  this is the town hes moving to albeit 50 years in the future its a little bigger now but the scenery is still just as great
  paint but probably rust now
so how did/does everyone here learn about wrenching and cars and just fixing things in general     earlier today i was at a boomers shadetreehomegarage with a relative as i guess they know each other and were doing some minor work and bullshitting     i was intrigued by this boomer and his mechanic skills so i had asked him hey can i take a peek and see whats going on to which he got immediately pissed and started telling me off with saying things like no you fucking cant and you guys my generation just halfasses everything and fucks it up and you want to learn go the fuck to school     i didnt agitate the guy any further and just said ok but it got me to thinking is there any backing to what he said is going to school really the best way to learn i have a tool set hf mechanics set internet and researching skills two cars daily  summer and a haynes general repair manual     i personally dont think going back to school already have a degree but am currently underemployed in my field is the best option as cars are more of an interest to me and i wouldnt want to turn it into a job but i think having a solid foundation for fixing things as they break is a very good skillset to have     pic sorta related
  that dudes just an ass  in my personal experience most boomers are totally cool with learning you something as long as you show general interest you also have to be patient and expect long windedness    but you only go to school if youre planning to make it a job and its not recommended to make auto mechanics a job  as a hobby i just learned by doing start small then big occasionally seeking help i got lucky and have had several more experienced people in my life but even going on your own its fine just might take longer
  yeah i figured the guy is an ass and just kept my mouth shut so he would quit his bitching i know patience is a virtue and have shown interest in performing my own work within reason and comfort     yeah i dont want to make auto mechanic my job so i agree school isnt a viable option     when you say you started small do you mean like small things around the house or small things with a car i was thinking that working on small things like taking them apart and putting them back together will help understand how things work and i could transfer that thinking to bigger things like a car     as for seeking help i have done that and will continue to do so older relatives internet etc
  as silly as it sounds when i was really young i played a shit ton of granturismo and used to read all the long texts regarding the cars and all the parts and their basic functions always used to take my toys and shit apart and put them back together thats what started me down the path    fixing cars is seriously easy as shit dude like any asshole can turn bolts     theres more to it obviously bit its really not that big a deal
  you know i dont think the video game route is all that silly i actually have car mechanic simulator 2015 on my pc and have played it and learned about things i hadnt known before ill have to check out gran turismo then any other suggestions    as for taking stuff apart i do have musical instruments electric acoustic bass etc that i do tinker with i could start going more indepth with that
  like any asshole can turn bolts  can confirm am bolt turning asshole
  well im talking about gran turismo for the ps1 many years ago    realistically go find a text book like modern automotive technology youll learn anything you ever wanted to know
does anybody here have any experience with gm abodies   i just bought a 66 pontiac lemans and have no clue what im doing   all my experience with cars have been with datsuns and other old jap unibodies so im worried i might be in over my head  pic related  i have more pics if yall want em
  oh ive been breaking shit apart my entire life  i was mainly talking auto related stuff but it kinda transfers a little  in all honestly i love fixing/building stuff always have  ive occasionally thought of building my own house with my own hands but i probably wont have the money for it    in short wanna do some shit just go do it
  what is it that you want to know
  i guess my main concern is rust as the car has sat in a field for about 15 years   also im worried about frame repair or just working with the frame in general   should i just leave it alone for now or try to get that out of the way first
  fuck that lemans look at that sweet fucking 80s lincoln limo id rather have that
  hahahahaha thats funny youd say that  i asked the owner about the limo and he said that it was his barhopping limo in the 80s   him and some friends would drive the limo around town all night and drink  after him and his friends collected a total of 8 duis they left it in a field to rot away
  i could work on the lemans blindfolded and i agree    the lemans is a great babys first pontiac because almost everything exists for it or can be had from gto clones
  is the frame rotted out of it if not just leave it
  i guess i dont know exactly what youre saying with your mental state but i get the gist of it sucks about your gf but if i remember correctly the relationship was kind of stagnant and not going anywhere probably for the best honestly  its lonelier  yeah shit sucks at first i was a wreck when i broke up with my fiance it gets better though if youre okay with unconventional practices look into sex dolls theyre awesome can confirm dont regret it one bit      as others said definitely dont go to school if its just for a hobby i never went to school and somehow i climbed my way up the ladder and am now an ase master tech and two classes away from infiniti master its possible i started just working on my own shit as a teenager not really knowing anything and now im able to diagnose complex electrical and can network issues as well any mechanical issues that took about ten years but youd be surprised how much you can learn if something is broken and you dont have the money to pay the outrageous labor fees that shops charge   just start working on shit ask us or do some google if you get stuck even if its not classic related repair questions dont get turned down in here      thats kind of my biggest fear too not being able to drive or work on shit
  i was born into it   that guy just sounds like an ass most boomer i know like that the younger generation wants to work on the same cars they did     a body   pontiac   those are the cars i work on most regularly i would get that thing cleaned up before you inspect it the quarters are probably gone along with the floor and trunk i can already see rust on the hood and what i pray is just dirt on the roof if the frame is rotted then you are pretty fucked unless you have the money to buy a new one  66 lemans and gtos are extremely popular so parts availability will be no problem year one and summit have good parts but ames is my favorite    get its vin read by the phs to get your original documentation   you could get them in the 389 option and that is a fantastic engine   i have been helping restore a 65 gto and it has been a blast too bad the barn owner smashed into it with a plow truck    dont try to make a gto clone i see so many people do this but to this day i dont understand why
  you merely adopted the wrenching i was born in it molded by it i didnt see cordless power tools until i was already a man
  thanks for the info man i really appreciate it  and i dont plan on a gto clone i dont want to look like an ass lol
  no prob if you ever have any issues ill try and help with my limited knowledge   i highly suggest signing up for ames catalog its free and is great to look through when you are suppose to be working or to collect and make a pontiac bookshelf out of it     pic is of the 65 before its front end got smashed by a female driver   like how the fuck do you ram into a stationary vehicle with a plow truck in the middle of summer
  lol nice      oh wow an old game haha ill check out that book though thanks      in short wanna do some shit just go do it  this is some of the truest life advice i need to follow more closely thanks      yeah ive been trying to do more work on my stuff because the prices the shops charge are ridiculous ill keep you guys in mind thanks      not much of a choice huh but i guess not a bad choice then lol and for sure he was an ass       bane
  how the fuck do you ram into a stationary vehicle with a plow truck in the middle of summer    female driver    you answered your own question friendo
  get back in the god damn kitchen woman      yes bane
i learned due to poverty wrenching because i had to
  i was indoctrinated into pontiacs and corvairs from day 1 i have been part of the cult ever since
  cutlass you stud
    looks pretty solid from the pics assuming thats all dirt which im sure it is nice
  i dont see that as an issue
quick update on the camaro havent been able to work on it yet but i may have found a solution to at least my issue with the springs theres a comp cams blower kit that comes with springs lifters the cam and timing set which would fit the car and go excellently with my blower setup which ive been told is currently being nerfed by my cam 350 so id say its worth it to have my cam match my torque converter blower and rear end only problem is my current heads are either 64 or 72cc chamber and theres no way to check on casting numbers since world products doesnt mark that for some stupid fuckin reasons well documented in the forums lots of people have this issue with wp id have to cc the head myself with plexiglass and alcohol if its the the 64 that may bee too much compression to run on 91 72cc and im gucci but either way they only have 170cc intake runners   deep breath  now heres where it gets interesting i can get a set of aluminum heads that are 72cc combustion chambers and 200cc intake runners with dual springs and valves pre installed for 1000 or so the pair and that way i could lower my compression and have better flowing lighter heads and save money on the cam kit by not getting any valve items just the cam lifters and timing major performance increase like big time id probably gain 80 horses doing heads and cam one big problem though as always smog the cam may smog still since its not visible and as long it sniffers its good the heads though definitley not since theyre visibly aftermarket not only that they have no provision for the egr heater crossover either so id delete egr it would be majorly jumping the shark at that point past the point of no return id delete the air pump too and probably run 810psi of boost
  guessing youre in cali kinda new to the general but if so i know there are shops that can make it pass smog  depending on where you are i may know a guy who knows a guy
  holy fuck that is one comfy picture you take that that pine sapll getcha
  pine  pecan  my truck happened to be under a pecan tree when the post office lost my parts so it sat there with the wellpreserved original paint being eaten away by fucking sap and sunlight feels sacrilegious man
  i didnt even notice the town car the first time might be selling mine this weekend that photo is my wallpaper now
  hahaha yeah i took it a bit ago i dont know if i would describe it as comfy but thank you and yeah fuck pine sap i have my 240z sitting under a pine tree right now and i hate cleaning that shit off
  im fairly certain you have more money into your engine that ive spent on a car lol at this point why not buy a presmog shell and vin swap it
  i dont know a ton about blower performance but i do know that if the cam specs are for building powe n/a like the giant choppy cam my corvette has it will rob gains from the blower i would say for sure do the cam as far as the heads go you really need to have your ducks in a row before you pull the trigger you need to have your exit path clear on that one or youll be fucked either know a guy who knows a guy or figure out some other work around coastie has a good idea though vin swaps are easy on an old car you just need to make sure the car you get it from is burned or buried is that something you could even get away with in cali
  especially since his car is kinda frankensteined with all sorts of body parts really its just the rear window that could give him away unless he says he roof swapped it or something even with the amount of work that he has done to this thing it might even be worth swapping all his stuff into an older roller    on a f body note i was cruising around yesterday and pulled up to an early 50s gm car i felt like my sparkling purple ta was extremely dull and boring compared to that car just cause the vast amount of chrome on it ive never been a fan of chrome but god damn    pic not related just to trigger cutlass
  yea i havent pulled the old cam yet but seeing how someone went through and put on heads with bigger runners and likely a smaller combustion chamber and flat top 040 pistons id wager that the lsa is more tuned for a mild higher compression na motor seeing as how it was already pretty powerful pre blower and headers i bet its probably blowing the charged intake air out of the still open exhaust valve on the intake stroke wasting boost the new cam is gonna go in for sure with the matched springs and lifters gonna keep my roller rockers on there too and probably run 10w30 full synthetic if the cam doesnt need anything specific flat tappet hydraulic where i really fucked up was putting my blower on this motor before i knew as much as i do now the lm1 motor came with stock 882 heads 75cc chambers low compression 81 setup which is what i thought was on still and why i figured a blower would be good for it now that i have some experience it was probably like 951 or so since its also bored over and had a thin gasket   theres like a 90 percent chance i leave california next year with porsche and i dont smog again until 2020 so im not super worried but if for some reason i do stick around im totally cucked      ive thought about the roller swap a lot but i have a great interior in this one new carpet and headliner too not saying its impossible but id have to pull the whole interior and literally the entire drivetrain since too i have the streetfighter trans the dalenzie converter and a freshly done rear axle with 390 eaton posi and 30 spline hardened axles new bearings and seals honestly if i could find a nova shell in decent condition id probably do it but i also have all the suspension steering and brake upgrades for this car in my parts shed alresdy too
looks like i have to do the timing chain on the imperial not too bad given its at almost 98k miles
  for me a swap like that would be near impossible for you though i feel like you would be done at the end of a weekend lol what about vin swap and if youre gonna be out of cali next year i guess dont worry about it i havent really paid attention to auto laws since bama is the wild west  ive driven without tags for months  never registered any of my classics  whats an inspection
so lets say im going to start a car thats been sitting for 20 years and i dont have the key put 12v to the starter to crank it but what do i do about ignition its a points car would i just run a wire from the distributor to the battery
  oh shit also forgot my megashifter and cable linkage which is vehicle specific to this car  tfw could a just bought like a 2012 camaro zl1 and had 500 horses by now probably not though i think im aboit 10k in parts on this car what really jewed me was when i have to get shit welded
  theres a ballast resistor somewhere in that circuit that you need to take into consideration
thoughts guy offered this for my ta    
  somehow even a bigger piece if shit than your 79
  more like classic coffin general amirite
yeeeeee my 90 r129 jspec
  this but unironically
  id say youre in a tough spot with all the variables especially your tenative residence in cali honestly man you need to leave that cuck state regardless its objectively going down in flames metaphorically and literally the economy was tanked 10 years ago give it another 10 and itll be a wasteland theres already a mass exodus primarily to my metroplex and theyre already fucking shit up over here
    youre a thread too late on that joke buddy we had ccg coffin general edition last thread
  not if your life depended on it thats a bigger pos than my edsel
  new cam with lifters and aluminum heads with assembled valves bigger chambers and runners would be pure sex and all them new parts would probably seal and fit together much better vs me trying to reuse when i go to pull the pistons out im gonna have to remove that cylinder ridge except im confused as to how its done i know autozone has the reamer tool pic related but then theres also the hone with the 3 stone blades and then the thing with all the little balls for crosshatching so im kinda lost on that rn on what you have to do i guess team first to remove the ridge and pop the pistons out measure for out of round and taper and ring clearances then hone if necessary and crosshatch prior to installing cylinders again with rings
  ill give you 725 and a firm handshake for your edsel    i dont trust rat rods or anything painted matte but figured i get yalls opinion
  dont trust anything painted matte  lets race for pinks coastie come on its all stock under there man your big 400 should have no issue with a small little smog era 350
  right now with your blown engine lets race
  your paint looks more like rhino lining lol are you ever gonna paint it or did you decide to keep it
  i intend to throw a 460 in there plus i triggered a bunch of boomers when i asked if i should be offended in an edsel preservation group    after values ranging from 300 to 2000 i said that i was going to throw in a 460 and get it back to driving one boomer said that i should do it the right way and rebuild the 410 as it would be worth more when im done i replied that given that people told me that i should have sold it for 750 and that its considered junk by most of them value is meaningless as it would be a matter of am i losing 20k or 30k if i were to sell it after restoring it i only wish i had said that being concerned with resale on a project is like not fucking your girlfriend as much so that her pussy stays tight for the man in her life despite the fallacy of thinking it can be stretched with a micropenis
  i did see an edsel donked out recently that seriously caught me off guard as you rarely see an edsel to begin with
  itd be infinitely cooler with a 410 though
  are edsels worthless or is yours just trashed
  pretty sure its in a bad way
  yikes i saved that pic too didnt know it was the edsel though
  none of them were lining up to sell me one for less than a 460 i dont expect it for free but they expected me to buy another car for another questionable motor      its not hopeless as a driver but it is hopeless as a restoration candidate while i believe in preserving cars there is a point where a car is beyond preserving with this one the entire roof is rotted through and will need a serious graft or patch to keep water out at this point my goal is to get it back on the road in any capacity
  its curious the body and floors are solid the doors trunk quarter panels hood and fenders could be reworked with relatively minimal effort for a car that has serious rust issues the frame is great too    the problem is the edselspecific parts switches mirrors hood ornament chrome plated bits etc are mostly shot it could be an excellent rat rod if i put in generic switches and the like its an ideal candidate for a ls swap too    edsels have shitty plastic switches for everything any that were left crumbled under my touch    if i wanted to make it into a mad max edsel it is more than solid enough for that
  i drove one occasionally back in the day horrible power probably didnt get better with age
  so i am in the process of buying a 1947 lincoln continental i made a thread about it the other day because im a tardass who has no idea what hes doing i just love the car    what should i know to not make retarded mistakes    inb4 its expensive dont buy it  im buying it anyways its a bad idea but its my mistake to make
  the flathead 12 while similar in architecture to a v8 does not tune like one    i believe its still a monospring front end too    are you keeping it stock
  yes i am its currently original and in very good shape mostly just needs a clean if i find anything on it not original i will restore it to originality
  i know a bit ill answer what i can
how do i deal with the boomers when they throw me ridiculous prices
  i dont own it yet so i havent opened my bag of worms yet but i want to know what not to do so i dont kill it i found out in my thread i need to know if it uses 6v batteries and that was really helpful im also kinda worried about it getting carjacked but yeah i just want to know the rookie mistakes to avoid really
  laugh and walk away there is no bargaining with them
  carjacking is ridiculously unlikely too conspicuous and too little appeal
    kick the tires  i know what this is  offer them scrap value  laugh  walk away
ooo  ooooo  i know its a mistake but fuck i need it  57 chevy  4spd  gasser  runs and drives  5500
  tell them no  if they keep fucking with you threaten them with a tire iron    unironically though as somehow who sells cars for a living most boomers are just dumb but for a lot of them if its old stuff its just cuz they remember how much when they were new and cars were way cheaper then
  4500 replace the gasser suspension with regular road stuff drive it until it falls apart then fix it   mad respect will be gained
neat 1989 or below cars that arent too expensive  in canada btw asking forn a friendalready have reliable dd so reliabilty is no issue
  5500 for even a roller 4dr 57 is pretty fair tbh i love the gasser look if i had the spare cash id be road tripping up there this weekend
  i dont disagree with you always try to get less if u can tho spend less on the base car youll feel like you can spend more on modifying it works every time
  toyota tercel wagon
  foxbody mustang old c10s 2nd/3rd gen camaro mk3 supras maybe but they have problems 300zx z31
    ty frends i guess the main thing to go off on this vintage is rust
  yeah and old wiring on fuel injected stuff especially nissan/toyota stuff which is more of a concern in my opinion rust isnt that hard to fix in small areas fenderwells rockers etcs
  okay thanks anon    will look out for this shit already had my eye on turdgens so likely will end up with one
  ive got a 77 if you can find an aluminum bumper 2nd gen id recommend them over a 3rd gen little better room inside easier to sell later and a lot easier to make fast
  paying 5500 for a hacked up 4 door chevrolet
  better than paying over 30k for a nice one imo buy what you can afford
  theres a pretty obnoxious clicking sound coming from what seems like the water pump once the car warms up  still running vbelts  check your wp pulley  if the wrong width belt has been used or just incorrectly tightented the belts may be too tight and this will cause the pulley to eventually crack or split in the bottom of the groove  when the crack/split gets bigger the pulleyif large enough may begin to ring like a bell while rotating  if you feel like you are constantly tightening/adjusting the belts check your wp pulley  if you have a fan clutch verify the pulley studs are properly tightened and the pulley is tight to the wp shaft some folks tighten the belts before verifying the studs/nuts are properly tightened
  to which he got immediately pissed  sounds like a punk he couldnt teach you anything other than what most mechanicos really are just asses  replacing parts is the easy part diagnostics is what really intrigues me so many times items have been replaced when it wasnt the fault or in need of replacement at all  the better you understand a system and how it functions and how it is supposed to work the better you will be at repairing  lots of guys just throw parts at a car going for hail marys or thinking they know what the problem is before doing any diagnostics
  coastie youre missing a letter in your name
finally downloaded the eurobeat mega  47gb  im ready boys
  no no ive left our shores and entered the world of coats       hacked  probably  4 door  you act like there is something wrong with that
  check the water pump without any belts on  give it a spin and check for any side to side play there should be virtually none
  this i get the feeling that most mechanics just man the parts cannon instead of pulling out a multimeter or stethoscope or whatever simple diagnostic tool    i usually go off of the beyond reasonable doubt principle that i know whats wrong before replacing parts
  not only that they have no provision for the egr heater crossover either so id delete egr  its a 79 your car originally had the pellet two way converter i would not be worried about nox emissions you shouldnt be tested for it when new nox was not tested on pre ccc cars  if you have weiand 142 blower 65021 it should have eo  d2562   camshaft you can get pretty wild as emissions go as long as you have the emissions equipment hooked up to pass visual and the cam isnt too crazy along with a quality catalyst you should pass no problem
ccg im thinking of buying a cheap amc for a project they seem extremely simple and could make an easy engine swap what am i getting myself into
  plan for a brake swap as well
  cheap  amc     that was your first mistake
    uh yeah   if you ever want to sell it unless its really nice and stock amcs are hard to sell  amc parts are expensive and hard to find  either spend a little more and get a lower end chevy or ford car galaxy fairlane falcon impala chevy 2 biscayne etc   or just buy a truck c10 or f100 both are great
  no man the egr is part of the visual its on my vickie label as well as the the efe air pump and thermac air cleaner and stock quadrajet i passed smog last year with all my shit hooked up and the blower with current cam heads and modified headers though i guess i can just leave the egr on and non functional for the visual but on my 5 gas report from smog they did sniff for oxides of nitrogen
    parts will be hard to come by if you get an amc make sure it is relatively complete otherwise youll be doing a ton of searching on ebay for used parts theres virtually no reproduction market for them however depending on what you get a lot of suspension systems will interchange between models which will make that a bit easier    but bodywork and trim interior oh boy    t javelin owner most of mine is there and solid so i wont be getting fucked hard
    ranchero a best      ill take absolute hell for 500 trebeck
  i can fuck that  12 slick in the back 460 up front
also just noticed the general gets wet
  
        thanks goyims the one i was looking at is all complete it just hasnt ran in almost ten years inside a garage in socal so likely rust and body work isnt going to be a problem as well as trim pieces all seem to be in place
  i would want it to be like this when finished what brings me to an amc is theyre super light and rwd
  word i thought it was a reference to ethan hawke smoking pcp in denzels monte carlo in training day gettin wet and thereby crossing the threshold to crooked cop the point of no return you know like what im about to do with my car
looking for something like an 80s tercel or corolla wagon with 4wd any similar cars boxy manual 4wd jap wagon
  theres one of those in a field near where i live
  found it      guy has a whole field full of classics some obscure shit too
  who wants a studebaker  this one also has a pic thatll give you a better idea of how much he has    ive never seen so many classics in one place on the dailyas i have in inland washington/idaho and im not just talking about this stuff people are always driving around some mint classics here  too bad im a broke motherfucker with no real prospects
  fuck      i have issues
am i an idiot for wanting to buy pic relatedopel manta 1972 use it as first car but only in the weekends and small trips without owning a garage and little knowledge about fixing cards but willing to learn    money is not really an issue
  i cant even open my doors all the way in my garage and i did an engine swap anything is possible
  shit moparts bought a 50something stud last year for 1500 iirc maybe 2k it was fully restored good paint and everything it just had electrical problem and it wouldnt run it was a simple fix for like 50 not sure if he still has it
    this i work outside at my inlaws driveway and carry everything to and from a shed including my air compressor jack stands heavy tools and soon even my engine hoist stand and engine itself
  just curious about the situation with your parents because working out of your inlaws driveway seems like it would be a tense and awkward situation
  i thought you were about to disown them a few months back shit i remember when you were about to kill your mother in law over your hood lol
  2 feet on both sides of the door   new engine on a stand packed in the corner flush against the wall  hoist is right next to it  new trans next to the hoist   old 350 still filled with fluids flush against the wall  shelf and toolbox on the other side in the corner  rest of the space is just random garage shit  right now id have to pull my car out if i want to open the drawers of the toolbox because i parked too close to the left when i use the hoist i cant move it too far forward because the boom would hit the garage door so i only have half of the garage to work with and i cant fucking turn it at all either its hilarious
      blog post time  nah im only back with my parents until im done with school in april since im planning on moving out of state when i graduate and since my parents happened to be a short drive from base when i left the military and close enough to uti and with shops hiring around them we worked out an arrangement where im helping out with rent and groceries and shit but i basically just shower and sleep at the house since i go to school and work all day and on weekends i go to my inlaws where my wife is at my parents are old i dont wanna bother them with clutter and shit at the house they wanna retire and move to their hacienda ranch house theyve been building back in mexico for the last decade so i try to keep a small footprint my two brothers are absolute shitbags though and have never left home ones 29 and the others 25 and theyre basically the reason my parents havent retired my older brother has a totalled 2016 civic in the garage that he wrapped around a tree with no insurance then got towed to my parents house with no police report or notification to the dealership and hes still making payments on it sucks terribly because it would he exponentially easier for me if i could work on my car in the garage an hour a night or so instead of having to plan days that i go to my inlaws and haul my tools back and forth not to mention how fuckin unfair that is to my parents that its taking up space in the garage  my father in law never had a son and always wanted one so he actually loves working on the car with me hes a maintenece guy at an apartment complex so hes proficient with tools and always seems to have some perfect odball tool for every snag we encounter i fix his cars and truck for free in return my mother in law is a waste of oxygen and ive found that the best solution is to give short polite answers or ignore her completely until i move away and never have to see her again rather than getting all worked up
  lel having a garage is bourgeois decadence  all you really need is a small deckedout toolbox and a piece of carpet if youre a desert rat like me i hear theres some weird green carpetlike stuff all over the place back east thatll work just fine
got offered a 2000 wrangler for the ta  pic related  i was interested then he said 4cyl then he mentioned it just needs a head gasket ive got the part lol nope
thought someone here would like this     
  the 4 cylinders are ok just a little anemic  inb4 its approaching 150000 with the 5speed
  straight 8  3 speed manual
  guessing they didnt last long
  yup with stock tires you get 150k before the rear bearing blows up and takes the overdrive gear with it
  i want it so badly but my current packard project takes priority im debating bolting a m22 rock crusher to the flathead 327 i8
bumping from the coastie school of painting cars
  that looks pretty damn good    got a call back from the guy he replaced all the vacuum lines and is pushing for a new carb on the other side he gave me a worst case price of doing the following  fixing my interior new seats dash carpet headliner plus misc  73 nose swap with out of the box fenders nose hood all mounted  misc body work  a total repaint  all for 7500 i obviously dont want to drop that kinda cash on it but glad to know that would be balls to the wall    im gonna go with a new carb and hes gonna get back to me for a price of a 73 nose  hood both used and painting them to match vs a 7778 nose  paint    side note neighbor started to paint his car ive done better with rattle cans
  i see someone else uses watertown autozone i saw it towed today actually at a yard in watertown with a guy arguing
    awesome styling it makes time stand still
why would you do this
  fuck the boomers check out the aussie prices for replica muscle cars
  you are paying someone to put a 73 nose on your trans am you dont get to judge anything anyone does
  im thinking about replacing my now completely fucked nose with either the oem 79 cone or a hugger thats if i ever get around to doing the exterior though might just say fuck it and rattlecan on a primer jolly rodger on the hood and drive it as is
  that would be boomer af  but i like it
  im not destroying a split window vette just improving the ugliest 2nd gen firebird    do a ghetto nightrider
  which one the hugger or the jolly roger looks like this guy already did it though i couldve been the scourge of the 7 seas in my ghost car the flying dutchman       kitt was like a 82 transam though wrong gen and wrong sister
  forgot pic also just found out its from death proof which i never watched
  thats why its a ghetto nightrider
  guess i could do this one of el guapo which was my handle on my last little bullshit deployment   moustache   check  gold tooth  check  filthy beaner   check   gunslinger   check   i used to actually have the patch on a pouch of my flak before some higher up saw it and made me remove it
  you still dont get to judge anyone
  you actually have a gold tooth pics or it didnt happen
is my car a classic yet /o/
  hence the ghetto version    thats the movie i was thinking of     ill be like a suburban mom ill judge the fuck outa anyone this is god damn america if you dont like it get out reeeeeee
  most of ccg wont consider it so but technically yes and i have a soft spot for fox bodies yours is really clean i like
  i hope to the good lord that this is a troll post
  its coastie were talking about here so no it isnt    sorry not sorry coastie
    i mean ive been talking about a nose swap for a while soooo
  coastie you took your car to a shop when i literally walked you through what to do last thread you paid someone to do something that is ridiculously easy and no shit he told you to get a new carb your engine was designed to have an 800 cfm quadrajet on it      muh nose swap  73 nose swaps are retarded your cars body isnt even the same it wont fit properly and it wont look right also a good endura bumper is hard to get your hands on and expensive hell properly put some fake chinese repo on or some fake along with overpricing the other components needed to make the bastardization fit  body work and paint   dont even bother get your engine sorted out first     your car is a worthless piece of shit that you should never spend a dime on 7500 for a car that is worth 14k in excellent condition i wouldnt even grade yours as fair just cut your losses and sell the car and save up for a car you actually want     dont just let him pick a carb and charge you an arm and a leg for what is probably an incorrect carb get your own i have linked cliff to you multiple times he actually knows what he is doing and will get you hooked up right
ran to summit tonight and warrantied out the carb bought a fuel pressure regulator for good measure hopefully the damn thing starts tomorrow        basically this i dont want to be a total dick to you but cutlass is right
coastie you need to start listening to advice you ask a question and when you dont get the answer you want you keep asking until everyone gets pissed at you or you do it anyway and then come back asking how to fix whatever everybody told you not to do
  yupp real actual gold followed by a tooth that was lost due to negligence of naval medicine and then a filling inb4 yellow teeth literally just chomped down a huge plate of singapore chow mei fun curry rice noodle
  how much did that cost you bro im gonna need some work done and i hear the gold isnt much more expensive than ceramics and obviously its more durable than ceramic
  idk you guys paid for it   thanks taxpayers and your welcome for my service  but in seriousness idk man i never saw a bill for it but the dentist said i have a small fortune in my mouth a few fillings a few root canals the gold tooth oh and another gold crown i completely forgot about my teeth are my weak point i brush and floss everyday and yet i always have problems meanwhile my wife drinks soda and eats candy and is always fine
  all those yellow crayons dye your teeth  how much did that shit cost you
      im not having him do it just getting prices and from what he suggested i get the parts at price and pay for the labor my biggest concern is the paint    the 73 nose is a dream i bet whatever crazy price tag he gives me will finally push me to get the 7778 nose    i didnt sign off on anything other than the vacuum unfucking besides yallve told me over and over that my carb is shit so i agree with his suggestion that i need a new carb one that ill get myself
  mine are kinda yellow too all the coffee i drink and smoking i used to do      kek you prick
  cant forget the jalapeno cheese
    pic absofuckinglutely related
  coastie me and my frankenbox are obviously in postion to judge whatever you choose to do with your car aesthetically but i will agree with cutlass that you should hit up mr cliff ruggles dude is the authority on quadrajets literally wrote the book and the book is a great read btw i got it on amazon and learned a lot     jalapeno cheese spread was the shit just hearing that makes me wanna go dig a hole to sleep in outside an crack open a mexican style chicken stew mre
coastie if you pay for shipping you can borrow my demon 850 that i tuned under the promise that you dont fuck with the tune as its for my 440 plymouth
guys i just want to get one last concensus before i put this carb on my ranchero    its a 351 cleveland in stock form is a 750 cfm holley 4160 going to be too much carb for it i got a 750 in case we do heads and cam upgrade later but i dont if/when that will be will a 750 be fine for it even if it ends up staying stock forever i just swapped this one out and its unused so if i need to downgrade i can i think
    thats what the guy said he would look for and thats what ive been looking for as well    and be lucky i dont try a 73 camaro front end and attempt to make a nightshade  though that would be something interesting to see
    i dont think it will be too overkill if it is too much but that is a bit on the large side for a smaller engine like that imo    t chrysler 59 w/ 650 cfm about perfect
as a frankensteiner myself its imperative that you understand the first rule you better know what the fuck youre doing because nobody else will look at the abomination of a delorean i put together as fucked up as lm7s build but i understand it    dont fuck with custom shit you dont understand
  meant to say in no postion to judge    guys i got my micrometers feeler gauges straight edge tee gauges and small bore gauges today not gonna lie im stoked to start building may even start building and selling on cl
  i appreciate it but im trying to go for a more mild carb
  this my teacher for suspension the guy who has been custome building and fabbing for 30 years told me the second i modified anything on the camaro i basically closed myself off from taking it to any shop most people only want to do stock oem troubleshooting and repair where they can just follow the tsb and order oem replacement parts and thats it hence why im in spot i am now fucking around with precision measurement tools trying to get quench heights and all that shit to figure my static compression for boost because   aftermarket cam   aftermarket heads  bored over   recurved ignition   supercharger   shorter 1st gear   shorter rear gear   most shops scream and run the other way at the sight of my engine bay but im totally comfortable since im the guy that built it and its only gonna get worse when i wire in the efi thats the main reason you never buy someone elses project
  everybody here seemed to think 750 was fine last time i asked im just questioning it again because the guy at summit said it was pretty big for a 351 but he also didnt know dick about carbs and had to pull a customer over to help when i was getting it warrantied out the customer who helped said it was a little big but was okay and understood once i told him that we may upgrade in the future    i just dont want the fuel mixture to be completely at the very bottom of the carbs limit in order to run the engine in stock form if that makes sense i dont think that would be good     im pretty sure i could swap it for a 650 if i need to the other carb we installed and had to warranty because of internal failure this one is unused uninstalled so i could probably exchange it or is that not necessary
  gotta fuck with shit to learn though i mean realistically it shouldnt be much harder than a firebird nose swap   fenders are the same across both platforms  90 identical cars  maybe the lower body lines would be harder to match up
    you wont drown the motor in fuel no it should work fine i just meant it was a bit on the big side for that motor    hell my dad has a 650 on the 318 in his roadrunner and thats fine only thing you notice in that is just a hint of a bog when you really stuff it from a standstill but not enough to warrant buying a carb to swap it out
    stahp
  theres a limit i know exactly what im doing with the delorean my rolls royce is on a waiting list to go to a shop that specializes in them because the british know fuck all about how to build a car    im building a 1930s touring car from a 1917 dodge 1950 packard and a 1967 rolls royce with smatterings of other cars 1926 cadillac headlights muncie m22 and some ideas even i think are crazy and a goddamn rolls royce is kicking my ass i know my limitations
  whats wrong with the rolls    wiring
  i appreciate the compliment
  i assume so not getting spark and if i crank it too long it dumps fuel fuck stromberg sidedraft carburetors converted to a downdraft setup
  cant be that hard mate get a power probe
  okay sounds good just to be clear though i wouldnt have to buy another carb just return this one and get another price exchange would basically be a wash but i do want that breathing room in case we do heads and cam which from what i read 750 would be perfect at that point
  also disconnect the fuel line so it doesnt dump while youre turning it over looking for spark
  does the rolls ignition work like modern cars
    nah id stick with what you got like you said it gives you breathing room for the future for me it made sense to go with what matches the motor because im not going to add any go fast parts its overkill as it is
  i legitimately find your car fascinating i dont understand half of it but i get the idea and i love following it    my approach is mechanical good electrical bad i love simple systems outdated parts and the likes
  ive learned alot about modern cars it makes things less scary id love to help you figure out the rolls
  i feel like cosmetic changes arent as dire as mechanical i fuck up a nose swap i just have an ugly car    im considering ordering a sticker set for the ta and i believe matte79 said he used soapy water to put his on do you position the sticker and let the water dry or what    also what color would look better with the purple blue silver or gold
  honestly i dont think it looks bad at all
    its not a conventional ignition system things are routed with pants on head levels of retardation    to give some idea the transmission shifts via a solenoid so that you dont feel the force of mechanical shift linkage everything on this car is like that and rolls royce doesnt publish wiring schematics    i couldnt get it to fire by bypassing the coil either nothing works like it should        not as easy as you think its all banjo bolts and hard lines i dont even know where its coming from
    just sell your car at a loss and save up for an early
  just sell your fucking car and buy what you want you absolute fucking retard
been eyeing 2nd gen firebirds for a long time now and i think im ready to pull the trigger  im not as hardcore as a lot of you guys and just want to dd and already restored classic    the one im looking at is this     25k for an ls1 fuel injected car i dont mind fixing minor things that come up but having a modern transmission  engine is a big deal to me    should i do it
  you could do a lot better for 21k  rule of thumb is to avoid anything made after 78
  you think ive been watching the market and ls1 swapped 2nd gens seem to be hard to come by and the other ones ive seen at 45k  also why avoid    not trying to come off as a defensive dick id just like to be informed before i sink money into this
with as much disgust that i hear about the second gen javelin front fenders it threw me through a loop to see this unholy thing        that car makes me sad so much what the fuckery going on there
wow that paint is awful  the glossy black on the interior with the fucking stickers
    fuck
  25k will buy you a lot of car i think you could find something better than an 80s bird try craigslist
  wow this is like the gayest post ever
   buy a nice firebird for 8k and swap in a 53l for 3k     then sell it for 25k and make a 14k profit lmao
  you could do way better you could do a similar build for like 15k if you do the ls swap yourself
whats everyone think of a 1972 comet or 1969 acadian beaumont they both turned up for sale locally
  if this is bait it worked
  paying 25 grand for something that can be done yourself for 4k
new thread when
ill warm up the oven bread is on the way        how much did your ls swap cost you all in
        new thread
do fog lights work well for driving in thick fog im considering buying an aftermarket set for my car after i had to drive through 100km of pic related
  get an ir camera and an windshield oled 4k display and powerful infrared lights youll see a perfect image of whats around you thats what toyota used to do with their landcrusiers but the screen size was shit back then you can drive around with your actual lights off and still see in the dark
  spend crazy amounts of money on something you will use only 1 of the time youre driving  ok
    fog lights are a meme     they do let you see a little in front of you but not enough just go the speed limit and pray
  just go the speed limit and pray  he doesnt drive the togue roads at high speeds exclusively when its foggy out  he doesnt enjoy the thrill of knowing that death could be around any corner  fucking casuals
he didnt do a foglight delete  fag
  rear fog lights  front fog lights    first priority keep some moron from rearending you
every third car on the road is a crossover
crossovers are unironically fine    the world is 99 normies get over it
  crossovers are npc cars it shows that you have no taste and fell for the practicality meme even though you only use it to go back and forth from work
  every second car here is just a pickup     rednecks are the only ones who know how to do it right they skip the crossover segment entirely and opt for full fledged suvs and trucks
they wont go away as long as people keep buying them they will keep making them
  a friend of mine got an mx5 less than 2 years later he got a biturbo quattro audi because he couldnt stand the mazda
i bought a fiesta but its too little too late /o/ will have a spergout when the next cheap shitboxes are all crossovers
  i bought one of the last sonics dealership couldnt fucking wait to get rid of it they gave it to me brand new for way under msrp
  2/3 cars on the road are cuckmobiles  seeing at least two dozen electrics a day  80 automatics everywhere
  most of the 90s cars have vanished in richfagzone and its just your mint condition sc400 left in a sea of belugas and cuckovers   yep 1uzfe was a good motor selects seiko matsuda live cd from cd changer siip ahh nakamichi sound they dont make those tape decks like they used to
was behind an x4 the other day in traffic almost threw up true story
  its women who cant drive excursions
  my moms dailied excursions since 2002 kinda wish theyd make a new one
  women love burbs and escalades i rarely see men driving them
boomers are the only ones who can afford to buy new cars and they love crossovers
  3/4 of the trucks on the road are driven by white women who cant drive
  normies like being up high  for instance the crosstrek out sells the regular impreza by 40k units theyre the same thing one is just slightly taller  from what i gather its mostly older people who dont want to bend over to get into a car and women who like having a more commanding view of the road despite it disadvantaging other people they also feel safer the more disconnected they are from the road and the more steel they have around them   personally i fear what future there is for automotive enthusiasts there will be no cheap fun shitboxes left in north america since theres no entry point higher end sports car sales will plummet even further more and more cars have autonomous features eventually driving will be made illegal all together   soon our hobby will be forgotten but well go out kicking and screaming on the day driving is made illegal well ride gloriously to the gates of valhalla shiny and chrome
  daily reminder its your fault for refusing to buy new cars with manual transmissions emphasis on the new  manufactures dont give a shit about keyboard warriors who only buy used
if everyone drove a cool car they wouldnt be cool anymore the normies in crossovers only enhances your own vehicles uniqueness
  women who like having a more commanding view of the road  women have shit depth perception and spatial/situational awareness looking down is easier than looking forward for them they literally look down at the road to see how much road is between them and the next car
    ironic that you posted literally the single most uncool car ever made by human beings or any other carbonbased lifeform in this galaxy         this x100 women are universally shit drivers no exceptions they pick vehicles that will be forgiving when they fuck up including keeping them safe
remember you all chose this not the manufacturers if youre not going to buy their sports cars then they have no choice but to make other things so stop whining
battery not charging brake and battery dashlights are on and i changed my alternator about a week ago what do    prev dead thread   sollutions like buy new battery didnt work i tried today pls help
  new battery self fitted new alternator no battery charge   have a mechanic check your work    my thoughts process is did you know your alternator was faulty in the first place did you check first your old battery could hold a charge maybe the battery was exhausted and didnt need a new alternator but your fitting of the alternator might have created a new problem if youve not fitted it correctly battery running flat new alternator no joy new battery no joy it still could have been the battery in the first place but youve created a new problem if the alternator is fine fitted right the battery is fine fitted right did it start with a new battery but then run flat then its check everything in between     did it start with the battery at least    once i fitted new battery didnt work fitted new battery didnt work the problem was battery connectors needed to be very tight to grip pins tightened battery connectors up a half turn more it all lit up just saying     it could be that simple
  mechanic fitted new alternator old one was blocked changed alternator with belt had car taken to the mech said alternator is fried put a new one took car back home  you can guess i am fairly pissed about paying again for an alternator problem given its new
  mechanic fitted new alternator  you what ive found your problem

this thread is sure to be filled with enriching and intelligent discussion
  this any time you ask an owner about specs all he can say is the 060 time and how much it shits on other cars

all cuckovers
  cuckovers are for soccermoms not söys
    a basedboy numale buys a crossover for her wife so she can go out on a trip with chad while he stays at home playing switch    that way chad doesnt have to sell his truck or sports car and she can drive something that fits their bags
  any financed econobox/cuv
  smart car is about as s0 y as it gets effeminate and pretentious
  okay what how do you get jeep to onions
  some pretentious daddys money douche drives his around with the factory zero emissions plate still on the back no state plate been like that for a year he needs to get pulled over
  you should like goto police accademy and become a cop and to be that somebody instead of waiting for a hand me out like some daddies money
according to /o/ any subaru that isnt a wrx

just saw an ad for the new audi electric crossover  its got four motors man your car only has one engine  this thing has an nvidia chip in the dash that would put your gaming rig to shame man  thisll take me to the convention no problem  i hated every second of it
  they literally advertised to carpet munchers
  came here to post this
  litercuck      why dis the legacy of one of the best sounding and driving pure sports cars for a meme engine that is known to blow up from upping the boost 1psi when you have a perfectly fine and powerful high revving flat plane v8 and actually makes sense to use since the original had an insane exhaust arrangement to mimic the scavenging of a flat plane v8
  yeah maybe back in the early 00s mainly with the foresters/outbacks i think theyve stopped doing that now
golf and any bmw
tesla is the only correct answer i have never seen a more drab looking vehicle in my life  all that new tech at production level with insignia body ugliness
  all that new tech at production level  pls
  this people who buy crossovers are people who deeply despise driving and aesthetics  those are either women or s o i s
  other than the brz someone saying the 370z is better and a nissan scum post just about toss a twingo reaction image in there for good measure
  i saw another ad for the new q5 ev    the commercial starts with a bunch of people who look like the definition of basedboy standing around the car with the hood propped  each one listing off specs about the car   quad motors awd  060 in 55 seconds  no emissions  they all start gawking at the car and the commercial ends
  it wasnt the q5 sorry it was the new etron

now what
been dailying my 1977 chevy malibu for a little over a year now gas is getting pricy and i might be looking to tag it as historic and buy a beater everything is oem and i do my own maintenance regularly if i were to end up selling what do you think i could list it as pic taken three months ago
  selling it  op dont be a fag there are other solutioins to your problem  want to keep it oem  if no drop a newer engine in there boomers be damned if yes then keep it stock and in that case  have enough money to buy a beater  if yes buy a beater tag it as historic and use it as a weekend car to cruise around rather than a daily
just hook up a fitech to it for better gas mileage and get hagerty for cheap insurance
  2  3k if you hang on for the right buyer
  been dailying my 1977 chevy malibu for a little over a year now gas is getting pricy  replace the 3spd with a 4spd th2004r no need to change the driveshaft just slide the crossmember back and install the tv bracket that millions of gm vehicles came with  if the car has 2411 fd now later on you can install 3421 fd for better acceleration and a fd of 2291 in od on the highway
can you swap a 4bt
  i could lmao ive got enough room for most anything id like to put in there id rather ls or chevy small block swap though fuel injection would be nice but id have to put an ecu etc in
  gas getting pricy  ls or small block  pls if you want to save up on gas youll need to settle on something with equal or more power but less fuel consumption
  fuck off buddy
  why its a 140 hp smog era ugly and to top it off 4 door malibu    not exactly in high demand
  i cant help you but i just wanna say that car is fucking beautiful
  hay guise give me opinions  fuck you i dont like your opinion    kek retard

well if its illegal in europe cant you lobby your local government to make it legal why would you have such silly arbitrary laws about things that are basically just commodities
  who gives a shit about urup
  learn how to post faggot
  holy fuck youre a retarded faggot
  this is the quality of posting via dubayew dubayew dubayew dot four chan ell dot cawm
  underrated post
if its illegal in yurop how did it set a nurburgring time
  gt2rs amg gtr gt3rs z06these cars are street legal but zl1 is track only like gt3cup
why is it that gas is so expensive around the world  should i buy a model 3
  so expensive around the world  it literally went up 5 fucking cents the french are just morons who will take any excuse to go on strike and then have urban guerilla with the police  should i buy a model 3  lolno
  the price increases have been a trend around the european and asian countries i hope that america isnt next on the list
  im sorry where do you get your news from because gasoline hasnt increased a single cent here its stuck at 159 euros per liter
  the rest of the world refuses to smoke saudi pole    t burger
  macron if you cant afford petrol/diesel then buy a tesla  marie antoinette if they have no bread let them eat cake    and the leftist capitalists still dont get why the people of france want macron and the other liberal capitalists dead
  159 eu/l  holy shit i just did that conversation gas in america is less than half of what you pay get fucked europoors
  i hope that your city isnt next ill keep you in my prayers
  and macaroni wants to boost it to 170 per liter  just watch what happend in france yesterday if you want to know what people think of macron and his liberal capitalist friends
  this made no sense at all youre oversimplifing the whole current issue
gas is cheap in the us turns out kashoggi blood is a great additive
  my city  it helps not living in a metropolitain hellhole like milan or rome it could be even cheaper if there was some form of reliable public transporation around here
they can kill another reporter if it means gas prices drop again just filled up for 188/gal in texas
  its actually gone down from 127/129 to 121p/l in my area
  are you german
  centralsouthern italy the only downside is having rome near me and having romans swamp the region during the holidays to buy good stuff for cheap but other than that its one of the best places to be
  
  fuel just dropped 5p a litre in the uk sucks for the frenchies i guess
  that site says gasoline went down 3 in the last month
  last month frances largest refinery shut down last week because theres no glaciers left to feed the rhine europe has been overpopulated for decades now
  europe has been overpopulated for decades now  and this dried the rhine how
gas went down where i live in canada  only cost 80 to fill my old f150 instead of 100
  look up the river stones and how did you make that jump
get this you fags emperor macaroon is planning on shutting down 14 out of 19 nuclear plants also energy has now become a luxury in europe even the newscasters in de refer to it that way the elite want you to die never forget that
  the river stones  stones from a river yes  what did they dry out the rhine did they overpopulate europe  hahahaha dude learn to write in normal sentences if you want people to understand you
  the overpopulation quip was just a observation im sorry you cant draw conclusions from the effects of an expanding population and a shrinking resource pool
  the elite want you to die  implying millenials didnt want to die in the first place theres no need from the elite to put effort into it
  such is the lifestyle they promote at every opportunity
  that other guy isnt me    
  you know im more than happy that france is shutting those off but they have no plan to replace their output they have the necessary sources such as rivers wind places where its sunny and so on but no theyre just gonna shut the plants down with no replacement at all
  show the one year chart keep in mind these protests came at record low oil prices
  regardless all i said was that oil prices in the uk where i live went down last month and that the chart you sent me if anything supported that
  petrol prices
  expensive    taxed or not its cheap unless youd prefer to find some oil and refine it yourself
  i sent you a diesel link but heres another if you somehow dont believe me  
  yes and im not sure why because i replied to the op post which discusses gas prices petrol
lol gas is cheap in the us we could make enough on our own with out saudi but they sell the cheapest especially recently     too bad i live in a rural area and have to use premium two things that jewish gas station owners love    recently ive paid less than 289 a gallon for 93 octane so thats pretty good
  93 is considered premium in america  developed country hahahahabab
  go ahead and ignore the 60 of the market then youre the one that cant understand a futures chart and thinks that uk lowering petrol by 2p by the supermarket chains is doing them a favor when petrol has went down over 5p wow arent they generous
  it was 127 last week this week it was 121 thats 6p unless you feel like disputing that too
  lol are you mad or something peasant energy should be prohibitively expensive only the upper class deserve to have electricity
  youre a retard and you should feel bad for saying that     octane ratings are not the same between the us and europe slightly different scales are uses     98/100 in europe is equal to 93 octane us     
     capitalist    bbut libs are communists
  im not disputing that petrol prices in the uk have disproportionately risen this year in direct contrast with historically low oil prices cant really explain that away can you
  jews are hyper liberal capitalists  jews are also the leaders of communist parties  you cant win goy dont even try
  im not explaining anything i simply made the observation that fuel prices in my area went down and then you sent me a link to a website supporting that    im not sure what else you want from this exchange    either way im done
  but they havent went down in comparison to oil prices youre paying more now than you were a year ago micro transactions are not an indicator of macro trends your ancestors would be ashamed of you for not cheering the burning of france
  you will always be a european union colony now anglo
  hahaha stupid terrone i pay 153 and i live in the norf
rapefugees arent going to pay themselves
gas is 2 gallon here
  south central italy  near rome
  around 60 of our gas price is taxes in germany if yellow vest protests spread further i will participate
  so underrated lol
  its not just about the fuel prices the msm just wants to make it sound like they are rioting over petty causes
  whats that cant hear you over the sound of your blocco a tutte le auto meno di euro 3    that literally is the definition of southern central italy the south begins with molise and the bottom parts of the provinces of frosinone and latina
  be american  be slave to driving  this is somehow a good thing
  be slave to driving    you know thats a good thing here right you know where you are right do we need to call 911
  be 1850  be poor  be a slave to walking  this is somehow a good thing
  t angry busrider
  lmao good luck ending like syria
  rome isnt below the po
  oh look another fucking old school leghista what your hamster wheel brain calls emiliani romagnoli and toscani terroni as well
  jokes on you syria is safer than the usa
  only south italians
  by your definition everything below the po which includes emiliaromagna and tuscany is south italy
  yes thats how the two words are assigned
  so logical connection dictates that emiliani romagnoli and toscani are terroni as well to you
  everything above the po is polentone everything below is terrone  how else would it be
  great glad to know you have the average culture of a lega voter which is absolutely zero have a nice day and dont forget your blue pill
  so then educate me how else would it be
  above the po is north between the po and molise/bottom halves of the provinces of frosinone and latina is centre below molise/bottom halves of the provinces of frosinone and latina is south we in the center have literally nothing in common with the south
  ah i see a butthurt terrone  keep crying bitch nigger maybe someday youll be as developed as the rest of italy
dfw baznia  dfw ron 95 was 09 yuros this time last year  dfw its 11 at best nowadays  nobody fucking did anything about it other than blocking a couple of roundabouts or something    why the f u c k are people that objectively live much worse than the frenchies not protesting
  because you can still afford gas and have no niggers in your country
  because if your life is shit then you have more important things to worry about if you have a better life then mundane shit that goes wrong seems like war crimes
  if there was someone between us who had to cry thatd be you enjoy being a cultureless cretin forced to live in metropolitan hellholes with awful environment alongside your blocchi del traffico
    i suppose that this is just a symptom of our unwillingness to resist governmental abuse of power in general but sometimes i honestly wish for a happening just so we could get off our asses
  literally thousand percent better quality of life   i somehow be the one who has to cry  go back to romania or arabia or wherever you come from maybe the south could recover if there would be less of you cucks down there
  i have been driving my euro 2 diesel even near city centres and no one cares  they even have a road plan of allowed routes which is literally a normative loophole because neither coppers nor citizens can realistically remember all the unrestricted roads in lombardy  signals are nonexistent and unless you live in a supercucked city like milan with orwellian cctv systems then you can do what you want and disregard those limits at will
  imagine being this retarded
  freedom is slavery
    fuck these people not because they are rioting but because they vote for socialists like macron and get angry the policies they voted for get enacted     le pen would have been a much better option
  macron  socialist  pic related is you hes a fucking ultracapitalist neoliberal
  why are you happy theyre shut off its the least expensive form of energy generation
  muh nucular power boogeyman
who else thinks this will be a disappointing flop
cant be more disappointing than the new civic
  its a corolla people lap that shit up no matter what
to performance focused enthusiats yes    but it will likely be just like every corolla ever all the car that most people really need and run forever with regular attention to consumable parts
  some things sell themselves why should they do anything different
its a sedan in 2018 no one will buy it
  lolno
  i think its going to sell like hot cakes
  corolla  flop  kek
  i see way more kia and hyundai sedans than corollas and even they are selling like shit compared to crossovers
  massive success worldwide  disappointing to one random weeb  how will honda recover
  yeah your eyes are more reliable than these numbers 
  they could roll out a lawn chair strapped to a red ryder wagon and as long as it has a corolla badge people are gonna scoop that up like their lives depended on it
  corolla civic and camry are the only 3 sedans in the top 10 best selling vehicles in america     
  because itll run with minimal maintenance for 15 years no issue
    do these count fleet/work vehicles because that would make a huge difference on pickups
  i owned a 2002 highlander for 16 years sold it this summer for 3500     thing ran like a top and sounded brand new until i handed over the title    oil brakes tires toyota is best brand
  fuck youre old
  happens to the best of us
  you know thats not true for modern cars their tolerances are a lot tighter so you really need to stay on top of the maintenance were not talking mid 2000s built to last cars here
its just a sedan form of their new sports hatch the engine is only 169hp stock and doesnt even have the famous toyota vvtli why should i care about it or the hatch
  i know im sorry what do you drive now
  i daily a motorbike yamaha fz07
  the new engine will be shit on by a cvt transmission if they put a traditional automatic in instead id buy it day one
  it has a brand new 6 speed manuel as an option
  did someone touch you so butthurt get rekt
  does manuel shift for me    jokes aside its a corolla nobody is buying it for fun
  the sixspeed manual in the outgoing corolla im was a disaster  sloppy throws a vague clutch pedal with uneven weight and unclear gates for gears all of which made it very easy to miss shifts even for someone like me who first learned to drive on a manual those issues have all been addressed with the new sixspeed manual in the corolla hatchback it feels tighter and each gear change comes with an added mechanical notchiness which is a welcome change  from test driver of 2019 corolla manual transmission they said its a good car to learn manual on

1get financing ahead of time/know your credit you always want to have a financing option in hand before you go to a dealership nothing wrong with negotiating a better deal with them once you get there but never go in empty handed this way you can have idea of how much you can afford to spend and what a car is going to cost you    2do your research know what values kbb/nada/edmunds/truecar are listing for the cars you are interested in also know what other dealerships are listing similar cars for dealerships will prey on the uninformed so make sure that you are    2bif you dont know enough about cars to inspect one yourself arrange to get any used car inspected or bring someone who does know what to look for its surprisingly easy to polish up a turd and get it passed inexperienced eyes     3never take the first offer unless its a place like carmax that doesnt negotiate dealerships know the game and they always get a certain number of people to bite on the first offer make them work a little to get your business    4you can negotiate on more than the price oil changes services plans warranties accessories are all fair game     5in todays world internet sales departments are your friend you can send a blanket email to 3 or 4 dealerships and get them to compete for your business let them haggle with each other before you ever haggle with them    6get them to print you a buyers order for any car you are seriously that is what you negotiate from it will look like pic related and itemize every line of the sale dont let them 4 square you or hand write shit on a piece of paper get a buyers order    7never be afraid to walk away from a deal if you have a bad feeling sleep on it there will always be other cars
need a vin checked search the catalog  for an existing vin check thread before making your own
tried this yesterday but it pretty much went racial   this is a serious issue in the us people using their 3500lb cars as bumper cars drivers fighting like children over who owns what lane     what do you think the solution could be
  what do you think the solution could be    more guns
  if alphonse targets your thread youre doomed sorry it happened to you just ignore him and hell go away after a while my solution is ignore the common rabble and work something other than an 85 shift so you never see much traffic
  barrett m82 prototype nice
  so everyone would need to work different hours   road rage is huge in the us its not just 1 in a 100 its like 8 in 10 people
  pass new law  road rage is now first degree felony  watch as prisons fill to the brim with manchildren who cant control their emotions without outbursts of physical violence  battered housewives tell the local news about how their husband dindu nuffin  would be so beautiful itd bring a tear to my eye
seems safe on the interstate
  what do we do then with waayyyy overfilled prisons do we allow all prisons to become private or do we pay more taxes so these children can watch cable
concealed carry
  1st road rage incident  lose license for a month  2nd  for one year  3rd  15 years
  to long to read   we should all have concealed carry
  how is an incident noted most dont have the police called   should every car have a dashcam and you just hit send of the incident and that reports it
  most dont have the police called  isnt this true for most illegal road incidents though you dont call the police when you see someone burning a red light or speeding
  i lived in the 4th largest city in the us aside from tailgating usually more annoying than anything and occasional brake checking ive never seen road rage go violent only time i saw anything close was my old boss brake checked this black women for almost hitting him coming off the highway and then yelled at her to fuck off when she got next to him
  hey charlie try not to cut yourself on that edge 
  yes privatize them most of the offenders will be tradesmen coming off a booze bender so we can use slave labor to force them into repairing the countrys dying infrastructure for a fraction of the cost of contracting government workers to do it two birds with one stone
  yes it is true but were talking about road rage not blowing red lights now if that driver that went through the red light caused road rage from another child then sure we can discuss that
  give them 8x8 concrete rooms with a bed toilet and sink nothing more they want entertainment give them a library they want to shorten their sentence make them do community service only for non violent crimes aside from that they get 3 meals a day 1 hour of recreational time so just a gym and a courtyard its prison its not suppose to be pleasant why would they even get cable
  so what do we do about this   its a problem now and watching a lot of road rage videos it seems to be people think they own the lane they are in
  why wouldnt you conceal carry
  my point is most road incidents dont result in the police getting called that doesnt mean we cant have laws
  why do you have to ruin it hun
      ive been watching a lot of road rage videos  guess your euro shithole is 100 muslim based on the videos ive been watching then
  i feel the court system and jail system now is like trying to kill 1 bird with 18 stones
  fix the educational system and legal system teach people to properly solve problems control their emotions and to not be niggers and alot of our issues will be fixed as for the legal system fix the cluster cucked beuacracy so people actually fear/respect it and will be less prone to doing bigger activities i personally view niggers as anyone who acts like how we view a nigger not by race but by actions
  so how do you suggest we have new laws regarding road rage   not being a dick but if your suggesting it give me some ideas you have
its not theyre rioting in the streets over taxing fuel and shutting off the supply of diesel to europe
  confused  all white people in the screenshots
  its prison its not suppose to be pleasant  because liberals think offenders needed to be treated humanely for some reason
  only for really bad stuff if a car is totaled but usually someone involved has already called i once saw this guy beating the living shit out of his wife in his pick up just straight up punch after punch when he wasnt moving when he was he was either swerving around or going way to fast the first encounter with him he was going twice the speed limit and almost rearended me called the cops after he passed me and i saw him hitting on his wife
  dont you think we will have self driving cars by the time the next generation capable of controlling their anger is of legal age
  im talking about your country not your cherrypicked video screenshots
  i live in the eastern united states sweetie
  im not saying beat them to wake them up treat them as humans but do not give them any luxuries they wake up eat go to class/community service then lunch get recreational time to read/workout or just chill more class/community service the dinner and lights out at 10 no tv no radio no luxuries and one visitation day a week
ahh yes the concern troll thread always a daily staple
  learn how to drive  dont be an asshole  problem solved
  maybe if theyre properly educated theyll understand the joys of life and will actually enjoy freedoms like driving and will revive the country
  you can leave buttercup 
  its like your just hitting the easy button   list some in depth solutions if your going to do that
  no you do not this thread reeks of euro
  that would be great but its not the direction the human race is going solutions need to be more enforcement i believe
  you do not have to believe me doesnt really rattle my balls either way
  i believe or atleast hope that were going to reach a point were its impossible to not realize how fucked our society is and were going to have a massive cultural shift thatll fix all this sjw liberal muh feels problems that are going on and that broken systems like education and courts will be fixed but unfortunately i doubt it i think society will just become a numb obedient mass that follows whoever has the most likes and is the most tolerant
  pleses sir my family is of american variety for 1000 years
    rent free baby
  honestly anon i hope that does happen i feel like were at the point where we are teetering on what is wrong with society
  for some reason  on bastoy prison island in norway the prisoners some of whom are murderers and rapists live in conditions that critics brand cushy and luxurious yet it has by far the lowest reoffending rate in europe
  i would love someone to get out of their car and try and attack me just so i can destroy their door and drive off laughing at them
  norway one of the whitest places on earth  ftfy
here is a nice euro road rage incident
  omg an epidemic how do we stop this
  i can see people realizing it i just graduated in june and even in our houston suburb high school we had constant discussions about how fucked our society was and how to fix it people arent as blind as some seem to think i just hope that sjws and all this blackmailing going on in this day and age doesnt scare people into silence these next 1020 years will define our world far more than any can predict when has humanity ever had this much access to technology information and transportation it pretty much throws out anything from 40 years ago out the window because they couldnt even imagine a world like what we have today
  euro  russian plates
  ban assault bats   for the win
  why are you taking screenshots of youtube videos instead of just linking them
  lowest reoffending rate in europe  how long is the average sentence though we have a detention center here in washington that houses child rapists and other violent sexual offenders and it has a very low reoffending rate but thats because most of them have an indefinite sentence and a release date is up to the decision of a panel which usually denies the offenders
  mandatory dashcams in the us too
  sorry cutie neither apply to me      unless you want to watch 45 mins of videos   ill link them
      i got for both of us after we were hit by a drunk driver
  youre pretty dumb
  heres a classic who would agree that punching that nazi in the throat wouldnt not be inappropriate road rage isint always bad     
  ok
  implying its americans making constant threads about euros and not the other way around  stealing memes doesnt help you fit in
  8/10 would be anarchy like collapse of society lmao its my personal solution even driving 85 in a big city ive never seen it
  literally seething
  what do you think the solution could be  literally isnt onejust take care of you and yours and if your prone to road rage yourself try to work on it pic related
  ive never been involved in a road rage incident doesnt mean i cant still be for trying to stop it   ya know
cant happen so long as the courts can be paid off     asshole nearly hit me doing crazy shit and i took em to court as a witness they kept dragging it out making me miss work to be in court then they filed a ticket against me their lawyer threatened to drag it out forever if i didnt agree to both plead the 5th    100 certain they didnt learn their lesson
  explain more please   they almost hit you you took them to court and got fucked
  you have no clue whats going on in the world outside of your little bubble

  the inccdent  there was a graduation so there were way more cars than should ever be on that street i was behind them had literally just turned onto the street they were on and behind them i didnt know it but they instantly decided that i was tailgateing them at that moment i know everyone says youre not telling the truth but this happened in the space of half a block i really wasnt i got a big ole sign on my car and was driving a really recognizable/describable car it aint happenin they pulled over almost immediately which i appreciated since i was delivering and waved a thanks then they sped up behind me getting next to me driving the wrong way on the street in a street which now could barley get two cars side by side other cars had to stop or they would be hit  they were pushing me off the road and trying to cut me off/hit my front quarter panel and only didnt succeed because i knew the area and took a real sharp evasive turn  i shut off my car got out taking a picture of the plate number and told them to wait for the police they tried to evade and then later lied to the officer when i called them to report the evading insisting they were looking for a spot that wasnt permit parking i grew up on that street and know there is zero permit parking in the whole fucking town she didnt  aftermath  cops came they talked to the police first and admitted to what they had done cop then talked to me and said i should go down to the station after my shift and make a report which i did  later the two of us speaking to the processer they were all apologetic and willing to bargain until they found out i wasnt getting in trouble then suddenly a whole story comes out about how they have ms and were frightened for their life because of how i was acting sitting on my hood waiting for the police now i get a ticket and now i have to go to court even if its tossed i would be losing the court fees and could have points on licens
  they later called my place of work demanding to know my plate numbers my home address and other information they did this about 10 times and on the 10th time the police answered and ordered them to stop harassing me  even after all that they explained to me in the courtroom that they were going to try to get me for all the money i had that they had a lot of money and were very angry that i made them late to the private school graduation she was trying to find a spot for and would do everything within their power to ruin my life and eventually i couldnt keep missing work to go to court and apparently none of the evidence was admissible because my store to which they were placing calls was in a different town than the incident and the two police departments refused to cooperate with each other  look on my face when the judge said his and no one is forcing you to plead the 5th was fucking priceless    god bless america whoever has the most money wins  they must have stood losing their license or something to fight that hard that or they were really mad someone with a garbage car dared to be in the same town as them   i should have killed them
  should have let them hit your quarter they never would have because they are soft much like you    this is why i like beaters i would have pushed them into a parked car and kept driving
  i should have killed them    you didnt even have the balls to let them try and hit your car
  only time you can call the popo is when youre being targeted during non traffic times  but they will be on that fuckers ass in 30 seconds  next time guys fuck cc if you get into ine of these situations outside rush hour call the cops dont fuck up your car because of some retard then press charges and sue for endangering your life  also they made it at least here in ny approaching another vehicles window is grounds for assault and you can be jailed minimum two years a lot of people had glass getting shattered and flying in their eyes  but what bothers me the most is people do road rage but they wont beap at the fucked sitting at a green light
  i delivered pizza in that car and i loved it a dent like that would mean broken lights and would mean endless tickets from cops wouldnt be able to work  couldnt risk it lived out of my old car for a bit and was forced to sell that because it had a nick in the windshield and the tickets from the cops priced me out
  thats retarded dude
  whats retarded is getting dragged through the court system over literally nothing    literally nothing
  attempted murder is a crime even if you dont succeed dude you shouldnt be able to act that way and get away scott free  or me my job and car isnt worth it
  what is the ticket for
  rape is okay if youre white  okay 
  murder my big balls i didnt say push them off a cliff you fucking cuck    wow no wonder you got dragged through court and ticketed into oblivion while living in your car    youre a big ass bitch it would seem    im literally shocked at how passive people are these days    let some cunt tell me shes rich and shell ruin my life that little whore would be iny fucking basement till daddy brings me a ransom
  reckless driving and they were gonna sue me in a separate case its all bullshit but i needed to work i was tired of sitting through court that tickets could have lost me my job
  so you took the rap
  defensive driving is a virtue
  forced into pleading the 5th with the understanding they would too so it had to be thrown out after all that
  so nothing happened one day you might learn to not poke an angry bear you should have went home in the meantime get a dash cam
    get a front and rear dash cam good quality one make sure its always working time and date are correct     got hit by drunk driver couldnt prove to the police who was driving as they both ended up in the back seat  one had insurance and one didnt neither had valid licences
  licenses  in the middle of repainting fireplace
  no confession  unprompted to the arriving officer should have been enough they should have been arrested on sight
  youre a dumbfuck for even stopping
  why im dumb for stopping  im dumb for not getting hit why im working and some rich asshole tries to kill me on the suburban kidfilled street i grew up on no man you cant act like that
  youre not dumb for stopping but what did you think you would get out of it when you decided to stop and ring the pd
  rich country nonexistant class divide and a shitton of national capitalist propaganda  its not worth to do crime bcus living standard is very high here
  because youre full of white people
  dunno justice from the justice system to show em there are consequences to actions 
  country with the most shootings already  also has the most guns  lets add moar gunz1
literally let them kill each other    i wont be happy until were mad max levels of violence

  ban knives  intensify efforts  crime rises  shocking
  what do we do then with waayyyy overfilled prisons  they have early release and more generous parole terms in order to empty the prisons so that the mandatory minimum sentence prisoners can then be put in the prison     its difficult to construct new jails and prisons or to expand existing ones those get blocked by activists and naacp my county needed more jail space but the naacp not only blocked it successfully but also tried to reduce the number of beds at the existing jail the logic was that the fewer the number of jail cells the fewer blacks will be jailed and theyre right many prisoners get released early because some crimes have these stupid minimum mandatory jail time which the judge is not allowed to reduce
bmw driver furious at me riding my ass  tries to cut between double yellow lines to get in front of me  flies past me when lanes open up and brakes in front of me  storming towards my car yelling  gets up to my window  grab my shitty uncomfortable to hold glock 20  tell him to go back to his car  he storms off calling me a faggot  my one and only time actually having to use my gun to get somebody off me its also my first road rage incident
  i hate holding a glock as well which is why i went with a few used mps
  my father has a beretta m9 dunno what variant probably a3 and that fucker jams every 3rd or 4th round atleast its comfortable to hold
  you only need one round to kill some angry bimmer faggot approaching your car
  i tried one a few years ago because i loved the way they look but for me it kinda sucked felt weird and felt like the slide could take the meat of my thumb off at anytime
  but what if youre a /k/ fag that couldnt hit a car with a 12 gauge from a foot a way
  weak baby wrists shit mags or you are actually dumber than army grunts and managed to fuck it up somehow
  weve got the mags that came with the gun instructor fired it only for it to jam halfway in father had the same problem its irrelevant to me not my gun
    8 out of 10 people are involved in violent road rage incidents        80 of people experienced road rage at some point in the last year only 4 actually got out of their car 3 actually attempted to bump or ram someone     getting angry at a minivan cruising in the passing lane / violence attempting to ram the minivan is violence and that only accounts for 3 of drivers 3 / 80
  if only we could find a logical way to do that it might just work not just for rush hour alleviation but for the fact that i cant get to a fucking bank or pretty much anything after work because its all closed    i dont pretend to know how we would organize staggered business hours but imagine the ability to actually go do shit after you get home from the garage    government offices especially should not have fucking 9 to 5 hours thats retarded you have to take time off work to do anything which only works against the nations gdp
  take it to a gunsmith its basically a paperweight at this point   its iirrelevant  i truly honestly believe from the bottom of my heart that you should kill yourself
    whatch out there bud wouldnt want to nick yourself with all that edge dont you have homework to do
  did you make sure to load it with 9x19 you seem dumb enough to try the wrong caliber
  80 of people experienced road rage at some point in the last year    fin
  sweetie relax go be a fag on /douche/ if you want
    you should be driving defensibly in the first place to help avoid even being in a road rage incident never trust that another driver can see you keep a respectable following distance and dont drive like an ass hat thatll help prevent you from causing road rage     for the times when the aforementioned doesnt work the solution is to avoid being aggressive and go on with your day like an adult i just want to drive to the store/work/titty bar its not a dick swinging competition i dont feel like getting in a fist fight on the side of the road or talking to the insurance man about my wrecked car if someone tailgates you move over and let them pass if they follow you go somewhere public like a police department fire station or hospital call the police and dont get out of your car if they start hitting your car take a picture of their license plate stay inside the car and call the police if it gets to the point that they start assaulting you you have no other options and you feel your life is in danger that is the only time you would escalate to lethal force you gave them every option to not be a cunt but thats the life they decided to choose
    10/10 reading comprehension there m8 80 of people experiencing road rage does not mean 80 of people got violent want me to grab some crayons and draw some pictures for you
  how do we handle road rage   keep driving and keep your windows rolled up   b bb but theyre yelling at you   who cares if your life is not in danger keepn driving   conceal carry   even more of a reason to keep driving unless your in a life or death situation sometimes people let their emotions get the better of them dont be that person
  sweetie please copy and paste where i wrote violent   enough with your bullshit   patiently awaiting your response
  sweetie relax  go be a fag
  youre doing the yellow text all wrong hun

i tried to fight my dad and he kicked my fucking ass
    what do you think the solution could be    people are too comfortable and too bored so they go out of their way to create an uncomfortable situation so that they can feel alive same reason why people sky dive or bungee jump

i road rage on multiple people on my daily commute home mostly for going too slow in the left lane and for being slow off the line when the light turns red
  what about people signaling a right turn in a right turn only lane but not going when able to
hardly ever an issue
  do you own the left lane stop acting like a child
  
  the left lane is for going fast and my time is valuable
  its a beautiful story
    self driving cars
  he take your tendies
  usa has even more niggers though so probably not
  you should purchase nonlethal weapons like pepper spray or a taser and then stun him and kick his ass while hes incapacitated
  its for passing
  we all know its not valuable    drive safe and not like a dick anon

  country with the most muzzie attacks already  lets bring in even more muzzies
  getting angry is considered violence when you have as much estrogen as the average eurofag
  you are completely correct   you are a huge pussy and youre reminding me of adam goldberg when he got his ass beat in that one movie
  youre a dumbfuck for real
  make prisoners pay their way through slavery  dont try and pretend its not a good solution its the perfect solution
    why
  delete cheap automatic cars or require licenses to only be issued on a manual    it would eliminate so many bad drivers
   you should have let him hit your car and whipped his ass or get on with your life no harm no foul the fact that you felt wronged and didnt confront the other party by yourself but instead wanted authorities to pursue it to make them get what they deserve is so beta lastly the fact that you let their lawyer intimidate your airtight case is just sad as fuck  you deserved everything that happened and learned nothing
  i just move over to the slow lane and get out of their way do everything i can to deescalate if someone is raging at me for some reason 99 of the time when road rage actually causes a traffic accident or fight its because both sides continued to escalate the situation until one or both of them lost their shit ive got stuff to do and have no time for dealing with road rage drama
  i saw 2 morons in lifted brotrucks trying to run each other off the road in the dallas area one friday evening each one took turns trying to push the other into the shoulder and then trying to overtake and then brakecheck the other it was so monumentally stupid that i had to follow them when they both took the same exit and drove into a nearby empty parking lot they yelled at each other for a bit and then they both peeled out and headed separate directions one of them almost sideswiped my car while he was fishtailing his truck it was in that moment that i realized that i was almost as stupid as they were for following them
  totally agree anon most road rage incidents happen because both sides are children
  just have to keep your distance anon   dash cams are always a good idea
  good solution anon
  she  theres your explanation if it was man vs man or god forbid man vs woman agressor even if it didnt end in death would have been booked for 1520
  but what bothers me the most is people do road rage but they wont beap at the fucked sitting at a green light    thats because the next car in line is also distracted by their facebooks
  this is true took a while for someone to say
  if you drive with your windows open on the freeway your probably an asshole anyway
  im not risking my property and job i dont want to live in my car or a tent again kid  being a ragey cagey and escalating it to a fist fight is child tier what benefit would that provide me    i didnt want revenge i wanted justice  which should have meant loss of their license  which keeps the neighborhood safe especially for the kids who play on that street i cant take that away by fighting    this isnt a schoolyard grudge match
    found the incels
  dont like an ass hole is how i avoid road rage
go on a quick freezeout motorcycle ride in my small town 15k pop largest city for 30 miles a few winters ago  riding down one of the main roads in town 4 lanes  center turn lane  get behind beat up old red chevy pickup truck thats going like 25 mph in a 45 mph zone  passenger of the truck is leaning out of the window yelling at the driver of a pickup truck in the lane next to him  passenger of truck in front of me and driver of truck in the other lane yell at each other until they come to a red traffic light  passenger of truck in front of me jumps out and starts running up to the other truck which was several cars ahead of them in the other lane by this point  passenger has large knife in his hand wtf  driver of other truck sees the guy coming at him with a knife and jumps the curb goes around the car in front of him and runs through the red light almost hitting a car in the crosstraffic  knifeguy comes back and hops into his buddys truck  they peel out cross over a lane and make a right hand turn    that was the day i decided i should order a helmet cam
  i do what i want fuck boi who gives a shit what other people do everybody thinks they have a say in everything just mind your own business and let people be
  so how do you suggest we fix this more gov reg slowly giving away your freedoms f that
  when you live somewhere where there arent literally any other road users you can be without driving regulations retard
  i never said any reg i said why do you want more reg read the post correctly fuckface
  boomer got what he deserved
  americans should be retested for their license yearly or in some increasing rate after say 60/65 for one
  why tho im pretty sure 65yr olds arent the ones with the road rage
  that would be a more reg id be in favor of sorry not related to rage
  kind of doubt that desu
  why is this country so much more successful than mine  could it be because of hard work  maybe social progression  or maybe thanks to natural resources  no the reason must be that they dont have niggers spics and pakis fucking niggers  i swear autists always think their country should be/was so great once and the only reason they can think of is well this race of people must be the sole reason my country is going down the shitter actually neck yourself youre so fucking insufferable you absolute mouthbreather its because of your countrys horrible management and your general populations retardation which i suppose is a part of horrible management since your educations funding is fucking dog

  because liberals think offenders needed to be treated humanely for some reason    no we dont think that trump and his family should be treated well once theyre in federal prison

  bitches leave
  let all the americans die out thats the only solution
  stricter requirements on drivers tests and a requirement to prove every 5 years you can still meet that level you do that and you can remove speed limits
  you can remove speed limits  there will always be someone who will overestimate themselves limits around schools for example  arent fascist tyranny
  hyperbole the point to be made was that the remaining drivers would be extremely safe by nature to the point where you could trust them with using their best judgment
  you cant test for that so no
  dont brake check like a fuckwit

let me get this out of the way i am not very knowledgeable in the automotive field i got my moms car when i turned 16 and i cannot stand it anymore im thinking stuff is going to start blowing out so ive been looking for a new car i always thought crown victorias were cool cars and there are a few decommissioned 2011 models nearby that are 2k before i commit and risk losing a couple thousand i need advice im willing to do basic repairs and i can grab a friend to help with bigger ones  1 do i even want a crown vic is there a better option  2 what to check for when i look at the car  3 maintance how much will this thing eat over a year i heard somewhere tires are hard to find  4 whats a good price point  5 what if anything do i want to replace off the bat i heard that most decommissioned cars have fleet keys and i should get the locks changed  and lastly  6 how long will she last me  i apologize if threads like this show up often i just want to avoid making a stupid mistake
do i want a crown vic  if you want something thrilling and fast no but if you want a rugged comfortable and reliable car that wont break the bank this is what you want  things to inspect on the car  check the transmission fluid and how the transmission shifts check the front end and steering and make sure it isnt to loose almost every crown vic ive owned with a few miles on it needed suspension work tires arent bad in fact they are very easy to find the tires size for the newest vics is p235/55/17  price point  spend between 15003500 not a dime more  what to replace first  i would not worry about the locks at all personally no one is running around with a set of keys looking to steal these things like i mentioned above make sure your suspension is sorted out tie rods ball joints etc tires are a good place to start also 90 chance the tires on the car you buy will be goodyear eagle rsa change those i fucking hate those tires with a passion the suck in the rain  how long will it last me  at least 23 years on even a run down one without major issue they are great cars and one of the last cars i would consider a stupid mistake to buy as a final note the best year to buy would be 20092011 2003 would be the very oldest id go for a daily best of luck
  just be aware that they are absolutely massive so parking wont be fun other than that and the gas mileage its a great car
  dont buy a decommissioned police crown vic get a civilian model vic thats been maintained or better yet a mercury grand marquis same car just a bit comfier
do note that while retired cruisers may have what looks to okay mileage officers spent a shit load of time idling obviously not as intensive as actual driving but regardless still will contribute wear
i had an 07 ex interceptor rekt it into a tree bought an 08 mgm and sold the vic to a friend the car was still driveable after he replaced a pinched line but the insurance payout was more than i paid for the car in the first place so i upgraded winwin    theyre extemely reliable in general unless something feels obviously fucked when you test drive it you have nothing to worry about set aside 60 for cupholders about 40 for a rear window defroster tab repair kit and change the rear diff fluid most normal people are completely unfamiliar with rwd cars and only ever change oil and tranny fluid if youre lucky the concept of a rear differential existing is totally foreign to them
if you can try to find a model a couple years earlier than the very last year 2011 by that point not only was the tooling getting worn out enough to be noticeable but ford was completely partsbinning cars cutting back on optional and standard equipment and the vehicles themselves were being put together by workers who knew they were about to be out of a job anyway    1 do i even want a crown vic is there a better option  if you hate your moms car because its boring then no you dont theyre like nothing else on the road these days so make sure you know exactly what youre getting a big slow sedan that embodies the last breath of the american roadboat v8 rwd body on frame top speed of who cares gas mileage of get a job and comfortably seats six in the cabin with a big enough trunk for another five objectively better option the mercury grand marquis which is just the mercury rebadge of the car on the same platform panther body and costs about the same now while being much less likely to have had the shit beat out of it also you dont look like a whacker any goodies you want from a decommissioned interceptor rear gears intake sway bar can be easily retrofitted to a civvie model and you get a nicer interior that doesnt have 125000 miles of cop farts  inb4 muh detective car
  2 what to check for when i look at the car  like the other anon said transmission and steering 4r7075ws are massively overbuilt for the power a crown vic puts out but sometimes the overdrive units go bad the shifts should be smooth but noticeable if you want to rebuild it look into the jmod which will give you faster firmer shifts if you want while also extending the life of the transmission the car popping out of gear at random isnt necessarily a transmission issue but just the screw on the column shift becoming loose and letting it swing enough to send the signal to the tranny to change gear its a silly thing but the chunkchunkchunk of rowing down to d is so satisfying its 100 worth it if the car has air suspension rare on crown victorias nonexistent on p71s semirare on grand marquis and standard on town cars it will go bad at some point either replace it and hope it doesnt leak again for years or swap it for normal springs    3 maintance how much will this thing eat over a year  more than youd hope but less than youd expect the engines like frying coil packs so always keep a spare around and dont cheap out on them other than that mostly just general maintenance parts are still easy to find both nos and junkyard and the big worry point is usually the intake manifold which likes exploding if it hasnt already been replaced check those service records if available do it yourself its a weekend job at most and youll be set for another 150k miles other than that timing chain guides tend to wear out especially mid2000s models but arent too bad to replace interceptors will have much more wear than the mileage indicates due to sitting around idling for so many hours which can be checked on the odometer on late models
  i heard somewhere tires are hard to find  depends on tire size panthers with 16 wheels run 225/60r16 which is common as hell later models run 17 wheels with 235/55r17 tires which might be a bit harder if you live in an area where youll run into unplowed or just snowy roads with regularity get good snow tires panthers are pretty damn tailhappy and even moreso on slick surfaces    4 whats a good price point  not a dime over 3000 even for a grandmakept creampuff no one wants these cars anymore in no small part because theyre so barebones four wheels a drivetrain a wheel and some seats am/fm as standard 6disc with or without tape player if youre lucky and not a single goddamn bluetooth connector or aux port or automated warning system in sight speaking of which 2003 and up have rack and pinion steering instead of recirculating ball and 2005 and up have drivebywire instead of a physical throttle cable i hate the dbw you might not hate it i dunno    5 what if anything do i want to replace off the bat i heard that most decommissioned cars have fleet keys and i should get the locks changed  get the best damn halogen headlights you can and look into either buying an aftermarket harness or making one yourself ford used abhorrently tiny wiring for the headlights and routed the wires alllll the way around the engine bay including into the interior switch itself on early models and for years after that the lcm still had issues even late models with the brighterlooking headlights still suck dont fucking stick leds in there
  6 how long will she last me  depending on how much youre willing to wrench could be until the frame rots out and you have to decide if youd rather scrap it or patch the frame 2003 onwards are definitely easier to work on especially suspension wise earlier models have the rear shocks inboard of the frame rails and the front end will throw you for a loop if youre used to rack and pinion steering setups most parts of importance can be replaced with the mercury or lincoln equivalents without issue or even have the same part number to begin with most things can be replaced in your driveway with basic tools exceptions being stuff buried in the car like the fuel pump which is on top of the verticallyoriented fuel tank and required either dropping the tank which is huge or cutting a hole in your trunk shelf make sure you have both sae and metric sockets of all regular sizes and some odd ones too because there is absolutely no rhyme or reason as to which set ford used when designing or attaching any given part if youre used to working on japanese cars where 10mm is god you will hate yourself in an hour oh and i hope you never have to touch the driveshaft because the ujoint bolts are 12point and if your car has ever been driven anywhere other than tarmac once a week theyll already be completely rusted and rounded
  that should say 4r70/75ws i lost a slash there someplace
as far as the police wear argument goes caring about extra wear on the powertrain is like complaining about guys pissing in the ocean yes the car will have extra wear on it from police use but in the grand scale of things it doesnt matter older crown vics didnt even have idle hour gauges for people to compare them with yet taxi companies still rode those sloppy second asses into the million mile mark regularly and there was no problem     pic related an active duty patrol car with 42k idle hours courtesy of crownvicnet ford says 1hr33 miles driven but that number has to be bullshit given that ex interceptors dont seem to shit themselves anymore frequently than decade old equivalent mileage econoboxes do
  how the fuck that means that car would have been idling not driving just sitting idling in park for 24 hours a day every single day for over four and a half years im sorry that doesnt make sense at all sure some areas will hotseat their patrol cars but they still have to be parked and fueled repaired and upkept at some point
  the driveshaft on my cvpi wasnt hard to remove before i hit that tree i had to replace the driveshaft from an earlier accident where my car got impaled by some loose temporary steel plate roadwork that said i do agree that the socket design seems like it would round off pretty easy on the bright side at least theyre conveniently located and rotate with the shaft and joint incase you do need to get get creative to remove stripped bolts a minor evil compared to fwd transaxle garbage youd have to deal with in another car
ffv panthers actually have about 10 more hp when running e85 its enough to be noticeable and makes flooring it much betterr 262 hp vs 239
  it was from some small town it did eat through a lot of ac components though makes sense and a rear axle somehow probably a perfect storm of reasons needing to be parked at idle like maybe being a k9 unit but even on the typical car with 4k hours you get the idea at the end of the day its a cheap car that will just keep running police/taxi abused variant or not
  not buying a preffv model just so you can say aside from your cop tires and cop shocks shes a model made before flex fuel so it runs good on regular gas
  what is the cheapest way to turbo or supercharge one vic  e85  performance increase would be seriously powerful in a straight line
  id rather have the extra 24 horses
what does /o/ think about the c4  lets hear it you shoebies bitchass
  massively underrated  personally i love the aesthetic  hilariously cheap cos underloved  absolutely comfy as fuck  vti is nippy but rare and always barryed to death  light handles    downsides are all the french memes tho they seem pretty rustresistant
the 16 thp pull better than most diesels  150 ps 110 kw 148 hp  5800 rpm   240 nm 177 lbfft  14005000 rpm
4 cylinder engines
3 cylinder engines
  these make me so mad  they should have just went all the way and dropped down to 2
  iim a ccar guy
inline 6
  didnt you die years ago
  no i didnt suck my dick faggot  shitpost general will never die
i need awd for snow
fwd drive isnt a terrible platform
german cars are reliable  japanese cars are fun to drive
i dd a sportscar
i lowered my sedan for peak performance
fca has come a long way
  he fell for the inline 6 meme
vw is a good brand
the stinger gt is actually a pretty good car
hybrid technology is getting pretty good nowadays
the gtr is a great budget supercar
autopilot is just around the corner
  yfw it actually is though  next step after that will be outlawing your gas guzzling envirodestroyers you dont want to hurt the globe now do you anon  your transportation will only work on our terms now goy say goodbye to your freewill
  you design me a 2 cylinder mitsubishi mirage and ill replace my 3 cylinder one today
people actually think na and nb miata are a good car
    evo engines are nearly fully bolt in for mirage do that and go nuts
  they are
  fuck off tidf
  people actually think the miata is a good car
    if youre dirt poor on a budget maybe theyre slow sketchy at high speed and dont even handle that well the only thing ill give them is if you want a early 90s jap convertible theyre the cheapest for anything else theyre shit and get far too much praise
  you know i never will goy its much too late i control everything already enjoy your little car while you can
miatas dont even handle that well  hahahaha  /o/ in 2018 really is just populated by 12 year olds
  the only way you can honestly believe the miatas are a great sportscar meme is if you immediately follow that statement with for the price    sure its pretty awesome for a 3k used pos you found on craigslist but it doesnt hold a candle to literally anything else this is coming from someone who owns one btw
  granted anything clapped out is going to be more of a doozy than something thats refreshed make it as it was off the factory decent bushings good struts new rubber and youll see what theyre about a beatup craigslist special is a little sketchy
  mfw inline 6 meme just works
    they dont theyre only decent if youre on a low budget theres dozens of better cheap cars especially jdm like suzuki altoworks nissan pulsar gtir suzuki cappuccino etc    theyre not even going to be the poor mans sportscar in 10 years when they end up like s13 did and get wrecked/riced to death and a 300000km clapped out pos goes for 8000
  cant fit more in my car without completely destroying it still soon ill make 300 hp in a car that weighs about 2200 lbs    sadly it will still be fwd tho
  tau internet defense force
  altoworks understeer like pros as do the gtir the cappuccino is a smaller mx5 with all the problems with a quarter of the solutions
  this thing has more torque than my 16l 4 cylinder and my torque peak is at 5200 rpm    i have 35 hp more tho    but this thing would probably drive better in my mothers fiat panda than that shitty brick thats in it now it has like a 12l na
  correction  i want awd for speedy fun on snow  drivetrainlets seething over awd superiority
  its honestly fucking unsettling how fast you can go with awd  it really is a whole nother world  tfw fwdlet that cant even drift his box in the winter  at least i get to practice scandi flick until the esp kicks in at 50 kmh
fuel efficient trucking hauling couches and bikes  parking in tight spaces
  he doesnt understand the taxfree power of 68 horsepower
  fewer than 12 cylinders  why even live like that
v5 vw engine
  he cant scandi flick a fwd car  must suck not knowing how to drive
  poor packaging  poor weight distribution  cant be used for awd/fwd applications  no advantage in power over a v6  moves mass to the side as its leaning
  poor packaging  what the fuck does this even mean  poor weight distribution  lies  cant be used for awd/fwd applications  who gives a fuck rwd is the best anyway no one cares about your poorfag fwd hatchback shitbox or your awd crossover normie wagon  no advantage in power over a v6  who gives a fuck  moves mass to the side as its leaning  ur mum moves mass to the side as shes leaning    btfo
  report submitted
  remain upset pleb while people with superior weight distribution fuck you up    tho i must say inline six viable with both awd and fwd  i believe volvo put one in transversely and some other company aswell    and look at the skyline that was awd and an inline 6
itt oppinions on the new volvos/polestar    a bit late maybe but what are your thoughts about the latest generation of volvos look feel everything    i really like the facelift it reminds me think of mercedes for some reason i like the new modern/sporty look over all ive only driven the xc90 so far and it is nothing special about it pretty much what youd expect from a modern car in terms of driving it is very comfy on longer rides both as a driver and passenger only major flaw is some hideous design options like some rims etc
volvo cucked itself into using only 2l i4 ff with some models having a soccer mom snow assist half of those dont even have a proper driveshaft but are hybrid awd  id like to see polestar being a returning point to actually good cars but im afraid the i5 gas and diesel v40s and the i6 s60s are the last nice ones
its weird in so much as it looks just like a regular volvo  its like if they made a carbon fiber bodied c70
based
    there is no reason to buy an volvo product over a mercedes or bmw they make nothing better than either of them and their cars are boring and just as unreliable/expensive to maintain     volvo is a fucking trash brand and theyre going to be fully electric a few years not to mention theyre owned by fucking chinks not nippons but actual chinks     buying an underwhelming chinese electric commuter car branded as a swedish cuckmobile    give me one good reason you would buy a new volvo over any other car ill wait
    no reason to own one bmw/mercedes/audi are similar prices more reliable more comfortable and generally more efficient as well as better looking     volvo lost its way when saab left the market and they had nothing to really compete with on logical design they instead just went full cuck and became a worthless buy id still rather buy a 10 year old saab than a modern volvo
    the polestar looks like a wannabe mustang disgusting fucking chinkshit
    pretty cool that they were able to claw their way back i think their cars are pretty great looking exterior wise but they could use some help in the interior department as well as in the performance/fun department
  i owned one of the last 5cylinder v40s for 5 years and cannot fault it  rock solid reliable literally noting gone wrong fab performance  handling great eco handsome and distinctive  not an npctier germancarmeme lookalike  also had a v90 as a company car  what an underrated machine  way lighter than the equivalent nazischeisswagen spacious relaxing and with the best semiautonomous driver aids ive used yet  naturally they get hammered by the motoring press  but only bluepills havent noticed that all of that is german owned so slate everything that isnt german  still im glad the sheep and busriders dont like volvo i enjoy the exclusivity
  90k 4 bangers chink car with questionable reliability
    the twin charged engines are cool wish theyd put it in something sporty and lightweight
  they could use some help in the interior department    were you dropped on your head a lot as a baby the interior is the best currently out there
    haha ok xd
why do people watch these retards
who
who
  muh ike gauntlet    they do pretty fairish comparisons on trucks theres a lot worse reviewers out there
they get access to vehicles before almost anyone
  i like the dad and son
  its usually the paint huffing truck fags that watch this shit   muh chevy pass the ike gaultet lol that pos ford broke down chebbys the best1     also is nathan the engineer from tf2
  the dad and son combo when they are on trails/testing the capability of 4wd/awd vehicles is pretty entertaining   the fat one not so much
they have good trails to do fair side by side comparisons their truck and suv reviews are great to show off road capability in stock form their car channel sucks
  he walks the line just enough to be honest about his reviews while not getting uninvited from all the early test drives
  their car channel sucks  i drive the track they test on sometimes its nice to have a baseline of how fast all their test cars are on the same track i drive i just wish they did rolling start laps paul gerrard is also awesome
  the son is the worst one
  nothing better watch do you have other suggestions ive gown tired of their nissan shilling
  t toyota marketing team
    gauntlet  its a regular everyday road that normies use    its like when you guys refer to highway traffic as a wolf pack
    its actually a pretty ballsy balance
  i watch because i like trucks and they cover truck stuff give me another channel that does the same
  literally fucking who    stop making these threads you fucking shill
  can your shitbox pull 10 thousand pounds of cargo in a trailer up it thats the entire point of the test its not a race track its for people who use their vehicles to haul/work
  should they ship them off to the moon and test them there like something top gear would do god forbid they use a real world road to test real world situations
    i have one of those shitboxes they test        not saying that but its like calling the 200 distance between your suburbs stop signs the track when you test the new grand caravan by taking your wifes kids to school
  so they should take the minivan to a real track and see how it performs hows that relevant in the real world
hey boys im permanently moving to eastern europe in two weeks and the only option i have is to buy a diesel car i have one picked out already its a 2011 bmw x5 35d my cousin checked it out for me and says its in great shape anyway i want to put some upgrades on this bitch as soon as possible     what do you guys suggest       pic related

reminder that ltl drivers are the most skilled maneuverers make hourly money sleep at home and are more hygienic than your average pj / flip flop wearing otr    spoiler we get welcomed inside those warehouse entrance cages that were built for you because they know we arent dumbasses /spoiler
  i drive a pickup truck and go to home depot once a month i know what you mean but i disagree us truckers of all types gotta stick together
i do business delivery for costco  i am a truck man now
  otr drivers are disgusting i eat regular meals workout sleep in my own bed and shower twice daily i stay in the same ish 3 county region ive spent 13 years making a living not dealing with a shitty otr existence
otr  pulling up to the bay in one shot    come on guys my sides need some rest
    the chad local  the virgin otr
    i do it at walmart all the time    we actually had a thing one night all the drivers were talking shit over cb to see who could get backed in this walmart dc we were all checking into with no pull ups and myself and a cr england guy did it england guy got a free pass because he was dedicated out of that dc
ltl are also massive faggots you boys are the canary in the coal mine when im in the slick as soon as i see one of you wiggle wagons in the ditch its time to look for parking
  not being able to one shot a dc door with partial throttle   if you cant do at least that fucking hang it up how embarrassing
one thing i have noticed will all truck drivers from oilfield guys to belly dumpers to otr to ltl to local and beyond is that if they have any romantic female partners at all  they are fat as sows  kind of like military wives but worse  this i believe is the result of being low status males they have a coping mechanism where the convince themselves they like thicc women when in fact  it is all they can attain  thoughts
  or they pick them up when they are tastefully thicc but the money coming in lets them get fat and bitchy
  just you projecting anon
  hmm to me this is just an observation but i am open to the idea that i am projecting if you can flesh out a plausible hypothesis    next  do you imagine that if i am indeed projecting that my observations are invalid  if so  explain please  thanks
  put down the fork fatty
  eeehhh not really an argument anon for the record  i am a thin white male
  can i see your research notes and statistics that way were all on the same page here i suspect you settle for less in life than you want so you stay alone     and im a cute school aged girl
  i have only my observations  have yours been different  do you often see truck drivers with thin attractive women women who are not thicc and would be considered very attractive by the non truck driving community   i am open to hearing about your experiences that contradict mine anon
  i have observed in life like people mate with other like people is this different how still waiting on your twinky pics
  this i agree with  my main point is that truck drivers are low status males  they mate with low status females this i think we agree on  what i find odd is that these same truckers imagine they are high status males and that the women they bed are of high value  this misconception is all i am trying to correct
  did you out of pocket for trucking school and got the boot your first week of driving you seem bitter as fuck some of our women are on the large side but my wife is a fucking dime pic related now lets see yours and we can have everyone vote or are you too beta
  that fivehead and faint mustache
  is there any chance that i can get you to stick to discussing ideas instead of trying to discredit individuals as being bitter  there is no need for anger here if you think i am incorrect  please explain i know its a bit more difficult   also please join me in a sip of the beverage of your choice  i enjoy coffee
    partial throttle  not hitting high reverse     must be your first day out in the field its okay swift youll learn           moderately attractive women are unobtainium because we have to compete with 50000 other thirsty males in their inbox who literally their only advantage over me is they can be there every day and feminism has told women its okay to be unfaithful if even one of your demands arent met    if all you have to offer a female is penis then you are nothing more than a common street peasant and regardless of how nice your tits are if all you can offer me when i come home is vagina then that makes you an escort                obvious troll is obvious this is a truckerfag thread go be a dumb 4 wheeler somewhere else
  i think the is misconception is all on your end friend all im getting from you is feelings of inadequateness what threatens you about truckers
  not threatened at all by truckers   without truckers my life would not be possible  i am in fact grateful to them i just want everyone to accept the fact that to become a trucker is to become a low status male   what i do dislike is people living a lie  it is also important that young men who might see this thread realize the sacrifices they will make if they join this industry  long hours is fine but they should be made to understand that they also become untouchables   do you disagree with any of this
  not at all life is what you make it im not a big fatty and you must be asian or pajeet to think of status so much i make 6 figures so i really dont care what anyone thinks
  you sound like a faggot who has a romantic idea of love     untouchable theres plenty of whores out there
    so i really dont care what anyone thinks    status is not important unless you ignore it i think deep down you do care about what people think
  sweetie if i was worried about status why would i choose truck driving youve doubled down on the caste/social order thing again why are you obsessed with that
  you son of bitch bastard bitch lasagna you no talk bad of india
fuck you
  whats the fucking deal with r high its scarey fast i can barely get it going without a slipping the clutch too much for comfort it must be a ruse ive also found a secret gear in a 9 speed
  my auto has 3 reverse gears 2 is perfect 3 is like you said ive gone 15 in r3 and it was at 1k rpm
  auto
why would you want this shitty job  loser
  i get paid to not interact with people drive around jamming to the stereo and smoking dabs all day
  wow that sounds trucking awesome  how do i get one of these epic weed jobs
  how often are truckers drug tested
  youve doubled down on the caste/social order thing again why are you obsessed with that  i am actually  and that was the whole point of the conversation i was trying to start women prefer men with equal status or greater status than they have especially when it comes to education it is extremely important when attracting a mate   even uneducated women prefer higher status men because of this  all the attractive women go to the higher status men and low status men are left with unattractive women  does this seem crazy
  so you after a social climber of a woman
  anon one of my points here is that all women are social climbers if they are able  google the word hypergamy
  i dont base and have never based my self worth social status or self esteem on the whims of a female so most of what you are raging against i struggle to understand im not on earth to please a woman if one wants to come along for the ride so be it been there done that all i know is the older i get the more offers i turn down you must be younger and more concerned with keeping up with the jones and status which is somewhat of a foreign concept to me you must also be very urban but where i am my income dictates my status over everyone i own a business have an actual college degreeworthless btw have whatever i want mostly so this concept of status doesnt apply when im happy where i am its just odd concerned about status so much thats why i think you are some type of pajeet and being a xtian worldly status means very very little to me also i hope you are happy struggling in life all so you get a piece of pussy now and again that will just leave you when someone whiter and with a better job comes around because thats the only thing that will happen with your particular mindset its so sad when all some men do in life is for the pursuit of women and all their thoughts seem centered around this very idea that some one else will somehow make them happy and satisfied
    its for the snow birds    reverse is too fucking high on all regular passenger vehicles

  mummys boy detected   this is exactly the garbage that women spout time to form your own opinions son
  oh my fucking lord  this guy    was right
              jesus christ this bait is so obvious but truckers are so fucking stupid theyre taking it seriously and seething in anger
  lets unpack this
pump truck daddy here    i think i might just be the best concrete pumper in the world
  every single intermodal truck that i see has at least one wobbly trailer wheel  mfw the only truck ive seen actually lose a wheel was a werner dryvan  it was one of his steers
  youre the kind of person who drives a smart car that us truckers gang up on and turn into a road pancake these accidents are common in the trucking industry because we get a lot of shit from beltway liberals with their bumper stickers or jerks who flick us off
i always wanted to make a seaworthy 18wheeler and trailer to put the shipping industry out of business
  no anon you have never turned anyone into a pancake
  i bet you pump dicks nigga     in your ass    because u gay     u gay nigga
  weird dude i was literally thinking the exact same thing like 2 hours ago all negros with golden teeth wearing wife beaters jesus christ
  i mean youre not wrong
  depends on the company usually randomly selected by dot or right after an accident
  i can see that most of them look dirty as hell and their trucks are so goddamn beat up save from most megas their chassis always have something wrong
  maybe an anorexic lot lizard he got on top of
    tfw dot doesnt test for being furfag so filenames still has a job
  i keep forgetting to erase my name and store my trip for another time
    the money coming in    the sitting on their fat white trash ass eating fast food all day is what does it you fuckstick truckers are working class peasants please stop with le rich truckman meme its not the 1980s if you drive a truck today youre middle class at best
  these idiots do not understand that the money they spent of fuel is not income  if you say you made 100k last year that means you paid taxes on 100k not thats what you made before write offs
  its all relative too what most people would consider povertytier they probably consider the high life
you ever just have one of those days 
  thanks man  im fucking dying
    post trucks
  jesus i love seeing this every time
  and thiiiis little piggy backed aaaalllllll the way in saying reee reeee reeeee rreeeeeeee reeeeeee
i had heard that truckers wives cuck them a lot  is it true
remember when trucking was a good job
  no one here is old enough
class 7
trucking is like the leading profession in serial murder i wonder why
  truckers cuck you a lot you fag that said i 100 would not do it if my wife wasnt with me it does sound like a great way to get cucked       sauce
  trucking was never a good job in fact at every point in the past its been more backbreaking than now truckers have never been as comfortable as they are now
  old trucks would beat you up
  its not about being comfortable its about being able to make real money you could make 20k a week if you owned a truck and were a crazy enough motherfucker    now you got all this regulation bullshit you might as well have any other job
  this elds and fees left and right and the price of freight being driven down its all bad news    might as well do ltl or find more work
    if i buy a 1999 truck can i still smoke meth and drive like a fucking maniac im very fond of driving and meth coincidentally
  people still do i am merely stating that trucking isnt as profitable as it once was however thats not to say that o/os cant make money still its just a whole new ball game now
  you might as well have any other job  might as well    if you werent a complete fucking pea brain

  dude werner is where new truckers go to die youre going to be making 300400 a week for the first year and having no time its a hard fucking deal even swift best in crash is better and thats saying somthing swift is like your anal rapist not having aids werner is with aids
  oh yeah
  im just starting i have zero expirence how can i get a good job with zero driving expirence
  always always its a coon spic or some eastern europoor behind the wheel of a shoddy ass truck
  you dont   you have to pay your dues first at a shit company for at least a year unless you get lucky and find a rare opportunity that will accept a total rookie  that said there are some places that are currently lowering their experience level requirements from say 2 years to even will train levels because they are hurting for drivers even local / ltls just keep an eye out
  im paid hourly stay in hotels of my choice every night when im away from home which is like maybe 70 of the time and still get to shower and workout daily but as an added bonus i dont have to hit fucking loading docks because that shit is gay as fuck    all jokes aside i have mad respect for ltl drivers because city driving all day sounds like a fucking nightmare and i couldnt do it
  im this guy      i got my cdl last march just scoured craigslist for local flatbedding companies because i knew that was what i wanted to do at that point in time and eventually found a small company willing to hire me on with no experience at all i started out just moving forklifts and hauling counterweight for cranes and managed to pretty quickly work my way up by having good work ethic and showing a good understanding for all different sorts of equipment 2018 will be my first full year of driving and so far ive grossed 107k driving someone elses truck
  city driving all day sounds like a fucking nightmare and i couldnt do it  its stressful sure but its not that bad desu you just have to get more creative with your maneuvering / backing techniques and keep your eyes open
  grossed 107k driving someone elses truck    jesus are you leasing or a company driver seems like youre doing much better than the average person
  this driving through la is nice nowadays when youre not cpm
  company driver my base pay is 2750/hr but it goes up for various things ot after 40 hours and double time on sundays and i pull 7080 hour weeks pretty consistently
  ive heard your story before and stil not sure i believe you  never heard of a rookie going strait into heavy haul much less a guy with less than 5 years experience being handed a 12 axle set up  just does not add up and its too easy for you to lie about it
  do heavy haul get cuckted less than reefer or dry van  asking for a fren
  driving through la is nice nowadays  said no one ever
  manly jewelry   i have some bad news for you
look at you fucking losers fly first class pick up and drop off to remote locations fly back get paid 65 an hour no one telling me when to stop driving no one telling me when i have to be where no sleeping in the truck like some beta stay at whatever hotel i want pull 15 hour days because i want stay in whatever city i want that night
so im working labor for a construction company right now and yesterday i got a crash course in how to drive 18 speed around the yard i guess the question im trying to ask here is how hard is it to rev match when downshifting on the road is there any special tricks to it or does it differ from truck to truck i dont have my cdl yet but i plan on getting it soon
  what job is that   do you even need a class b to drive that truck  whats if for
  except me because i get paid hourly so i dont care if i get stuck if i was cpm i so would be pissed
  i think hes sent on recovery or pickup missions
  just tap the accelerator and downshift the same way you did in a yard
  ah i see you are working for the motion picture industry fucking nice gig dude thats kinda my end game too being a trucker for them is literally the best thing ever especially working union
  yeah whats the catch if i could do unlimited driving id be clocking at least 5500 miles a week id jizz when i saw the check for that
no catch i work for a dod contractor for the air force dont need a class b have been doing it for 4 years now
  uh are they hiring id fucking love to do something like that im guessing you need a security clearance and such
  whats the cuck factor for a job like that  are you technically a trucker
  im an operator there isnt a cuck factor other than having to leave when they tell me everything gets charged to the contract and nothing comes out of my pocket im not really going to get into specifics about what the truck does or where it goes i feel like those questions are next in line but i probably spent about 1/2 my time this year driving it is annoying to drive an auto international i try and stay out of the way as much as possible to avoid slowing up other truckers though theres the occasional shitbag watching tv on his laptop while driving that ill show no regard to
  reminder that ltl drivers are the most skilled maneuverers    swift recruiter detected
are you the same larper that does heavy haul with three weeks experience 
  apparently you missed the ive been doing this for 4 years its the size of a penske truck im not and dont pretend to be hauling oversized loads of uranium
  sorry sargent larper i must have gotten you confused with another anon
  dont apologize to me
  swift  ltl  anon
do all the swift trucks have the 1500 watt converters in them now i heard that was in the works i need muh electronics
  buy your own itll run you all of 150
  i heard they have real big issues with people buying and installing their own due to jackasses burning down trucks by installing them wrong fug
statuslets   when  will  they
  swift master race
  swift is master race af
  they do have issues with people installing them themselves also i think theyre 1800w unless my company is different
  what the fuck do you need 1800 watts for fridge tv cooking decide and an xbox should be well less than half of that right
  i dont know what someone would need i am merely stating that is in those trucks     an 1100 watt microwave seems to cause it to breaker     at least its pure sine energy
  you cannot run an 1100 watt microwave on less than a 3000 watt inverter preferably pure sine wave  most truckers use 700 watt microwaves
  i know but i didnt have a chance to buy a smaller one yet so i just took the one in the house it works still just every now and again it trips the inverter
are lot lizards real if so is it safe to bang one of them if they come to the truck to try and sell you a piece or could it still be a setup
  anon i cannot overstate this you do not want a piece of what theyve got 
  that sounds ominous i may actually heed this warning even after 56 months otr
is flatbeddjng actually hard work like yall make it out to be tarping and strapping down a load seems easy as shit im in horrible shape and i could do that all day long
  once randomly about 6 months after i started and then never again for the next 45yrs
  no theyre just incredibly lazy and dry van guys are even more lazy and will complain for 2 weeks after somebody told them to sweep out their trailer
    prime o/o jealous of a swifty    thats cute        agreed fuck miami and jacksonville those sumbitches are always doing like 80mph in their rube goldberg contraptions down i95 with wobbly trailer wheels and shit         rekt        fuel is tax write off and so are truck payments lrn2taxes retard before you go spouting off ignorant bullshit on my tfg         trucking is a good job if you make it to be one where the fuck else are you going to make this kind of money without a degree in communism it is one of the most based and red pilled jobs you can have and most carriers that arent slave drivers are family oriented maybe you just suck at trucking which if you are so fucking dumb you cant even do this job you should just work at mcdonalds or neck yourself        muh eld    nigger i have never made so much money as i did after the eld mandate i have a comfy regional account i have touched my 14 once since i have been on it and i was being lazy and fucking around at a truckstop git gud scrub        werner    if youre absolutely set on a mega come to prime make sure when you get your license you dont have an automatic restriction i dont know how roadmaster works nowadays but theyre been a funnel school for werner for a while and a lot of the trucks you train on are old werner equipment we have a lot of guys on our fleet that got their cdl at roadmaster so its a good school but there are better companies to start for prime will reimburse half your tuition if you come over from one of those training schools        this guy gets it lots of people think they will make big money their first year i did 23k my first year and took next to no time off and i took a lot of shitty sub100 mile loads when i first started leasing now im doing much better just finished 212 mile beer run for 700 bucks drop and hook the money is out there you just have to be someones bitch for the first year
    lold        you must be talking about louisiana        nice if true i still fly first class on off time and usually pick up and drop off to remote locations and if im rolling im doing 120150 an hour im happy i own the equipment though and i think in the long run thats where the money is the real money makers in the trucking industry dont have their hands on the wheel        they have an ltl division
  fuel is tax write off and so are truck payments lrn2taxes retard before you go spouting off ignorant bullshit on my tfg  your reading comprehension is terrible
  regional account  git gud scrub    thats what im trying to do so that i can get out of this otr to do some local gig shit with a dedicated account jb hunt had an opening around me but then took a transfer from within their own company i cant be mad because at least theyre helping out their own       nope los angeles ca getting stuck in traffic was super gay when being paid cpm but when youre getting paid hourly or daily and your pay starts as soon as your wheels start turning i could care less if i sit for a few hours moving slowly though traffic im still getting paid
  kek the port thing is so fucking true i go down 595 every day that highway leads directly into the ft lauderdale port those fucking trucks shouldnt be on the road theyre either doing 45mph because the trucks are breaking down or theyre doing 85mph and will be broken down a couple miles down the road
    oh and if you do that same stretch when it is dark out youre guaranteed to see a few port trucks with no working trailer lights and a 50/50 chance of no headlights its sketchy    theres a while lot of cubans and haitians driving rickety ass straight trucks loaded 20k over the limit too
the relationship thing and low physical activity is why i would never drive a truck
  you can drive a truck without sleeping in the thing every night
  you could but why not    id get a mega cab and itd be the nicest living space a 60 dollar whore has ever been in
you can even set up a septic system an have a full bathroom and shower in that bad boy if money aint a thang
    i dont understand how this is a thing anyone that can afford that shouldnt be trucking why does this exist
  well back in the good old days trucking could actually afford you a rig like that but not anymore its not as expensive as youd think if you build one out of an older rig
  have you met any supertruckers its not just a job its an identity
  trucking is all they know and they have been at it long enough
  this  if you have an iq under 87 there are not a ton of options for you anymore  even trucking is getting too complicated for the intellectually impaired this is one career path where you can compensate for low iq with high industriousness
  the only thing that sucks about those is backing into tight spots but if you flatbed it or actually know how to drive it youll be a supercomfy
  we are not impaired dipshit just so enlightened that we seem lazy to normies
  id rig up a few cameras on it to make backing it up a little easier
  now thats some smart thinking
  yeah man i had a similar idea for a rock crawling truck put a pair of cameras underneath the truck facing front and back with a view of the wheels and differential so you can move without a spotter just put the cameras and screens on a switch so they turn on when you need em    with a semi id have to think about the camera placement once the trailer starts moving around it might get blocked
can you stupid fucks stop showing up without refr trailers for freeze protect
    one of the big reasons i have stayed with prime is their regional accounts if shit dries up for a day i can just grab an otr load to keep the wheels rolling until freight in my area picks up again    dedicated is a whole nothing thing though ive heard some companies run those guys so hard they are touching their 11 every day and getting you home on weekends is a 34h reset which you will spend most time sleeping anyway watch out for that          and they will get away with it too the nearest scale is in fucking god damn key largo and dot doesnt speak creole or russian so they will never get inspected either fhp is too busy rounding up accidents on i95 or 595 to bother with truckers        87 is being generous there are people out here who cant read left lane ends jesus christ and my favorite ones are the supertruckers who see the huge ass prime inc on the back of my trailer and think they can pass me on the right to get in line and i lay into the power and they cant pass me so they get on the radio and talk all kinds of shit and im like but you cant even pass a prime truck hang up your keys and go work at walmart cletus    im going to get shot one day
  unless you did flatbed
    if you would hire driven by the best tm instead of cutrate carriers you wouldnt have this problem
  i did a dedicated run for a while you got it right 11 hour days 2 days off  etc drop and hooks 98 of the time so that was sweet 250 a day too     all things come to an end when your carrier gets underbid
  we dont get to pick who our customers send     weve had people take a shit in the parking lot and one guy who refused to install a load lock bar himself and then tried to run over one of our dock coordinators when he tried to stop the guy from leaving with 100k in product  he stopped when we threatened to pierce his engine compartment with 2 4000lb capacity forklift forks
  any more stories where the hell do you get these people
    top fucking kek tell your company to stop sending russians and niggers to handle your freight    shit in the parking lot    poo in the loo         underbid    happened to me at olney il prime pretty much had that on lockdown and we got underbid by cpm cucks and now all i hear them bitching about is how they are late all the time or drivers dont secure loads prime had 99 ontime record at olney and they new carrier is under 90 kek every load i deliver there i hear the dock workers wishing we were still there their yard dogs will look the other way if i ask to overnight in the back lot kek
    wasnt this guy on drugs or drunk or something    truck fails are the best if youre gonna fuck up dont half ass it    
i heard swift has a new program offering status per mile bonus has anyone heard of this
anyone have a cat with them on the road
  i lived in my lincoln lx with a cat id walk it around on a shoestring good times were had by all
  check em
  robots should take that work     port truckers dont get paid for shit anyways
  how is that not a beaner driver
what city do you hate driving in the most   i nominate pittsburgh over nyc any day of the week
      we dont get these people they arent ours our customers send them with appointments theres been accidents and other minor shit but we also get idiots sent to us who cant confirm anything forget what their cellphone number is show up 10 hours late and wonder why we send them to the pad to wait  they also ask us where they are headed as if we are their broker or dispatch  ltl guys usually have half a brain
        can literally one truck driver show me a tax return id love to know what you faggots actually make instead of the larping of gross pay ignoring the insane cost of running a truck
  5 signals to op  ok here i am i grossed 73k last year no operating expenses being an ltlfag
  cool proof
  implying i would actually post that to the hacker known as 4channel
  shut up you son of basterd bitch
  dc bar fucking none
  based prime power giving cleetus shit     tell us more about this insane cost
  does that include per diem
  gas insurance truck payments tires breakdowns and downtime maitinence  weigh stations constant fast food washing clothes on the road downtime bobtailing hundreds of miles to get a load and probably a few hundred more things this is coming from the top of my head and im not even a trucker
  gas is around 25 of income i spent about 1k last week on close to 4k of income i still had a third tank left on monday insurance is about 800 a month tires are about 5k a year all that other shit dont apply to local fags like me
any advice for people wanting to get into trucking in the next 36 months i cant afford a private school so ill go company sponsored what companies are best  is trying to get into a company program with a felony arson topkek going to be a significant barrier   dot drug tests do they do hair tests  thanks in advance guys
  youre fucked as a felon best bet is a local company drug tests are generally uas with some megas going to hair youll probably qualify for a grant from the state to offset school costs what youre doing now is going to a school that wont give you a job afterwards leaving you with the debt
hope u kids had fun  hope u did  for the king has spoken  and the king is not amused
  i aint got no panties on
  you just want to burn up a truck on the interstate dont you
where do you always stop off at when driving for me its kum and go
ejaculate and evacuate  shoot the jizz and out you is  bust a nut and out the hut
  good old jizz  split
theres a decent smash and dash near me where they have gas for 204 a gallon right now
  i like to get down at the local suck n swallow  its a hole with a lot of turnover
  for me its kum and go  nah their pumps are too fast  pay the money bam all done wheres the experience  i prefer places that have nice slow pumps
  jizz and jet  splooge and split  ejaculate and evacuate
i am sorry but guess what it is a superior daily driveable car yes we get it rwd is the best way to transfer power yet not all cars need rwd if i see another only if honda made x car rwd i will cut my balls off  you dont have to pay rice tax for an enthusiast vehicle that has had the ass beaten out of it  meaning there are 250hp to 280hp daily driver cars that are less than 4 years old under 16k  meaning you can get 8 to 10 year old cars less than 7k  uh my torque steer body roll hur dur upgrade sway bars tires and suspension  uh what about wheel spin wheel spin will happen even in rwd cars slamming the gas will cause this to happen quit being a brainlet  yeah but there are 430 horsepower cars that are under 20k yeah have fun with insurance and shit mpg
no one would ever argue otherwise whats the point of this stupid thread
  being mad at youtube zoomers that think poopra is the best car ever and probably will crash their kia spectras in two months
  rwd cars are always expensive gas guzzlers  tell that pic related the renault twingo iii  not only is it rwd but also midengined and about 10k when new
  fpbp
  it is also utter shit
  thatss begging for an hayabusa swap
  theyll get you from ab but thats about it i get more joy out of driving my 15k lb work truck than my fun and light fwd
  itt poor people who cant afford a rwd car
  fwd is no fun its either awd of rwd for me
wheels pin is caused by slamming the gas  explain how my 75hp diesel spins the wheels at half throttle in the rain when trying to accelerate that wouldnt happen in rwd
true   fwd is just a lot more predictable than rwd and more useful in normal application
  because you have bald ass tires with no tread on them
  show me another new rwd car for a simmilar price
  uh my torque steer body roll hur dur  none of that matters in daily drivers none of it fucking matters you dont even need 200hp in daily drivers thats why its a daily driver you dont drift around the togue on your way to the grocery store
  also if you cant have fun in 100hp fwd shitbox on the touge your touge is shit
comfy and when they break you just buy a new one for 1500
  the reason fwd cars are cheap is because nobody likes them they are disposable with certain exceptions mostly hondas    i own a sw21 s13 and a dc integra guess which one is the beater
  the only thing that makes a car a beater is the owner treating it like one
  enjoy driving a boring shitbox
  this i have an absolute blast reving the absolute tits off my 94hp shitbox on the country roads
whats the best way to go about getting a job at a dealership any position if youre young by young i mean under 23     yes i know 23 is still young
dress slutty and give manager the succ
  be a pathetic smarmy lying piece of shit basically will guarantee a sales or service job
get a job detailing or as a lot attendant
  this  i started at a dealership when i was 20
  try sales theyll hire anybody you just have to produce
  just show up and apply for a floor sales position    i did it for a summer its solid money really good money if you give it your all but the hours are grueling    also make sure you fully understand the pay plan    its usually gonna be a minimum wage hourly check every friday and then at the end of the month you get a fat bonus check from your commissions
theyll hire any retard as a salesman detailer or lot attendant
      sweet ill apply for the detailer position then         sales will be my second choice thanks fellas
friend of mine works for toyota think he shuttles or something but plays games on his laptop all day    his wife makes the money while he does jack shit
    get an apprenticeship i always took my car way back to a certigard when petrocanada repaired passenger cars the owner saw i knew how to do some work on cars and offered me an apprenticeship when i was 19    shit was decent school was fully paid for by the boss i had a journeyman/redseal diploma for automotive tech at 23 years old and was making 3040 an hour when petrocanada got out of repairing cars i worked for a napa autopro then got sick of fixing peoples junk and work law enforcement now
  have fun hating your life its kinda fun to clean a car the first hundred times but about 34 months in youll start to get real sick of cleaning up after other people i left after a year and will never willingly do that again probably detailed over a thousand cars in that time at least that was my experience with it and im a guy same age as you
  i applied for sales and they never called me back
  get an apprenticeship  how is this possible do i ask or find a listing online      i actually enjoy cleaning its the people that make me want to bang my head against a brick wall some people are hella retarded
im tired of seeing these fucking things everywhere    im a 30 year old single mom i need a giant vehicle it makes me empowered
its not really a problem your typical crossover isnt that big not bigger than a car anyway they just sit higher up
  people think theyre better in bad weather
  i need a giant vehicle  they arent any heavier than a midsize car
  giant  nigga that shit aint giant single moms in an f150 are a bigger problem
  better at rearending my car yeah
  or anyone in an f150 really
  theyre just lifted sedans pal  not all crossovers are big near suvs tons of them are pretty small like the crv cx3 crosstrek etc
  well they are because theyre heavier and usually come with awd
    i have no problem with trucks as long as i see them being correctly utilized eg pulling a large trailer that requires a 5th wheel or the bed is completely occupied/being used
  stop doing things i dont like  fuck off faggot i can do what ever i want with my property
  close the loophole in cafe/crash regulations that allow crossovers and suvs to be classified as commercial vehicles which is the only reason car companies started pushing them as family cars in the first place  if they counted against efficiency and safety averages manufacturers would ditch them practically overnight and start pushing sedans and minivans again  normie would just follow along because they just buy whatever the dealers tell them to buy but you have to put pressure on manufacturers first
  honestly if tacos got 30mpgs i wouldnt drive anything else
  not that big  5 meters of length and 19 meters wide on average  thats yankee luxobarge levels in europe    its simple the entire world should tax cars by dimensions make sure older cars are exempt tax crossovers to the point theyre more expensive than a rolls royce and watch as everybody scrambles to buy the smallest cars on the market
  no cafe laws state that an engine has different emissions requirements depending on the class and size of the vehicle    the 15l turbod engine in the honda civic has a different emission restriction than the same 15l turbod engine in the honda crv    crossovers came about because people wanted the mileage of a sedan with the cargo of an suv hence cross over because theyre larger and classified differently they dont have to meet the emissions requirements of a sedan
  if they counted against efficiency and safety averages manufacturers would ditch them practically overnight and start pushing sedans and minivans again  no they wouldnt because consumers are buying up crossovers like no tomorrow its literally where the demand is
  remember back in the late 90 and early 00s when every parent thought it was good idea to buy their little princess the biggest actual body on frame suv so they would be safe be glad that these exist under the big safe illusion because now youre getting rear ended buy lifted cars instead of fucking suburbans and excursions
  oh fuck off dinky sedans like the civic were literally death traps back in the 90s modern safety tech and regulations have cut car fatalities by a fuck ton
  you missed the point entirely im not even sure you read the post right
  the big safe illusion  except bigger cars are safer      in its studies the insurance institute for highway safety iihs has found that a heavier vehicle will typically push a lighter one backward during the impact as a result there is less force on the occupants of the heavier vehicle and more on those in the lighter vehicle according to iihs the organizations fatality data bears this out the lowest 2015 death rate by vehicle type is for very large suvs 13 deaths per million registered vehicles the highest is for mini cars 64 deaths per million registered vehicles
  allow me to clarify you aggressive sperg    parents then bought trucks and suvs for their children because they were big    parent now buy crossovers because they appear to be big and safe  im not implying they arent safe    so instead stacy is t boning you in an audi q3 instead of a 3 ton suburban  which is great for you
  thats fine anon 
  bigger cars are still safer regardless of who hits who with what the fact that larger cars suffer less fatalities over sedans proves that    none of your shit well now everyone has a big car that means it cancels out is pure conjecture and i doubt you have any evidence at all
  youre a sperg because what i said was wrong and an illusion even though its explicitly true  posts some nonsense about how now every car is a big car means its changed
  because manufacturers created the demand in the first place they started aggressively pushing suvs as family cars because they have a better profit margin thanks to not having to have as high of fuel/crash standards  if they stopped pushing suv/crossovers so hard they would shift the demand back to sedans and minivans because cars are one of those things that people cant not buy normie will literally buy whatever manufacturers are offering the manufacturers are the ones with actual control over what sells
  not really manufacturers usually copy each other in one way or another when one maker started making an otherwise smaller suv on a sedan chassis everyone else jumped on board because people were demanding smaller and smaller suvs but bigger and bigger sedans    they arent going to stop making them because theyre doing so well no retarded change up in the cafe laws is going to somehow oust crossovers and push it back towards sedans when in reality the shit   is saying is absolutely true
  normie will literally buy whatever manufacturers are offering  clearly not because makers like ford gm and chrysler are killing their sedans because they arent selling nearly as well as the suvs and crossovers are    when given the choice of sedans crossovers and suvs people are picking the latter options rather than the sedans
  clearly not because makers like ford gm and chrysler are killing their sedans because they arent selling nearly as well as the suvs and crossovers are  because they intentionally created the demand for crossovers and suvs in the first place they are not passive in this role this is car market that they deliberately created for themselves its not that they cant sell sedans its that they dont want to they want normies to buy crossovers suvs and double cab family trucks because those dont have to be as well engineered the ford explorer literally flunked its crash tests but because its a light truck ford doesnt actually have to change anything  the manufacturers are completely responsible for the popularity of crossovers they can end it whenever they want
  oh my god you are fucking stupid this is not induced demand its literally people wanting crossovers    for years youve had the choice of a compact or mid sized sedan and a compact or mid sized suv with the occasional large suv    when they introduced crossovers due to speculation that people were demanding smaller than otherwise compact suvs people rushed to buy it they stopped buying mid sized sedans and mid sized suvs which prompted this    they want normies to buy crossovers suvs and double cab family trucks because those dont have to be as well engineered  holy shit this is absolutely retarded and makes no sense these cars arent engineered more or less than any of their other cars the only thing you could possibly point to is the unification of standard chassis models like what honda and vw have which is far more akin to a design decision to save money than to make up some shit that no these are designed less what the fuck does that even mean
  the ford explorer literally flunked its crash tests but because its a light truck ford doesnt actually have to change anything  the ford explorer is an suv and it failed because ford didnt adapt newer explorers to the new safety standards  the explorers door frame was crushed inward during the impact by more than a foot in some places the insurance institute found that injuries to the right hip were very likely while lower leg injuries were also possible based on readings taken from the crash test dummy       oh man heres other suvs that actually made the cut because they actually engineered for safety regulations and didnt make excuses or deflect    in the same test the kia sorento volkswagen atlas and gmc acadia all earned the best possible rating of good three other suvs the toyota highlander nissan pathfinder and honda pilot earned acceptable ratings
  i dont think much can be done about it desu       the main reasons why i wouldnt personally drive a crossover is because theyre top heavy/dont handle as well as a car and theyre ugly the thing is 90 of the drivers on the road dont care about either of those theyre affordable practical and get relativity good gas mileage thats what normies want and care about plus their in right now and all the stacies got to keep up with the other stacies       i wouldnt say its all doom and gloom either theres still good cars for us /o/tists
just dont let women drive ez
  crossovers get commercial status and the standards are far looser essentially the same as full sized pickups cars are being phased out because theyre reaching the limits of ice capability to meet cafe standards
  i have no problem with trucks  you must get constantly triggered in traffic
   stop seething so hard yes that is correct if you go back and read the original post the big safe illusion is being compared to a 3 ton suv crossovers are safe because they are bigger sometimes heavier than some sedans a huge suv is also safe but now but now a majority young distracted inexperienced drivers are driving crossovers instead of huge vehicles and that makes your life easier
  so what your saying is that heavy vehicles are safer for the occupants but more likely to kill who ever they hit
  half the reason people love crossovers is because theyre easy to get in and out of i wish i was kidding this is how lazy our population has become
i havent ever seen a crossover that looked good they are the ugly bastard children of suvs and hatchbacks
people always going on about fuel economy but want to add an extra 300 kilograms to the sedan they should have
crv is a very good practical car bought one for my mom
  piss the arabs and provoke an oil shortage give tax breaks to more efficient cars overtax gas reduce the number of loans and their values in banks
so why does every country except for america drive on the wrong side of the road are you third worlders just retarded or whats going on with that
  you
false flag shitpost thread ignore and move on
  are you really that stupid op    all of the americas drive on the left side of the road     just a very few countries drive on the right side     with that type of education i believe youre not even from a third world country

for christmas im planning to give one of my friends a customized car emergency kit im planning to use an old surplus 50 caliber ammo can for the container so the usable dimensions will be 11 x 7 x 55 overall the question is what should i put in it    for background he makes his living as an uber driver in a midsized city in the i95 corridor but frequently makes 300mileish road trips along the east coast for family business he doesnt do a lot of driving out in the boonies though    keeping the total cost of this project not counting the ammo can under 100ish would be good but ill take any helpful suggestions     thanks
  fill it with ammo for the gun which he will be using to protect himself from niggers with
  based fpbp
  fix the car emergency kit or dont die stranded emergency kit
  well thats why i gave a description of his use case make of it what you will but again he lives on the east coast and doesnt drive around sparsely populated countryside a lot
 space blanket   flares or maybe triangles or both    pliers needlenose   small size of crescent wrench     the kind of screwdriver that breaks down to have 4 different screwdriver tips   duct tape   zip ties and/or wire needed for fixing shitty plastic bumpers and similar   one of those flashlights that has a magnet in it so you can stick it to metal surfaces
a pair of ice cleats that pull over shoes and boots is a must theyll keep anyone from slipping on ice which is likely if your car has become stuck from ice and snow
  this is actually super fucking helpful  i never wouldve thought about it  a san diegan moving to dallas
tow strap  shackles   leather gloves   hi vis   flashlight with a flood light   surgical gloves   pry bar
  honestly this guy has it right      id add a small trauma first aid kit with some basic howto cards  jumper cables kitty littler to go with this guy      a hat maybe too since a lot of retarded people in cold climates heat up their cars then go get in them without properly dressing for the cold which means they get to be extremely chilly in the event of any kind of mishap
op also add condoms strawberry flavoured lube and a small dildo
first question does he really want an ammo box in his car its practical sure but i wouldnt want one    does he have any mechanical ability if he does then he probably already has a small tool kit so i would focus on survival    the biggest thing people often overlook is water id love a steel long term storage container a couple of gallons of distilled water so that both a human and a car can drink it
i have one in my truck in it i keep pliers screwdrivers a few odd sockets chain lube some tape and a few large fuses
  make sure you put some kind of soft padding on the inside because every metallic object left loose in there is going to make lots of annoying noises while driving

hey guys pretty simple one here  im building my own harnesses for a car originally built in 1990 it is a race car so alot of creature comforts are not present eg rear wiper rear jet aerial powersteering power mirrors etc and the battery is in the boot  i have spent the last 10 days after work researching all about 12volt systems with use of relays fuses and wire thickness related to length  the main purpose of making my own loom is to simplify the circuits because the factory setup has them running back and forth through the car  i mention this because i have searched for my own answer but cannot get these following parts straight    how do i determine what does not need a relay is there any rule of thumb like under 10amps    another small question i have is if it is safe to congregate multiple different circuits earths together obviously if i have 4 x 16g earth cables connecting i would use a thicker cable and anything that is a signal ground must be its own seperate circuit i just assume regular grounds can be grouped together as they would be anyway since the chassis is a monocoque    would i be safe to just read the fusebox of the original systems and match those amps for choice of cablefuse and whether it needs a relay or not  alot of things are modified from stock like a bigger lift fuel pump and the addition of a external fuel pump but i have already set these up on 30a relayed induvidual circuits  other modifications for the electrical system would mainly draw less amps i would imagine as led globes are more effecient than the factory halogens
  im not an expert either but i know a little if someone else comes along who sounds like he really knows what hes talking about defer to that person     how do i determine what does not need a relay is there any rule of thumb like under 10amps  nothing needs a relay they are just nice to have and can be safer and cheaper than not having a relay they just allow you to use thinner wires at lower wattage to control or switch different accessories   its up to you some circuits just dont need a relay because the wattage is so low or the whole circuit including switch is very short id just use your best judgment     another small question i have is if it is safe to congregate multiple different circuits earths together obviously if i have 4 x 16g earth cables connecting i would use a thicker cable  yes i have done this without trouble you can look up charts for what guage wire you need for your wattage and distance ac and dc are different and braided and solid wire are different too    would i be safe to just read the fusebox of the original systems and match those amps for choice of cablefuse and whether it needs a relay or not  generally yes just watch out for any big changes you make to the circuit
  okay thank you mate that all sounds correct to me
  frig off back to  you racist drumphtard it was her turn
is there any way to make buying a used car not an absolute headache any car thats considered an enthusist carrwd manual awd etc is such a shit show in the used market
if you arent good at wrenching just take the car to a reputable mechanic to take a look at critical things like engine compression i have never done it and ive been okay i just go by james mayesque instinct sometimes you can just feel that a car is a complete piece of shit like it has some sort of aura of shit around it
yet another reason to buy a safe reliable fuel efficient new car with a warranty you wont have to worry about all that hassle of finding a good used car and serious seller best of all you wont have to worry about the unease and financial burden of the repair bills that come with all used cars isnt that peace of mind worth something to you
  is there any way to make buying a used car not an absolute headache    carmax youll pay a premium yes but on the other hand    5 day return policy  fixed price  30 day free warranty   multiple extended warranties for purchase  low pressure sales   can pull inventory from anywhere in the country     if you hate the traditional process of shopping for a car and dont mind paying a premium for that its perfect
  honestly buying new is shit because dealers fuck you if you dont call them out on tons of shit and every new car is plagued with recalls and random problems you will have to pay for within the first 50k driven    and good enthusiast used cars have become owned by either retarded fucking shit skins atypical stereotype white trash or women none of which take care of the car and tell you everything is great then when you look at it and see 5000 worth of work needing to be done they wont even lower the price 100 because i know what ive got     the worst part is many of the previously mentioned arent even boomers its fucking stupid you cant buy muscle because boomer mentality you cant buy import because millennials and you cant buy new because extortion
  downside of a new car is its steep depreciation and the fact that you cant do much with it out of fear of ruining its aftermarket value not many people buy new cars intending to ride them until they die
  i dont know anyone who buys a car expecting to sell it in 10 years usually it is  i want to groceries  i want to drag race at stop lights  i want to offroad  i want to pretend to offroad
  go through a broker itll cost more but its their job to do all the haggling and due diligence for you
if you cant spot the lemon you should not bitch about it being hard
  non enthusiasts do it they only want something that will turn them a profit and look like they are in the in group
  i have never met an enthusiast buy a car for resale value this is called investing not enthusing are you referring to the old people who buy shittier exotics like a 944 turbo and sit on it for 6 years thinking it will suddenly skyrocket to 50000 or those that can actually afford exotic cars buy them take them to the track once then sit on them for a few years to resell for profit of 125k    literally nobody at all the solos amateur rally or even car meets want something that will turn them a profit unless you get the rare bird who bought an r3234 and got a good import deal then charge 10k more as it is already in the states
r8 my ride
  gets a dodge caliber because it has the word caliber in it

  if i see him in florida i will grab him by the pussy
  damn thats a gay thing to day

i want one so damn bad how can anyone not want it
  lotuses are cool
  cost a shitload to buy  cost a shitload to maintain  will get trounced by any teenage girl in daddies lexus  ive resigned myself to never even see one of these let alone own one the piece and tranquility i now feel more than makes up for the loss
tfw you will never drive or probably see an m1 iro
one of the best looking cars imo
  how can anyone not want it  bold of you to imagine i dont jack off to the picture of an m1 everyday
post the black kidney grill on the x1 i think it looks way better heres the before
after
just got done replacing my alternator on the e60  can basically suck my own dick now from bending so far over  how is having to remove the whole radiator to get at a commonly serviced part a feature  muh small bodied v8  bruh im pretty salty at how tough getting that alty back in the bracket was
  radiator fan not radiator
  removing the clutch fan/rad fan for access is pretty standard on a lot of bmws
ive just finished paying my f30 340i i guess from the next month its back eating normal food instead of onions and bread
    cuckover scum
  get another bmw  fuck food
  not really a fan of the new moustachiod grill desu
  should i get an e90 i can work on my own shit
  also i shouldve been more specific id probably just get an 328i maybe xdrive because of snow
  love my e90 328i really nice driving car just be prepared to sift through some real shit if you go seeking one seems like lots of them get trashed by shit heads
  word ive been checking around ill make sure to try and find one thats well taken care of
how bad of an idea is it to get a used m4 looking at a 2016 one right now with mt and about 20k miles looks clean but havent tested it out yet
  what happened to the collage
  b l a c k  m a n s  w i e n e r
i can literally hear my secondary air pump fail in my bimmer when i start it up i gotta start it turn it off start it turn it off start it to be able to go or it just fugs up so bad and eventually stalls out lol god my e46 is so clapped out    im probably gonna end up fixing it up in january cause i just dont want another car none of them really satisfy me i want my ratchet shitbox    oh rain leaks in like crazy cause the molding is all rotting off think a bunch of liquid rubber would do the trick it seemed to work well enough for the sunroof broke had to reposition and seal it up when i did it like 5 years ago
  nah dont get the fucking xdrive half the problems on my shitbox is because i have a 325xi instead of a 325i fuck xdrive
  hell yea nigga    this is exactly what im looking for ty ty
  i know that feel i had a 2400 suspension bill for my e90 which was a lot of rice with peanut butter and sriracha
  f8x  no traction  manual implying less traction/grip than dct    just buy a salvage one     every frat kid ends up crashing them within 2 months besides theyre at half of even below a reasonable price such as 2030k
i recently got a 89 325i from my uncle and im having problems finding parts to fix it any help for a new fag
   fcpeuro dot com is all you need friend
      y/n talking down to 5k
  rockauto as well for regular shit like radiators and suspension parts  interior bits and bmw parts youll have to get from fcp or blunttech etc
  wrong    buy everything from fcp they got lifetime warranty on all parts
  it looks more like an ev now
whats the general opinion of the 4 series gc specifically the 435/440  i want a quick 4 door liftback that isnt a complete bore to drive and doesnt have as questionable a reputation as a kia
why does replacing the starter on an e46 take fucking 6 hours why do i have to disassemble half the fucking engine to get to it why do i have to remove so much shit who thought this was a good idea
  not gonna lie that looks pretty damn tasty
so its time to buy winter tires for my smol bmw    should i go for these all season tires size 225/45/17   or only winter size 205/55/16
  also keep in mind it rarely snows here its just a dry ass cold windy winter
i am thinking about buying an e46 320ci  any reasons i shouldnt do it and get the 4door 320i instead
  320ci  dont bother with this shitty engine  get a 330cd and enjoy
should i get an e38 v8  and why
  no and because the v12 exists
  the 4 series has a pretty good reputation for reliability surprisingly the last gen was rated the best in reliability above the 3 and 5 series      better reliability than the v12  better parts availability for the v8  better fuel economy on the v8
e36 coupe ftw
  comfy but rare to find one that isnt a modded piece of shit
  i wanted the v12 but im not sure if i can afford one
  if you cant afford to buy it you definitely cant afford to maintain it
  i agree the smaller the engine in e46 the more problems you will get
  if you really dedicate yourself to it you can run a v12 7 series on minimum budget perfectly fine  just fix everything yourself and read up on the cars and all the info you can  t owner of multiple v12 bmws
  im talking about maintaining it buying one would be not a problem of course      where are you from tell me more about your bmws please
  how able are you repairs wise like the other guy said if you diy then you can save a tonne of cash but if youre a newbie then a v12 is a bad choice to start wrenching on
    the 320i330i engines are virtually identical
  i did a lot of stuff on my motorcycles like changing the camshaft and removing the engine and installing oilcoolers and stuff like that im not a complete retard but i know of course that a v12 is something else   the problem im having regarding maintanance is mostly that i dont really have a space to do it i move around a lot
  2 door vs 4 door is only a matter of whether you value looks or practicality more with one exception if you need to replace the door seal on a 2 door it will be quite a bit more expensive than the 4 door but as far as i know this is the only major difference and id recommend getting a more powerful model than the 320 unless you really cant afford the purchase price
  i am from finland yes ive done rally with bmws to boot  ive owned a couple of e32s since ive been a teenager and learned to wrench on them only one of them wasnt a v12  owned one e38 too that i maintained pretty much all myself only had the hydraulic lines done by a shop because i have no lift and the transmission fixed by a pro because i didnt dare fuck with the 5hp30 and because it was like proper fucked  ive also owned dozens of e34 5ers of varying sizes smallest being a 520i with the m20b20 and biggest a 540i touring  never owned m cars because i dont want to be responsible for possibly fucking up a collectors item  newest bmw ive owned was probably the e60 535d i had although my e91 335d is the same vintage of 2007    also i tend to name all my cars when they prove themself worthy usually with 2 names a main name which tends to be after wwii ships and a nickname which is some girly or weebshit  3 series are named after destroyers 5ers after cruisers and 7 series after battleships
  why are my pics not uploading
jesus fuck this piece is sexy as hell like god damn i want to lick that body  not big on the engine swap which is apparently from an e90 m3 or something like that but the aesthetics are on point ihmo
  also i tend to name all my cars when they prove themself worthy usually with 2 names a main name which tends to be after wwii ships and a nickname which is some girly or weebshit  3 series are named after destroyers 5ers after cruisers and 7 series after battleships  thats pretty cool    how much l/100km are you getting with the v12
  depends i do a lot of city driving the e32s generally get around 350 to 40l/100km the e38 despite having a 54 litre v12 instead of the 5 litre in the e32 consumed less at around 25 to 30l/100km most probably due to better gearing of the 5 speed automatic    my current combined on the e32 is like 24l/100km and usually they sip at around 10 or so on the highway and when cruising e38s can get as low as 8 on comfy cruising
  40/l 100km what the fuck
  this is on an e38 though and they tend to consume less but you get the idea
  identical my ass  everyone and their mothers know that you go for i6 or you dont get a bmw  i4 is only acceptable on 1 series desu
is the om606 as good as everyone says it is
  the 320i330i are i6 you fucking moron 316 and 318 are 4cyl
  bmw built its legacy on 4 cylinders the e30 m3 was a 4 cyl and the most powerful f1 ever made was a bmw m10 with a massive turbo  sure some if not all of the worst bmw engines are 4 cyls but they have some gems in there too      it pretty much is or rather was most of them are driven to the ground by now and lmao succtubes
  its probably the best diesel engine of all time for tuning but its garbage when stock bmw m57 already has 200 hp stock and can gain 50 hp with just a remap so if you arent interested in heavy mods and 300 hp its probably the better option
  ok all memes aside but is there such thing as a reliable bmw that might sound like bait but im curious because i like bmws cars but every time i sort of get into them i keep hearing shit about how theyre expensive as fuck to work on and they have constant issues how real are these tropes
  they arent real and spouted by jap car fags who have never owned a bmw
  almost any diesel bmw m30 powered bmws m50 powered ones and so on  m30 was the big six used from the 60s till the 90s and built its reputation on rock solid build quality reliability and smooth power delivery downside is that its a fuckhuge lump sohc and with bad care they tend to chew through camshafts  m50 is more modern and they have bad waterpumps but that aside and some miscellaneous sensors they are quite reliable too and even take on abuse quite well  m50 engines in one form or another were found in almost full bmw range from your basic 3 to the 7 series
  ok so humor me because im coming from a honda civic that didnt really cost me anything outside of regular maintenance oil brakes rotors with the occasional fix such as headlights or a rusted tire rod and now a wrx that hasnt given me any issues at all generally speaking what bmw cars should i be aiming for that are similar to the civic in the sense that i really dont have any issues but with the power and fun of my wrx now
  buy an e46 i6 and do stuff that pops up yourself its ridiculously easy and parts are cheap and plenty shoplifetv and the50skid are a good starting point on yt to get to know everything you need to know about working on an e46 e46fanaticscom has a great buyers guide
  and when i say the wrx hasnt given me any issues at all i mean i used my civic money to buy a 2015 wrx with the fa20 had it a year now and havent had any issues obviously this is not a fair comparison because its so new but if and when i get out of the wrx im always looking at other cars and saying can i see myself driving that
  is there a large aftermarket for them in the us i have a heavily modded diesel truck but id like a car as well
  ok so wiki says they had a bunch of different engines from 2l i4 to a 32l i6 plus the diesel variants and m3s are cool and all assuming i could find one that wasnt shit on but what other specific models and stuff
  dont listen to him and buy an e38 750il instead theyre good reliable cars  if you insist on having an e46 pretty much anything with an inline 6 is solid the 4 cylinders had some issues with crank bearings going bad after some time for example  also subframe cracks are a real thing on the e46
  a bmw that will only require oil changes and nothing else is pretty hard to get although that can happen if you get a pristine one with a very caring owner the most likely scenario if you buy one that has been well maintained is fixing a few minor issues for like 200 and then just regular maintenance for the next few years my e46 cost me 500 in repairs in one year although it is a bit older and high mileage than the very best ones on the market so i saved more than that in the purchase price and after i fixed those things in the beginning now its been working fine for quite a while no problems since then doing the work yourself is a good idea if you can most older bmws are pretty easy to work on and it will save you a lot of money since its not usually the parts that are the expensive bit  the 1 thing to do before buying one is researching all of the common problems the particular model had how much they cost to fix and making sure they have been fixed already do not under any circumstances buy a bmw with a really cheap purchase price and poor maintenance this is the worst mistake you can do and the origin of most reliability horror stories the better maintained examples can be a lot more expensive than a bad example even if its the same model year and mileage but its worth getting the more expensive one it will save you money in the long run
whats everyones thoughts on the e82 135i
  id avoid the i4s theyre seriously underpowered for the heavy chassis that is the e46 nonm i6 320i330i are probably the most optimal as far as reliability and performance is concerned the engines are bulletproof and theyre decently quick m3 is in a whole different league the performance is significantly better but theyre also 3x as expensive as the best 330i and have a few more reliability issues a well maintained 330i is probably the best option if you cant afford the price up front and possibly tax and insurance then get the next biggest engine you can i got the 323i because the road tax still remains reasonable and theyre a lot cheaper to buy than the 330i but if i had a bit more money id definitely go for a bigger engine
    also the 330d is a great engine and actually better for light tuning than the 330i
  theyre cue little buggers and pretty much the modern e30 handles exceptionally well loads of power for such a small car and just all around nice to drive  not a very practical car though as theyre small
  what about the whole n54 vs n55 deal whats better    im thinking of buying one as i particularly love small cars
  n54 is twin turbo and has a few issues going although bmw did try to fix the situation and the engines with recalls n55 is single turbo and more reliable but they also have their fair share of problems neither are bad engines really but they arent without their flaws  n54 is more tuner friendly though and has better aftermarket and because it is twin turbo so more room to fuck around
  ty for the insight anon
  tbh im kinda bummed the e81 and e87 didnt get the 135i guise wouldve been hilarious and a total golf rapemachine
  how does b58 compare to both
  130i is pretty quick  260hp/2800 lbs
  theyre also a shitstain company that doesnt care about their employees or suppliers same shit as ecs  at least rockauto doesnt pretend to be anything other than a wholesaler
  cant really comment personally but it managed to top wards top 10 engines list again this year if memory serves its also part of the new modular engine family meaning that botht eh diesel and gasoline engines are developed from the same unit meaning that in theory it should have the harder bits of diesel engines and in theory have similar reliability to diesel engines      yeah but it could be quicker e36 325 is quite quick but 328 is quicker thus better dont you agree  same for the v8 powered e34 5ers the 530 was quick but the 540 was quicker and thus better
im looking to upgrade my current car does anyone have a f22 220i/228i whats it like
  nigga no one here has anything above beat to shit e36s
  chink car
    v12 city driving fuel efficiency  more like n/a  also averaged about 1l/10km highway in my e32 750il myself
  yeah and how much were you coasting these things suck shit for city driving em pee gees thus they have 100 litre fuel tanks its not a car where you give a shit about fuel efficiency anymore just go full american and live with it
  several posters in these threads have e9x and f series m cars
  im having trouble figuring out how to remove parts the black piece was painted by my uncle how would i go about removing and where would i go to replace it
  and is this rust or something else is it on the bumper
  its a bumper
    youre way too stupid for cars maybe head over to /mlp/ or something
  is there a large aftermarket for them in the us  no  you will have to get everything ie pump and manifold from the europe
  a very caring owner    stopped there phew youre a dipshit
im going to be looking at a 2008 e92 328i in my area soon what should i be looking at/for when evaluating it im going to get it inspected by a third party but are there any telltale signs to avoid the car before taking it to get a ppi
  telltale sign  yeah its an e92
  probably the worst generation to get in terms of maintenance they have a lot of problems and you cant really fix them yourself the e46 was one of the last chassis that are easy to work on and reliable enough im biased though i had 4 e36s and a e34 540i my coworker has a e92 328xi and that thing is fucked all the time its always got an issue and the window regulator has broke on it 3 times he has to take it to the dealership too to put it in perspective the e92 has no way to measure oil besides a faulty electronic sensor thats how much bmw wanted you to be able to fuck with that car i pulled the motor out of an e36 by myself in 3 hours never having done it before also have a turbo e36
  my e46 is about to clock over to 200k feels good      ima guess 330i pre facelift with the sp the sap is real easy to replace it just costs your right nut to buy the molding however is cheap but a bitch to replace have you checked your drains had a shit tone of pine needles clogging up my passenger side roof once took me a weekend to find where they were      its a bit much for one but it looks like its well taken care of id go for it just know at that milage the piston rings and oil consumption starts to get real bad
what issues do e82s with the n54 have other than hpfp and oil pan gasket thanks in advance
  water pump
jag xj v12  bmw v12
  congrats ive been debating on doing the same but i dont think i can give up eating like a cow eg fast food tons of booze etc to make up for it good on you for sticking with it though
please dont hate me _
will tuning a stock n54 for a little more power cause serious problems  would i have to do some preventive maintenance and parts replacement  i never seem to get over 3k rpm driving it to my wagecuck job but sometimes i get to 6k or 7k on the mountains or just fucking around on empty roads  also i have engine ticking which doesnt seem like its too much of a big deal after some research
oh sweet the weekly every bmw newer than mine isnt a real bimmer anymore thread     theres a reason these generals die off so quick and spoiler alert its because most of you are a bunch of poor twats with a massive chip on your shoulder
  seems like a very civil thread youre the one being a belligerent fag here
  cant hear you over muh last real e36 clapped out shitbox
  its a bit much for one but it looks like its well taken care of id go for it just know at that milage the piston rings and oil consumption starts to get real bad  text the guy that im willing to buy for 4700  sorry man sold today  the ad has been up for about a month and of course the week im interested in it it sells    kill me
tfw sat in a brand new m3 today  fuck it felt comfortable the leather on the door cards was so damn nice and the wheel felt so good in my hands not a fucking chance of affording one though but i can dream
  not a real bimmer anyway so what does it matter amirite
  unfortunate anon just keep saving up more money another nice bimmer will show up one of these days it took my a pretty long time to find mine and its worth being patient
  in what way is it not real
  its not a slow ass e36 thats beat to shit and all i can afford its so obvious
  oh noes a company competes in the market to make money
  eat shit jagfag m70 best v12 if the jag shitheap was so great then why did mclaren use the m70 based s70 in their f1 instead of the jag engine    man id trade my soul and both nuts off for an m760li i love most new bmws even the x6 things
  yes for all the hate the f30 gen got the m3 was very fucking nice to drive and very fucking fast     i can see why bmw does it the initial experience is extremely good the weight and numb steering and the auto blip are all flaws that seep out later     personally i hope the next gen is awd drive or even mi hybrid
  8 series looks nice but dont pretend pig fat camrys with m badges are better than the e46     bmws market changed from track fags to stacys and stacy wants a comfy ride with tech and bmw obliges    there is a fundamental change at the brand and everyone knows it but you     the bmw execs offer the old fans exactly 2 cars the z4 and the 2 series coupe
  e9x m3  camry with an m badge    youre a retard parroting the same things over and over while your posts read like a frustrated incel babby just start railing against the jews in your next post for the complete trifecta of asshurt
  butthurt poorfag who just leased a 320i
  i wasnt him fag and i wasnt talking about the m cars the old nonm cars were fun to drive the current 3 series is a camry you clearly have spent zero time in one
  nothing wrong w/ the 320i its a good daily driver
mercedes  bmw
  paying premium for bmw  buy cheap 4banger  i am better then all of you  joe in his v6camry blows door off while saving 20k
  joe has a fucking v6 camry though that will never have the nice exterior the driving dynamics the interior or the prestige of a bmw though  joe has a fucking camry
  next gen m3 is going to be offered in 2 versions  less powerful rwd with 6spd manual available  more powerful awd with auto only
    and what do you drive
  i drive a beat to shit v12 bmw joe in his camry can go suck dick as he aint blowing no doors off nor keeping up with that shitbox of his
  i drive a beat to shit v12 bmw  and whats the acv of your beat to shit v12 bmw im asking cause youre in here calling people poorfag
  i never called anyone a poorfag i just pointed out that joe has a fucking camry
e34 535i  how much hp can i expect with a turbo or super
  depends on how big the compressor is
  i meant to reply to   you shouldve been able to figure that out
  what part of saving 20k you didnt understand joe does not need to show off or ever have to defend 4banger bmw while you need to debedge that shitbox
thoughts on nos in a 89 325i
  sure if you have engine ready for replacing
  joe has a fucking camry
  and you have cheapest bmw 3seris dont you get embarrassed at stop light  or you just have window rolled down thinking people admire that shit
  i dont have a 3 series though
  cheapest 3 series is infinitely better than a fully loaded camry and you know it
  i owned a 330ci with a 5 speed i hated it an electronic throttle with a clutch is not pleasant the idle control valve would kick in while the load increased as the clutch slipped then shut again once you were in gear going about a mile per hour it was subtle but distinctly present the non liner throttle response sucked my dad has one to this day in auto and loves it but that car always was a poor choice plus no option for limited slip unless you swap subframes i will maintain to this day e46s other than ms are truly awful enthusiast cars
  i dont know about that the fully loaded hybrid camrys are nice the only problem is theyre ugly grandmamobiles
  lol you really wanted to show the world you made it huh  using cars as statues symbol is really the worst most people dont really give a fuck but i am sure you go home with smile as you look back at ur car parked in front of your apartment really sad if you ask me
  bus rider detected   sour grapes
  so preferring a better handling more luxurious better looking more comfortable car is using it as a status symbol lmao youre clueless
  jealous bc he drives a clapped out camry   typical /o/tist
  i am sure you go home with smile as you look back at ur car parked in front of your apartment  i do this daily i like my car and value it more than some piece of shit camry is it wrong to enjoy things anon
  bmw fags in charge of judging interior quality    lmao    
  i test drove the new x3 40i and g30 530d recently and the interior quality was amazing  ive sat and driven several other modern cars new volvos benzs audis and the fit and finish was notably better for bmw interiors more quality materials used etc  matt notes on the high interior quality in the beginning  
        lol keep sperging you all know how sad your pathetic life is thinking some random person on street will admire you for some low trim bmw
  he buys his cars to impress other people  lmao end yourself
  keep being mad i dont give a fuck what others think about my shitbox i bought it to please myself and thus far it has done that exceptionally  remember to thank the busdriver you sperg
  life is all about enjoyment which i agree but buying low trim and acting all badass isnt it appreciate what you got and stfu
  learn to read retard  
  bruh i aint mad at all i am just enjoying you bmw fags sperging over 4banger models
  keep seething sperg the 316 overtaking your clapped out camry wasnt even racing you were just being slow
  arent you the one who said base 3seris is better then v6camry   just admit it you bought it because you wanted to show off nothing wrong with that instead you faggots parade around like its gods gift to man kind
  base 3 series is still better handling more luxurious more comfortable and better looking than any toyota  just because you spent bmw money on a polished turd aka fully loaded camry doesnt make it the better car
  have you seen new camrys and accord bruh at the entry luxury sedan price point camrys and accord are the car you can enjoy and save money at same time its like dumb people buying dream house as first house why would you spend that much just be cucked in engine
  niga meet me at the light
  why would you spend that much just be cucked in engine  because some people dont care about gotta go fast boyracer shit and can just enjoy a well balanced sorted chassis you dont need loads of power for the touge
  320i to the touge   well my work here is done have great day
  yeah you dont know much about cars   
  4 door is technically superior because its slightly stiffer and weighs the same  2 looks better though
  compact  i dont hate you but only because of the style 32s
    i dont think getting a 4cylinder in any bmw after the e30 is a good idea unless its the e36 compact or a modern turbo version the e46 is too heavy for it
  its true though
looking into buying a 2016 bmw 320i xdrive   talking me out of it
  pretty solid base model sedan m8  its so new many problems it has havent really surfaced
  save more and get better car
  why do people do this take e30s and e34s and putting imitation e46 and e39 bumpers on them
anyone remember the days when the series and model numbers had meaning now a 6 series is a long ass fucking station wagon hatch back abomination and 3 series are sedans only
  slavs
  and theyre not even consistent within their own naming system  split the 3 series into 2 models  make the 4 series to specifically differentiate it from the 3 series by having 2 doors and no other differences  make a 4 series with 4 doors anyway because fuck you
  pushing on things makes a noise  well holy shit who knew
  joe has to show off with a brand new camry instead of a 20 year old pre owned camry he got for 3k  joe is just a different kind of show off
anyone know if a few simple mods will void my sulev warranty
  this isnt even a joke everyone in my fucking family thinks bmws are the greatest brand in the world and worth dumping all your savings on as a status symbol    fucking slavs i swear
  also not even joking bmw is the most coveted marque in the world and it fucking pisses me off i just want to enjoy my e30 in peace without people irl going ohohoho fancy bmw or wow are you trying to impress people with an old bmw  then i come on the internet looking to confer with similar autists and you get people shitting up the generals because they got cut off by a leased 5er once  then i go to bmw forums and its all literal boomers raging about any deviation from stock    you cant win
  you own a bmw you can just pay for that scratch  legit stranger told that to a friend of mine when sitting on the hood of her car  needless to say the bitch had her hair yanked out
i have a 2018 430i is this car /o/pproved
been living in tokyo a few years work as a consultant making bank finally decided to get a car thinking of copping a 3 series    japs with money out here all do german cars and i need something classy for meeting clients audi and mercedes are pretty popular but i just prefer bmw aesthetics also even the hybrid model is fairly compact jap side streets are tiny and not too pricey    any advice
you will never be a full time bmw group employee and have access to the company lease program    goat fucking perk
  actually wanting a nubmw  acual goat would be a fleet of factorycondition historical models
  employees getting a brand new 4 series for 50 a month  yeah im fine with nubmw
  get an early 80s mercedes 300d
  pretty slick but i need something newer
  you dont need something newer you want something newer thats fine but dont conflate the issue
so apparently the e92 is fucked good to know   ok that means going down a generation which im ok with but hesitant because older means more miles on the car then let me ask the same question but in e46 form   what should i be looking for
  an e36
    i mean im not gonna debate need vs want    i work on the road a lot japanese roads are complicated i need connectivity proper chargers gps etc older cars complicate all of that     i also like automated parking highway lane assist advanced cruise assist sensors shit like that    could i make an older car work sure but its not worth the effort to me
  could i make an older car work sure but its not worth the effort to me
  i bought a 2015 320i xdrive a few months ago and i love it  nice interior great handling drives faster than expected
  i wish i wasnt so broke need to get her some help needs hydro fluid and the vanos looked at to start
  am i an idiot for wanting to buy a used e90 330d i live in australia so it makes sense here to own a diesel and most of my driving is on the highway anyway from what ive heard the diesel inline 6 bmws are supposed to be very reliable is this true
  idealy a zhp if youre a burger or the 330i or ci from 02 on facelift with the sp at around 130k the vanos starts to go out not crazy to replace headliner is shit cheack the voltage reg subframe is a big one they crack if you dont reinforce them at high milage theres plates for it on sell oil oil leaks everywhere and the opg is a big one the cooling system especially the expansion tank piston rings start to act up around 180k bushings are a big deal with the things     this is a good guide for mods         the e46 is not much better than the e92 its just easyer to work on imo i love mine but its a labor of love for shure
  the old xi and xdrive are very different
  whats xdrive like  is it worth getting over a rwd if im not trying to track the thing or kick the tail out on a regular basis
where should i buy a reliably used e46 most niggers near where i live have 120k miles on them and are charging 20k for them what gives what price and miles driven should i look for and what are the best resources to find one
  im not gonna lie its comfy in the snow and grips any road like a fucking orphan to anyone who shows it love but it also gets boring to drive   t bmw 328i owner
  nothing wrong with a us e92 if you get a later gen since theyd fixed the nikasil problem by then its not a problem if youre in europe though     the e60 is also good with the 525 and 530 being the most reliable models
  diesel  dude no im an ausfag too but i have a 530i that runs on premium if you cant afford the fuel you cant afford the car the diesel will really numb the fun factor of the car
  i had over 600k on my e60 530d which had the same engine and was hooned almost daily there are people on /o/ with closer to a million on the clock with the m57 engines    no it wont its a different kind of fun diesels offer plenty of torque from down low and the m57d30 is great fun across the revrange thanks to the generously sized turbocharger
should i buy a new m2 i have a f30 320i and i want something smaller faster and cooler was thinking of getting a used 911 but ive always wanted to own an m car    is this a good decision should i keep my 320 as a daily / beater
  no you should buy a v6camry instead saves you 20k you can use on drugs and alcohol to fill the void and alleviate the crippling depression for a while before you hang yourself due to the fact that you bought a fucking camry  otherwise id reckon the 320 being cheaper to keep than an m2 but it has no dice against the m2 in every other department save for maintenance and such expenses
  id personally get an m235i theyre around for half the price and have just about everything you could want minus the badge saying m2
  i can afford the fuel just fine i just prefer diesels and think it would better suit me considering i do mostly highway driving
  lol yeah id expect it to cost more to maintain as long as it is not too crazy the 320 actually isnt that bad for my personal taste just not as sporty
  had my eye on that when i was getting my car unfortunately i didnt hold out to test drive it honestly it would probably fit and exceed all my performance needs only issue is that i have a desire to own an m car so i think id regret not spending more need to check that off my list otherwise ill probably have regret and feel like i missed out if that makes sense
  this couldnt be more wrong  get a e9x over any e46
  get a lexus ls600
  paying double the price just to have it say m is a big thing though i get what you mean though but its down to you whether you can spend that extra money or if you can live it it not being an m     the m235 is a great car and is essentially an m2 anyway
picked up a 2012 e92 m3 today
  im sorry for you loss
  its got a carmax warranty perfect combo
  im in alaska and i saw that looking for ls swap candidates
  carmax wont replace the engine under warranty when the rod bearings fail so get them checked asap
    this is one of the best coupes of all time  the swirl marks bother me though
  pic related      pretty cool but that black looks so off with the carbon roof and spoiler
tfw come home from parents house  still no winter tires  road is frozen  cant back up onto driveway  end up parking on the street blocking my driveway  some retard crashed into my moms car a few weeks ago when she parked like i did    i sure hope nothing bad happens
takin the e90 to bmw today for the air bag and pcv recalli fucking hate going there can some one hold my hand
  yeah that carbon roof makes it look weird also get you some polishing pads and a buffer and get rid of those swirls marks in the paint other than that i love it
  no loaners make them give you one
is it wise to buy a used m3 2015 when it had 3 owners at 15000 miles
  yeah ill probably take it to get a proper detail    im going to send the oil to blackstone for analysis but its not as valuable information since the bearing material changed carmax warranty will cover engine replacement i cant find the thread on m3boards but someone has done it already
  im gonna try n get one
  why not just detail it yourself
  e92
  because i live in an apartment and cant do it in my parking garage i have all the supplies from before i moved but i hate doing that kind of stuff at the pull in wash places
  actually e93 to be specific
m43b18 e36 sounds good doesnt it inb4 m50 i need to afford gas lpg somehow without it shitting itself
  old bmw diesel engines are ass  source my e34 24d
how comfortable are the backseats of a 3 series convertible is it noticeably different in various generations
  if your under 58 its ok i take my girlfriend and out lady friend out some times and we take the e93 and shes about 56 120lbs and shes perfectly comfy
  buying an old bmw which can potentially cost thousands in repairs  worrying about saving a few hundred at best in fuel  ill never understand this mindset if you want to save money buy a corolla if youre going to get an old bmw with a million possible things that can go wrong at least get a decently powerful engine otherwise its completely pointless
  theres a very small difference between the m43 and m50 in fuel consumption the only money youll save is on the purchase price
  its because you are american  upkeeping an old bmw is cheaper than upkeeping a toyota in europe
  are those factory wheels they look way too cool to be stock good looking car
  absolutely agree go big or dont do it at all
  factory  bmw has some of the best looking oem wheels ever
  the 440i is absolutely shit   this dude i run canyons with had his break down stranding him like 5 times and 1/2 the time some electrical problems were fucking with the shifter and dashboard
  pic unrelated
im being a total faggot and no one can stop me
  are those winter wheels/tires
  tfw 90s bmw was peak bmw
  idk man ive had my f30 for over 4 years and nothing major only a parking light bulb went bad and i replaced it for 4          xdrive    why didnt you gentlemen buy the rwd i love my low speed fishtailing too much to get the awd lol
      i am a normie i know shit about fixing cars hardest thing i ever did was power steering hoses to  from pump on an e30 its like an hour long job and it took me two days    is buying link related a bad idea should i just get a honda
  pic  i think the hatch is sexy and i want an m42 over any other engine
  i love the look of steelies good stuff anon
i say go for it if thats what you want    i got a story for /o/ tho    be me buy 530i msport e60  before buying he mentions parking lights dont work properly   he says he will fix it   totally forget about it until now   but anyway after i get it i do oil change get sold the wrong fucking filter so have to clean the last filter and chuck that back in until i can source some filters that will actually fit   have to code in aux and code the cars ccc back to defaults after replacing ccc because the one that was in the car was faulty   all working well  heater doesnt work only blows hot air through one vent all the others are cold   its summer where i live so its not such a problem but have to get around to fixing that   mfw mechanically the cars been perfect its just electronic issues galore    pic related what my dis looks like its always red up the top where it shows outside temp and time    if i reset the ccc it will fix this issue for some time but will always come back if i drive around for a bit stop the car then start it again the screen will return to orange when engine is warm     there is no errors showing and the adaptive steering fault just goes away ive noticed no change while driving but that fog light warning is probably something relating to do with the driving lights he said he fixed somehow i just dont know    the right side rear light was all wired up wrong and all the wires were burnt so had to fix that ive had a rear number plate light failure but fixed that bought some led ones anyway to replace the old    thats pretty much my bmw story thus far over the span of less than a month
what would be a reasonable price for this  
im thinking about a 335 with the n54 should i get a convertible i love being a fuckin cunt and playing music and driving around with the top down and it seems like the perfect im an adult with a job and want a comfortable car car i also spend nearly 2 hours a day in the car so i want to be comfortable
  i would offer 5000   that interior is porn
  should i get a convertible  no
    seconded for 5k
    retard here who cant drive stick what do you guys think are the rear seats in these coupes pretty much impossible for normal people to fit into
any horror stories about european 1 series bmws notable mechanical/electrical failures  would it be appropriate for a first car
in my heart of hearts i want an e34 540i because its small i love the styling low tech and has enough space to haul people/things if need be but for some sinking reason i have a bad feeling about a car that old so my gut is saying go for a 1 series because theyre about the same size and is supposed to be more fun to drive
  neat at 183cm theyre too small for me my head hits the roof and my knees hits the front seat
  i had an e34 540i touring as my hoon machine  paid 300 bucks for it drove it hard for 2 years before it broke down and the transmission went but that was wholly my own fault  only problem the car had during the time was a fucked crank position sensor
  find a good one that had a lot of the rubber components already replaced and it should be pretty reliable the e34 is simple old tech so the things that will go wrong are due to age not the complexity of the car like the newer bmws
  one of the best first cars up there with rwd toyotas
  am manlet and its not really bareable for me
  only just doing the airbag recall  scary man a few people have already died from those things i got mine changed as soon as i could      i want these wheels badly but the prices can be quite insane plus there are a lot of fakes now because of their popularity
  make sure you check the carfax and have a mechanic inspect it before you buy also dont pay that much that fucking stealership screams overpriced buy here pay here pay cash    rear seats  theyre ight ive sat in the back of my old coworkers e46 a couple of times on the way to lunch about the same room as anything other coupe out there
  more of a silver grill person myself
  a man of culture
  what do you get from posting fake stories here
  i was told i bought it off the original owner and that it was only ever in ca and tx  lol fuck this guy 6800 for a 30 year old manual with over 100k miles id low ball him down to 4500 after you make him produce a carfax report
redpill me on the e46 30 diesel  good first car i hear the engine is pretty good
  my winter/job daily is a e36 316i compact and love it it makes me appriciate my e91 325d more
  yeah
should i do bms stage 1 tune i have a n20 engine seems like a cheap way to get some more fun but my car is out of warranty not sure if any damage would be worth it in the long term
  the 30 diesel is a great choice for the e46 probably even better than the 30 petrol the e46 itself aside from the engine isnt that great in terms of reliability although the good news is that parts are cheap in europe and there are diy guides for pretty much every possible problem you can have read up on every e46 buyers guide you can find to see exactly what to look for it would take way too long to write everything here
  why not though
  the european diesels run forever like holy shit those things can go long the station car ones
  bmw made a twinturbo dohc v8 diesel  dropped it into astonishingly beautiful e38 7series as the 740d  the us didnt get it  being a burger has its perks but when it comes to diesels we get shafted
  dont waste your time with a 328i you cant do anything to them go 335i
    sup fags    why buy a bmw when for nearly the same money i can buy a porsche which is not better built in every detail but also retains value infinitely better
  can you take your wifes son to school in that unsafe overpowered compensation machine i think not the x2 is simply epic and has plenty of room for gamestoptm hauls and jaquarius friends
    which is not only better built
  you cant but thats not why this threads exists we like bmw because used bmws are among the best bang for your buck cars if you know what youre doing the e46 330ci is an excellent rwd na canyon carver with a longitudal smooth i6 the 335i is a 10k tt car that can go 060 in 37 seconds with less than 1k of mods yet still remains a comfortable dd also theyre super fun to drive even at low speeds theyre comfy well built fast german shitboxes
  wheres your porsche collage though    op dropped the ball big time btw
  4chan generals are a really big deal  t nerd
  obvious sarcasm wasnt so obvious this time id love a porsche for the record but i cant find 911s for 10k like i can m3s
  different people like different things faggot are you 12
  meant for 
  is the e46 the ultimate pleb bmw now all the turks have gone from the e36 to the e46 now too
should i buy this    2500    m3 sedan manual  all new suspension and body bushings a few years ago   new alternator last year   comes with a set of ds2 wheels with the set of snows you see    needs   rotors pads all around   shocks/struts   drivers rear tower just discovered been driving it with these needs for years    offers in person only off the road     no trades    193k
  25k for an m3  that seems weirdly cheap
  it does have some rust and the seats are pretty beat but it just seems too cheap
  still it is an m3 properly fixed up it can be worth a bit of cash and it is a fun car    if youre mechanically able get it but dont dare touch it if you are going to rely on a mechanic for everything
  theres no way the motor isnt fucked all of the 24v m motors are worth at least 1500 and people buy m shells all the time just for the vin  jump the fuck on that and update us
any experience with the e9x 335d i love the idea of a fast diesel and this one is very quick some even call it the diesel m3 they make gobs of torque and can sound menacing with a proper exhaust theyre all auto but from what ive gathered its a responsive trans and it even rev matches on downshift pic related is an incredibly rare msport ive found a couple for sale stateside and i want to look into one
  is the rear tower cracked if so thats why its so cheap thats very expensive to repair correctly also if it got new suspension a few years ago why does it need new shocks and struts somethings fishy i suspect he went over a big bump and fucked something
  fatt marah did a one take on one and he seemed to enjoy it if i remember correctly check that out
  will do thanks anon reliability wise i know most of the issues seem to come from the emission controls which you can bypass um less than legally
  theyre the wheels you get with the competition package
  fun fact this engine was used to power some european trams
okay so im the fag who asked about the 1 series in   is the 118d a good pick the 1 series market here in france is absolutely flooded with 118d and 120d models but all i can afford is the 118d really because first car and no insurance will insure a 25 yo for a 177ch coupe even a 143ch 118d will cost me a premium and its the starter level for the coupe  i want the coupe because holy shit it looks so much better than the hatchback fuck practicality im single and have no friends
  its an ok car  1 series is kinda cheap to upkeep
408 mph muthafukkas
  well this is good because im not exactly rich
  fun fact they were planning on using it to power armored combat vehicles too but it was deemed too expensive for that purpose
  what the fuck did you buy the whole completely oem suspension all from a dealership or something
  every single jag owner i know or have heard of have constant big expensive problems that no one can find the root of and most of them are sat in the garage for years on end in nonrunning condition  really nice engies youre right
  imagine being this autistic
  no the 330d is a fucking great car the engine is almost bulletproof and if you want to slightly modify it they have a huge power potential    diesel will really numb the fun factor of the car  a 320d can keep up with your 530i  a 330d will be even or faster than your 530i  a lightly modded 330d will absolutely destroy your 530i and any other petrol e60 except for the m5 or maybe a modified 535i  
  just remove the dpf and block the egr and have them coded out when you get the car remapped more power better fuel consumption faster turbo spooling  better reliability and more cancer spewing into the lungs of the nerds behind you
got in to fix my 2004 e60 coolant leak  pic related  mfw  60k miles 100k kilometers  guess its over then
  that was actually part of the plan if i got one that and a muffler delete straight pipes on a 335d makes it sound badass gives it a really gutteral noise
  good stuff personally i wouldnt go full straight pipe i have a 320d i removed the muffler and dpf has a nice growl to it and makes sound when you give it some throttle but its not obnoxiously loud i imagine the 335d would be similar except of course the 6 cylinder sounds much better id probably leave the middle silencer in but thats personal of course good on you getting a 335d absolutely monster cars with great engines and huge power potential
  what engine and why not fix it yourself  if its the v8 engines theyre fairly costly to fix but not all that hard to do by yourself something like in the 500 range if you do it yourself and replace every single gasket and such like youre supposed to  20 if you do them like i did and that 24 was for a case of shitty beer
  ill look into my options if i do end up getting it heres an example of what a straight piped one sounds like in case you were curious  
  that actually doesnt seem too loud fyi have a professional do your work if you have anything custom made and have it made from stainless steel with stainless welds this is whats under mine now on my old 530i i had almost the same thing done but by some cheap garage they used regular steel and that shit was rusted to fuck after like a month
  thanks im having them only fix the waterpump  this was the first time i had it checked out in an actual bmw service because i moved
  wait what kinds of shit that invoice includes 23k is way too much for a waterpump jon that you can do yourself in like a hour  youll have to drain and remove the radiator though which is a bitch
  550 to only have the waterpump replaced  im not a handy guy
  will do man i appreciate the advice a quality stainless exhaust would definitely make that 335d sing been bitten by the diesel bug since i daily drove my old merc 300d for a month or so and ive been looking at fast diesels to replace what the current daily bmw diesels seem like the way to go
  i bought a very cheap e90 recently but it had a gasket cover leak so the engine has oil all over and im not sure exactly how to clean it off literally caked on everything
  1m
  bmw m8 competition was just leaked  
  how much does it cost for a custom muffler from a shop would be nice to get something on my f30 but dont want anything too loud / annoying
    should i buy this or is it a lemon
they are alright do an engine swap
  i prefer 4 doors but they are very decent bmws in fact the last good bmw imo
  y
id put a stereo in it becuase i enjoy listening to the radio when driving but the price seems right for that
  thx
didnt see a thread discussing the new honhon
rear
  probably because no one cares
  its not cheap yet
  i dont see one discussing the french rioting in the streets and all of europe running out of diesel but here we are
  dct  no manual no care
  it was launched like a year ago its hardly brand new handles great    
i met a guy who owned an alpine a310 in the states i think like a lot of french cars theyre full of quirks and interesting features
  i think they share their wiper arrangement with the panhard dynas and nothing else    
  overpriced underpowered overweight with only a dct why would anybody care
4 cylinder  open diff  interior materials are cheap  costs around 60k  why i wont deny this car has some great engineering it and is better/nicer than something like a mustang gt in a lot of ways but where is the value
   diff  easy fix   materials are cheap  who cares   around 60k  better alternatives at that price point
  huh thats interesting    it also had three lug wheels for some reason
  overweight
i dont get these they catch fire and have those french quirks     in a market/price point dominated by the cayman/boxster i dont know whyd youd go for this
  so 250hp at 11tons is underpowered now
  cause cayman/boxster weigh about 500kg more  every review comparing them usually says the a110 is more fun
  its about 300kg actually and the reviews dont consider the practical ownership aspect of these cars     whereas in reality these things will plummet in value and the porsche offering will be more reliable and hold its value far better     which is why i think sales of these are ultimately going to struggle the people with the budget for these arent going to go for them
  lighter weight than 4 or 5 lug wheels mostly
no lsd no want
daytona appreciaton thread
weird flex but okay

  many people have been able to build somewhat reliable om606 superturbo builds maybe there is something wrong with your friends build like insufficient cooling or weak hoses leaking coolant or oil did he settle for sensible build aiming for 300 to 400hp range using something like holset hx40 or did he attempt an overkill aiming over 600hp    anyway given the point of this thread i really should have said something like ls swap it or mercedes m120 swap it instead of thinking something that could be done relatively easily and has been done to death then again speaking of more realistic options i guess turbocharging the existing m103 engine using the overpriced turbobandit stuff is an option
  awd system from the awd version  twin turbo  somehow make it lose 200kg without having to strip it
  illiterate  cummings  likes rolling coal  like pottery
  make it run again injector pump gremlins please sod off  nice wheels like pic related  roll cage with pkm mount on front door
e90 330xi  ideally id like to improve its handling and capability while retaining its comfiness  1 the electronically adjustable m3 suspension and brakes while youre at it please  2 supercharger kit and more durable clutch  3 rwd drivetrain swap    i considered supercharged s54 instead but id rather the computers in the car all work as intended
make it wrcspec  make it run on air so it doesnt need fuel to drive checkmate ecofuckers  make it indestructible in term of parts and crashes  arigatou porungasama
  i dont want mods just fix the paint fix the bumper replace the front shocks

why would anyone do that its the torque graph of the ferraris turbo v8
should be pretty obvious if you think about it for about 20 seconds
  many cars and bikes torque limit in lower gears    do you have any idea what traction is brainlet
op is a brainlet
  my bmw is torque limited so hard in first it feels like it accelerates harder after the shift to second does make modulating traction much easier on a launch though    people get the best 1/4 mile and 060 times launching my car in second    op is deffo a brainlet
      a lot of boost controllers do the same thing limiting peak boost in lower gears
  modern cars and electronic throttles make that method of torque limiting deprecated    now the computer just limits throttle even at full throttle input
  neat  manufacturers trying to get people to keep it between the ditches i suppose
  saabs limit boost in 1st and 2nd gear  its stupid shit that should be illegal
  its actually pretty annoying how much modern electronic throttles cuck you pic related is a graph of rpm vs requested throttle opening xy and the actual throttle output from the computer  example is an r6 but the same sort of shit is going on in cars as well for emissions and noise regulations
  to be fair limiting wheelspin on a bike is important  i guess thats why everybody goes out and gets a plugin tuner when they want more power
  lol so dum roasting tires  fasts
  if you have ever had a directly cableoperated throttle 600 you would know that opening the throttle all the way at low revs is slower than a partial opening smaller flow area from low throttle helps get the air up to a reasonable velocity in the intake ports which helps fill up the cylinders better    that throttle map may be a bit neutered to help with noise and emissions under regular riding conditions but that kind of thing can be used to make full throttle give the best results from any rpm and scale down from there
pee is stored in the balls
  i would give some credence to what youre saying but my first bike was a cbr600f4i with a direct cable throttle and ive had my r6 remapped to pic related which resulted in a huge bump to seatofthepants midrange power
  performance car  restricts performance  next thing you know people buy a track car and theyre only allowed to sit bitch when theres a trained professional free to take you around in your car
  most of the freed power is a result of not running it absolutely lean as shit to pass emissions mileage etc half of the reason why bikes list dry weights as opposed to fully fueled to stop those faggots shrinking the tanks
  is this the difference between horsepower and torque

  starter motor stopped working at a gas station 10mins from home  i tried smacking it a few times with a tire iron but it didnt do the trick   ended up just calling the tow truck since its free and the car was still under warranty
    on motorized dirt bicycle  coming up on a turn  suddenly rear wheel locks  the ass end walks out and i go wide and plow through the turn  end up balls deep in a deep mud hole  motor just free spins in gear  the snap ring that holds the front sprocket on decided to fuck off into a low earth orbit because i didnt seat it all the way which allowed my sprocket to walk off the shaft and bind up on the swingarm locking the rear wheel  luckily i was only a ten minute walk from camp
  nah but i get paranoid about that shit or getting in a nearfatal accident with no one around for miles and bleeding out
my brakeline exploded in my 62 at the liquor store i had to wait in the parking lot for 3 hours getting harassed by every homeless and old person bugging me about my car

  my brothers exploder ign key got stuck 3 hours away had to go out with an air chisel with the tip right under the key i got it to turn and drove it home then replaced the cylinder and rekeyed it for him
  oh goodie story time    summer ending soon want to do something fun  why not explore the desert  pack up my shit in the trusty metro and head out  turn off highway 130 miles from home still have 30 miles left  28 miles off the highway on a long dirt road drive over pothole  unholy grinding  car doesnt move only grinding  try pushing it back putting it in reverse the grinding continues  well fuck  no cell service  ranch house 7 miles back load up backpack with water and head out  one mile away jeep with antelope hunters rolls up offers me a ride to the ranch  get to the ranch thank them and they leave  knock on door get no answer  yell loudly knock loudly  nothing  sit on their porch for a half hour trying to get cell service but cant  what if they dont even come home today  fuck it ive got to contact someone  try the door its unlocked  open it a crack and yell inside  no response  well here we go  i enter the house
  no one is there thats certain  where the hell is a phone  i cant find one there is no phone  well fuck again  i manage to get a hold of my brother for a minute at least someone knows where i am  see a tablet  use it to log into my email  proceed to email my brother and dad  sit there doing this for hours  dogs outside start barking and running  first vehicle yet coming up the road  it must be the owners  go out onto their balcony make myself known from a distance  they park i approach them and let them know my situation  the old man looks at me cautiously
  get shot
  ok fuck green text thats annoying    him and his wife were ok with what i did i wasnt the first person who this had happened to and they understood my brother and dad were still hours away from arriving so we went inside and spent the next three or four hours talking he told me about his time going the university i currently attend back in the 60s his wife told a fun story about coming home in the morning and finding someone on the couch she thought it was her brother so she started shaking him only to find out it was someone who had slept in their house overnight it was one of the coolest experiences of my life and these were some of the nicest people ive ever met it felt like the closest thing to kinos journey that ill ever get    later my dad and brother show up and we get my car loaded onto the trailer i get it into the shop a week later and they said the transaxle shat itself i got a new trans and upon disassembling the old transmission i found that it was just one gear in the whole thing that died while having my last fun trip of the summer ruined and the 1500 repair bill sucked the worst part was going back to work the next day and realizing that after the crazy adventure i just had its back to the same old shit      i was worried about this especially when opening the door the first time and when i first met the owners i didnt know how they were doing to react
  i was drunk af once and ended up putting my chevette in the ditch where the rear wheels were off the ground i put my bumper jack on the front and lifted it to where i could get some traction off the back that was a close call
my foxbody decided to eat a pip hall effect sensor in the middle of nowhere my wife was only 6 miles away so it got fixed quickly
  never even when i misplaced the radiator fan fuse and causing the coolant to overheat i managed to drive it home safely and fix the problem the next day  toyota
  the worst part was going back to work the next day and realizing that after the crazy adventure i just had its back to the same old shit

transmission in my dakota exploded on the highway near milan mi fortunately there was an exit right there i could coast     unfortunately that exit led to a side road up to a medium security prison complex     truck sitting out by a prison with a driver inside that drew a lot of suspicion had a few unmarked cop cars drive by before one asked me what i was doing continued to drive by and ask for the next two hours while i waited for a ride    my dad ended up using his work truck with a trailer to tow it home that night while unmarked cop cars continually passed him and shone their high beams at him

timing belt went out in my truck at about midnight and there were no other cars out driving since i live in the country side so i just coasted the car half a mile into a gas station

thoughts on an 0809 cayenne gts for like 1820k
  you wont get an answer because literally every one here has a shitbox
  are you implying a cayenne isnt a shitbox
  no  i see cayenne s going for about 5k here because theyre utter shit  not sporty cant offroad basically a touareg with a porsche badge and the service/repair costs associated with it    if youre a boomer who doesnt care about actual performance costs and just want a cheap porsche badge go for it youll learn your lesson anyway
  no im just implying that you can get a shitbox cayenne for much cheaper
  what this guy said    here in the uk cayennes are cheap as fuck because theyre a cunt to run nobody wants them
hey /o/ quick question for your lads i drive a 2016 malibu lt and last night i had a weird problem where when i lightly pressed on the brakes and the car felt like i had slammed on them i was going slow in a parking lot but anytime i touched the pedal the car jumped and it felt like the brakes went full power to a stop i turned the car off and let it rest for a while and drove it home fine now im worried to get back in it any ideas
santa gave you sport brakes haha
  santa almost killed me lol
  a glitch in the abs module programming had the same thing happen in my 2017 malibu one time last year shut the car off and back on it never happened since
  should i get it looked at its the first and only time its ever happened to me
    check for recalls as this sounds like a generic problem with a sensor module/ecu
    how do you get rif of he kfc smell
does anyone here know where the starter relay is for a honda 1996 civic ex standard    i found the main one and seems to be working fine its not under the hood by the battery those are relays and fuses for other things i see the relays and fuses under the steering wheel but the only one labeled close was a starter fuse and that was fine there are three easily visible relays but one is for the lights and the other two im not sure here is one i pulled out does anyone know how to test for continuity within a relay itself thanks
  thanks bro
you stupid honda cunt did you really have to make a whole new thread about that when there is honda general god damn fucking mongoloid
impressive
  china  10 says the batteries are just soup cans tied together with string with the words state of solidify buttery written in sharpie on the side of the box
  i have directly stolen all the research by samsung and panasonic in the field of solid state and am now hiding behind my government while building what are essentially bombs
  ssb dont work in economies of scale even mass produced ones would make your iphone cost 1000s
  because china totally didnt make the batteries in your phone
  /thread
is it possible that china is making this statementboasting about their progress in solid state batteries to trick one of the front runners in the development of solid state batteries to speak up so they know who to hack next after all that is how china advances their tech or so it seems
  happening solid state battery is here  these were researched many years ago by lots of different researchers and companies in the usa europe and other countries in asia such as toyota in japan and samsung in south korea    the chinese project is just to muddy the patent waters in china to give additional shielding for their government to help chinese insider companies ignore patent laws this is a commonly used tactic in the past cases of patent fraud the chinese then use their most favored nation treaty status to push their lowerpriced patent fraud gear into the usa market and cannibalize customers so that the original inventor runs out of money once that happens the chinese often buy up the inventors company or patent rights or forcibly sign licensing deals to make their fraudulent patent claims legal its how pirates become technically legit since the consumers dont seem to care much about patent rights and simply buy whats cheapest
  ok nutbag  also delete that picture
  you dont have to fear china this much anon
  t triggered china man
  yeaaaaaah i dont think ill be first in line to buy a revolutionary communist battery thanks anyways
  thats exactly how china operates
  in china besides a fuck ton of pirated brand name car parts you can also buy cat kebabs and dog meat burgers theres no noise from the animal being chopped because the selected animal is transferred into a bag that is then dipped into the river the water muffles the noise and the cat or dog peacefully drowns    life is cheap in china and thats what keeps the food prices down        video of chinese street food available at above site

  how do you think they became the goal leader in solar panels
  only the sand fleas in western china whom the government is currently trying to genocide and give the land to the han
  anon china makes literally 999 of the batteries used anywhere
  china makes literally 999 of the batteries used anywhere  south korea japan and the usa all have car battery makers liion battery makers and nimh battery makers    well even the usa has liion type battery makers so china doesnt have a monopoly on batteries solar cell panels medicines food toothpaste toilet paper paper towels nimh batteries lead acid batteries tires etcetera    but all of the above have had chinese pirates make counterfeits for sale on the market or it is an outright theft due to industrial espionage of foreign research laboratories they simply steal the idea and then beat the original inventor getting the product to market     there was the case of the cargo ship that had many of those industrial shipping containers filled with chinese counterfeits of proctorgamble products that ranged from toothpaste to paper towels it got turned away at san diego without being seized due to treaty so the goods went down to central and south america instead so the chinese will counterfeit anything to make money as long as it makes money it is worth doing as it doesnt need to be a glamourous product on amazon some buyers of pg duratowels from a chinese reseller spoke about how they immediately fell apart one user saved a lot of money over swiffer products by refilling with a reshaped duratowel instead but that batch of duratowels simply fell apart on her and she didnt know why duratowel is like bounty only both thicker and much stronger and tougher for scrubbing

  01gwh solid state batteries per year  what does that mean the total capacity of all their batteries in a year of production is 01gwh thats nothing
  its called a startup anon
    they do but only on a manufacturer level the real innovation is coming from americans japs koreans    nobody has figured out solid state batteries its apparently really difficult to make even one example mass production is not close at all      hell i think graphene based batteries will be get done sooner
    this a massive problem on amazon  chines knockoff flood the market and makes it hard for consumer to tell the difference      amazon doesnt do shit about it unless its a big company pressuring them also having patents is best way to fight it
  tpbp
  also having patents is best way to fight it  muddy waters who issues patents china does thats why lots of automobile patents from western companies are invalid in china as those patents are owned by chinese individuals chinese companies and even chinese political groups and municipalities     china even made lots of claims for various bullet train inventions which they copied from the japanese they certainly built theirs decades after the japanese had their first working bullet train when china opened its bullet train for general use it was so proud and bragged about all those various innovations and features invented by the chinese for that train yet others outside china pointed out those features were already invented and used many years ago by various western nations nevertheless the chinese have those items patented    youve already long known of traffic accidents where both sides claim the other was at fault as a result nobody is prosecuted many times the same goes for patents as a usa inventor of a medium or small sized company you claim your patented product is legit for the usa market the chinese company that used espionage to steal it out of your own labs to predevelop and then used your first products to reverse engineer for final development claims their chinese patent predates yours they make use of the clinton most favored nation trading status which sets limits against prosecution of chinese products and so may the best product win in the marketplace hey the chinese product is faulty but is 1/3 the price of yours your company ends up surrendering in the price war because consumers dont care about ethics this story has been repeated many many times
  the real innovation is coming from americans japs koreans    however the money is made not from inventing but from selling products
  nobody has figured out solid state batteries  china just did
  terrible english  article posted is chinese  anons fall for it anyway
  happening solid state battery is here  china publishes a lot of fradulent research papers and fraudulent product announcements if you commit to funding their research or to buy orders they take your money and then nothing happens nothing wait wait wait

  fucking doubt it chinks cant innovate  yes they can they are the world leader in pirated dried placenta foodstuffs avast there matey is that placenta booty i see        pirating placentas coming from beijing hospitals and traders can earn 100000 yuan a month a chinese newspaper finds from pirating automobile features and designs to placentas that shows a great variety of innovation and business tactics
  chinks cant innovate  they found a new way to prevent nuclear meltdown problems so there wont be nuclear pollution of their country like what happened in japan and the soviet union ukraine china plans to build 20 more nuclear reactors and those will be out at sea since ocean currents move clockwise up the china coast past japan the koreas russia and then onwards to canada and the usa any radioactive leaks will naturally move away from china selfcleaning due to ocean currents and wind currents go east from china across the pacific ocean onto canada the usa and mexico    now thats innovation but heres more    for other facilities such as oil drilling platforms the south china seas islands china built up to take over ocean waters and oil fields and at planned ocean robot stations for military defense china will also use floating nuclear reactors instead of building the reactor on the oil drilling platform or island much greater safety exists when the reactor can be towed and discarded elsewhere in the ocean perhaps it might even be dropped in a place where currents carry the radiation onto the beaches of foreign nations that china is displeased with or whose fishing industries compete against chinese companies    now thats real innovative thinking outside the box on chinas part
  pirating placentas    lel sick band name
china  inventing anything since gunpowder
  chinks cant innovate  they can    for example one province area needed soil surveys done in a river region so they had chinese researchers at usa universities partner with some usa citizen professors to file a research grant with one of the quasigovernment agencies that hands out money for research projects     the professors are glad to make money their university gets to skim the customary 35 or so of overhead fees and the chinese provincial government and thus the main chinese government is pleased that usa taxpayers paid the bill for the research data which they now have for free and a lot of the usa taxpayer money was even spent in china to boost that local economy    thats chinese innovation grants like this go on all the time
  chinks cant innovate    chinks are some of the most creative people on the planet what they lack is empathy respect and a need to be respected by the general populace they dont worry if you respect them or not for not selling a copy of your shit  from the chinese perspective you save your personal art projects for later  whats selling now is the best bet for making some money as long as they are on good terms with their higher ups and immediate peers they dont care scream uncreative and the chink will shyly open up his portfolio and show you something pretty interesting and then in true capitalist fashion he will shut it shoot you in the face and steal yours

  inventing anything since gunpowder  china invented jingwang governmentmade viruses/trojans arent stopped by antivirus programs due to treaty and legal punishment youre a foreigner making a tool to fight jingwang you can be convicted in absentia by chinese courts the next time you encounter police in countries with extradition treaties to china you might be detained and someone from the chinese embassy shows up to take you to china for arraignment as hacker        its already required but more advanced versions will be mandatory in 2020 for everyone in china with media devices the law sets a requirement for hardware or app back door and monitoring in 2020 it will be regularly checked for by established stop points or random checkpoints on roads buildings borders or wherever they feel like it all your communication devices will be checked to verify that it present active was not disabled or tampered the locations of pretty much everyone will be known and if you put your device into a faraday bag and then bring it back out for use its appearance and disappearance from the network would become apparent         jingwang monitors your geolocation and sees who you meet since the govt checks other peoples gear locations too it continually scans your files as well as what you are streaming or viewing it checks text messages to make sure you are not subversive        jingwang also creates a social credit ranking system this is what the usa needs everyone already is ranked by credit score jingwang 2020 can summarize all your pc smart tv product purchases and give you a social ranking score     jingwang is doubleplusgood  
  that is so fucked up
   jingwang supports a social credit ranking system    social credit score  big brother at work      a social credit score is like a personal darwinistic scorecard for each of chinas 14 billion citizens having a poor social credit score in china is like winning the darwin award thats because even if the bank wants to give you a low rate loan if your social credit score is low the govt requires the bank to either deny your loan or have a high rate of interest the same with product sales as the product is listed out of stock whereas for those with high scores it remains in stock another use is that other people will demand to see your social credit score before they work with you    those with top citizen scores get vip treatment at hotels and airports cheap loans and a fast track to the best universities and jobs they can live in more areas    it will allow the trustworthy to roam freely under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step    those at the bottom can be locked out of society and banned from travel or barred from getting credit or government jobs    the system will be enforced by the latest in hightech surveillance systems as china pushes to become the world leader in artificial intelligence    surveillance cameras will be equipped with facial recognition body scanning and geotracking to cast a constant gaze over every citizen    one announced date for widespread implementation is 2020     your friends and family affect your score if your best friend or your dad says something negative about the government youll lose points too if you go to the police to inform them about crimes your social credit score can improve snitching is rewarded    who you date and marry also affects social credit you have incentive to not associate with low scoring people

  i am delighted this shit is befalling them    your social credit rating has dropped to 99 out of 800 for that outburst your employer is notified and the government requires him to fire you for cause
  china bses a lot about stem shit the corruption and fraud present in corporate and academic research is so severe there that it seriously damages the credibility of legitimate discoveries from the entirety of the country
  this a billion times  they rely on spies so much its ridiculous
  they rely on spies so much its ridiculous  moles or blackmail to get information out thats cheaper
  its all too typical for chinese citizens in the usa to have relatives in taiwan and mainland china those chicom chinese relatives can have their relatives in the usa send over info from the companies and government agencies they work at

  my first thought too probably gonna take peoples money and run    400wh/kg  thats like 3x liion batteries of today i think would be a gamechanger if they can be mass produced economically i think i remember that the technology is sound but the problem is/ was they have a very short life something about crystal buildup creating a short or open after just a few charges
  scary
bunch of angry chinks in this thread
  nothing new about china taking advantage of the ocean currents china continually gets new clean water and the contaminated water flows in a big circular pattern to the northeast eventually it flows to the alaskan canadian and usa west coast     chinas dumped nuclear waste in the oceans so its just an evolution for china to make floating nuclear reactors when done they just tow the floating nuclear reactor somewhere and sink it cheap products is the chinese way
  and people dont buy certain things simply because they cost more
  most car batteries i have used are from germany mexico or south korea    i buy good batteries for home use energizer batteries made in the us and some osh branded batteries manufactured in canada  mexico    my computer battery was made in japan and my phone battery says assembled in china liion cell made in republic of korea

   nothing happening here   counterfeit car parts apathetic you people enable this kind of excess misfortune to occur of course the real start of it all was the clinton foundation make enough donations to it and president clinton eventually pushed through the treaty giving china the most favored nation trading status along with additional provisions and benefits     those limitations on car parts inspections really suck if you have an exam and the teacher is limited to grading only 10 of it and the rest is automatically given pass and you have privileges of direct insertion into the supply chains of businesses so if there is corruption wow that is even more you pass score thanx to donations to the clinton foundation      cats are the niggers of animals who fucking cares  dont hate cats delicious    dogs also get into the chinese hot pot the problem is that people who want to earn some money will then lure and capture peoples pets then the pets are taken to the meat butcher for some money dr peter li humane society internationals china policy specialist said that 10 to 20 million dogs and four million cats a year were killed for human consumption in china        not wasting anything the furs are sold in western markets such as europe and usa in the past the lifelike cat figures sold at hallmark gift stores in the usa were made from carefully removed real cat pelts cat fur is also used for ski boot and glove linings fur coats rugs and even toy animals    it is not illegal to eat dogs or cats in china dr li said he witnessed animals being bludgeoned to death with metal rods before being disemboweled and dismembered in front of the other dogs some restaurant owners claim the pain and fear makes their adrenalinerich meat tastier

  10 says the batteries are just soup cans tied together with string with the words state of solidify buttery    chinese battery makers have taken used or reject liion cells and then created new batteries out of those cells these new batteries are sold as new which is fraudulent in some cases the batteries do not even have the legally required safety mechanism and circuitry to reduce the chance of the battery catching on fire    the people on one of those battery forums did the testing by taking chinesemade new liion apart to verify safety components were missing as well    just you see the fledgling market for solid state batteries will get filled by counterfeit batteries that have the same logo as the brand name pioneering batteries except the batteries will have short lifespans by then there is no chance of refund
drive over shitty road   car and seat vibrate  get an errection
  drive  get arrested for theft bc i dont own a car
  thats why you wear buttplugs while driving for the added stimulation it also promotes good posture

  i have chronic gas and work with a lot of females so it was always embarrassing ripping ass in my office and hearing one of them outside say oh my god i read that using a butt plug loosens your asshole and makes you have silent farts figured it was worth a try and it worked i wear it in the evenings and to sleep then take it out for my morning shit now now matter how hard i try my farts are silent
    squat plugs and driving plugs  wtf
  i knew a guy who put talc powder on his ass why he told me this i dont know it was a really awkward sperg moment for him but he claimed it made his farts silent i nervously laughed and never spoke to him again
  jpg of a gif  whats wrong with you

      stop  butchering  the  fucking  pop up  headlights
  the two posts of mine you quoted are respectively from years ago no such thing as butchering pop up head lights you dumb cuck you prob dont even have a car with pop ups faggot
  i couldve bought one but i got fucked into getting an handed down car and please tell me how theyre not butchered when theyre left sitting like that neither opened nor closed
  popups fucking suck      and please tell me how theyre not butchered when theyre left sitting like that neither opened nor closed    do you think sleepy eye mod is complicated or damages the car lol
  pop ups suck  into the trash it goes
  bimmer wheels on a sil80  why tho
  they are though nothing good about them      those arent bmw wheels
  further into the trash it goes get your taste checked and come back onto this board when it isnt complete and utter trash
  yeah i should just follow the hivemind ive owned a car with popups for 8 years the novelty wears off fast i am now under the impression there isnt a single car with popups that doesnt look better without them outside of that theyre objectively trash
i havent seen a single good 240 in this thread
  why post a 240 when you can post a silvia or 180
        which one guise ive always wanted a clean cooookie crisp sense being a young lad how much for a new skyline diff sense that seems to be whats wrong
  all mesh wheels are bmw mesh wheels lol    those are probably enkei 92s
  i have right here     or pic related
  ssr formula mesh
i had a 93 with the ka24de rated at 155hp and 165tq    it was great for 1993 but i had it in 2003 so it was a little dated by that point was 1 wheel drive apparently i did a 25 inch off road cat back and a shorty ram air and a monster sound system it was nicer and faster than pretty much any other 17 year old had in my area that they bough themselves   this car would have been so much better if they all had lsd and had a turbo option 200hp even is all this little car needed super fun car small light responsive hatchback 2700lbs guys and had room to lighten up if nissan wanted to make an effort i could imagine it being 2500lbs from the factory with 200hp if nissan really would have tried they just didnt want their precious 300zx to have any cannibalism
  more like 240sux lol
  heavier  more parts to break seriously pop ups add a failure point that doesnt even need to be there  can freeze in the down position when parked somewhere in the winter  ruins aero dynamics in the up position
  this car would have been so much better if they all had lsd and had a turbo option    its called modifying your car
  ooohh you got em good anon    pfft op is such a loser poopy pants
    this car would have been so much better if they all had lsd and had a turbo option    its just you americans that got cucked with the ka24 boat anchor truck engine everything else had a ca18 or sr20 at least    at least s13 you still have a massive aftermarket and can get cheap exhausts lsd kits etc all day long and a sr20 swap has been done 500 million times try modifying oddball jdm cars with next to no aftermarket having to custom make everything
  truck engine  was used in 2 cars including the 240 before the hardbody  try again idiot you cant even get the basics right
  implying 80s90s style doesnt overwrite all those points
  undersquare as fuck  still a truck engine
  lmao gottem
  popups fucking suck  kill yourself
tried to convince my dad to get used 240sx when i was in high school  looks at back seat  no thats not practical  it wont hold its value
  wish all these underaged edgelords would fuck off popups are objectively trash
  see  
    dont buy the s14 for that price you idiot keep looking
  fuck off i love the pop ups on mine and they have never failed
personally love pop ups  but realizes that there is nothing wrong with modifying them      the autist itt is overreacting tho
  sleepy eye mods indicates that the owner is a wannabe driftfag the same that trash the car and think were still on underground 2  although neon is still cool
  yea i agree 9k is ridiculous for a 240 just sucks because its so hard to find a kouki or even a s14 coupe all i find is beat to shit hatchs and im not really a fan of the hatchbacks but im not in a hurry ill keep looking patiently
  sleepy eye mods indicates that the owner is a wannabe driftfag    wannabe  yet the car is drifting    what
    s13
  also clearly your dumb ass cant tell the difference between shittly modified cars that take after nfs underground and genuinely well built drift cars    learn the difference cuck it may save you from looking like a dumb fuck in the not too distant future
  bitch nigga
    still trash try better next time
  try getting some taste start off with licking my asshole faggot
  assblasted fag so pissed he thinks he can kill me with bad taste  ever heard of stock

  its for sale on fb in nz
  og famous one from the net    lol fucking fanook
did someone say popups to fixed conversion
pick a car for me because im too much of a bitch to  20072009 mazda 3  20072009 civic  20072009 corolla
civic if si corolla otherwise unless you like more fun at the cost of more rust then mazda3
that year corolla is atrocious both the civic and m3 are much better
  i cant afford si they are like 56k i only have 3 give or take also i live in florida    okay thank you ill forget the corolla didnt like it anyways
  if you live in florida then go with the mazda3 esp if it has the manual gearbox
  how are you going to afford the insurance maintenance tires fuel etc then  you cant save for a bit to get a better car
  definitely manual    i mean i have 3k to spend on the car itself
  right and a normal person would set aside money every month for repairs insurance fuel etc etc etc so instead of that use that same money and save until you can get a better car or were you going to buy a car with zero funds to make repairs and cover running cost
  and a normal person would set aside money every month for repairs insurance fuel etc etc etc  yesthats why only 3k of my money is going towards the car    suck a dick dumbshit
  89 toyota mr2
  3 write the corolla out unless you hate yourself
  do you literally not understand save longer buy a better car   here npc  more money have save  car good get
  i own a 2009 civic get the civic its the middle ground between the other 2 its fun and reliable    just a heads up buy a 20092011 if you can it had the face lift and was imported the engine also had been fixed of its issues by then buy the sedan its the better car only weighs 80lbs more and the aftermarket for it is huge get the si if you can but dont stress it the si is amazing but the r18 is still a fun little engine if you skip the si make sure to get the exl trim    its also great on gas so thats another bonus    as for things to look out for it has the traditional elweak japanese/honda paint the clear coat does fade no getting around it the pre 2009 models 200608 have engine block issues some were affected some werent play it safe and buy the 2009 it was fixed by then
  i will crash    ok    i think the cars i outlined are good enough for me whats a better car in your opinion    ty
miata
i just bought this did i dun goofd pic related not mine but same color
  thats the question you should ask before you buy the car dumbass
  its always like that  i gave up getting annoyed by them there are several ones of these a week on /o/ they always ask after they bought the heap
  buys the definitive dreary npcmobile  expects anyone to give a fuck  feed my expectation bias
  you did good dont listen to what the poorfags here driving their moms vans and 98 miatas say its a really nice car
  most of them are shit posts theres one guy who always makes those threads and his post always has the same format   other people though i think are just looking for back pats
  npcmobile  ive never seen any of these arizona cars in my life
  superb is just a horrible shitbox for pensioners get a vrs octavia if you want a fun vag car made reliable by czech magic
how do you prevent the car door/lock from freezing in the winter if you dont have a garage
depends where you live in moscow in 15ºc just cover the lock with some plastic bag so water doesnt get on it and freezes
    im close romania we can that low as well since were near mountains  i just used some wd40 in the lock apparently it drives moisture away
    it has never been a problem for me if cant handle touching snow just wear gloves when you open your car door    canada
    its not about it being cold to the touch the lock actually freezes and you cant open the door in some cases even the door can get stuck from it
  never heard of this    texas
check if the plate covering the keyhole from the inside isnt bend i had my first cars keyhole getting frozen shut after someone tried to force it open with a screwdriver and bent the plate bending it back and making sure it was completely flat solved it  other than that you can buy one of those bottles of lock defreezer or whatever they call it just a small bottle of concentrated antifreeze with a very small tip
for the door this stuff
my beater cars doors frequently get frozen shut the door seals freeze to the door frame it got so stuck once that i pulled the door handle clean off the car it only happens when its advanced coldness outside though  sometimes when i finally try to close it the latch doesnt catch but i fixed that by blasting the latch with dry lubricant aerosol called drislide i might try that on the seals too
  have an auxiliary heating
  graphite oil for the locks silicone grease for the rubber against the doors never failed me once
get some deicing fluid
  this right here ive also had really good luck using tufglide in door locks and even in the ignition cylinder keeps things nice and smooth and from binding at all even in the cold
fluid film
  silicone spray on the door seals my dad always does with all our cars they never froze shut
i just throw ny coffee on it in the morning
  leave your door open
  i have never had that problem in any cars ever  canada
  this one is pretty decent for this use    i use motorcycle chain lubricant in my locks and on the handles after washing to prevent them freezing  for the doorframe  seal itself i have a silicone stick/brush that i smear on the seals and the doorframe which keeps water off and prevents it from freezing stuck
  spray your door seals with silicon oil to stop them from freezing
ive never had my doors freeze in even 40c canada just really frozen windows and inability to use hybrid style wiper blades without them freezing every hour
  remote start
op here with a little update    so i used wd40 in the lock and even though we had 10 and 12c the past two nights and the windows froze the lock was perfectly fine
sometimes it pays off living near the equator desu
name a better tire for the money  protip you cant
federal 595rsrr because im not a pussy
  neat
everyone here has a shitbox so were good with the cheapest discount tire crap arizonans generals barnums roadrunners goodrides etc
  not everyone is happy with trusting their life on the cheapest tire on the rack
jewing out on the main interface between you and the road
  speak for yourself faggot i wouldnt put chingchong tyres on my shitbox
  its not some chinese bias ply tire with an aggressive tread pattern youre getting 95 the dry grip and 105 of the wet grip of a pilot super sport for almost half the price
   was referring to 
  its rubber thats it    stop over complicating a basic compound
  kraaaw buythefirehawkindy kraaaw
  and metal is just metal right either its yuro retard power hour or the average age of /o/ has shifted to about 12
  you can do better than that
  have had a set great at the start but useless as the tread fades invos dont do that
      putting 500 worth of tires onto a 1000 shitbox  lrn2econ
  500 worth  not 500 each  im embarrassed for you
  came here to post this i got a set of 225/40/17 for 89 apiece
  i am the tires on my dd were only 600 after mounting and balancing
  i got 4x firehawk as for 240 bucks    340 up front  40 for picking them up at the distribition center  60 for rebate    mounted them myself still need to get them balanced though learn 2 poorfag properly
    heh my 4 tires were 63 each fitted australian
debate me    best budget 3 season   indy 500  best overall 3 season  pilot sport 4s  best budget winter  general altimax  best overall winter  blizzak ws80  best budget track tire  federal 595rsr  best overall track tire  potenza re71r  best all season tire  more like no season tire
  best all season  good performance all seasons are fucking expensive
  63 each fitted  teach me your ways sensei
    ring thetirefactory and ask for their cheapest chink rubber and have a corolla
  literally the cheapest tire that would fit my wheel even accounting for / 10mm and /5
whats the consensus on tires  what should i get if it never snows but ocassionally rains
  tires in the op pic are really good in rain and hold grip well down to 3 degrees or so
  chink rubber
i had indy 500s and they work pretty well but i probably could have put some cheaper rubbers on since its just a daily driver  currently on blizzak ws80s that are too small for the car mounted on the wheels that are the wrong lug pattern which means i have some sketchy non hub centric spacers    if you need a good shaking come ride in my car because the vibrations are pretty wack
  they dont make them in 285/30/20 and 305/30/20 so they wont fit on my car
  have fun destroying your wheel bearings you absolute fucking idiot lmao    yeah lets put twice the wear on the car cause im too poor to get some steelies that fit
  arethose on backwards
  not my fault the box they came in brand new but opened said they were 5x100 when they were actually 5x1143      no
  you shouldnt be allowed to own a car
  hurr durr i got sent the wrong product    installs them anyway    youre truly a fucking moron
summer  i like toyo r888s or michelin pss zp if i need a run flat  winter  hankook icept evo series
  best overall track tire  r888r
  blizzak ws80  nokian hakkas are better in snow and on ice  potenza re71r  best for autox very sticky cold and get up to temp quick but the compound overheats too fast on an actual circut the local corvette club likes hankook rs4s but idk if theyre the best street/track for circut driving
call me a casual but i like my michelin mxm4s a/s great in the rain no hydro planing   might buy bridgestone potenzas next but ive only got 5k on these michelins
  nokian hakkas are better in snow and on ice  depends on the model
  black lion
  all seasons are goodyear eagle f1 asymmetric a/s  my dry grip is amazing and the wet grip kicks the shit out of the factory continental contipro
used hoosiers
  allseasons worn past the wear bars are basically the same right
  the rsrrs are better than the rsrs for like the same price
  i bought them privately
i ran the yokohama avs es100 for about 4 years on my mr2 turbo for the price they are the best summer tire
    tfw driving a smart and not even the cheapest tires  mounting and balancing costed me 250
  i feel safe in claiming that i probably have the most expensive tires on this board not counting the semitruckdrivers and the guy with the military deuce
  retard
paid 500 for wheels and tires    toyo proxxes 2    each wheel and tire would technically be 60 bucks each    they are kind of sketchy in the rain
  what offbrand tires are those
    anything by tigar pirot
  not hankook ventus s1  the man with no grip
  too grippy to get wheel spin even in the wet  picks up everything on the road surface and tosses it into wheel well  it dropped my lap time by 5 seconds compared to eagle sport performance all seasons but i would not recommend for daily hoon use
im kinda jealous of people who can get good summer tires under 500 because they have shit boxes with tiny tires i have 285s on all 4 corners and if i got the best id be over a grand
  replace rsr with rsrr
  nokian hakkapelitta lt2 315/70r17    worlds third largest dedicated winter tire 656 per tire shipping mounting and balancing not included    the only real reason they started making them was so that arctic trucks the icelandic company that made the hiluxes that took top gear to the north pole could have some actual winter tires to go with their 35inch conversions thus the production volume of these tires is very low driving up the price
  245/45 on an 18 inch wheel  550 for just 2 blizzaks
  hhi  it just starting raining in la
  snow tires are literally only for new drivers who cannot control theyre car
  oh no you sure got me  i shall now proceed to have an autistic fit about how uneducated you are and not consider that you are probably just being ebin troll xd
thoughts on toyo i feel like they never get mentioned here
  theyve already been mentioned twice in this thread alone    ive had  toyo proxes t1r on 1998 mercedes benz c240  damned good traction not as noisy as youd expect quite worn after only about 16 000 miles  but thats the price you pay for traction and high treadwear  toyo open country m/t on 2003 toyota hilux  i was surprised at how good these were  quiet for a mudterrain did splendidly in any terrain i threw at it    i have no qualms about buying toyo tires unless they are winter tires for my conditions where they tend to underperform
my 35 each chinese tires are way better value for the money with the added benefit of being able to drift in the dry with nearly no power
  t1r  good traction  choose one
  going cheap on a tire isnt bad as long as you replace them when they start to wear brand name tires cost big bucks because they have better warranties and tread life the actual benefits in initial performance in wet/dry/winter/offroad often go unnoticed by normies like you
  sure they arent 888s or indy 500s but theyve got plenty more traction than your regular summer tires
  i cant
  having owned hakka r2s and blizzak ws80 i would probably just save myself the 2030/tire next time and get blizzaks the hakkas are quieter for sure but not that much better
  trip has a retarded opinion  go fucking figure
  well how about you enlighten me with your knowledge then
    lol no firehawks are not basically equivalent to super sports in terms of being summer perf tires there is no magic here  they are cheaper because they dont perform quite as well first pss are max perf and indy hawk are ultra one tier below    indy hawk 500 are more relaxed with a more pliant sidewall than the pss
    this    for the money federal tire makes some good shit
anyone here own an suv or a truck my tires are going bald on my ford escape daily driver havent done research im not concerned about price
  two apostrophe mistakes in the same sentence  weak bait this isnt /v/ you have to try a little
  made by goodyear lol
  those are fucking garbage  t install them
how bad are federal rsrr in the rain
    those lugs cant even throw a pebble
toyo proxes so you can have a giant toyo tires banner duh
  nitto anything
    on my c5 in a summer downpour pretty fucking bad they can deal with wet roads fine standing water they do not like theyre very limited on how much water they can evacuate
best wheels  tyres for money coming through
whitewalls represent
i bought some direzza dz102s on sale    it doesnt snow where i live and i dont go on the track did i do gud
ohtsu fp7000    because the japs really are the best at everything including budget tires
  not bad at all in my experience standing water is a little sketchy but they grip great in the wet otherwise
  this for handling and they hook great on the street in a straight line too  federal rsrs are by the best budget tire that is for ultra high performance driving    not used but new dr2s for strip use they are actually very cheap but they dont last but maybe 4k miles    but  best ultra cheap street tire for a shitbox    achilles atr sport and sport 2s they are like 4575 bucks shipped are actually perform decent they are a bit loud but who cares    they are better than the falken rt615ks i had on my c5 thats for sure  keep it under 55 in the rain and you should be fine unless you went for super fat meats on a light car then keep it under 40      also rsr vs rsrr is not much a difference they simply changed the tread a little and made the wear rating a 200 up from 140 on the single r tires its for certain classes of racing same compound and tire effectively
    rrs are not better than rs they are the same just a slight tread change and a rating increase in treadwear  same compound
  actually one of the few budget tires i would be ok with running on my car their biggest downfall is tread life they dont last long
  i realize for practically the same price the extra treadwear make them a better value
summer potenza re980as  winter blizzak ws80  rate my tires
  its not extra treadwear  treadwear is a made up number and means nothing really at all these days    tread depth is actually considerably more on the rsrs compared to the rsrrs in theory they will last longer as a result  again its the same compound so the rating is useless and is strictly for the 200tw limit a lot of budget racing classes now impose
  ditch the all seasons and get some actual summer tires winter tires are great
  general  wut
  why have all seasons and winters get proper summers
  conti dws ps as3 and g max as 05 are all fantastic if you live where it gets below 45 in the winter
    got them for a steal when i worked for the tire shop 332 otd as it was the only tire we carried that wasnt a cheap ass primewell in that size 215/45r17
  ripperooni youll be fine just be super careful on crests
  normies like me  my currents daily driven tyres are 80 treadwear go fuck your hat   i dont care about brand name i care about the performance of that specific tyre in the temperature and climate i live in for the uses i want   going cheap on a tyre that has worse dry performance than my semi slick in torrential rain in winter is a compromise i will never be willing to make
  putting your life in the hands of the cheapest tyres you can buy in the cheapest car you can buy  easier to just neck yourself if thats the end goal here
  best parking lot cone dodging tire   re71r  best overall track tire  pilot sport cup 2 r    ftfy
  cup 2s and the kind of cars which make use of them are well outside /o/s budget
  conti dws  based i got a pair on my car and im surprised by the amount of grip
  are all fantastic  but do certain tires remain fantastic for most of their lifespan or were some tires and tread patterns created to game the rating system such that they are only their best when very new and once they lose 25 of the tread they are at half the performance when new    there really needs to be reviews about tires that are halfway worn i bet most top rated tires lose a lot of their abilities after the top third of tread is gone and the blocks have changed size and various sipes have disappeared
  gotta do your homework and find reviewers that actually drive the piss out of them not faggotmobile erm yes my ehmpeegee has definitely increased by 15 ones
  go on tire rack look at user reviews filter for high mileage reviews
  so god damn sticky love them so sticky i cant break the wheels loose anymore
  why have all seasons and winters get proper summers  rainy summers with standing water in rutted roads
  lots of summer tires are good in the rain
have the dwss on my awd tucson replaced the butt synergy gts that came stock have to try very hard to break them loose even in slushy snow conditions
fact if your wheel goes clank when you put it down on hard flat surface  you have shit taste
doesnt matter what car i drive i only buy michelin or continental  i had sava nangkang linglong semperit and dunlop as well and theres a reason why you should get the more expensive ones  dunlop and semperit are both alright but loud and overall meh  sava 19 are surprisingly good in corners but i had traction problems when accelerating despite having enough tread  linglong are absolutely undriveable horrible in every situation  maybe ill try hankook next year only heard good things about them so far
anyone have any experience with saetta tires they are supposed to be bridgestone subsidiary making high quality tires at reasonable price but i cant find any information on them anyfuckingwhere
continental extreme contact sport    run these on my tl and love thembesides them wearing pretty fast 35k miles soft tire i know
  even the all season extreme contacts wear fast im 30k in and my front tires are beat good alingment btw
  might switch to michelin pilot sport a/s 3 plus or what my car came with when i got it bridgestone potenzas re980as both equally expensive
  former firestone fag here  never seen them in person but those stickers look awfully similar to the old stickers for evos/blizzaks i believe it
  30k on a tire is amazing you kids are fucking stupid
  anyone have any experience with saetta tires  you can check to see where the patents or trademark for saetta was initially filed
  i cant find any information on them anyfuckingwhere    then you can google saetta tires and find descriptions and sellers    first check if saetta is a stand along tire company that actually manufacturers tires or is it a brand name that rebadges tires made by discount companies        rather than being an actual separate tire company it might be a marketing brand for various tires for example interstate batteries sells a huge number of car batteries and has storefronts in many cities but it doesnt really make any batteries of its own it just sells rebranded batteries
  summer tires evaporate
what is the best car tire to put on my motorcycle
  based
  rear engine v8 that takes some balls
  continental extreme contact   im 30k in and my front tires are beat  thats excellent tread life for the front tires that you never rotated if you had rotated them when there was still 1/3 tread left then youd probably have 50k or more out of that set of four tires     rotating is good because you can take advantage of the continental tire purchase deals such as buy 3 and the 4th one is half price if you had only the two fronts to replace then you can only replace them two at a time while the rear tires get older and older and older     rotating means when you do buy the set of four tires they will all be brand new fresh rubber compound and if there were tweak improvements in the meantime those new tires would have it over your older tires
  man those are some obese grooves
  my last set of potenzas lasted me nearly 55k do you just do constant burnouts or some shit
  ar1s on my mx5 barely lasted 20k lol  many skids
  potenzas are some of my favorite tires i remember them having fucking excellent rain conditions almost no hydroplaning ever fuck no tramlining eitherprefer those shits to michelins
  loved my toyo r888rs on my rx7 desu
  looks retarded and how the fuck am i supposed to know what company that is retard  also yokohoma advan best weeb tyre
  potenzas are some of my favorite tires  almost no hydroplaning ever  my continental procontact fronts are worn down about halfway so there is a lot of tread left but the hydroplaning on the pools of water on the freeway is noticeable now its a bit scary going 60mph and feeling the car just slightly floaty due to water resting in the ruts caused by studded tires chewing the concrete in past years
    i noticed a major difference from any of the 90125 all seasons i usually buy i got them on sale for 61 each only driven them once in a big storm but they did fine doing 4550mph on city streets
  which all seasons did you usually get i need a new set of tires for my daily driver im on indy 500s and they lasted around 15k miles  3 track days on a 2005 wrx wagon already have a fun sports car to slap 200tw tires on     im considering getting a set of all seasons only for the light snow/mild winters where i am in nj  the indys turn into hockey pucks in the snow/ice/below 30f and didnt last long in the first place good all seasons 500 seem more costeffective than a decent set of winter tires 400  a decent set of summer tires and wheels for them 600    was either gonna do michelin pilot as3 or bridgestone potenza re980as for 110/each
  my currents daily driven tyres are 80 treadwear  sorry but buying a lowtreadwear tire doesnt make you an expert     going cheap on a tyre that has worse dry performance than my semi slick in torrential rain in winter is a compromise i will never be willing to make  this doesnt even argue the point whatever personal experience you had that drove you to pull out that anecdote doesnt make it a universal truth a cheap semislick in the dry and moderate temps will always outperform a brand name semislick in cold and wet rain all else being equal
idk man i just use the cheapest shit was like 200 for all 4     just wear ur seatbelt and drive good lmao
  actually yeah you did dz102s are great tires in the dry traction in the wet is lacking though
    all of the all seasons i bought were junk the last ones i had were the goodyear eagles and i hated them the most i dont remember all the ones before that sorry the indy 500s were like twice as grippy minimum in the dry i live in az so i drive in monsoons where it rains a few inches at one time a few times a month for a few months but besides that its all summer days thats why i just chose to go to a summer tire
  they get narrower as the tires wear
    thats better than average for a performance tyre tbqh    this    t drives like a grandma i get about 20k kms on a set of sport tyres and i literally cant do burnouts in my car
  almost no tires you buy new will be sketchy enough to be unsafe otherwise they wouldnt be sold some tires just perform better than others
   i live in az  all of the all seasons i bought were junk    it may also be the type of roadway surfaces you drive on where you developed your dislike for those tires they probably drove great except for those few bad experiences of yours where the harshly weathered az pavement is either pebbly with smooth tops of larger pebble rock surfaces exposed with aggregate far below or the pavement is fine pebble rock on weathered aggregate     for the first type of pavement many types of all season tires would probably slide across the smooth tops of the rocks if it didnt have enough tread to bite between each of the pebble tops for the 2nd some pebbles can be pulled out of the aggregate by the tire drip so those tires are rolling on top of essentially ball bearings if the gaps between the tire blocks arent big enough those little pebble ball bearings continue to roll under the tire as you corner so your car slides ive had that effect when i drove in arizona many years ago
  drives like a grandma  lol no im throwing around my shitbox is300 like crazy but it isnt exactly powerful either
  they may cost nearly twice as much but theyre gonna last twice as long and offer better performance that entire time
    blocks your path
r8 my tire design
  0/10 do not pass go go directly to jail to get entered by jamal
  thats not how rubber compounds work
  r8 my tire design  is this design from a chinese engineering school
  ive owned nt555s before and they got great dry traction and so so wet traction my extreme contact dw was slightly worse in dry but like 9/10 in wet
  best all season is dws 06
are the dunlop direzza star specs any good    theyre the only performance tires that will fit my mr2 on its factory wheels
  yes theyre good very loud but if you own a mr2 you wont care
  i have to wear earplugs in my mr2 so no problems there
  it seems that the whole continental contact series of tires is reasonable in performance
  they handle just fine in the rain not at 60mph torrential rain fine but still better in the wet than an eco tyre in the dry
  ran fine on my stock 14x55s but since they were 185/60 they had a profound case of the rolling over shoulders were worn to the markings but the center was still at 50 not the ziis fault i dont think just the profile
  confirmed slid out and with toyos and bent all my shit up
  ive owned dws 06 extremecontact dw purecontact and extremewintercontact on various cars id rank the entire brand as a 785/10 good tires for good price
  its rubber thats it  good stretchy chinese rubber  can stretch without bursting in an explosion
  send the apprentice in with a tire stem valve remover
  in the rain yes but not standing water
i drive nankang snow viva sv1s basically because they were already on the rims i bought  the internet says they mean certain death   any experience
i just got my first car  i dont know shit about cars or tyres  the guy i got it from put on 4 contisport 5 ssr on it are they good  it doesnt snow where i live
i use linglongs because the name makes me giggle
    general tire has the rt43 and altimax arctic head to a public library and read  200 is correct
  head to a public library and read  a lot of times the library doesnt have the printed paper version of a magazine but it will have the digital version you can read on the monitors and it may subscribe to 500 or more different electronic magazines that way
  nope only conti sportcontact 6s
  he said the boss should show leadership and lead the way with the core remover
  he bought curved faced rpf1s  lol cucked they look so fucking shit compared to flat faced
i bought re003s because they were half the price of pilotsport 4s what am i in for
  i went to iceland this year and was fascinated by these
          remember everybody this is the type of shithead flying by you in a lowered shitbox on the freeway the rest of his car is just as janky and he will eventually kill someone
pss/ps4s are like 4050k mile tires thats easily 2 years worth of driving unless you are hypermileing your shitbox    why cant afford 8001000 every couple years to put decent tires on their car jesus
  4050k miles is insanely long surely the tires would be getting flat spotted and hard over that time if you drive 510k miles a year like myself
  the rest of my car is in excellent shape thank you very much
  this semi slick on the street or gtfo    indy 500s are basically what a numale soi thinks a badass tire is
  invo is a literal meme show car tire
  curve spokes are stronger than straight spokes
youre walking down the street  get in the fucking car    what do
youre gonna have to shoot me nigger
  i get in and hope for the best or i make a run for it if i see a really good oportunity
nope
relaxed  first mistake
  oblige because its a comfy landbarge and i dont have a gun yet
  get in mane  what do i have 2 lose
getting reminded
  never do that youll have a bad ending
  oh i get it
  i get in the fucking car and have a fucking adventure you fucking god damn pussy
  ventilate the car
  shoot me faggot  peace at last
  shoot him
yes another one of those threads    im considering buying an 8894 jeep wrangler and was wondering what i should know about those specific years    pros and cons of the 4cyl vs 40  are the 5speeds really that bad  typical rust spots  other usual failure points    the goal is to make a jp jeep so i dont really want to get other years since ive heard its a lot of work to go from round to square head lights
  aim for a fuel infected 5 speed 40 the 42 was finicky and the 25 was gutless as fuck not worth the minor fuel savings it is a jeep you know    4 cyl 5 speeds were known for losing 5th gear not sure of others the ax15 was pretty stout i thought    they rust everywhere    the newest ones are almost 25 years old anything could be a failure point rust is the biggest killer of them pretty sure 94  95 had parts of the body galvanized not sure if it helped much    look for one as close to stock as possible but expect to pay a premium for it you really dont want somebody elses project/weekend warrior that they got tired of working on
  thanks ive heard the 4cy 5speeds were shit but didnt know about the 40 i agree super fucking hard to find one that isnt jacked up other than old car stuff failing i was just wondering if there was something more likely to fail like the trans
   and cons of the 4cyl vs 40  4cyl 2wd is not gonna make a useful jeep and is scary gutless  fuelie i6 40 and ax15 is the shit put a gibson exhaust on it from header to tailpipe made 5th gear much more useful with the bigger tires at speed not as mind blowing as headers on a 29 bii but there was a nice difference but it did making merging easier especially when folks were being dicks     the 5speeds really that bad  think the 4bangers had t5s and not the ax15 t5s you can blow up from abuse 3rd gear is in the middle of the geartrain and with the sheetmetal bearing support the cluster flexes away climbs teeth and kaboom  ax15 is fairly stout     rust spots  cali here dont recall anything unusual other than letting shit pool up and muck building up after you trail just hose the jeep inside and out and get all the dirt and shit off the body and chassis if you really got muddy sometimes removing a few panels makes it easier to get the muck off its a jeep treat it like a jeep     usual failure points  rear diff started making weird sounds early on just replaced it with an exploder 88 with the disc brakes and internal drum parking brake not only is the 88 really stout the brake modulation was better and something about the divorced drum parking brake was reassuring when getting watermud logged the rear drums didnt feel like they did shit    if you have a tilt column there are four bolts that hold the lower hinged portion to the column that loosen up this makes the column really sloppy not good when climbing need a few specialbut cheap tools to get down to the four etorx bolts take them out clean them and then coat them in some blue loctitei prefer gel install them and you can lift the jeep with the steering wheel they are saginaw columns any 80s era jeep/gm/amc used them but there are four main columns mt non tilt mt tilt at non tilt at tilt floor plate is what is differenet between make/models
  you get to hear about the square headlights from every jeep enthusiast
  you get to hear about the square headlights from every jeep enthusiast  fucking this  square lamps bro  it can outrun a trex though  confused look
  it just doesnt look right with round lights and that paint job is it a thing to trade soft top with people the ones in my area all have grey/black tops and id rather drop 500 on a new top just to change colors
what about the autos i hate the idea of it but its local and has the right color accessories and cage    
  well no soft top and its an auto
  what do you mean by a finicky for the 42
i had a 92 4l yj jeep as a first car it broke down bimonthly     solenoid had to be replaced  clutch had to be replaced  drive shaft split in two after shoving it into reverse while it was still moving  wheel bearing seal on the left rear axle went out burning the axle rod twice    the first time it actually fused to the axle housing and i spent 5 hours cutting through it with a sawzall its still the best vehicle ive ever driven by far
   it just doesnt look right with round lights and that paint job
  exactly
my subaru impreza has reached 300000 miles and is starting to break down on me im sad to see him go but i guess that means its time for me to look for another car ive got a budget of about 10k and in looking for something thats gonna be fun to drive and easy to work on myself also wouldnt hurt if its a car that can handle shitty weather since im in the midwest what would you lads recommend

  look at the profile pic on that one
  i have to assume this autist browses and is responsible for some of the transmission shitfest threads would it be admitting defeat to try and get board concencus to make manual vs automatic banworthy
  is it even possible to stall while going 90mph
  that pic  residente artiste  tumblr level post  complains about manual  no surprises here the hamster inside the wheel he calls a brain probably broke a paw or something
  maybe if you put it in reverse and your gearbox decides to detach itself from the car or you pop it into 1st and one of the pistons flies into your forehead
  of course not this idiot doesnt understand how cars work
  you literally cant put it in reverse at those speeds on most manuals especially newer ones where you need to be fully stopped in order to do so
  whats with all the hate for manual lately
  people have moved on from stone age technology
  look mom i did it i showed those fword on 4channelorg how outdated they are now lets go we need to go praise elon
do you consider this as an improvement
scum
  over this    to brief up the new prius has a restyled new front end yet still keeping the ugly body lines    plus theres a 7hp electric motor in the back making it awd the awd is geared more into giving an extra traction and extra pickoff from a startstop situation
i own a 2012 plugin and other than the usual truck bro bullshit of getting rolled coal on i love the car stupid cheap to run and maintain but the worst thing is driving it in the snow with studded snow tires on it its great but adding awd would honestly be the one thing that would have me buy another one for commuting its perfect but otherwise its boring as fuck
  id fuck that
was this the quintessential modern 4 door supra  turbo 40 i6  can handle massive amounts of boost  rwd  6 speed manual or auto  even available in 2 door ute form  more reliable than any modern turbo i6 bmw
its a completely different car to a supra why would you even compare the two at least compare it to a 5series or something
  i think you mean the toyota cressida you mong  im not familier with your strange made up kangaroo cars but im pretty sure that thing has nothing in common with the supra at all
look guys i posted it again
  both slow and shit  it checks out
  cant handle for shit    yes
why are australians allowed on 4channel
  im pretty sure that was the aristo
  australians  australians actually know you cant get a falcon its an ozaboo
umm supra had a good chassis ford falcons might as well be made from timber from bunnings
  lol no
  read some period reviews of the ba when it came out
great engine  shit car
  what car is this though
  only good for towing desu otherwise theyre shit performance cars for the money
  ford falcon xr6
  god tier drivetrain shit tier chassis ford australia sells what a few thousand cars per year our entire population is like 25 million toyota probably sells more priuses than that every year ford australia couldnt afford to put any rd into their cars whatsoever so they just used the same shit and made small upgrades every generation
  they sold a bit more than a few thousand a year but it definitely wasnt the volume of global brands   i wonder how many cars they would have had to sell to have not been killed 100k 500k
  kek holden really fucked up with the zb   sold 23k in 2017 last year so a lot of people looked else where   sold less than 5k in 2018  would have lost a lot of money importing them who did the viability report on that

  flag on your house  why do americans do this shit lmao
  is everyone on /o/ like instagram thots but with their cars i only have like 3 pics total this was right after i bought the truck
  why do people who are active on imageboards and have cars as a hobby take photos of their cars    you must be fucking insufferable to be around
  yuropoors have no pride in there residence  color me shocked
  i didnt want a turbo i did consider a 458 but honestly i feel the rwd huracan felt more nimble its a totally different feeling than the awd variants and it happened to be in my budget range
  you know it takes all of 30 seconds to get a nice picture right
  well yea i personally just never feel the need to take pictures guess im weird
  its literally just a random place you happened to be born the kind of people that are dumb enough to fly a flag would be proud of any state they were were born in any country they were born in etc
  the average home in my whole county is 600k and i only got a g37 nigga what do you do
  cope more yuro boi
after a good hour of manually polishing
  i mean i understand that  theres many time when im on here i think to myself i shoulda taken a pic that one time but i was kinda busy doing the thing  realistically ive only got 510 pic of each of my vehicles not including things like pics of damage  but sometimes i want something nice to show people
  thats wonderful joo propaganda youre pushing there my boy which one of your teachers told you that nonsense in middle school    you have a history and where youre from and who your kin are are important
    my property is worth more than 500k and my car is worth like 5k so i dunno
  where youre from and who your kin are are important  citation needed
not the mustang
  what if you were born there but as you grew up happened to actually like the country you were born in  friend of mine born in mexico came to the us when he was younger legally and really likes the us flies the us flag on his house what would be the problem then
  youd understand if you lived somewhere you truly love thats something europeans will never understand about americans
  look dad i posted it again
my slavcruiser
  washed and waxed and ready for winter storage
  where youre from and who your kin are are important  and where are you americans from immigrants from europe that murdered the natives and took africans as slaves thats really something you can be proud of
  id say so
  we havent even been graced with knowing where youre from not that youd tell the truth anyways probably stalins underage great grandson getting all salty because you nobody could be proud of having a commie ancestry
i come back to look for my yous and find that ive derailed half this thread into a shit slinging contest    hell yeah america
  yurop cant understand national pride
  you plan on repainting it anytime soon id be worried about rust
    no im a german living in a nice house driving a nice car and im proud of that see pic related  i just see no point in being proud of something that i havent achieved myself
  congrats man
  and i wanted to add you fuckers      probably have never achieved something yourself so sure you poor individuals look for something to be proud of
its even worse now
  well if were gonna derail the thread anyway  thoughts on this line of thinking
    your point is pretty retarded its possible to be proud of things others your country accomplish is it really that hard to understand
  sure is nice to live somewhere where were not taught to be too ashamed to have national pride
to be fair german pride has led to some pretty terrible things  so he cant ever really experience it even if he wanted to
  well i think     is just stupid too     yes im proud of things my country accomplished like inventing the car to stick to the thread but im proud of these things and the people who where behind this and not of my country  pic related is my hobby car and now i wont post offtopic again were not on /b/ here
  i just see no point in being proud of something that i havent achieved myself  solang du nicht die fahnen von anderen autos abmachst  almans  fucking lmao brudi einfach lmao

  i wouldnt take pics if i had what you have there either
i dont wear a helmet when i ride a motorcycle because if i crash id rather die than survive and become paralyzed thanks to spinal cord injuries  bbut muh safety  if safety was my ultimate concern and the be all and end all i wouldnt ride a motorcycle in the first place
  absolutely based and freedompilled
yeap i agree with everything here
  attitude number 4 niggas report in
  based and cheese grater pilled
  wearing a cap  confirmed for 30mph top speed
  nice blog looking forward to the next installment
  my luck would be that i would survive with disfigurement so i wear mine
  1 here but purely because bikers are annoying faggots
how can i ride a motorbike without sustaining a spinal cord injury
  hes so manly he doesnt even pack heat
  for starters not driving like a retard violence of impact relates to speed and you need to be going fast in order to damage the spine secondly some companies produce biker coats with thicker protection which dont just prevent your skin being cheesegrated by the road but also absorb some of the impact
and nothing of value was lost
  yeah bugs and rocks and shit are fun fuck you dad
  airbags
have fun becoming a potato at a 30mph crash
  you know you can brain yourself just by falling off the bike and landing awkwardly at 0mph right
driving motorcycles   yikes
  better than riding cars
  yeah but not better than sitting in a car
yeah im sure youll maintain the same free spirit as youre crying yourself to sleep on the hospital bed fucking motorcyclists shouldnt be admitted to hospitals  t emt
  not 2
  no youll just be braindead with half a face/ear/skull nice blog post though
  
  yeah   driving is the controlled operation and movement of a motor vehicle
  cry more faggotron you wouldnt even have a job without bikefags
  are you implying bikerfags get injured so often that theyre the sole reason why emts have a job if so you are a retard who hardly leaves your greasy house
  enjoy your road pizzad face
  if you dont agree with me youre an unwashed shut in  wew
  fucking motorcyclists shouldnt be admitted to hospitals  t emt  gtfo with that faggotry  t ff/medic atgatt    as for not wearing gear i do believe in personal choice so long as it doesnt affect me adversely honestly though my helmet has my radio/music/phone connection thats reason enough to wear one never mind becoming a liberal due to the tbi from a slow speed accident
  in a single vehicle crash youll be fine just make sure youve got leather from head to toe  if a car hits you there are airbag systems built into race suits and jackets but theyre super expensive and its uncertain how effective they are
i wear a helmet simply because the bikes arent legal
  even animated niggers are repulsive to the eyes
  how much should i be spending on gear it seems a helmet can go from 100 to 1000 with no difference that i can spot is kevlar denim any good for a jacket and pants
  hans device jackets with proven back padding
    gets injured  sustains brain damage and spine damage  but doesnt die  now youre not only physically disabled  but a goddamn legume     lmao great plan op now you can be a drooling fuckin moron in a chair shitting your pants instead of a coherent one who can still enjoy a lot of stuff in life    the only way to truly avoid suffering is by riding with a vest packed with c4 and some impact fuses itll guarantee your death if you have a wipeout
  damn that picture makes me want to slam and stance a supersport
  general rule of thumb is you want to spend 200 and have glass fiber carbon fiber or kevlar based outershells for your helmet    leather is the be all end all for protection kevlar pants are nifty but are expensive and degrade faster over time boots should basically keep the ankle from moving at all wearing ankle level shoes or sneakers is a guarantee youll need relearn how to walk if you ever have an accident
  in most cases you want to be thrown clear of the bike being trapped under the bike or car you have an accident with is more likely to kill you
  wow u must be so tuff im so impressed
  low sides are better than being catapulted clear of the bike by a high side much more likely to break bones from the impact of your short flight from the latter
  the trauma from the impact kills you dope
  you need to learn how to land on the ground  common reachtion is to plant your hands infront first but thats not a good idea  instead you should just before you hit use your hands to push and position yourself to land on one of your shoulder blades and then follow up into a roll  this way the impact resonates in a larger surface area but this is only useful if you fly off still it is good to learn how to fall and how to disperse impact energy transfer etc  and dont speed no one wants to drag ass for half a block
  friend of mine is an emt in nyc told me every bike job hes done was a fatality
  like in judo no worries then
  he must have limited exposure to motorcycle accidents then ive seen fatality when a car ran a red light and tboned a motorcycle and ive seen a car pull out into the path of a motorcyclist causing the bike to tbone the car and the guy had no injuries some accidents you see little injury when the wreckage looks like armageddon some accidents you have rider and passenger fatalities with a mostly intact bike    wear your gear and stay proficient with your riding including taking the classes even if youve ridden for years the advanced classes will still teach you something the more you ride the better you are at anticipating stupidity and scanning for problem spots and vehicles
sweet blogpost bro
any aus fags   im 19 and have time to go for my ps red ps  only thing is ive driven for about 100hrs and never recorded those hours except for 20 of them at most  will vicroads require me to show my driving log   ive been told by people that it is required but on the official site it doesnt list it specificly as a prerequisit to take the test
hey mate  no shit you need to show them the book  youre a dumb cunt  you have shafted yourself absolutely    the best thing for you right now would be to start forging in those hours i bullshitted all mine  was fine even had the lady say so here it says you took 2 hours to drive 12km  she still took me for the test some fuckwit cut me off in a roundabout from the left side  i failed the first test at no fault of my own enjoy
  they flick through the book champ lol why would you think they dont
  yes you dumb cunt you need to show your driving log  just forge the hours but try not to be as braindead as first post cause you might not get so lucky  you passing more often than not has nothing to do with your driving ability and more to do with how the supervisor is feeling on that particular day if you fail dont sweat it just try again when you can
  yes  not getting your ps on your 18th bday  kys
  i dont have to explain myself to you gay cunt
i probably drove a good 20 hours and forged my whole logbook going backwards from the current ks on the odometer it was a pretty decent effort but they didnt read a bit of it just flicked through it really fast and i guess made sure a decent chunk of the book was filled in
  did you skip any pages or spots   im filling it in one by one and using different pens and making sure i change up my hand writting etc
literally why the fuck would you not record that shit you daft mong
  in actuallity i only drove 20hrs since i was 16 i stopped driving for about 1 1/2 years since my smart car got totaled by my brother
  hey mate im from vic two years ago i did my driving test just otuside of melborune told them that my dog just ate the book this morning and showed them a photo of it actually a random picture book blended with water heh and they let me do the test in a rental car i hadnt even driven a car before because i had no mates with cars nor did i have a job to be able to afford lessons i watched youtube videos on how to drive and memorised routes on google maps i dont think you could do it with a manual car but with automatic it was easy as
  my dog ate the book  its almost retarded enough to where i could possibly believe it especially since retards work for vicroads
buy japanese cars
no
does the car include the girl
  for me its the 50 s550
ok i will
  thats a korean trap from /int/
  came here to post this
  did you know buying anal sex is legal in japan 
found a nice clean car  needs a little work but overall seems like good value  sold 30 minutes after i saw the ad  fuck me  
  bogan scum
  apart from the horrible chevy badges its a really clean car
first come first serve
imagine living anywhere but america
  seems like australia still has fun cars were killing off all of ours
  but australia literally killed off all their cars
  but gm literally killed off all their cars  ftfy    we didnt get the ls2 in the normal monaro in bong it was only in nfsu2 tier one with the gay spoiler and the nice looking car only got the 57l ls1    still getting one once i finish my degree though 350hp is more than enough
  i have a feeling we didnt get the 6l in the monaro either maybe the hsv had it though   im debating whether i get an older commodore and do some work to it or buy a new vf2 and leave it stock for 7 years while its under warranty
  chevy badge  140000km    how many of those kilometres were sideways
  doesnt matter you buy that kind of car to do work on spend between 10k and 20k and youd have a beast of a thing the exterior and interior look clean
  tfw brabham makes an iconic hyper car and no cunt knows about it in australia    70 vehicles 2000000 a piece 700hp straight v8 972kg things a fucking beaut    
    the ss in the vz were reliable you dont need to do any work to it    the only downside to the super sports version is the fact that fuel prices are retarded expensive in australia
  each to their own
  im talking molesting it with suspension and brakes upgrades extractors mild cam sequential shifter etc   fuel prices are fucked but they came down to 120 in brisbane last week shot up 20c on friday though     its cool but it doesnt really mean much if they made a 300k version that was good for the street you might actually see one what im getting at is id be more interested if there was a consumer version   why did they even make them here england running out of room
  they are interested in making a street legal version if they sell them out quick enough no doubt 69 of them have been snapped up by saudis the thing that perturbs me is they claim to be making them in the old holden factory in elizabeth when i have good word that the place is completely gutted atm
  yeah ive had a relatively new econobox for a while now and its been nice for the reliability but i definitely want something i can do a bit of wrenching on    england is running out of room actually probably not why they made it in oz though
  it is a sexy car thats for sure which factory is that german company making those solar system in must be the old ford one
  looks sick    kys söyboy
was it kino
prelude  integra  civic  why honda made so many fwd cars with completely different names and bodies that served the exact same functions is beyond me
absolutely flawless fr proportions  is ff  why honda
  someone made a prelude thread  kek      and to answer your question yes i also had to google wtf kino meant
decent cars especially the 5th gen and 4th gen vtec models     civics were compacts prelude was midsize the integra is pretty much a compact by american standards but still a little nicer than the civic a normal integra was quite a bit than a faster than a normal civic
  make the deslo look like a sporty mr  stick a 100hp engine in the front
  at least some of them came with a b16 the main problem with the del sol is weighs more than a civic while be far less practical
  doesnt know about the b16 vtec ones that shit on miatas
is turning your car off while filling up a meme or are people just retarded i get diesel but not sure about gas
oy vey moshe its nearly sundown
  whos in that thing lol
  very much not a meme if the car is turned on while you refuel the new fuel will get sucked right in and fuck the engine five ways to a rebuild
  but wouldnt it still go through the fuel pump and not matter that its being poured in
  pure safety  cant damage your car  except the gas station blows up  but that is highly unpropable to happen
  oh no fuel going into the engine the horror
  you are less likely to drive away with the pump still attached when waiting
  is turning your car off while youre not driving it a meme
  is turning your car off while filling up a meme or are people just retarded  why would you leave it on while filling up      you are less likely to drive away with the pump still attached when waiting  ah so that explains how people drive off with the nozzle
  this is the only reason you need to turn your engine off while filling especially if your car is an auto otherwise theres pretty much zero technical reason why you cant or shouldnt do it that and leaving your engine running means leaving the keys in the car means your car is significantly easier to steal     here in the uk its pretty much just the norm engine off while filling
  is that some sort of emergency jew patrol
  probably depends on the car and how much you tanktheres barely any difference i think at worse youre gonna get some asshole shouting at you about how youre gonna get the whole gas station on fire when your at gas station and have car running
  this fucking board
  busy gas station  dozens of cars idling while they fill up  everyone there now unnecessarily breathing in excess exhaust  is this what you want op i mean i do see the appeal
  leave car on while getting gas  car is unlocked  keys are in ignition  car is 100 more stealable than if it were off and locked
  my black friend from a nyc project said the jews had their own neighborhood watch type civilian policing force
  the gas cap being off may affect the engines ability to create backpressure affecting engine performance and potentially throwing a code
  is a big issue on boats where vapours can get everywhere hence why boats have blowers to get rid of them    on cars though hell nah
  is there supposed to be air bubbles in the fresh fuel or something
  thats the dumbest thing ive read today
  a girl i was really into got really annoyed when i turned mine off because of no a/c it was over 100 out she said she always left her car in while she filled up but i was too much of a pussy made me think many people must do it in the summmer especially if you have kids
          you guys fell for some highclass bait there
  this a lot of modernish cars will get cel if the gas cap isnt tightened enough to seal id imagine that running the engine while fueling could have similar results
i want to get into cars but i know nothing about cars any tips
buy a piece of shit and start fucking with it until its your bitch
  grasp door handle  open the door  get in the car  wa la
  youre already on the internet have you tried google
  pick a brand then pick a model and start researching it do this multiple times until you find a segment of cars you like then learn about that segment until you become board of it then you repeat or you could do some research then buy a car you like then learn by tinkering with it
  watch all of scotty kilmer
  youre overthinking it by just making a thread on it on 4chan /o/    either buy a car and start fucking with it or start fucking reading car manuals    your choice f aggot
  what a fucking degenerate
  change your oil
  yeah try not being a roastie
  step one start reading read a lot any car that interests you learn what motors are available in each generation were they offered in manual or automatic transmission basically fill your head with loads of useless info involving cars  step two buy a set of tools learn how to work on your own vehicle  step three if you have disposable income buy a project car to fix up once you are comfortable working on your own car  step four by this point you should at least be half ass knowledgeable enough to discuss cars with other car people you could try going to local car meets to make friends with other gearheads    good luck
  dont get into cars  but if you do buy a lada lol
2018 recent year this car is available to buy at your nearest subaru dealership  fully mechanical drivetrain  not drive by wire  actual rods connected from shiftertransmission making driving that much more engaging and fun  old school awd system that simply works as it should  old school engine that feels like driving a cessna plane  hydraulic steering  no nanny assists  actual handbrake  only the necessary creature comforts  060 within 5 seconds easily making it a moderately fast car  rally heritage    last of its kind last of the ej engine last remembrance of the 90s golden era    you should love this car it doesnt deserve the hate you give them  vapebros are a lame joke and only poor wrx drivers vape sti owners are actually based and love driving like anyone else does  seriously go sit in one and start the motor drive one you can actually feel something feel like youre in control of your car for once in a recent year car there are none like it    this it it there wont be any more cars like these enjoy it while it lasts
jesus christ the subaru shills are out in full force this season    if i wanted japcrap id buy japcrap
060 within 5 seconds easily making it a moderately fast car  sweetie  
  only poor wrx drivers vape  so youre saying all wrx drivers vape
its slow the motors outdated everything else youve said is true though its stayed fairly true to the original and its a drivers car
  comparing a 4door turbo sedan to an american lard barge  actually buying a sporty truck  ya i got muh 62 chebby truck that i race  said no one ever    apples and oranges
  wish i had saved the mexican silverado racing image people race pickups all the time and nobody wants some ancient fat awd sedan
  yeah dont kid yourself you damn well know that your going to buy that 4 door turbo car to drive just yourself to the vape shop and your it job youll never take it to a track or race it subaru drivers are the biggest fucking pussies on the road    ya i got muh 62 chebby truck that i race  said no one ever        oookay i bet more chads race their trucks than nerds in their stis
  no more hatch im not in the period of my life where i can have 2 cars so the 1 that i do have needs to have good cargo space
    what the fuck are you even talking about it has all the nanny assists including awd you cockmongler     and these are drive by wire you dipshit    dont forget    shitty fucking boxer engine that pisses oil and makes basic servicing a nigger and a half    spark plugs  better drop the fuckin engine bro
  its okay op /o/ would bitch about anything
  unironically bus rider
but is it better than this red pill me
  i made an appointment with a dealer to test drive one tomorrow so hopefully it lives up to the hype
i own a 2017 sti  the engine is outdated and there is a nanny assist in the form of hillhold you can turn it off but i love it to death  its been fun learning to drive stick with it  rip clutch
  engine that feels like driving a cessna plane  you mean slow and uninspiring  t fly cessnas
  short answer no  subatards will criticize the lack of a mechanical center differential but i say if its faster than any sti maybe real awd isnt necessarily a good thing
oh is that true  i never actually thought about it   unfortunately i dont have enough money so i would just buy a rhd bugeye wrx
  enjoy that ford edge
  whhhhhooooo cccaaaaaaaarrrrrrreeeeeesssssss
brother has a wrx its cool but it feels like a boat brz is more fun but slower worth overall if you dont need a practical car    also bought it for 17k used with 40k miles a couple years back way cheaper than the wrx too
  unfortunately i dont have enough money so i would just buy a rhd bugeye wrx    that honestly doesnt make any difference you can pick and choose any year model and they all feel the same driving them  thats pretty based to be honest
  kys weeb
  id love to own one but its almost 100k where i live and the wrx sti is discontinued next year in yurop ive seen 20142015 ones for 30k or so in germany so ill probably import one in 2020
  i dont know why you think its a bote the thing literally claws at the ground and i keep pushing it harder and harder and havent really felt any understeer yet i just put winter tires on it and ive felt it some when on some unusually colder but dry days
  and the wrx sti is discontinued next year in yurop    oh god why ahahahhahaha yurofags endlessly btfo
  probably because it gets taxed out the ass as an import not only by vat but just the tariffs and fuel emissions taxes    the same goes with the brz
alright so i just test drove it and it handles and drives really well    only thing i hated was the cabin noise is god awful my ears are still ringing after the 15 minute test drive
  stis are known for horrible sound deadening
its hilarious when sti owners get butthurt when s4s shit all over them
  jesus christ youre pathetic reminds me of pic related
  why is car ownership an ongoing competition if you like audis thats cool but an audi if i like subarus im gonna get a subaru it blows my mind how much you faggots bicker over the stupidest shit
  no sti owner gets butthurt when an s4 beats them you think we dont know how fast an s4 is shit even the 2004 models are faster  but if it helps you with your ego by all means retard
  subaru and vw are on par
  i literally dont expect my 2019 sti to be faster than anything i wouldnt be surprised to get freight trained by a stock diesel pickup 310 horsepower isnt shit by todays standards but its a fun car to drive it looks cool and sounds cool and it rips in the snow with a set of studded nokians
  its cool ill probably pick up a used one in 10 or 15 years
  a sedan has more or equal cargo space with the seats up if you have a family you need a sedan or a wagon not a shitty memeback
  not drive by wire  u wot theyve been drive by wire since 04
thanks now im watching colin mcrae compilations again
  never thought id see a based subaru owner on /o/
    wanting a worse car than its competitors for the same price    lel its getting discontinued because its an inefficient pile of shit and subaru cant compete at least mitsubishi knew the evo was out of the game
  shameless opportunity to post my sweetheart 3
  car that costs 14k more is faster  no shit
  itll also break down 10 times as much
ej series was cool
  once you get past the a3/a4 economy models this is false
  remembrance of the 90s golden era  the 90s were a garbage era for cars
  elaborate
  the 90s were a garbage era for cars  you have to be 18 years and older to post here you bus riding teeny bopper  go back to listening to bulow
  i own a new wrx not sti and test drove an rs for about 40 miles rs is a assload better to drive powerband is thick clutch is solid shifts are positive throttle is old school but the extra 12k entry price and head gasket issues on the 23 made the decision easy
  thats why you see so many sets of dunlops with 5k for sale on craigslist the tire noise is insufferable
  the difference between the eb 23 and the ej25 is one got a recall and one got several class action lawsuits
  what are you on about    servicing is very easy     spark plugs  remove the battery for the driver side pull the air intake for the passenger     if you struggle you can unbolt the two engine mounts on the cross member and lift the engine enough to clear the frame rail
  implying id buy anything american
  direct injection
  the first thing i did on my 2018 wrx is get an air oil separator instead of a catch can 30k miles later i had a buddy of mine put a snake camera down to the intake valves and theyre completely clean idk why subaru doesnt just put a good can or an aos into it
  new wrx  the new wrx has an fa20dit not an ej25
  and the subject of the thread is the sti which still uses the ej
  and  brought up the ej25 when  said he owns a new wrx
  well i dont really care what he drives
    great info saving up for 2020 and hoping ford still revives this car
  the sti is getting a refresh in 2020 so idk if you wanna wait or what its supposed to get subarus fa24 being a 24l engine with more modern shit should prove to get even better hp
  inb4 an extra 15hp and even more curb weight 3700lbs
  well if the wrx from the ej20 went from 220hp to the fa20 making 268hp i imagine the fa24 will make a big difference too if its the same proportion then youd be looking at like 350hp
  in a 4000lb chassis
  the regular sti is 3400lbs it isnt going to magically jump 600 pounds you fucking retard the focus rs also weighs 3400lbs
  had no idea im honestly in between the sti and rs love the styling and sound of both cars how fast they are is not really the decision maker thanks for lookin out
  i would wait the more you wait the more focus rss depreciate so you pay less and you get to see how the sti refresh is
  the sti used to be 2800 never underestimate what subaru is capable of fucking up
  paying next gen money for last gen tech sure buddy whatever u say ill give a bit with the wrx but the sti is overpriced
  dude its 1996 since then safety regulations have forced manufacturers to build safer and better cars virtually every car is going through this and has been going through this that 22b was a fucking death trap in comparison
  maybe itll get the 24l ive seen it in person and it ressembles a lot like the ej motors honestly  but one thing subaru did mention is that itll be a hybrid as well with electric power driven wheels such as their latest crosstrek phev hybrid  youll probably get a mere 20mile range with it but hey its to boost the performance a bit and be fuel efficient enough to be able to be sold back into yuroland    im predicting 340hp or 370 with hybrid and a lot more torque    price will be jumped to 4555k as a consequence    its what you get for crying all these years about   muh headgaskets muh ringlands muh muh muh waa waaa i dont even own an sti and i cry about its defects    ive had 6 stis and none of them had to be opened or had serious issues two of which were sold at 220k km  for 1000015000 cad still
    the new sti golf r and rs will all be moving to 20l hybrid platforms in their next generations in subarus case though the regular wrx will probably stay all ice and get even more power as the sti moves higher up the performance ladder
  the more you wait the more focus rs  unless the rs never comes back to america in which case the mk3 price will sky rocket
  unlikely this isnt some old jdm car from the 90s they stopped making looking at a lot of those cars for reference they depreciate and only start to appreciate up to 10 years a head of when they stopped being made    hell s2000s arent even up beyond their starting prices from the early 2000s
  which company aos did you buy
  crawford
  a bunch of things that make it worse than alternatives  u shuld luv dis car    no subaru should make it not shit it was nice 15 years ago not so much now
  i think were looking at a different era though imagine in 2021 when someones looking for a fun practical car and literally everything on the market is  crossover  hybrid  cvt  etc  the outgoing segment could very possibly be the last cars ever made of this style
  none of those stop a car from being fun or practical
  no sedans do not i have to haul music gear all the time hatches are much more helpful for load in/out i dont have a family so youre also wrong there youre also wrong about memes wagons are the absolute worst one yet    i hate it when fucking idiots opine on things they know nothing about
  name one fun car that is any combination of crossover hybrid and cvt
  not a cvt nor a crossover
  wut it has a cvt
  crz  theres even a supercharger for it
  i said fun and practical plus a lot of people dont want to move to hybrid cars because of all the added weight and complexity 
  i would wait  yes im honestly in no rush to make the decision i do know i want it new but i can hold off for the pricegouging to subside before pulling the trigger on either the sti or rs 20
  if youre american then waiting is going to lead to a big disappointment the new rs isnt even going to be sold here
  got a source on that or just speculating
  the fact that ford wont be selling any cars other than the mustang in the us anymore
  they even pulled the plug on the focus active so now its all mustang all the time
    my reasoning for hoping the rs is still made available is that its such a niche product they might make an exception for their new no cars business plan
  they wont though speculation is that they lost money on every base model rs sold in the states and with the new tariff stocks as low as ever and a new ceo theres just no shot if hackett gets fired soon then maybe
  20 years ago with a floppier chassis and crash safety bad enough that it created the term head crush maximum
  but normal cars and trucks are getting faster while weighing a lot more than they used to why is it only subaru that seems to be going backwards
  they havent been going backwards theyve been progressing the same way as other makers have
  man ill swallow that bitter pill you just gave me i guess ill keep my ear to the ground and wait for 2020 regardless and see what happens from there might just be able to pickup a 18 or 19 sti for cheap
  because they focused on the drivetrain and chassis instead of hp since then also they dont have as huge of a budget as other companies and i guess theyd rather sell foresters and outbacks for guaranteed crossoverbux than update the sti
  their power to weight ratio has been getting worse and worse over time because they keep clinging on the the piece of shit 280hp boat anchor       because they focused on the drivetrain and chassis instead of hp since then    so they still stick the outdated as fuck boat anchor 3 feet in front of the front axle they should probably just stick to crossovers and crosstreks and shit because they really cant compete in the performance sector anymore
driving a cessna plane    nonpilot larper confirmed kys knigger
  so they still stick the outdated as fuck boat anchor 3 feet in front of the front axle  whats a good alternative that doesnt end up putting even more weight up front like the evo or end up making it cost more
  cessna    /o/ is a piper board
  go with a transverse inline 4 or jeep their shitty boxer and use a motor on the front axle pretty sad when you actually need hybrid technology to help you
i posted this thread yesterday night before bed and checked up on it today  this many seething replies    jesus lord 3/4 of /o/ are bus riders confirmed    the focus rs is a good car and actually can be the better car for sure  the wrx/sti are also good cars  audi and vw can eat dicks though    i just wanted to inform people what this car really is and its pretty much a 90s car living in a recent year shell/body no difference whatsoever pick and choose a model theyre all the same such as the evos    they still do not deserve the hate they receive
  they were good cars now theyre slower in the real world than a camry or truck and slower than a 4cyl mustang or camaro on a track
  would i be able to translate my dirt rally experience to the real world with this  or do i wait until the a110 gets a manual
  subaru just cant find the finances to upgrade anything its a winning formula anyways  305hp  290tq  in a 4door corolla looking ass thats quite decent people who hate on the power figure probably have never driven anything remotely fast  subaru cbf upgrading the engine in any cases its getting a huge reform come 2020  just enjoy the last purest form of driving machinery before hybrid kicks everywhere
  why the fuck would you track a subaru wrx  the thing is meant to be blasting around gravel trails and shit
  valid points made transmission makes the world of difference
  why the fuck would you track a subaru wrx  is that not what sports cars are for     gravel trails  in a modern 3600lb subaru with 20 section tires and 2 inches of ground clearance    the days of the rally car are long gone its a pavement queen now and theres a lot of better choices if your looking for one of those
  is that not what sports cars are for  not really there are tons of sports cars millions of sports cars out there and 9999 of them will never see a track nor did the manufacturers intend for their cars to be tracked they designed them with sportyness in mind and that can be driven daily
  is it reaaaaaally that low tho  tyres can be changed  and sports car refers to performance not where you drive it  but for me a wrx belongs going sideways in the forest
  is it reaaaaaally that low tho  its not hes exaggerating its actually 5
  i know it was a rhetorical question  posters who type such absolute statements always exaggerate  much to the detriment of this board
  its always the same retarded people    looks like a camry  looks boy racer  so which is it faggot  head gaskets  from an issue 10 years ago on one section of cars  some other nonsense i read on a forum i disregard any and all elements and give anecdotes the ultimate confirmation by calling them well established facts  muh ringlands and rod knock  oh but ill ignore the 1 causes of those issues shitty tunes extremely high pressure tunes boy racers lugging the fuck out of their engines and taking highg turns because the oil pan doesnt have a baffle in the regular wrx
  then why dont you just get a truck      if you took a new wrx and entered it in an amature rally youd be done after one lap their 1000lbs too heavy to be a rally car
  then why dont you just get a truck  because i dont want a fucking truck
  if you took a new wrx and entered it in an amature rally youd be done after one lap their 1000lbs too heavy to be a rally car  oh man never mind that the wrx nor the sti has absolutely no fittings to be in a rally race but please tell me how sports cars belong on a track despite them not being equipped at all for tracking capacity
  well a wrx isnt designed to be fast on a track apparently and its only a couple hundred lbs away from a truck
  what truck is 3200lbs
  what wrx is 3200lbs you girls always use that number even though theyre well above that a colorado is under 4000lbs and has a better f/r weight balance lol
  wrxs made between 2002 and 2014 the current one weighs 3400lb in top trim with the cvt why do you always shitpost in subaru threads about trucks did a sti fuck your wife or something
        the current one weights 3300lbs    dont kid yourself    oh the colorado is under 2 tons  and more expensive with its v6 because the v4 isnt going to do shit
  because hes a dumb bench racer who is so autistic he cant understand why other people dont want fucking trucks
  but subarus handle like trucks weight almost as much as a trucks and have worse weight distributions if not a truck then at least get a proper sports car instead of some riced out poser mobile
you  hurr im just being retarded gimme attention  subarus handle like trucks but ive driven neither
im the m3 fag from the other post i owned a 2011 sti for 7 years first off the new one has a different drivetrain its not 100 torsen diff as the older ones are so my take from tons of track days and autox days     stis understeer like crazy you need to learn how to enter a corner slower than you want and accelerate out of the corner compared to an evo in this aspect they are shit  the new sti supposedly has torque vectoring i think its brake based which is shit all you do is over heat the brakes  i had tons of suspension mods in mine it still understeered like shit   the interior is shit  the motor is shit i tuned mine my self i tuned mine conservative as fuck i added boost and not much timing too much timing and you see detonation and the ring lands are done  the drivetrain is stout as fuck it will handle redline clutch dumps all day  the synchros are shit the car does not want to shift fast at high rpm  honesty after owning one i loved it as a fun daily driver its an absolute shit performance car a evo 8/9 is better in every aspect     if anybody has questions i know quite a bit let me know i have tuned and built high hp evos and stis i have tracked both
  also to add the throttle is throttle by wire i found from my many track days that putting the dccd in full  and not auto  is the only way the car is predictable
600 euromonies taxes a year to drive it on the road
  right i have a brz that everyone loves to shit on on the internet irl i enjoy driving it and it actually gets unsolicited compliments i could not care less what some cum gargling cock holster on the internet thinks about vehicles he has never driven and you shouldnt either i just come in here to lol at the arguments
alright faggots someone talk me out of buying a manual 370z right now    330 hp
   had tons of suspension mods in mine it still understeered like shit  clearly not the correct mods nor the right toe and camber
   motor is shit i tuned mine my self i tuned mine conservative as fuck i added boost and not much timing too much timing and you see detonation and the ring lands are done  what the fuck is this your tune is shit the ecu will retard the timing if you get preignition there are tons of third party tunes for this car that are totally stable but you do yours yourself and complain its the cars fault
  i like the wrx  but i like the feel of the new si way more    sti vs ctr is no contest ctr
  bitch i had tre coilovers 29 degrees in front 19 in rear with control arms full bushing i ran bfg rivals and re71rs the car handled amazing but after driving a proper evo 9 it just felt like it was trying to hard my car was setup as good as you can set up and sti we have a local stx4 class at my autox that are basically fully built awd cars the stis win here and there and if not are competitive but from behind the wheel fighting understeer all day is not fun when you have an evo with actual active yaw torque vectoring ect they are just much more fun to drive
  dude i have tuned tons of cars stis evos dsm sr20 rb25/26 if you run too much timing in a ej25 by the time its knocking the ring lands could already be gone show me fast ej25s with a tune and bolt one and ill show you tons of 500whp evos on a totally stock motor the ecu pulls timing when it sees knock but with a ej25 its can be too late if u wanna talk tune talk we can talk all day i have timing/fuel tables i can pull up for you
  also to add the ots cobb stage 1 tune is absolute shit it has way too much timing advance at low rpm if you try to pass a car in 5th/6th gear on the highway you will run into timing/knock issues i use tactrix/rom raider to tune it my self much safer for an autox situation where the intercooler gets heat soaked and its prone to knock
  well 5th or 6th at highway speeds is going to be 5560mph which means youre at 25003000rpm if youre really hammering it here youre lugging the fuck at the engine
  no you fucking havent when you say shit like i was super conservative this thing is bad you get detonation its really awful meanwhile maproformance tunes and shit are fine and get you a solid 20hp but somehow youre not satisfied with the bajillion of fine examples
  exactly but why should a tune be so agressive that you cant pass a car in 5th iv tuned evos and they are much more lenient on timing advance and how much knock they can handle like i said for every 1 400whp stock bottom ej you show me ill show you one 600hp 4g63 is you say otherwise your a fucking idiot
  wow 20whp mean while ea888 vw are making 75100whp with a tune and pipes the ej is shit
  you cant pass a car in 5th   you absolutely can you can either give it a little gas and accelerate around some car in a lane or you can be a boiracer drop it to 4th going from 3k to 4200rpm and floor it to stop lugging the engine      wow why arent apples like oranges
that was my pos tactrix/rom raider tuned they are decent dailys they are no evo they are no golf r they are no focus rs literally the worst build platform you can buy in the segment
  nigger speak english
  miata
  let me buy you a beer op    i have an 18 sti bought it new and love it
  its not slow plenty fast you prob have not driven one if you drive a tunedone thats 350400 whp you would shit your pants and realize you would never use that hp unless on the track
  muh toonz  your car is slow deal with it
  post your faster car
  picked this up last week 2018 performance package only 33k way nicer and way faster than any sti
  ford
  attempts to corner
  yeah eww a ford thats faster than any sti on any track any strip looks better sounds way better and i dont have to worry about my engine shitting out seals
  i had the choice between the sti and the mustang    i still have picked the sti    the mustang just cant compare to the feedback you receive while driving an sti you can have all the ponies that you want but i would hate driving such a numbed out car
  the sti is sexier and feels symbiotic with the user driving is experiential to each their own
  power going to the front wheels under normal circumstances   sexy
  4 door awd sedan with full backseats  vs  2 door rwd coupe with tiny backseats  compare the sti to a taurus sho golf r or focus rs it has nothing in common with the mustang
  how is that relevant when youll be the only person in the car
  op thank you for this took the words right out of my mouth the sti is one of the last cars still rooted deep to the beginning so much better than the current wrx
  mustang  bahahahahaha
  fat tarted up econobox  sexy
  at least i can put the power down instead of just wheel spin
  yeah no the sti is ugly as fuck i like the older ones a lot but the modern gen is a piece of shit  fake vents and 4 exhaust tips despite using the same engine which used to only have 1  its gross
  even spinning out a mustang is faster i get wheel spin shifting all the way up into third gear its unfair how much power that thing has
  lmao this is the stupid nigger that thinks his fwd garbage competes with corvettes
  needing awd to put down 260hp    its literally just a hindrance at this point a 650hp camaro or 500hp mustang have no issues going faster on a track with no traction
  whatever you say about the current gen sti its a good platform just as the older ones
  the older ones werent ugly and fat  the older ones also had era appropriate interiors
  bitch i bet you dont even have tinnitus  fuck off back to your soundpadded classical music tinkling den of safety and beg mommy to make your autistic ass some tendies and coconut milk ya faggot
    nice test drive photo
oh shit
hnnnnnnnngggggg
  that is truly awful
ford better bring the big guns with the bronco
  looks fucking sick what are you talking about
  to each is own i guess looks awful to me to make it even worse theyre using the gladiator name
has a front facing downward pointing trail camera with a washer nozzle to clean it off    neat
oh boy another truck awesome
  if they make a shorter 2 door it will be lit
    no it looks like trash thats a 40k vehicle that should cost 25k  the entire roll cage is pressed steel and looks awful especially for a vehicle where you think that they would take some care to make sure that at least looks decent considering the whole point of a wrangler is taking off the top and the doors for some open air fun what youre fixated on is the knobby tires and the fucking sick hood vents but really those are there to detract your attention from the rest of the vehicle
  really i was just paying attention to the fact that it was a off road capable pickup truck that you can take the doors and roof off
  you can already get a kit to convert wranglers to that single cabs are a dying breed these days so wouldnt get your hopes up
  neat wrangler is back on my list
    and youre right maybe my reservations come from its target audience instead of how capable it really it is
    that looks badass
  looks shitty but ill reserve judgement until i see it with doors and roof on
  target audience     lol jeeps are pussy magnets why would you not want one
  im sure itll cost about a million dollars
  probly 40k base
    buying chrysler trash in current year
  100k household income 75 male thats scary to you
based
  another shitty compact quad cab pickup with a tiny useless bed
  staymad
  everyone that bitches about no 2 doors dont buy new jeeps 2 door sells only 25 of the 4 door
  but by your own admission they do buy new 25 isnt a small number
  ermm it looks awkward
  when introducing a new model who do you want to sell to first 75 of customers or 25
  low iq post 25k is like the cost of a base toyota camry or chevy malibu    the gladiator is in a whole other league
  lol this is what yanks get instead of patrols and landcruisers sad
  the back sticks out too much
  how about you bongs produce a car that wont kill everyone inside it if it gets in an accident and we too can enjoy land rovers
  american customers want something reliable
looks disproportionate tbqh too much rear overhang the bed needs to be like six inches shorter also to keep up with the wrangler philosophy of crazy approach angles
  if you want a crazy off roader then get the regular wranglers obviously theres going to be some compromise when making a pickup
          this looks like
  sure does
  this is why i said it looked shit rather have a fake ass shorty bed thats proportional as no one is going to use this like a real truck anyway    think hummer h3t
  my poop emoji was not posted
  then get a 4 door wrangler suv
  this it looks retarded with the bed and 4 doors
  20135  mobileposting  attempting to post emojis on 4chan  go back to whatever hole you crawled out of newfag
  why would i waste 40k on a piece of shit when thats riced used landcruiser money jeeps entire purpose is to offroad where other 4x4s cant using an autistic shot wheelbase and overhang     this is the worse od both worlds bot truck enough to be used as one and not 4x4 enough to compete with the larger vehicles its now sized as
  this may as well buy a tacoma at least its not made by fiat
  is there a car that can buy for less than  500
mfw its longer than a 70s cadillac
  40k    are you really that fucking poor
  not compared to the majority of americans with less than 1k in their bank account while driving vehicles like your pic with subprime loans lmao    dont bother reposting the wrangler owners make 6 figures meme as its irrelevant without an expense sheet to go with it
less than 300hp  will most likely cost 35000  40000  no v8 option  can get a 400hp v8 ferd f150 for less  its going to be fucking trash its too long to compete against the wrangler in rock climbing and off roadin and the bed is far too small to be considered a viable pickup truck youre much better off buying an f150/tundra or getting a wrangler like a normal person
  less than 300hp  will most likely cost 35000  40000  duh like everything else  no v8 option  nor does any other midsize truck jeep will have their 442ft/lbs of torque diesel though  can get a 400hp v8 ferd f150 for less  yet not as off road capable     the jeep is competing against the toyota tacoma trd and chevy colorado zr2
  so yes yes youre poor
   jeep is competing against the toyota tacoma trd and chevy colorado zr2  ok youre still better off with a tacoma for reliability or a zr2 / ranger raptor for performance
  looks like shit desu wheres that badass one they showed a few years ago
  this is my kind of car advertisement
  toyota memes  ifs chevy or ford truck  ford already stated the ranger raptor isnt coming
  how is it too long why does your arbitrary definition matter anyway when reality is a thing
i just want you guys to know i did some of the gdt and cmm on the jt trailer hitch and a few other parts so when you see them please think of me    also i wouldnt trust these to last long
   already stated the ranger raptor isnt coming  implying amerifats are the only people who matter  fuck off cunt
  house is paid off and i actually own everything in the driveway so yes im a bad goy      itll be better offroad because its a jeep  no it wont the special sauce was short wheelbase no overhang the rubi got decent tc upgrades but at the 60k fuck maybe 70k if the trucks get a premium its a solid toyota camry more than the zr2    if anything itll be less capable due to what appears to be a stubby wheelbase exaggerating the bed overhang making for shit overhang    but at the end of the day im not autistic enough to use the tire size and aspect ratio to measure it since its a vehicle im too poor to buy
  is there a 2 door on the way whats the towing capacity
  not surprised jeep is here hyping their shit truck    post the departure angles to shut us up or fuck off with your longboy
  longer vehicles are terrible for rock climbing and hill climbs their longer wheelbase and overall length prevent them from climbing hills that a shorter vehicle such as a wrangler could do with ease      good luck doing something like that in a gladiator mememobile or a full bed pickup
  i dont think youve ever been offroad in your life  
looks like utter shit  engine is total shit  transmissions will be ssgsslevels of shit  price tag will probably be 45k before stealership markups      its doa
  theyve doubled in sales volume since 2010 how many vehicles can do that
  the wrangler is fcas best selling vehicle its a cash cow
  a gladiator will tow your rock crawler and then you can use your truck to enjoy other forms of off road
    dont know about towing capacity but there is a 2door coming been seeing rfqs at work for a jt profighter and some prohunter model and the profighter is supposed to be a 2door from what i understand          i aint here to shill nor do i work for jeep i work at a engineering firm that just happens to be doing a lot of jl and jt parts
lets take the doors and roof off a truck and sell it
  bring back the excursion
  well cant tell if larp or not dont see how you can design hitches without knowing the capabilities this was part of the gladiator leaks earlier this month
  oh i also should add that a jt crossmember srt math data file came through my work not too long ago with a bolt pattern and load requirements matching a dt ram so maybe v8 model  im not sure what specific motor but im going to try and get a hold of the hellcat and trackhawk crossmembers and compare them to the jt one i dunno if if fca will give me access but ill try
  im a cad tech i do gdt and cmm prints mostly towing capacities arent something i deal with
  7500lbs   thats somewhat impressive
  agreed it looks especially dorky with the doors on all the four door wranglers look like ass anyway though so this isnt a big surprise
  dont compare the xj that fucking barbie machine youre shilling
  god forbid they engineer something clever  like fixing the overhang by incorporating folding back seats into the bed so its a reasonable length but its okay we get this
    reminder the original was so badass the army adopted it as the m715
  why would i not buy a v8 truck instead of this its the mom version of the jeep with a too small bed and its likely going to be way more expensive and just as thirsty
  nah man its totally gonna guzzle even more fuel the frame is almost 3 longer than a wranglers
this looks coolonly problem is jeep has good engineers but they wont lastand their dealers sucksgood luck fixing the problems with it who ever buys these
  the xj still has a much shorter wheelbase than ops monstrosity
      now up to 5 passengers can get flung violently from your death machine
  it looks really nice i like the design i kind of want one even more than i would want a midsize truck the only bad things are the likely obscenely high sticker price that could pay for a full size 4x4 truck with a plethora of engine options vs buying this with a pentastar v6 with less power and capability than the base model of the fs truck if chrysler would start offering more power options that could balance out
  meh sort of gimmicky probably will sell well to tryhard bro fag who are into ufc or crossfit    id rather have a regular wrangler unlimited or if i needed a pickup id get a cozy sierra
  uhhhh i dont think its long enough
does it have twin solid axles it come with a diesel option
      i cant wait until i get stuck behind some vineyard vines wearing super faggot going the speed limit in the passing lane in one of these ugly pieces of garbage
     so you can carry all four of your mechanics with you and their tools plus extra space in the bed for something not made by chrysler
  /thread
  kekked hard my man
  which is why rich oil princes in the gcc always choose patrols and landcruisers over american 4x4s cope      landcruiser is jap not the bong rover
  no one else buys patrols they make them only for the arabs
   dont see how you can design hitches without knowing the capabilities  you can design a hitch tow x amount the legal team/ government can look at the wheel base and weight and say it will tow y amount as long as x is greater the y you are a ok
  patrols are pretty common in the united states in nissan armada and infinity qx whatever it is
  oi yeah nah fuck ya cunt
    not a patrol and where else is the patrol sold not the us not the eu either
  yeah the current armada is a y62 nissan otherwise known as a patrol also sold in aus but literally nobody buys them because theyre only offered in petrol so everybody buys a 70/200 cruiser
  i think the only downside to this truck is how easily it will be to cleve off one of the taillights why do they stick out like unneutered nuts on a dog
  based
    oh look another tool for smallcocked men to buy so they can push around people on the road they feel inferior against it literally will be bought by fathers for their sons sexually questionable daughters
  sounds like you need to learn to drive like a man    big babies in these joops dont want to scratch their 60k truck so just push them off the road
  because theyre retarded sand people
  its built on the outgoing ram platform its been around for over a decade the only changes are almost purely cosmetic not including some new electronic features obv
    why dont you get an std you fuckwit
    attempting to emojiipost  figures antijeepfags would be vapid leadditors
  high middle class income attracts largely men in stem fields that enjoy modding and offroading and are generally confident and content with their careers and hobbies i take it this is problematic to you
  that weak ass engine  might as well get a frontier would be almost half the cost for the same power
okay guys  what if we took our dedicated offroader  and made the wheelbase really fucking long so it can get highcentered easily  and gave it a bed that extends way beyond the rear wheels to fuck the departure angle  and made room for two more fat fucks to sit inside so itll sink into the mud better  but you can still take the doors and roof off because heritage or whatever lol    ford btfo
no single cab    i am upset
  approach and departure angles are certainly not a problem with the vehicle
  beds not long enough you fucking retard nobody wants to spend 50000 on one of these 15000 for a stupid kit and hack their fucking jeep up theres no reason they cant sell two door truck ones they just dont want to because they know theyre shit trucks worse than a ford ranger even im done with you
  /thread
  look up price of unlimited wrangler rubicon  from 41k  are you fucking kidding me 41k base for a jeep is insane
  it seems upset
  they know theyre shit trucks worse than a ford ranger even  havent made any since the comanche
  what it will be is useless offroad due to its longer wheel base
  rubicon is not a base model sweetie
  they dont offer anything above rubicon iirc
    no i just meant the base price of the rubicon trim    i know it has lots of extra shit but 41 grand for a jeep just seems silly
  you seem to mean rock climbing i think it would be fine off road     nah brah have to go through the rubicon trail to enjoy offroading
  to long for rock crawling  maybe but theres finally an option that can hill climb with out flipping backwards this jeep gladiator is for the growing overland crowd anyway
  it will sell like hotcakes same way 4 door 4wd variants outsell 2 door variants exempting commercially operated vehicles everywhere
        no they produce them for the whole gcc including qatar which is pretty much just america with americans living there so not just stupid sand people buy them people in the gcc prefer them to landcruisers they sell them in every country in the world besides the us australia and nz were buying fuck tonnes of them before they brought in stupid emission laws and stopped selling the tb48 before they stopped selling them they were more popular than the landcruiser because they can get the job done better except for the shithouse mpg they have the united nations uses the tb48 in rugged country because the performance cant be matched in any other 4x4 of its size  the engine is more reliable than some american shitheap solely developed for shekels and planned obsolescence in mind think of it as a more reliable barra that has more displacement and is cast iron instead of aluminium  they are detuned from the factory for reliability but ive seen them running up to 400 hp on stock internals no dramas involved its nothing out of the ordinary hearing about them pushing 20003000hp they are like diesels in the way that they have so much torque its just about neck breaking fanging one uphill also no one buys the newer model patrols theyre shit nothing like the gu/vtc patrols lol        
  also no one buys the newer model patrols theyre shit  yeah my point only the old good ones are available to brown oil people theyre great but the new ones are pooftertier
  yeah fuckin oath nissan has gone to shit ay one thing i really like about them is that theyve failed to retain their value you can get one that used to cost 76k for 7k second hand now
base wrangler starts at fucking 36000 here in canada  yet another large suv to choose from with a probable starting price of 48000  mfw    sweet another expensive fully loaded truck for boomers to drive around in i am so fucking bored of the north american auto market
  i give it a month until its ruined with light bars and angry headlights
    i live in sc the only people driving jeeps here are women and faux libertarian white guys who jerk off while reading the 2nd amendment these men are 3040 year olds fuckboys        where do you get that figure from        is this something youre pulling out of your ass     these things are pavement pounders around here they do nothing but cart people around on paved roads in discomfort while they think to themselves i could go on every trail in moab i never would because this cost 40k but i would and i actually rented a 4 door wrangler for a week because i wanted to see what the hype was all about it had four wheel drive the v6 it was a solid model but all i could think is this is absolute watery green with specks of blood dogshit to drive in every single scenario on the highway it was miserable driving around town it was miserable parking in garages was miserable parallel parking was miserable etc and i owned a wj and that was a wonderful suv so its not like jeep cant build a comfortable and capable car with solid axles on both ends its that they realize that they can cheapthefuckout with the wrangler and people will still throw down several thousand dollars more than they need to on this vehicle because it exists as a compensatory tool for the majority of its owners shit one of my good friends owns a rubicon and ive asked him and if hes ever taken it off road and he said that he doesnt want to mess up the paint or the expensive optional wheels these are the people that buy these i mean jeez why not just buy a toyota fj instead at least youll be comfortable while you never leave the roads in your comfortable offroader    and thats all i gotta say about that
  why doesnt fca put the 57 hemi in the jeep
  hahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahaahhahahaahahhhaahhahahahahahhhahahaahahhhahhhahahahahhahahahhhhahahahahaahaàhahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahhahahhhahahahahhahahahahhahhahagahahahhahahhahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahah
      lmao look everyone i took the doors off lmao
  angry headlights
    angry jeeps make me audibly cringe
  fucking 5/3 as long as a wrangler should be fuck pickup wrangler fuck fourdoor wrangler fuck luxury wrangler
  people who buy 40k jeeps dont take them offroad  perfect ill buy it in 10 years for 10 of the cost and mod it out to my hearts content
jeep fags wtf yo
  what is this gay shit
  looks like a pic that says happy sock 
literally paying 40k for recalls    only a retard would buy a new jeep in its current manufacturer state
  he doesnt know  awwwww sweety
  think of this thread when you bring your shitty numale wrangler back to the dealership for repairs
diesel option sounds like it could be interesting still wish there was a 2 door option though this thing looks way too long
20063327  snowflake trying soooo hard  sweety no
  its so round and gross
  hey quick question boys    if the safety standards are making cpillars mighty thick and this bad boy definitely looks rollover prone why isnt the steelpressed frame bigger    in fact all of the roof supports look stupid thin and do not inspire confidence in me in a rollover event even in the rubicon in ops pic
  make pickup truck  payload is less than some suvs
  its body on frame so its rollover protection isnt into the body as much as on unibody cars theres a basic roll cage i think they call it the safety bar also the stamped metal pillars arent as thin as you think theyre considerably thicker than previous generations and on the far side of the image you can see they seem quite large from inside the cabin
id gladly sacrifice some bed length to be able to take it anywhere near a metropolitan area but i guess thats not really the demographic for the new model    ah what could have been instead we get shit
  is that like the sock you cum in every night faggot      lmao sick burn 10/10 fucken roasted
    its a shit fca product and if you roll it youre gonna fuckin die
  good info thanks anon      heh
  instead we get shit    yep and jeepfags will come back begging for more more shit please sir i cant get enough stuff it in my mouth i want to pay you sir please take my money and fill me with your shit every orifice
maybe they could come out with a not gay looking comanche instead of forcing us to chop up xjs
  jeep    shit
  yes thats what a happy sock is congratulations newfriend 
  that looked like a gtav screenshot from the thumbnail
  that purple pass  im going to enjoy creeping on you next summer
  looks like a transformer from the bay movies  thats not a compliment
    faggot nigger turns into a faggot jeep    sounds about right
  lmao that thing is fucking retarded looking and with the wrangler roll bar as the only structural rigidity that thing is going to be a piece of shit as a pickup truck towing or hauling anything heavy     the gladiator concept looked cool because it was more of a retrolooking concept this new thing is just a wrangler with the trunk chopped off and a shitty bed welded to it no wonder chrysler was bought out by fiat they are fucking morons
    10 years for 10 of the cost    false more like 10 years for 85 of the cost if you want a jeep buy it new because used ones are insultingly expensive and if you total it you are almost always going to get more than you owe on the loan    t jeep owner
  considering how many new jeeps are being sold every year i dont see how these used prices are sustainable where i live i see jeep wranglers everywhere
  jk unlimited  real jeep
    i mean if you want a 2 door example here you go
  youre a spanner mate bodys got fuckall to do with frame strength on a body on frame design completely ignoring the fact that a bit of flex is desirable in something that tows
  inflation    
    you think the average wrangler driver has a grasp of inflation    you are still talking about retaining 57 of the value over 10 years with 46000 more miles than most people consider a car to be too old to buy
why cant japs be this based anymore what went wrong
  for whatever reason they decided making money was more important than making loss leaders for manchildren
  the tides ebb and flow   nippon will rise again
  goat sports cars are for manchildren  why are you on this board fuck off
emissions standards and taxes  speedbumps and the crackdown on car culture overt or due to external forces lowering sporty car sales
subaru still makes the imprezza  nissan still makes the gtr  honda improved the nsx  toyota has a supra replacement either being the actual car called supra or the lc depending on who you ask  that kei car thing on the bottum right was niche and never even sold in the states    all but 1 of the main jap sports cars rx7 are gone and the subie fills the exact same roll of the evo
  all but 1 of the main jap sports cars rx7 are gone  i mean only one of the main jap sports cars is gone
  well i consider the 3000gt vr4 and mr2 and s2000 as main but i see your point
  any of those cars   based       theyre all meme tier garbage
  sti  still a pretty damn amazing car    lancer evo  dead but so is mitsumishi afaic    gtr   still in production and even more impressive just a lot more expensive    rx7  rotaries are dead so it hard to really make that again    supra  new model coming out soon but it will never live up to the hype behind its successor so who cares    3000gt  mitsubishi is dead who cares    nsx  new one is just fine just a lot more expensive and lacks the supercar for dummies maintenance people liked in the old ones     s2000  2019 miata makes similar numbers for less     autozam  oddball freak of a kei car if you want something weird go buy a alfa 4c or something kei cars barely seem like a thing in japan outside of work vehicles these days anyway
  i defend corporations which i have no stake on for free  i am rational
  i dont really consider the 3000gt a main because it was mitsubishi dumping shittons of money into a car and is unlike anything theyve done before and expecting them to do it again is unrealistic miata fills the roll of what everyone mightve wanted out of an s2000 and whatever you feel is lacking could more than likely be made up with mods honda themselves said they cant bring the s2000 back despite wanting to because it was be pointless in a saturated market for those cars and the miata basically cleans up everything even gm tried to make a miata fighter and despite its sells success it still had his marketshare eaten by the miata theres just no way to compete with it unless you go upmarket like porsches boxster and bmws z convertibles
  they all make overpriced transformers editon bloatboxes with the same name  whats your point
  because lowvolume cars like these are significantly less profitable its not that theyre money losers like this  retard thinks its just that because they require more investment and generate less revenue even a profitable successful example is less profitable than just cranking out another cuckmobile with a high beltline that you cant see out of the companies themselves didnt change investors and shareholders expect you to chase pure profit above all else and simply wont tolerate any actions which dont maximize it
  that they continued the tradition of their bloatboxes gtr and 3000gt especially were fat og nsx was also fat fatter than a cheaper less expensive rx7 for a supposedly lightweight mid engine sports car
honda will never go back to s2000  nsx level of based again
fuel prices emissions safety adds weight refinement anprs insurance ripoffs speed bumps everywhere also recession in uk so they cannot afford them plus brainwashing and dumbing down less people have tools or know how to use them hence cant maintain a car
  he calls people who go to the track fun and sporty cars manchildren  remind everyone why you are on /o/ again
  just a lot more expensive gtr  not really the r33 was 53k uk paper units based on uk inflation that would be 89k uk permission slips today   which is 115k usd 82k euro cuck bucks so its actually a little cheaper
  82k euro cuck bucks  thats the price of a gtr today in the uk     i also meant the r34 im typing like shit all over the place tonight
  in this line of thinking when the r35 was first released it was actually significantly cheaper wasnt the base price below 70k
  2019 miata makes similar numbers for less   how you can pick up a s2000 for way less than a 2019 miata
  im not him but are you retarded the whole point of op is new cars that dude was saying you dont even need the s2000 when the miata performs the same for less money
 vr4    thank you for not forgetting the best car of the 90s
  that dude was saying you dont even need the s2000 when the miata performs the same for less money  a new s2000 would outperform the miata in every way a new s2000 would make more or the same power as the ctr they would probably get lazy and use the same engine    2019 miata makes similar numbers for less   hes saying the 2019 miata which costs more than a used s2000 would make similar numbers but a used s2000 is cheaper than the 2019 miata unless he lives in australia
  safety
  le inflation meme  people also earned more back then
   a car that doesnt exist would totally do stuff i said so  nice argument
  people earned more compared to cost of living in the late 90s and early 2000s  he doesnt understand what inflation calculation is  holy shit
  theyll stop making money when their cars become indistinguishable from the hyundais and the kias eventually chinese cars of the world its incredibly easy to take a generic shitbox and cram it full of cheap little gadgets
  the japanese asset price bubble or why japan hasnt made anything cool since the 90s
  they already are  gtr  nsx  civic type r  supra  lc 500  is f  gs f  lfa  wrx sti  evo rip itll be back  370z  qx50 red sport or whatever it is  v6 tlx  miata  brz/86    theres a lot half of them are just very expensive they might not be going balls deep like they did in the 80s and 90s but theyre doing it in a more financially sustainable way
  s2000s wernt exactly cheap the last model year sold for over 40000 in 2018 money 10k more than most mx5s
  economy tanked in the mid 90s and hasnt come back to the retardedly massive size bubble it had since
  right is honestly better in every way
  those things are tin can pieces of shit
  safety and emissions  safety is why all kei sports cars copen/s660 couldnt get imported now  emissions standards is why most japanese sportscars couldnt get imported into the country  the lack of demand for these sports makes is why most japanese sportscars ceased production    most people dont want to drive the smaller jap sports kei cars becuz slow and dangerous
  select chinese cars other than the lowtier bottomfeeders like chery/yema/lifan are already far better than existing japanese/korean cars tho  some are already decisive leaders in their segments   it is just only a matter of time whether a megalomaniac chink autoboss realises the madman ambition to build sportscars to revitalise the industry
  1 id rather ride a bus than drive a chink car  2 zero chance those things come to the states with god emperor trump in charge  3 theyd never pass safety anyway    this chink car shilling needs to stop its worse than took and kraut car shilling by far
  burgers cant drive kei cars because theyre too pigfat to fit inside
  im barely over 90 lbs so id fit in one just fine
  women are the main reason why cuckovers are so popular the logical solution is to not let women drive so they cant buy cuckovers and automakers can go back to making based cars
  not let women drive  they just force their husbands/boyfriends to buy them instead
  s2000 outperformed miatas back then the f20c designed specifically for the s2000 produces more power than any other na 20l in the world how is it stretch to say a hypothetical roadster from honda would outperform the current miata honda already has a high performance engine outputting 300 hp they still know how to make cars you know
  the s2000 is a better car than the mx5 of course its going to be priced higher the s2000 wasnt really a competitor to the miatas as that would be setting the bar too low
  wow 300hp impressive
  jerking off the shareholder culture lead to an america without cars and suvs so terrible that people are flocking to the used market instead and the auto industry is starting to flop yet again    when will the board of directors learn and bite the bullet to make quality cars for at least a decade to regain a decent reputation
       300hp is about right for a car in the 35k price range considering that its going to be a roadster i mean honda already sells a car with 300hp in the 35k price range     
  it unironically is for an i4
jap economy collapse  hasnt disposable income per capita been going down for last 20 years
  this    even anime has gone downhill
safety regulations happened
  selling a sports car helps market the commuter cars
  i wont defend things i dont have a stake in  what a prick
    nsx is literally the same price accounting for inflation people like to romanticize the old car for its feel but the new nsx is a 10 second car thats actually comfy and returns 22 mpg when not driven hard
    new s2000 is coming it may end up as an acura also the nu nsx has as much accord tier maintenance as possible honda made sure of that
  people like to romanticize the old car for its feel  because it wasnt clotted up with turbos  shocker
  and yet everybody was comparing them because miata was just this good at the lower price point  funfact nc miata was already superior in some places compared to s2k and nd is so good it blows s2k out of water
usually their sports cars arent for making money but a showcase of what the company is capable of creating through rd in motorsports f1 motogp indycar nascar lemans etc
  if chinks made cheap copies of japanese sports cars id be all over it
  just as good at a lower price point   nc miata was already superior in some places compared to s2k  nd blows the s2k out of the water   lmao
  it would probably have shit reliability and poor quality at the end of the day its still chink shit
  it seems like korea is possibly going to take over the fun cheap sportscar market unfortunately they dont have a tonne of large car makers so itll probably be a limited list though thats if they even get it right which they probably wont being korean and all
  honda improved the nsx  no its shit
  yes on paper the nsx is a better car in every single manner but when you drive them you will find out what feels a lot better just like the toyobaru twins sure it sucks on paper but its damn fun
  1 tbus rider  2 true  3 the export models already got 5star ancap in europe asia and australia
  well they sell everything in china  every engine transmission you can think of  every jdm past and present and every aftermarket piece og jdm or otherwise  you can build them up if you have the cash and wanted to still cost far less than a new car from a stealership  hell you can even specify the metal  but getting them roadlegal is another thing altogether
  the butthurt of the deluded s2k fag is sweet
  but less shit than the old one
  first off  regulations  massively fucked over everyone and everything all over the globe  and second of all  auto corporations making a living off of selling new cars  changing an amazing design to sell people on buying the new yearly model putting in detrimental features to earn revenue  back then automotive corporations were the solution  now theyre the problem
  not enough people bought them simple as that
  fun doesnt sell so fun must be limited to cars like mx5s see mazdaspeed
  please explain more am curious
what about this car is causing so much butthurt and seething is it the price tag which was always high on the supra is it the fact that weeaboo muh nippon steel fast and furious sissies are shitting their panties about bmw engineering is it the fact that its better in every conceivable way from the mkiv aside from the looks
  shut the fuck up op
  its not a real supra never mind i could never afford one and still cant afford it as an abused 90s beater
  its a rebadged bwm if i wanted to buy a bwm then god help me id buy an awful bwm not a toyota  muh fiata  the fiata atleast a fucking engine from fiat and the abarth has tuned handling this is literally a bwm call it a fucking bwm not a toyota
  this is what i seewtf toyota 
    i hate the look of it looks like a mishmash of three or four cars i cant even decide which design feature i hate the most    inb4 shit taste you asked why the seething and i told you why i dont like it
the toyota badge is ugly and id never buy a car with it on it
its taking forever to reveal a rebadged bmw made in austria its pure unadulterated cringe
  toyota though that /o/ is dumb thats super disrespectful and disappointing
    did you have a mild stroke when replying
  nope u
  i dont even like the car and never really felt strongly about the supra its just hilarious to see ricer soiboys and teenagers crying about muh bmw as for the delays its obvious toyota is dragging their feet because its not another rav4
  its more like the z5 is a rebadged toyota and the supra is a toyota with an engine swap    im just not confident modern toyota can make a good sports car
  its more like the z5 is a rebadged toyota  eh the new z4 uses bmws clar platform so will the supra
  dude the supra is on the bwm platform not the other way around this isnt a toyota its a fucking bwm
  bwm  bavarian works motor
  utterly devastated anon grasping at straws
  t utterly broken bmw fag having to act as spellcheck to make his stay on this board meaningful
ill make sure to buy one and post bread on the hood just to make all the haters anally prolapse with rage on their daily bus ride while /o/ shit posting from their phones with cracked screens
  price tag puts it well above its competitors in cost  small bmw platform dissimilar to previous generations when toyota/lexus have several rwd platforms already in production much more similar to past supras  bmw engine with all the maintenance and problems that come with it  no guarantee of manual option  entirely missing the point that the supra is an overengineered tuner car  10 bucks that while the engine is from bmw the supra ecu will be locked down  roof dip is horrendous looking  beak could look good but doesnt since there is absolutely 0 continuity in design  cant decide if it wants to be bubbly and round or sleek and angular    the whole thing is a hot mess if you told me toyota of all companies would be rebadging a bmw as a supra 10 years ago i would have laughed at you they already control a huge part of the market why are they so afraid to let trd and f performance stretch their legs i mean jesus christ toyota at least build the engine thats going in the remake of one of your most iconic cars ever made it will forever be the black sheep of the family just how the new nsx flopped with the first nsx community
  no one has the money to buy a toyota for 6070 grand    no one wants to buy a toyota for 6070 grand    you can get an m2/m3/m4 for that amount of money shit you can get used gtrs lambos and a porsche 718 now    toyota knows the market for a supra is low and at an all time low     this new bmw supra thats going to be released will face the same fate the mkiv had no one cared about it no one bought them until they figured out it can do wonders  now this to say toyota engineer himself has said if you want to swap the car for a 2jz get the 4cyl model as it will be easier    they know we know it is what it is
  you had 5 chances and fucked up bmw each time
  its a fucking bmw z4 with the supra name as its nothing like the supra like the new nsx is nothing like the one from 90s or the gtr is nothing like the skylines
  people have already figured out how to extract power from the b58 and it comes in a lighter and better balanced than any of the bmws that have it the car is being slept on
  because its not a jz series engine shut up baiter fag you know why no one will buy this
  seething because they thought the new supra would be a nsx/gtr competitor like the ft1 concept
  believe it or not people love paying out the ass for toyotas  just look at how popular the lexus es is problem is the market audience for the supra is different and they cant afford a 60k small sports car a harder sell than a gt car the market audience cant even afford houses much less a 2 seater less than ideal for daily driver unless you have a second car or a spouse with one toyota should have designed the car around the market of 3545k    all around poor management of the marketing division    i actually think the market for the supra is great right now just at a different price point the mk4 is iconic status where even normies know about it were seeing the revival of older cars thought discontinued more and more especially among american manufacturers the economy is on the incline and we can safely say were out of the recession until some other market pops the 3035 crowd would probably love something a little higher trim than a brz/frs    the 2jz while fantastic is an iron block monster  similar to the frs it just doesnt belong there youll just end up making the weight distribution all bonkers so im not sure thats a great solution  and even then what are you paying 40k to rip out the engine      it might end up being a fine sports car but at the price point its at you would think you would get a little more bang for your buck in a world where you can get a 300hp camry    that being said its hardly a supra and not even close to being a toyota
  no one has the money for a 70 grand toyota have you ever heard of the landcruiser 85k base people still pay 1015k for old landcruisers with 200k miles
  because its not a mkiv supra with 1000hp straight from the factory for 19999 its gonna be a good car /o/ is just actual garbage
  better in every conceivable way from the mkiv aside from the looks  aside from the looks  the looks  looks    the performance is relative and only matters to 14 year old bench racers but more importantly it looks like shit why would people want to buy an ugly ass car
  bavarian works motor
  fucking based
  the mark iv supra is the ugliest piece of shit among all the 90s sports cars that didnt stop it from being wank bait for sojaboys
  is it the price tag  yes remember all the  the gt86 should be a 6 cylinder turbo  threads that had the argument in response   that would cost a lot more  followed by   no it would be the same price   well the poorfags who couldnt afford an 86 didnt like being proven wrong
  some of us have good jobs and can afford to spend it on a nice car
  i dont know about being first to pay mark ups with possible quality issue on first batch i rather buy corvette then this
  i rather buy corvette then this    with guaranteed quality issues
  its a bmw it is going to have bmw problems if it does not bottom out on the road they were trying to rerelease the supra two years ago and they still have not gotten it it is not a competitive race car but it is made for the track
  the bigger problem is its 6070k for early 2000 levels of performance sure thats an upgrade from the mkiv but its not going to cut it today based on the figures we have its going to be very close to a base gt mustang in straight line speeds and probably very close to a base corvette in terms of handling if you built a 60k halo sports car and it looks like a stock stock cars at 35k and 45k are going to be close to your performance levels you have pretty much failed     this is the same problem alfa had with the 4c 60k price tag and piss poor performance numbers i mean when youre a sports car and your ring time of 804 gets beat by an older heavier luxury car ctsv 759 you have a very big problem
for me its yugo
  based and titopilled
am i the only one that owns one of these    full mechanical awd shits on subaru / shitsubishi / well anyone else really
  gt4 thread
    yeah but what is it
they never sold the st205 in the us the last gt4/alltrac we got was the st185 and there were so few of those sold theyre regularly 10000 or more for one in driveable condition    do i want one as a burgerclap hell fucking yes i want an st205 182 and 215 so bad
  they are amazing cars reading up on these before i actually set out to buy one myself
reminder ameriburgers will legally be allowed to import st205s starting next year
  they are pretty fucking awesome cars i own one  only down side to them is they are a little hard to work on other than that they are bullet proof built like a tank and super fun to drive i have never gotten stuck in snow in mine ever
  thunderous applause
  are those oem headlights    didnt know they came with projectors for the low beams on those
  japanese market cars all got projectors about 515 years before the american market did
  zoomer pls leave    jealous op i feel like ive missed the boat on getting a gt4 at a nonridiculous price
  zoomer detected who doesnt know what the first japanese car to win wrc and win it consecutively 4 more times in a row is
  great now to find an unmolested st205 wrc    off to the land of bagged milk and meese i go
  shits on subaru / shitsubishi / well anyone else really  really nigs
  stop telling everyone
m3 fag here i unironically love these was super close to buying a 1990 celica all trac these cars are underrated as fuck 4sgte is a beast the only issue is the weak transmission and lack of options concerning builds
dont meme these please i want to get one in the next few years
  implying that retards like us will fall for the celica meme when the celica sold awfully here in the states compared to the camry/corolla    people will import more supras the day they become legal before an st204 lands on the beaches of the states in its entireity
  the 185s are the best years 205s are awesome and look phenomenal but man they are h e a v y
  nice car but any sti/evo will rape the shit out of it at rally/drags/watever you can make 350whp with alot of money then youre done with the 3sgte meanwhile sti/evo can keep going and going    every gt4 ive ever been to look at in nz has a mystery oil leak aswell idk if thats from factory or just the islander owners being shitheads
  youre dumb as shit because with head studs and a good headgasket and turbo you can make 500  you mean stock turbo you can only make 350whp
  typical nz bongo dumb ass mixed with native doesnt know fuck all about anything
  and every evo and sti have the same due to the same dumb group buy them
    ive probably worked on more 3sgtes than cars both of you have driven
  bud the only ones that escaped being completely thrashed in nz are evos due to holding their value slightly better
  only thing a nz monkey is good at is fucking sheep  go back to doing brakes on 3sgte cars thinking ive worked on so many cars  i fucking hate people from nz
i need to lift my car to change the transmission oil will be doing it in my garage but i only have 2 jackstands    1 put both jack stands on the rear of the car a little bit ahead of the rear wheels    2place wheels underneath rear wheels    3 lift front end up placing the car jack in the middle of the car    4 place set of wheels underneath front tires
  holy shit anon someone from nz fuck your mom have a little banter
  americlaps cant do bants
  did a kiwi fuck your mum or something bro
  brakes on 3sgte cars  anon no car with a 3sgte has 6 stud hubs  so are you a larper or just autistic
        bunch of sheep fuckin nz fuck bois  fuck you and your island
  you salty you cant drive these p plater
  u ok    doesnt matter alltracs are fucking fat and theyre more difficult than even z32 twin turbos to work on
  3sgte block failure is a job for life good one  plus for bonus cash you can also try fixing the why does it overheat problems as well
  this theyre damn heavy      full mechanical awd shits on subaru / shitsubishi / well anyone else really  165s are heavier than 185 and 205 which are both fairly heavy the lightest gt four was just under 1400kg the heaviest evo 1/2/3 was 1250 and the sti was about the same and both the evo/sti made 250 hp from the start rising from there  as a road car the gt four doesnt get a look in against these contemporaries and is more of a competitor to the galant vr4 in terms of capabilities    and win it consecutively 4 more times in a row is  they didnt
is this transverse or longitudinal
  transverse
  i just own one thats fwd  it doesnt drive yet but i already love the car
  the 205st is dirt cheap in some european countries often going for as low as 6k can someone explain why
bumping this thread now and in the future so the prices are inflated by autists buying them
  lucky for you the autism rate in the general population is only 17
  diagnosed maybe
  being born autistic has the same probability as being born a chad
  didnt they get lighter as they moved on im pretty sure the 165 is the heaviest and the 205 the lightest
  yeah pretty much
yeah if i could find one id get it gt4evowrx
  theyre ugly as fuck and overall just big failures worst of all the 90s awd sport compacts
  that thing is aesthetic as heck
  is this your opinion because thats objectively wrong
i have the fwd version the st184 because im poor  i like it a lot though its really well put together
  spotted the wrx driver
gt4  4  i want fake fans to get out of my celica thread
  would love one but then you look at the price aftermarket and maintenance in burgerland and an r32 gtr just sounds like a better decision to fill that niche usually
  id kill for one of these but none closer than 3 countries away
  i wish i could afford to own a gt4 but i have this atm  24l awd  the toyota meme is real
tfw seriously considering buying a celica made before i was born
  price wise it ran against the sti and got mauled fella they sold both new in my country
    3sgte you dumbfuck
dumping my celica gt four /all trac folder
what are the differences between the pop up headlights gt4 and the newer one
  you know google exists    st165 and st185 have pop up headlights    the st205 does not    for any other information read up dumbass its not long at all    
  aesthetically mediocre at best absolutely hideous at worst pass
  t someone with shit taste    its okay lad
  i was wondering because i never saw the older ones on sale sadly
  all time for wheel drive  viscous coupling in the middle  why
  i was wondering because i never saw the older ones on sale sadly    thats because     1 you probably never cared for this car before today  2 they are pretty rare to begin with  3 gt fours werent actually sold in the us  4 they were sold as all tracs here    heres are two all tracs that were sold somewhat recently            also once celica gt fours turned 25 years old they were imported and sold here you can find them on craigslist sometimes and on bring a trailer
  
overpriced as fuck in europe would rather get an audi s2 instead
  im in europe though and ive looked up sales on the internet before
    tfw u just wanna race but they make you give the tourists the ole razzle dazzle instead
  prob not looking hard enough there are plenty of forums europe based where ppl sell their gt fours
  the center lsds goal is to maintain this 50/50 split  oh makes sense
question since modern rally is incredibly cucked why cant we return to groupb style in countries that would host it it was banned from civilized places because of the danger so why not just hold it in uncivilized places like they do with the dakar itd be like podracing youd just have to watch out for tusken raiders taking potshots at your rig and dodge flaming wrecks that get pushed out onto the track     teams could carry firearms too and theyd have to fend off wild niggers every now and then with drone technology it could be extremely televised and fucking amazing     give me some good reasons why this isnt possible and why we shouldnt start lobbying rich russian and brazilian oligarchs to fund it
  because fia
      20070301    impossibly stupid maintenance on this car    you will literally need to replace the engine on a clutch swap
i too own one op
  nice post more pics
    oe cs hood and bumper waiting to be painted and installed once i get my oe a2w ic setup
    the day i got it in colorado was stored in a storage unit for 16 years
  so they have almost nothing in common with the normal celica  disappointing
    16 years of dust
      mine sat for 16 years and only required a new battery fuel pump tires and a new timing belt tensioner to be road worthy again    was about 34 hours of work in total not bad
  what color is that called i love it      god damn      its a homologation rally car buddy
    teal    for extra bonus points my old 165 which got a 246 swap before being sold
fin
    how did you find it
    was posted by the owner on alltracnet  i was lucky to be first in line to get it
  749  teal metallic        i cant believe someone would just leave such a great car alone for almost 2 decades
    story is that the owner was out of the country for that time and couldnt get to the car
friend of mine owns a gt4     great cars but have their own fragile aspects     the seal between the turbo oil and water cooler for the turbo can fail and absolutely destroy the engine
  i have only ever seen a celica alltrac st185 once in my entire life works of beauty did north america ever get the st205 gt4
  theyd wanna be given they sold for about 30 more than an evo where i live
  north america ever get the st205 gt4  no
    looks slow desu
should i go get it
  looks like a real piece of work how cheap is it and how long has it been sitting  leaky roofs are always a concern on those old convertables
  only get it if you need a parts car
  1 thats not a celica all trac  2 thats a shitty fwd celica convertible that is nothing like any of the other celicas in this thread
  1000
i am so jelly ive tismd over st185s for over half of my life never had the opportunity
  thats not a horrible price for a nonawd celica but that is assuming it can run and drive and not leak water everywhere due to its convertible roof
  can always fix it up maybe put a 3mz in it its not like im ruining an actual celica all trac
  maybe put a 3mz  swapping a shit engine into a shit car with shit suspension    ok
  right    
  if you want to engine swap it you could probably find cheaper 5th gen celicas with bodies in better condition albiet with blown engines ive seen blown engine celica coupes and hatches that go for 200400 dollars on craigslist
id swap a k24 and call it day it made mr2s relevant again would definitely do the same for the celica
  probably although the early 90s toyotas were the best looking of the bunch the took a simple aerodynamic design and made it look like a nigger sneaker
  they    the same thing happened with the mclaren p1     although the 86 looks more normal looking than the 93 supra
like this shoe the added colors and lines make it needlessly complex i think the early to mid 90s had the style just right
there isnt a whole lot i would change here
the 86 looks like its balanced more towards boomer comfort
this is just fuck my shit up
idk what happened here
  newest render
  not being able to import them from new  cuck you  cuck you
daily reminder that the st165 is the most aesthetic of them all
  god these were so cheap in the uk about 5 years ago i wish i could have afforded to insure one at the time
  nice the fwd ones are also good
1st gen eagle talon master race
hello /o/ decided im going to stop hotboxing my dads car how do i get rid of the weed smell and any trace of weed itself
  faggot  face the consequences
  thats not what i asked   dont be a cocksucker
  what consequences weed is not a crime anymore    you should just beat up your dad he wants you to
  yeah i beat him up once tbqh but its pretty sad and id rather not repeat that
ozium
  ok in that case just take edibles from now on no smell and they are better for your lungs and a better high anyways once you get use to them
  this also get a good carbon filter or a vape with carbon filter cartridges
  ok op i know its gonna sound weird but sperm is the best weed odour remover  just cum somwhere not visible couple times like under the sits or carpets  it works you can google that
  but how do i get the weed smell out of the car tho     ive been trying that but i figure i have to stop hotboxing the whip and roll the windows down while driving for a while for it to be really effective i guess science hasnt made it possible yet to fumigate a car with smoke and make it smell 100 like a new car again after
  wipe and steam clean the tar and residue from every surface and all the fabric run an ozone generator in it for a week
  better high  highly debatable edibles are usually straight thc i bought 80 worth of 20mg gummies and havent /really/ enjoyed one but i dont have to stand outside in the cold or even leave the comfort of my chair so its worth the hour wait and useless high after consumption
  what car is it might be cheaper and easier to just grab a whole new interior/headliner from pnp than try and clean it the carpet can be shampood
  i got my old accord shitbox impounded because id hotboxed it 3 hours prior after some stressful college exams the pigs didnt found any trace of weed in my car but still wanted to extort me and make me learn a lesson dunno what lesson they wanted me to learn besides fuck your life we have power and you dont kid id spent 48 hours in jail in the meantime the pigs stole shit from my car lost my job and 2 college exams meaning i would had to do another semester and get a new job weed is kinda legal now in my 3rd world shithole got some legal courses with a lawyer fren and she told me my case could go through with the supreme court and that i could get back my car tho the pigs already completely dismanteled it because jdm partzz n shiet dirty fucks some neetbux due to the fact i wasnt doing anything unlawful even by the past laws and that affected me in my way of life and a permit for legally growing as many plants i want guess im suing them gubmints lol
just shit in it
  did u used your car as a bong or ashtray wtf get a good pro carpet wash and evape some mellow berry shit also replace the filters of the hvac system they must be dusty dust catches a lot of odors
  old subaru but no money   i think ozium and not hotboxing the whip anymore will have to do
  whats the last time you smoked in it it will probably go away on its own after a while       weed smoke isnt all sticky like tobacco smoke
sell it and buy him a new one and stop stinking up peoples shit
ozium and black ice trees
  get an oil vape so you can hotbox it with that and it wont smell
  weed smoke isnt all sticky like tobacco smoke  most people smoke joints im sure and its worse than tobacco or weed
  underrated
  most ppl do not smoke joints     bowls blunts bongs and onehitters are usually more common
  leave a few plates full off milled coffee beans in the car overnight
  joints are superior because they can fit inside markers and are infinitely concealable
  well when you live on your own blunts last much longer and bongs are much more efficient than joints joints can be decadent but i find them wasteful unless i have regs
  if you want efficient just do spots
      literally everyone i know only smokes dab carts now either that or one hitters
turn your fan on full blast open all the windows spray new car smell into your cooling intake  usually above your glovebox  afterwards change your pollen filter
  some of us live in the dirty south where cartel brick is still the most common shit and concentrates are unheard of unless you dnm
charcoal cabin air filter gets the smell out of any car
  ozium  its usually spray it and bounce when you get back the car smells weirdly clean not showroom clean but absolutely no traces of any smell you will never have that new car smell without getting a new car    if you are going to smoke in the whip get a vape crack the window and enjoy your high
  edibles  debatebles    i see what you did there very clever
  i doubt you lost too much income with prose like that    fuck me dead
  i smoke joints in my car all the time i always check in with my grill about the smell and she says she doesnt smell it just have open windows air fresheners i also use bamboo charcoal natural odor absorber and a good tip is to keep the joint near the open crack of the window so the idle smoke is still going outside and not filling up in your car
  this    a good small vape pen and all the windows down and a sunroof helps a gigantic panoramic sunroof is ideal a convertible is kino
    what hot boxing  it wouldnt be hot boxing if you did this this is how you smoke cigarettes you vape fags
  i think you might be high yourself  joining you in 35 mins as soon as they kick in lmao
  smoking in general is for adolescents imo adults go edible or vape you can vape the dry herb pretty reliably discreetly now but vaping wax is better with even less odor and of course edibles only have a smell during preparation not consumption but if you must smoke then for the love of spaghetti monster dont do it in a car you plan on driving around thats the first way to get caught in a prelegalized state
  eat a bunch of lil caesers and mcdonalds inside the car and leave the garbage inside air out before hand as best you can spray febreze before hand too smoke a couple darts in there too
more adolescents are actually vaping from wax carts in fact here in california it spread like a wildfiresorry bad taste but i think me and my friends popularized carts at our school because ever since we started selling them last year the school restrooms have been smelling like fresh wax everytime i walk in lmao
  you sound like a faggot

  we do weekly friday meets to shitpost irl and blow off some steam sometimes we touge or cuise too     we typically shit up hard park meets and have a giggle     if theres enough interest i can probably make a official saturday meet might be very late notice because the weather is getting worse   dont forget to join the washington telegram there is a discord but it is fairly dead
daily reminder to check your oil
  i like sodo moto but theres something fucked about the market when those az1s sell for 14k
  
  we could put it out a ways to give more time to raise awareness
    i support a saturday meet wasnt able to make the last one
  just be sure to post it in an /o/ thread im one of those that does not use telegram
hey 323 guy wanna race
  make it happen plz
  i know there are a good number of people on the telegram however a lot of people lurk here exclusively and if we could do a collab meet we could have a pretty strong showing    is there a good person to coordinate with
  if youre the fucko with the white si you can piss off

  where do these meets happen the weekend meets i used to go to arbitrarily stopped about 6 months ago
  stop
  when we meeting and tougeing again  looking forward to the next meet i only see the posts in /o/ i dont get to know about all your past weekly casual meets that get posted on telegram
  when we meeting and tougeing again washington senpais  the holiday weekend is probably out but what about the next weekend
  no
  what are the ideas on telegram for the next meet
  join and find out fren
feel dumb for asking this but do we need to own a specific make i own a 88 325i and will be getting my licence in a month and a half i would love to meet with other car people
  everyone is welcome
  do we need to own a specific make  all kinds of cars have shown up in the past you can take a look at archived /o/ meet threads at places such as        the archive thread above has some links to other past /o/ meet threads
  you a nuke
  when we meeting and tougeing again  if you like using king county parks parking tables facilities and trails during meet trips then its time to fill out the king county parks survey which continues thru dec 07 king county parks are not city parks they are looking for more input and ideas on what to do next year as well as streamlining costs and removing features not popular with users king county also owns open spaces which can be areas with parking and little else but if enough interest is shown facilities may be added to further develop the open space the survey was originally going to end dec 05 but it seems they still want more feedback so it was extended to dec 07    kingcountygov/kcparkssurvey    if youre curious as to where parks are that you havent ever visited there is a parks finder navigation tool at      or you might prefer a basic listing instead  
  what are the ideas on telegram for the next meet  does being required to have a telegram membership to see posts make them the not /o/

  we do weekly friday meets to shitpost irl  havent seen one yet    might be very late notice because the weather is getting worse  the statistically rainiest day of the year has already passed by however the median of the rainy season is yet to occur this has been a pretty dry rainy season so far will climate changes cause this upcoming winter to be drier than last years fairly dry season
  lifesaving bump
  i gots ta know    how does one forget they were filling up with gas and drive off are people sitting in their cars with them on and watching the fuel gauge go up to f and then drive off
  are people sitting in their cars  some people do get into their cars while they wait for the tank to fill then they get distracted by music or an exciting cellphone message your corvette car part has come in pick it up now so they forget about the pump handle and excitedly drive off to pick up their corvette part so they can fix it and get it drivable again
    i saw you at autocross last month hope to see you at a meet some time too
did one of you post this recently
  this was from like 2 weeks ago i think
  this was from like 2 weeks ago  since you guys have been back to the end spot how is that big paved parking lot at the 5600 development road ending spot has any more facility infrastructure been added to that location since the summer 2018 meet
  if i see any of you fags while im up here im pissing on your car
i guarantee id have the fastest car if i went _
  i guarantee id have the fastest car if i went  the fastest car is not the same as the fastest safe driver

out of state transplants get out reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee    there never are enough cicadas around here summer time is pretty quiet
  there never are enough cicadas
  im from cali and live here what are you gonna do about it
  complain about our governor fucking the state up beyond repair by importing faggots like you from commiefornia and colorado    go home you deserve aircraft stripper poured on whatever car you leased when you moved here faggot
  fight me bitch
these threads make me miss living in north bend im so much happier not living there but i miss the landscape and my old friends
  ive had my cpl for years now i dont actually have to fight you id just gun you down in the street like the disgusting californian troglodyte you are
  kek ive got my cpl too but typical pnw pussy wont fight dont come to any meets
  struck a nerve eh you won bro ill make sure to never come to one of the gay meets i havent ever shown up to in the first place im sure youre a hoot at parties gonna assume from the volatile retardation that youre probably a military doofus who couldnt get any further than that in your life enjoy being a bootlicker forever shithead much love 3
  are you actually upset
  no why thatd be retarded
    heres what i dont get about califags they leave their state because its broken as fuck but wherever they move to they vote in the same policies that broke california in the first place    why the fuck do you people do that
  why the fuck do you people do that  because its difficult for some types of brains to connect actions and consequence when there is an emotional issue it also doesnt help that those people arent loyal to the country as a nation but think of the country only as an infinite piggy bank
  think of the country only as an infinite piggy bank  but the seattle city council voted that all high school graduates from the 17 high schools can have 2 years of free community college education covered by the taxpayers that means all the welloff students continue to go to university paid for by parents and jobs but the poor people now have 2 years of free community college taxpayers will cover it    sawant you go girl
  heh  im from cali but just spent the last four years in colorado  neither was my choice tho  living up near deer park for the last few months and i gotta say its about as nice as i remember although the last time i lived in wa was in oak harbor inland seems a bit colder but meh  fantastic roads tho especially mt spokane
  ok just checking fren you seemed a bit rustled also checked
  cuz their personality didnt change
  why the fuck do you people do that  emotionally cancerous beliefs with lack of patriotism coupled with refusal to connect consequences to their actions
  out of state transplants get out reeee
  there never are enough cicadas on tg either
remember fuck california and dont each vegetables

hey /o/ complete retard here basically i know very little about cars and i need some help so i dont get fired   be driving in the rain last night in my automatic 98 civicits stock   hit a bump or some rail road tracks  battery light comes on  assume it just knocked the battery loose because the people who sold me it had a bigger battery in there and it wasnt tied down   light turns off so i think nothin of it  i pull off to the side to enter in something in my gps and i notice my car making a weird sound  think its the engine knocking but it sounds like its coming from the back  shift into reverse to see if anything weird happens and it shifts really rough  i try driving back to my friends house  the lights start dimming and the car is driving real slow and hesitating  i turn off the heat lights radio and everything because im thinking the battery is dead  it stops in the middle of the street so we push it off to the side  positive terminal wire is loose enough for me to remove by hand  we call someone to bring some pliers and some jumper cables  i tighten the cable as much as i canthe retards brought vice grips  jump the car  it starts but the battery light is still on and its still running rough  it stops again in the middle of the street  push it 4 blocks and walk the rest of the way to my friends house  we jump it again and it survived just long enough to get back to the house which was about half a mile away    so /o/ i know you guys probably hate people like me coming here and asking for mechanical advice but im desperate from the events in the green text does it sound like the alternator or the battery is gone im gonna go back today to see maybe if its just the belt for the alternator is loose but besides that whats your verdict i can afford one or the other if its the alternator im gonna put in in myself i have to work at 1 am tonight and its peak season so i have to be there id appreciate the help
  either alternator or you knocked something else loose shouldnt be that big of a problem
  i was thinking it was the alternator which i can afford but if its something else other than the battery im fucked and completely clueless about what itd be the battery light came on and the engine light did too but i think thats because i was forcing it too much
  the check engine light can come on for a variety of reasons even for a malfunctioning sensor you dont have any mechanic or someone with mechanical experience near you who might help you
if you hit a bump it might be the oil pan do you have leaks could be anything could be a broken propeller shaft aswell check al belts and check if the alternator is properly connected could also be a grounding issue somewhere
  no nobody the check engine light was on before i changed the spark plugs       i think its a battery or alternator issue because the lights were kinda flickering and dim and the wipers were going slow
whats the most likely problem
  the check engine light was on before i changed the spark plugs    why the fuck didnt you fix it
  if lights are dimming while driving theres an alternator issue
  or a problem with the drive belt slipping
  i replaced the spark plugs its not on anymore because i put in new ones      thats what i was thinking the battery sparked bc i accidentally touched the terminal with the vice grips and that made me think that it still had some juice
  i wonder if its the battery terminals being corroded too much
  they dont look corroded the battery says 6/17 on the side its only a little more than a year old it was dark and rainy so ill have to take a better look at it when i get to my car the car has 170kish miles if that helps
    its your alternator when the car starts receiving voltages below 12v the sensors start sending erroneous data and other weird electrical things start happening dash gauges bounce around warning lights turn on and off etc since your lights were dimming your charging system wasnt working correctly if you want to save money throw your battery on a charger and replace the alternator or youll end up needing to replace the battery too also the battery light is the warning light for the alternator not putting out enough voltage to charge the battery
  another thing you need to secure your battery properly not only will it bounce around and possibly short but it may start a fire or fly out of the car if you slam on the bakes or get in an accident i watched this happen to a car while running errands yesterday   some guy driving his shitbox down a busy 4lane road in traffic  hits the brakes a few times  some large box looking thing releases from car and slides along road  oh its his battery  fucked up the front of the car on the way out and cracked the battery case  he pulls into a parking lot and dashes into the street to grab battery
it is absolutely the alternator just buy a new one at autozone and have a cheap garage install it it may be something else but messing with it wont be worth the hassle for someone like you op
  how on earth does a battery fling out a car like that no way is a battery going through the front of your car in circumstances like that
    thanks for the advice i need a new battery anyways because the battery is too big for the car      it seems pretty easy to fix so i think ill do it myself because i have like 80 bucks
  batteries are heavy and dense like a bullet when loose they break through plastic like a wet paper bag just imagine a wrecking ball slamming into the front of the engine bay every time you brake moderately hard ive seen it happen in realtime more than once
  i bet it was used because the alternator was on the outs and they hoped this would fix the problem if you can properly secure the battery in the car its fine nothing wrong with a larger battery but if you cant secure it properly you should replace it dont use elastic tiedown straps theyll end up slingshoting your battery into the car in front of you
  thats probably why its a more expensive battery so youre probably right i just hope i can do this myself
  its seeming harder than i thought guys
  even if battery terminals were corroded if the alternator is fine and the car is running there should be no loss of power dimming lights if op is losing electrical power while the engine is running its as others have said either the alternator is bad or theres a slipping belt
  use jumper cables on it and see if it runs good   battery should have 126 fully charged   14 v running get it running remove the jumpers from other car turn on everything if it dies most likely its the alternator yes
honda general  last thread before 4channel edition    toyota sister thread     ford sister thread       honda chasiss codes      zee maps frozen      bump the thread if you see it at page 10    vids  honda euro meet 2018  hem9      last thread      
  how do i join the collage  see pic related
  last thread    
thought i fixed exhaust leak  nope    damnit maybe its the other gasket
  current collage    i think this will automatically get transferred to 4channel from what ive seen with other boards
got that prelude behind me i swear i see this guy every work shift
  you doing the soapy water technique spray it everywhere along the exhaust with the engine running and you should see the bubbles where its leaking
  you know i forgot all about that ill do that next thanks m8    civic bro picked up a tl for 2800 my old sedan thats his daily blew another transmission hell of an upgrade
  comfy as fuck marysville for 2800  thats fuckin steal
thinking about getting a 92 4ws prelude any advice any good swaps to start with or would it be better to build and/or tubro the nonvtec h23a1
im seeing less and less of these on the road is it time to give it up im thinking either 8th gen accord or civic
  im seeing less and less of these on the road is it time to give it up  they are still out there just gotta dig  its like any reliable comfy car after the 20year mark they become stupid cheap and grandparents give them to the kids who wreck them or sell them for cheap because they are old  a/g gm midsizes were cheap  jackass bought em and wrecked them  gm bbodies were cheap  jackass bought em and wrecked them  ad infinitum  dont lose hope anon just look around still see plenty of them around here all the riced mangled murdered out ones seem to have gone
  i take great comfort that there are old motherfuckers driving 11 yo cm6s in like new condish
      how did we go from that to this monstrosity/
integra is kill 2003 accord v6 or current gen civic sport or si
  the cv1 is ugly as fuck but that 20t drivetrain is amazing finally no more sohc timing belt crap as the performance option    the cm was the same kind of way it was kinda ugly but its such a good car with a cutting edge 4 cyl it starts to look good
  the accord has 125k miles on a rebuild and bone stock everything
  si or sport hatch with the six speed manual for sure
  69  nice
  got that prelude behind me  kek
  i just saw one of these drive by on the way home    nonstop belt squeal
  i see at least a dozen of these every day and i live in the heart of the salt belt if i ever find a mint cb7 coupe in black its mine
  ill have to take a photo of me and the cb7 that lives on my street because theyre everywhere
  they were everywhere until around 5 years ago the 6th generation seems to have filled that void now the only ones i see now are base models that look like they were props from some war movie
so i was driving into work this morning going from pa to nyc about 80 miles pretty much all empty freeway shortly after getting on the highway the cel starts blinking and car runs kinda rough at low rpms and has trouble accelerating the day before i had about a quarter tank of 93 which i usually run and filled it to about 3/4 using 87 never really run 87 but was kinda broke and being cheap the tank was showing roughly half when this started i was driving in early before any shops would open and i really had to be at work that day so decided to just granny it to work and sort it out after i suspected that the 87 may be too low octane and figured i would top it off with 93 after work and all should be ok after work i was going to take it to an advanceauto nearby to get the codes scanned and see what was up but that particular one did not offer the service and was the only one nearby im tight on cash so decided to skip the shop top it off with 93 and see if it sorts itself out on the drive home during the drive i noticed a distinct ticking/knocking sound coming from the engine but after a while it went away and the blinking cel light would occasionally just go to solid for a bit eventually the solid periods becoming more frequent but always eventually going back to flashing upon getting back home i stopped at the local autozone and they gave me codes for misfire on cylinders 2 3 and 5 also a random misfire code i figured since the situation seemed to be improving with the solid lights perhaps the 93 was finally slowly getting into the engine
  decided i would disconnect the battery to reset the ecu and maybe all would be well well like an idiot i disconnected the positive terminal first then negative keys were out of the ignition after reconnecting the battery positive first then negative the car wont start at all dash turns on all lights turn on wipers work think i hear the fuel pump priming but starter will not even try to crank turning key just dims all the lights and nothing from the starter i doubt the nonstarting is related to the misfires i stopped and started the car several times during the drive and it was fine i probably messed something up when disconnecting the battery i was about to go to a shop when the car refused to start and ended up not making it before they all pretty much close and ofcourse with my luck its right before thanksgiving so most wont be open until monday
  soooo any ideas i could try to sort this out really hoping i didnt fry the ecu fuel and temp gauge move into position when turning the power on i assume they get their signal from the ecu so if they work its probably ok do different octanes actually mix in the tank or do they separate might explain why the misfiring started after the original 93 would have been used up if it was all at the bottom of the tank and seems to possibly be getting better right about when all the 87 in the tank should be about finished up if it was separated at the bottom get paid tomorrow so if i find a shop open on friday or saturday i will get it to them and see what they say really hoping its just bad gas and a minor electrical fuckup on my part just bought this car recently and spent a not insignificant chunk of cash to get something nice to replace the crapcan i had before
  can you connect a obd scan tool if it cant read any codes that might mean the computer is fucked but dont blame the computer could be just a bad starter
gonna go check out bros tl tomorrow after thanksgiving stuff and also got another friend wanting to sell me these front lcas for 100 brand new normally just over 150 hard to say no and i got the cash     hatchibroku may be ugly but its got such a good setup underneath i feel
  probably the best cm color wish they made more of these instead of the silver
  information i need  what car is it  year make model engine    is the battery dead  did you tighten the battery connections appropriately    is there a chunk sound when you go to start the car    is it silent when you go to start it
  it is a nice color but you better garage keep it or wax your dark colored shitbox because it will get sunbaked i love the look of the red cr2 sports i keep seeing but i know there will come a time where they look like pink eh2s
first time washing since before i moved  thicc layer of black comes off the white with water pressure alone   the paint i did didnt chip off from the pressure    today is a good day happy thanksgiving /hg/
this looks preposterous
checked out friends tl those j series cars are pretty damn quick     mechanically great needs a brake job  paint overall good only rear bumper clear is roasted  radio locked up has factory navigation and reverse camera which is sweet for an 07  lots of cosmetic work needed both front seats are tore up bad and dash has cracks  165k miles    still a sick deal for under 3000
can i be put in collage will reply with proof
  proof
  what did this auto look like before the ugly
  fuck honda and fuck the drivers unless theyre stock racing
would you buy this   id rather get a crv to be honest this doesnt seem to warrant the almost double pricetag
  i like how its riced but not slammed so low you cant use it
  nice paint job
  please tell me you got it like this and youre planning to derice it
  that car is an artifact preserve it
  for the money id rather get an accord touring 20t 10 speed or a crv touring
are baikus welcome itt  the honda cbxxxr bikes are very attractive to me
  why not    i think the honda shadows are dope
  i know this isnt a grom but id ride the fuck out of a little 125cc like the grom    still like my 2354cc though
  get a crv exl  the touring is a waste on that car its got like nothing significant on it    the pilot is just too fucking much unless you desperately need those extra seats
  no faggot im not going to de rice my car for you because i like it why do you give a fuck what do you drive
  tell me more about it is it wrapped i see the roof trim is covered
  year
  my beef with the shadow is how stylistically similar it is to harley/american cruisers in general and has some real ugly lettering on the tank
  okay mate we accept you have shit taste
  bought it painted orange no wrap roof used to have sunroof so its bondod over because last owner deleted sunroof for weight going to repair that eventually as well as new front bumper because this one is cracking turbo is supposed to be making 14 psi but is only pushing like 10 right now so im gonna put in a new one and try for 2022 psi  car makes about 230fwhp right now id like to get it up to 400500 in the next year or two
  post car benchracer
  deleted sunroof for weight  dont give that nigga del any ideas
  tfw i swapped my stock d16a to a si body because i wanted sunroof    i dig it a b series im assuming
im trying to build a post cassette futuristic vibe for my ek think like playstation 1 or older japanese tech in general planning to do an s2k swap and re dye the interior light gray does anyone have good resources or cool ideas on how to move even further forward maybe changing out the console or an interesting way to do my cabin light etc
  sorry forgot to attach pic    heres the general vibe not necessarily these colors
  yea we need bikes on the collage again and i agree with your taste      not the phantom edition  gross      woah nice bike      a debadged shadow phantom edition is pretty cool
  d15 i plan on running 18psi once i get new turbo until engine dies then get b16 or possibly k20 i havent decided yet then ill run full boost
  i tried to wash my car yesterday but it froze over before i was finished
  busrider not benchracer
  or both
wew lads we 4channel now
  beat me to it nihga
  1992 sorry
  step 1 buy hardtop       see if you can get a roof skin from a junk yard and use that rather than trying to fix the mess someone made        1000 dont do an s2000 swap    just do a k swap and if you want more rpm do the valve train    additionally you cant dye the interior light grey unless its already a lighter color to start with
  did you ever get another honda after this one
  nah but i probably will down the road my brother bought a 6th gen sedan while i had that one and recently he bought a gsr swapped 6th gen coupe so theres a couple hondas in the household
      whats wrong with the s2k swap its pretty much the only cluster ive found that would meet my aesthetic idea im not engine swapping    thanks for the tip about the dye i couldnt find info online anywhere about that any ideas on how to get a lighter interior im apprehensive on spray paint but am not opposed
  you like having a busted to fuck r32 body kit
newfag here whats your opinion on the newest honda jazz/fit is it at least fun to drive
ok so i just got into the honda game i bought this 91 crx si almost two months ago and instantly fell in love with it theyve been my favorite cars ive been nutting over for years and years i caught the bug and i went out and bought the cleanest 95 civic ex coupe ive seen for sale 88k og miles so freakin clean picking it up monday im a honda boy overnight and i love it
  i love how it looks replacing bumper next as soon as it fully brakes in half and then going to find something similar then probably painting new one if i can get it to match or if not then paint car
slow night tonight leftovers i suppose
  leftovers i suppose  nice    ctrl f  del    what do we not praise the rex enough dont leave us kek  pic related      3rd gen prelude drives the tail of the dragon  
  what was that image you posted responding to originally
  dels crx in r/honda kek
  its extremely impractical to swap that engine in because now youll need to figure out some way of hooking up a fwd transmission    k swap someone already did all of the work for you    you can use the s2k cluster with basically any engine setup i have it with a b18c1 and it works just fine    to get a lighter interior you need to buy a lighter interior dont use spray paint only use fabric dyes on fabric      i just like to hurt the feelings of people on reddit
does anyone know where to get honda parts for europe i have a 2005 hatch and the body parts are kinda hard to find
is the del sol crash safe compared to a miata is it any better    i heard that its as good as the same gen civic but is that any good    i want a roadster but the miata is too unsafe for my liking
  for europe  how incredibly vague of you
nihgas be stealing other nihgas wheels these days
  why like a place with a good selection of body parts that ships in the eu
  at least tell us which country youre in  fairly sure most american sites will ship to eu but that might be expensive try finding out how to ship from japan not sure of any eu specific sites but perhaps someone else will know
  tfw have seen 19 inch sport blades on 04   based cm with the 5 lug wheel hub

fuck me not hg related but    just had two beetles 70 sb and a 69 put in my yard  fucking 5 vws now    buy some god damned jap shit no one wants a beetle anymore  fuck some one buy a 1g integra please    no updates on the crxs started raining so theyre under tarps
  hg is health general    how is your health
  just to be clear im not touching my engine maybe cosmetically in the future but im leaving it stock because im poor    i dont know if there exists a light gray plastic interior for any panel for an ek please correct me if im wrong
im in the market for a used odessey what yr and under how many miles is a good target any problems i should be aware of   t 6th gen civifag
  get a 2005 oddy and beyond the older ones are either clapped out or the transmission will be about to go
  if you are poor then id say focus on saving up more money    when you got fuck you money then you can start doing stupid shit to your car
  much much better than it was    down to 180lbs and 200mg/dl cholesterol last summer i was 220lbs and 290mg/dl its still high but im working on it holidays are a bitch though didnt eat anything besides a turkey sandwich    doing a lot of fishing and hiking

should i sell my 2009 jetta for a stock 5th gen prelude i am not good with diy maintenance and i wont rice the car
  sellling a reliable daily  you better keep an eye on that oil level but preludes are cool cars even though its expensive as hell to procure
  alright ill just save up for one then youre right it is 20 years old
  the if you own the jetta and put whatever you get selling it down on a civic si or accord sport and have a short loan you can pay less monthly then youre using the money well the cars not gonna be an endless money pit and you can make payments
  this    also save dosh on lower trim levels the markups are insane for comforts your kids will ruin anyway
  6ft 29 yrs old no history in my family of heart disease  i figure its because i spent my early 20s partying and being lazy
199 gas last night  196 tonight    damn i knew i should have filled up tonight instead muh 30      tfw 30 and back and knee problems    though to be fair i had these same problems ten years ago
  tfw gas low at 329 in cali right now
  im mad at that gas tax vote you guys had still california is crazy bruh
  tfw all kinds of suffering going on and im comfy in my little car  we deserve the fires im glad they happened where the insufferable lib white people live
  paradise is red  most of norcal is red if you get away from the coast  breathing in bone ash for the past month    my fucking hips man wiping my ass and it pops sometimes  also muh fugging hairline
  i forgot about pleasure f    but my co worker and i were laughing at the celeb mansions burning    
  im glad they happened  at least 2 preludes died in that fireyou monster      i just like to hurt the feelings of people on reddit  hurrr durr paint your car  no its just all carbon fiber  kek      is the del sol crash safe  del sols safety in a crash is inversely proportional to the number of 6000 lb suvs sold every year
honda gave everyone a m18 claymore mine instead of a airbag on accident  has to hunt them down  jesus fuck
  2002 civic  she was fucked in that crash anyway civics were dinky as fuck until the fa1
    over9kpreludeguy cant compete id rather use that money to build one from the ground up tommyfyeah style this one is too fresh to even drive
  its getting to a point where getting an fk8 and putting it in a bubble for 25 years isnt a bad idea because the value goes way up
if i were to buy a mostly stock sub150k lude or civic of the late 90s would i be able to run her with just basic maintenance or will i have to have some degree of wrenching experience    tldr how much shits gonna be broken
  who knows what price theyll be asking for when the jdm ek9s start coming in probably just under 20k any higher and you can get twin turbo nissans and toyotas      basic maintenance is all they really need but it depends on its history just avoid the autos unless they have a history of 30k mile fluid changes
  just under 20k  its probably gonna be more than a brand new accord to get an ek9 typer
  most liked comment on that in one of the prelude groups was we all make mistakes i just wanna know the story behind what happened 30 years ago to make a dude spend msrp on a fucking prelude in 2018    mechanic homie texted me earlier told me to drop the prelude off this friday hopefully the donor lude is still there i wanna take photos of the car whos soul is being transplanted kek so fucking excited to get a 3rd pedal finally holy shit
  oh hell yea i saw that on the news who the hell cares fuck the kardashians they should have broadcast the fuck out of the video of the oldman coming home to see his neighbors melted in there car        also arent airbags supposed to be serviced every 8 years  just removed them from one of my cars crashed once and they didnt go off        its habbening guys we did it preludes are collectible
bid history of dude who won is interesting also    get outbid on nsxcivic type r 001integras  fuck this  1 bid to 30251 on 11/23/18   wins
  i dont trust my 1994 airbags at all threw the srs computer and harness into the trash    i wouldnt be surprised if the old /hg/ threads helped bump the value up kek      he was determined to get at least one classic kek    something tells me he could have gotten the car for way less money its borderline decent shape nsx money
  i wouldnt be surprised if the old /hg/ threads helped bump the value up kek    literally own mine because pic related kek
  something tells me he could have gotten the car for way less money    yeah thats why i wonder wtf his background is with preludes or was it just he wanted a nuclassic and didnt give a shit past that idea     h22 swapped 1st gen prelude track car project for 30k or            almost fucking anything would of been a better purchase imo pic fucking related
stumbles into the part of youtube where a 80 year old man is inhaling lead vapor instead of using bondo        didnt even know about this shitif i ever shave my door handles
  this is how i shaved my engine bay
  yeah this is dope af watching bill hines and gene winfield stuff now fuck
      so is there any recommendations for new not remann rack and pinion assemblies for my 90 integra automatic mine bit shit today and this is the first honda ive ever owned i dont know a ton about hondas as ive only had this one a couple months always been a big 3 guy until now
love the lighting at this hotel entrance
  yeah thats a dope photo
new to honda where do you buy accessories i want a rear window louver for my civic matchekt alnor eskopf
  you still in colorado damn the one day i didnt check /hg/ this nigga still alive lmao      im pissed cause now ill never be able to buy a prelude again without spending r32 money     guys i have that 94 svx sitting in my garage still which i have most of the parts i need to fix   it externally its fucking nasty and all the sensors are fucked i dont know how it looks internally yet but the timing is jumped on one head non interference keep in mind it ran like that     so the svx is in respectable condition when it will run i want to sell that for the integra fund i kind of want to sell the 99 outback i have for a profit but its been a tank in the new england winters so far    im on the fence with selling both and buying a sixth gen civic hatch after that just because i like working on hondas loads more than these fucking subarus theyre simple but both of mine have 4eat automatic transmissions and the outback has the ej25d which is the worst engine ever made    should i just get a civic out of both of these itll take time but fuck subarus up here theyre all junk
bat prelude is literally a garage queen  ayyyy
museum happy as fuck kek
  rip prelude prices
i was planning to get a new car soon test drove a lot and the civic hatch was definitely my favorite to drive in my price range except im awkward tall with a long torso so even lowering the seat all the way i cant really say i fit comfortably the hrv and crv were nice to sit in still had the lower the seat a bit but i didnt care for driving them the fit is ugly as shit any other options from honda im not considering
  rip period kids dont take care of their shit
  wrong photo
  havent even started packing for colo  now the family wants everyone to move to canada sell all the properties and shit and nah    but both of mine have 4eat automatic transmissions and the outback has the ej25d   oh fuck that shit i had one of those for about a year drove alright cel spun bearing  actually comparing it to an impreza i liked the driving feel more in the legacy    how you doing where you at i always forget      pilot
  i test drove a civic myself the other day according to the salesman the passport and some other retired line cant remember some other bigger car will be reintroduced in february if you need something bigger i would wait till then
  pilot    both too big and expensive
want to buy new civic coupe  nearest is five hours away  is it worth lads
  new one if its a manual transmission turbo model then yes otherwise no the cvt on these is dogshit
  the cvt on these is dogshit  why i dont know how to drive manual
  well apart from the usual reasons all cvts are garbage this one also has the annoying feature of being painfully slow off the line for some reason the highest gearing it can do from a standstill is equivalent to like 2nd gear and combine that with a tiny 15l engine that probably makes 10 hp at 1000 rpm from a stop you can mash the gas pedal and it does almost nothing for the first 3 or 4 seconds and then finally the turbo kicks in and it starts to move i test drove one and hated it and the dealer said a lot of people were coming back complaining about it i looked at manual transmissions which drove fine but ended up getting the insight which is basically a civic with better looks better mpgs and 200 lbft of torque at 0 rpm for virtually the same price as an ext
  did you sit in the accord also go check out an acura dealer
  stupid question then how does one learn to drive manual if he does not already own a manual
  accords over an lx are a bit out of my price range even lx is pushing it
  fuck canada dude im still in vermont basically southern canada    my outback isnt going to last another year lmao the svx engine is out and its all sorts of wrong but i want to drive it     i had two earlier this year one had an ej22 swapped into it but it was wrecked in the rear i should of kept the engine
  ask a friend/family member who already drives manual i barely knew how to drive manual when i got my car but in two weeks i had it down youll learn pretty quick in traffic
5th gen prelude or 8th gen civic si as first car    both make similar power figures my lack of wrenching experience pushes me towards the civic but i tend to like the prelude more plus prelude is cheaper albeit harder to find clean
  i have no strong opinion one way or the other
    does he want too much for this
  my opinion is yes
  doesnt fucking matter what he wants  make eye contact  take 1800  go from there
  iis that your cm anon
can i daily a prelude if i dont know how to wrench what should i look for when buying
  its getting old you gon have to pay for broken shit as time goes
  yes it is i just got her too 6spd with the v6 is hella fun to drive
  damn anon thats looking good
  thanks anon shes at 180k and ive been replacing problems as they come up first thing was sway bar links the old one on the passenger side was snapped off and sometimes when i start after shes been sitting for awhile she struggles to turn over so im replacing the starter as soon as i get one
what the fuck
smash or pass    
  this is amazing
  i think i see cum leaking out of the tailpipe id say buy the car if youre planning on running over protestors with it
    i daily one without issue theres always something small that needs looking at but the car as a whole is still plenty reliable  what should i look for when buying  oil leaks and oil consumption are the 1 issues
  nrg decal  i fucking lost it    we can fucking save it pay a dude in a robe 20 bucks         wonder if it looks retarded from the rear thoughi assume the interior is classy af and seats 4 max comfy
thoughts on the urban ev spy shots the lack of fender flares and the smaller wheels kills it for me    
  poor prelude it deserved better
  im going to assume someone gave a fuck about it at some point in its life being a sh so there is a greater than 0 chance the previous owners know of its fate let that sink in    nightmare where your gay raped prelude is sobbing and screaming you dont know what ive seen michael in kitts voice from fucking knight rider    pic fucking related
  i spent 3 or 6 years with my 01 having factory airbags passenger side deployed a month after my brother had his crash in the thing    full srs em2 is a suicide car       my old 01 em2 survived a bunch of shit pretty decently even with the drilled holes for weight reduction the first owner did though i always figured if i got in a major crash id die somehow or another      implying shoddy inspections ever tell you to change anything but brakes and oil
take my sister to dmv for a driving test  they tell me my insurance proof is invalid  lol wut  go to aaa and print new proof  cm policy is gone when ive been paying it  tfw driving without insurance for over a month
  okay i called them and im still on but they shouldve sent me a new card in the mail fuckers
sad news confirmed b/o/is  my 5th gen prelude has been drinking oil at about a quart every 23 weeks no leaks so my rings are bad or shot  how much am i looking at for getting it fixed
  im fucking howling lmao i fail to understand how anyones taste can be this shitty  and it even looks like the owner is black
  a quart every 23 weeks  how many miles is that  my rings are bad or shot  happen to notice any smoke when coasting in gear especially down hill could also be valve seals  how much am i looking at for getting it fixed  to do an actual rebuild more than what an hmo replacement would cost especially if you need a hone
  about 150250 miles    no smoke afaik only time it got bad i was really low on oil and cel said the cat was below peak efficiency im fairly certain the acceleration has gone down since i got it in july but i assumed it was due to the dying auto tranny with 180k mi on it    hmo  wwhat
  
new shift managers car 9th gen accord coupes probably the best looking of the decade as far as honda goes     inb4 upside down
  both upside down shitboxes
  right side up on google photos and my camera folder  upside down here    fucking 4channel
pls add me back to the collage daddies ty
  what happened to ur red paint m8
  i bought a white si hatch shell in march and swapped everything over its originally black some some dude did a really shitty paint job
  gotcha havent been to hg for a while
  yeah it was a spur of the moment thing buddy convinced me to do it and we knocked it out in a few weekends the rear end of the old car was all fucked up and both rear quarters were heavily dented rolled with pliers and had fifty layers of bondo     i do miss the red though maybe itll come back
  based manager driving that marysville
sup /hg/    i joined the honda team with this decent but shitty ej2 and i hate it because its an automatic but it was 300 should i sell this thing or attempt to go through the massive headache of registering it here in california it has no tags and was an auction car so who the fuck knows what kinda rape im in for
  i mean it was for the best considering the weird and dumb shit the red egs previous owner did before you got it       body and paint dont look too too bad in photo really old car but d series transmissions are pretty much all fairly cheap if your feeling like keeping it as a project or daily    i think thats old enough where it can still be chipped on ecu with at without much issue if project honda at isnt too bad if you really know what your doing unless its pre absorbtion spring 4at which always feels off     if you really dont want to deal with the at and the registration id suggest checking for major rust around wheel wells front subframe and the atf to see if the clutchpacks arent shitted through  any metallic look in atf means pack is ruined and its gonna probably be hard to sell like that
  somewhat rare color  paint in good shape for its age  basically stock    really the only flaw is the auto these things are extremely slow and boring auto its a good manual swap if you wanna do it especially if its the d16z6 i think the ex trim has it other than doing that its an easy profitable resale       yeah it did its job well got me out of the auto eg taught me manual taught me how to wrench and get keks out of it turning it into an initial d meme machine
    i honestly dont wanna put much into it its super stock trans shifts fine fluid looks fine its just sllllooooooooowwwwww and weak id like a hatch with a manual if i were gonna mod anything
  my black one previous pic had that head unit and it was fried internally speakers were beyond done too im amazed people keep the stock audio when it clearly blew out ages ago     looking for a hatch is definitely a better option finding them stock can be hard but i know california has a lot of them save yourself the trouble and get one that already has a dohc swap b or h series really wakes them up even with the block being stock
  yeah this one is fucked too lmao it makes some noises with the volume all the way up out of the front right speaker    im not too keen on buying a swapped one i dont trust other people enough to buy their projects
  yeah i totally get you on the one hand it can be a garbage swap though not much modification is needed to fit a b16 in one since they had them factory in the jdm models best option i think is to get a low mileage full swap package from hmotorsonline and its just bolt in     my buddy has a full b18 swap on the way to go into my old black car cant wait to rip it and compare it to my slow hatch
  whats wrong with owning a coupe      b series swaps for that gen are so well documented online that they would need to be comedically retarded to fuck it up    it seems like youve pretty much made your decision on selling it you might ba able to put a little bit of cash into into then flip it for 23k ish if the milage isnt bad      i gotta wonder how bad must the paint on that old thing be by now
primer gray doesnt look terrible desu
  nothing wrong with a coupe i just like a hatch better  youd have to be comedically retarded  i mean im in california and i want a honda the chances of someone being retarded with an engine swap is higher than not    its a 309k mile car im gonna post it for 1200 the clear is shot on the roof and its got scratches and shit its a beater for sure
me need vroom juice
  year
  13
  doesnt primer absorb water
  the guy used a dip kit
  will add your 13 civic fâm
  did you get my civic for collage 1992 civic vx i posted proof above i dont know if anyone saw to put in collage    pic is   
  good thing about civics is that a bare bones manual swap is just the transmission shifter and pedal assembly you can run a manual swap with an automatic ecu but itll throw codes all day    california goes through emissions safety and all that shit i dont keep my cars registered in vermont for the safety shit
  id say it looks better now than when i owned it he dailied it when he put his coupe in how shop a long while back and made it look great      when i ran the manual ecu on the old civic all i had to do was tie down the shift lock because it wouldnt let me get it out of park pretty funny ran fine after that
  california is an asshole about emissions and how much carbon youre putting out but as long as you have the cats arent putting out too much co2 and arent leaking fuel they dont care about your manual swap
  will add your 92 civic fâm        i missed it when you replied the year my bad
  no worries thanks so much
hey /hg/ theres a first gen accord in my favorite junkyard didnt get a good long look or get any pics as it was getting dark but everything appears to be there the back window is smashed in but it looks like its a recent development    would it be worth the trouble to pull it out clean it up and drive
  1g accords kinda stink 2g4g are excellent id go for one of those desu the 3g is my personal favourite
try to buy 2019 civic coupe  dealership cant find any within 300 miles  wont get any until march  why is this
  ty
timing belt just snapped on my eg this is going to be a fun morning
  praying for your valves bro
  i didnt hear anything catastrophic it just shut down probably 50/50 at this point
  thats good my buddy bought a coupe that had a snapped belt and it was fine with a belt replacement he made mad profit selling it     background red car in 
  whats your budget fren
  what state and what trim level do you want
small penis gang who up
  who up    ayyycant wait for friday
  whats in the goodie bag
    5spd swap on a 01 prelude
  oof how much does that all cost
  1200 i could do it myself for less than half or whatever but yeahi just want it done right hopefully the donor shell is still there and maybe whoevers car is getting the h22 out of the donor also wanna take pictures of the donorrecipients
  i think the price is fine youd probably lose more than 1200 by selling your current one and buying a manual
world debut of the honda passport  meh  but hondas studies showed that people still recall the old passport from the 90s even though it was a rebadged isuzu rodeo although the new passport has that adventureready look honda told us it was about halfway through the development process when it chose the passport name leaving behind all the connections except its name with the previous passport    except its name  wonder if they will ever use the prelude name again
  at least they didnt use the prelude name for an suv think eclipse
  mk3 accord or mk1 integra
  would take either and flip it for the popups i actually want
in light of the gm plants closing ive been hearing reports of employment at marysville honda plant to increase with the speculated demand increase in midsized sedans  just thought this was interesting      i mean its been said in these threads before but with the death of the accord coupe they can just make another coupe off the accord frame and brand it as a prelude     japanese gt coupe market is dead though and the american gt coupe market is in a weird place right now    the market for large and high hp ff cars is pretty dead
is a 97 civic dx at all engaging or will it make me want to die
  marysville built prelude when
  im just north of denver looking for a coupe sport id take black white grey or silver the salesman straight up said as far as i can tell that car doesnt exist in colorado
exhaust leak hunting  find out some header bolts are loose  still hear the ticking under hard enough acceleration    what a fucking cunt
  if youre ever in houston my dealership has one
  im not sure if i should settle for a sport sedan or coupe ex those are the two options in my neighborhood
  exhaust leak hunting  that sounds fun
prime fuel pump  cd player ejecting invisible cd again  turn car off and prime again  idling at 500rpm now  i still dont know what that is but i can recreate it now
  update  took all paperwork to dmv office  original title from 2002 and fucking four bills of sales trailing from when it was donated from the original owner to now me  335 in fees literally more than i paid for the god damn thing  oh you have to take it to a star certified smog check  passes everything but apparently the timing is off thank you that will be 68 please  look around for loaner timing lights  fuck it buy a 45 light  get it home go to sleep  wake up warm car up and check timing  mark is exactly at tdc mark  cant adjust any closer to correct mark  cam timing is off by one tooth  quickly regretting doing anything with this piece of shit but oh well gonna dig into it in the morning
  damn and it isnt even the vtec engine owning a car in california must be hell do they cut any slack for being antique it should be about to be one now
  i dont know honestly im just trying to get it all done so i can stop daily driving my f150 50 miles a day gas is too damn expensive out here for that the timing failed the whole car so i absolutely have to get it taken care of before theyll plate it i dont know if california is the problem or the retards that have owned this poor car before me or a combination of both im gonna run with it though    if theres any positive its a base base model with no power options so at least its light if i decide to swap it i want to swap a hatch but with as much as im sinking into this coupe i might say fuck it itll have that going for it
  no the only way you could ever run a straight pipe in ca is if its a 1975 or older or a diesel vehicle from 1997 or older
ej running soon lads how dumb an idea is a tranny swap car holds a lot of sentimental value
  car holds a lot of sentimental value  not dumb at all
  ricer tow hook already in that bitch
    what u guys think cop for a daily
  did you jump the service plug under the passenger kick panel before adjusting the ignition timing it wont do shit if all you do is rotate the distributor
  hello there fellow ct anon
  no safety inspections here in ca you can register any deathtrap as long as it passes smog       i have a 6speed sport if you decide to get a 10th gen civic the si is definitely worth it for the limitedslip diff and nicer seats alone also the si engine has stronger internals and is assembled in ohio or canada i think and not thailand like all the hatch l15s
  6 speed cv1  damn nihga i like those things better than a typer because it is so cheap at 25k and you can tune it
  oh wait youre in a civic i got the clusters confused
  yep sure did
  sup qt
  the base model civic gauges are so much cooler though second best cluster honda currently makes imo first being the s2kesque digital dash on crvs
heterochromia is cute right
  this picture looks so canadian
  northern michigan but close enough
friendly reminder never go under 50
  im always pushing it to the limit this time i had maybe half a gallon left
  i need every last drop nihga    but i am going to try to keep it half a tank or more because million mile joe kept his cb7 pretty full and his car outlived him
  but my accord has 3 gallons left when the low fuel light is on i fill to 75 and refill at about 10 need those weight savings bro cant be driving with 18 gallons of fuel in my car i just dont drive it hard or turn fast so the pump doesnt suck in air or some bullshit and die
  confirmed timing off loosened up the belt and slipped it off move it over one tooth and reinstalled everything jumper wire in diagnostic plug and set ignition timing    we smogged now boys
anyone here ever bought shit off    the site looks so fucking dodgy like we stuck in 1999
well boys ive decided its finally time get into the honda game ive been looking into getting a prelude preferably a manual 3rd gen but im also taking some peeks at 4th gens any good advice when looking for these specific gens
anyone with clutch experience here i got my engine rebuilt at dealer and had clutch changed while that work was being done dealer wants to charge 1k in parts for clutch so instead i get a exedy clutch kit and instead of using the supplied tob i bought an oem from dealer as well as a new flywheel when i picked the car up i noticed it still had a creaking sound at the end of the pedal when letting off the clutch it made this same sound before replacing clutch which is why i had it replaced service manager tells me he thinks my aftermarket clutch is this problem and suggests a teardown offering that it will be covered if it was a lubrication issue but if its my clutch i pay out of pocket i told him i didnt like the idead and we talk back and forth a few times where he insists he had his best master tech working on it so lubrication probably isnt the issue that bothered me because i contacted exedy and they claim there should be no clutch sound whatsoever and blames dealer for lack of lubrication manager gives in and offers to tear it down free and this was the findings i didnt talk to advisor i just got an email with invoice ill be picking car up tomorrow i cant tell if theres still an issue or if it was solved it seems to suggest lubricating something else why the fuck wasnt everything lubricated if so if not i gotta insist they go back into it right theyve done alot of work for me i bring two of my cars to their dealer for service
  i get mine all the way down to when it turns off when i hard brake  anyone know why my starters going out fifth one now and wont even crank or turn on with push
  its legit
hey fellas just checking if anyone would know how much a turbo would cost in a 01 manual prelude h22a4 bb 6 would a supercharger be smarter i just want something faster not a race car or anything
  good to know thanks
are yonaka mufflers loud becoming a nuisance when highway cruising
hello my corolla has acura wheels can i hang out here
/tg/ here  buy 2019 civic  2 miles on it when i left the lot  two hour drive on the interstate to get home  take it through the carwash to get the road salt off  leave carwash notice smoke coming out of the front grille and people pointing at my car frantically  notice smell of burning oil  local honda dealership just across the street  pull into garage and they spend half an hour looking at it  say its just a little extra oil burning off on the exhaust because the dealership i bought it from didnt do a full inspection  its perfectly safe come see them if i see anymore smoke or the smell doesnt stop by wednesday  dont see any smoke on the drive home  get home open door hit by the burning oil smell  is this true or did they just not want to deal with it because i bought elsewhere i dont really know much about cars
  oh yeah he also said the reason for only seeing smoke after the car wash is because the undercarriage wash probably got some water up under the exhaust and the smoke was just steam dont know if thats true does it happen every time never owned a sedan but ive never heard people talk about it
whats wrong with my old accord    itll like shake and the engine seems to die for like 1 second  it was happening a while back then but stopped usually at a red light  now recently i was going driving and it started doing it again like 3 times then i pulled up to a red and the car completely died and showed the battery/oil lights though neither one of those are wrong however i just started the car back up and worked again  and it worked the next day no problem
anyone ever use the inlinepro adapters this one is a j to k adapter and id love to do a j32 build but the 03 cls 6mt is rare as fuck and if i could use the parts/aftermarket availability of a k trans itd be good shit anyone know if its worth a shit ive got that dead 06 rsxs with working trans and itd make a good donor for a future v6 build    
i might buy a honda element on monday is there anyone in this thread who could run the vin for me    ive checked the catalog for two days and there hasnt been a vin check thread and id rather not start a whole thread just for me    5j6yh28757l005030    i own two honda motorcycles from the 70s if that qualifies me any more all for honda thread
  id rather not start a whole thread just for me  thank you for that  
  sucks these didnt come to aus would be a decent tradie or town car
  dies at idle from low rpm try cleaning your idle air control butterfly valve fairly simple its probably caked with carbon try using crc direct injection intake valve cleaner you basically spray it in your intake while the car is idling on the butterfly valve
    are you sure its a burning oil smell burning oil has a very distinct smell and smoke color what color was the smoke coming from your grille
  thanks a ton      yeah they seem pretty cool to me very utilitarian they really nailed the backseat design you can easily remove them or put them up on the walls like pic related via a builtin hinge/strap supply is apparently low in the us as well though due to low sales
  2002  134k mi  new timing chain tensioner and guides  5200  howd i do
any rt4wd boys here got a 91 shuttle
  5200  not great
  thats pretty good for a low mileage type s people want that much for riced out cars with 200k miles
  not even him but hondas on the west coast are extremely expensive
    tfw leaf  tfw wanted a honda element  but theyre all ridiculously overpriced like 10000 for one with 200000km thats 10 years old  tfw buy an fj cruiser instead  tfw ive had numerous times where i wish i had a big flat open boxy area to put large stuff  tfw fj has this fucked hump where the rear seat backrests hinge into the floor  tfw cant even sleep in it comfortably  tfw wake up with spinobifida     fuck i want something big and utilitarian like a 4runner but compact enough outside like an element but with a proper powertrain like the fj the 4runners are so underpowered even though they use the same engine as the fj    why the fuck doesnt honda make something equivalent and dont tell me about the cuckline
  oh had no idea it was a type s
  whoops forgot to mention that    ill post proof tomorrow when i stick some stupid sticker on it
        im still working on another lude for the motor swap  other lude cockblocking me still i just wanna drive my god damn car senpai pushed it out the parking spot to drive it around the block earlier /
  theyre bringing back the passport which seems like a good 4runner equivalent gonna have the reliable j series and is focussed on offroad    
  any news on the new dohc j engine with vtc
  that the ttv6 acura is supposed to be bringing out for the type s revival havent heard shit about that
  allegedly yeah heres hoping they have an na version as a crate for sale thatd be sick as fuck
  sure bud
  it was white but barely visible to me at least if i wasnt in the sun just right it also wasnt constant the smell was acrid and really stuck in the back of my throat but it smelt like motor oil out of the can
    the presenter gave me fuckin aids tho
    20 inch wheels  awd  35l v6    this is not competing with the 4runner bro this is a ridgeline with a closed box    holy fuckin shit honda just give up already    offroading with awd is fucking garbage anyone will tell you this
  jason is a very weird dude but hes pretty good at shilling hondas plus he has the only phoenix yellow type r which i dig    really his museum tour videos are the best       honestly id sooner get a 4runner or land cruiser if i were offroading honda does better with street cars
maybe i should ask osg instead but i want to get an itasha wrap for my civic the 2012 in the collage and have already decide to put stickers on it what are downsides to this i live the south but there are itashad cars that show up at conventions around here
  35l v6  its not like the v6 in the 4runner is anything to wrote home about
posted something in the ford thread so why not post my other car here its an 09 civic lxs i use it as a reliable daily
  heres a pic for the collage
theres a dealer near me best coast with a gorgeous white 2018 civic si with about 1k miles on it for 24k sticker im in love what should i know br/o/s
  will add fâm
made a thread but maybe you guys will know the problem better     hey /o/ complete retard here basically i know very little about cars     be driving in the rain last night in my automatic 98 civicits stock   hit a bump or some rail road tracks  battery light comes on  assume it just knocked the battery loose because the people who sold me it had a bigger battery in there and it wasnt tied down   light turns off so i think nothin of it  i pull off to the side to enter in something in my gps and i notice my car making a weird sound  think its the engine knocking but it sounds like its coming from the back  shift into reverse to see if anything weird happens and it shifts really rough  i try driving back to my friends house  the lights start dimming and the car is driving real slow and hesitating  i turn off the heat lights radio and everything because im thinking the battery is dead  it stops in the middle of the street so we push it off to the side  positive terminal wire is loose enough for me to remove by hand  we call someone to bring some pliers and some jumper cables  i tighten the cable as much as i canthe retards brought vice grips  jump the car  it starts but the battery light is still on and its still running rough  it stops again in the middle of the street  push it 4 blocks and walk the rest of the way to my friends house  we jump it again and it survived just long enough to get back to the house which was about half a mile away    so /o/ i know you guys probably hate people like me coming here and asking for mechanical advice but im desperate from the events in the green text does it sound like the alternator or the battery is gone im gonna go back today to see maybe if its just the belt for the alternator is loose but besides that whats your verdict i can afford one or the other if its the alternator im gonna put in in myself i have to work at 1 am tonight and its peak season so i have to be there id appreciate the help
  there used to be a supercharger kit jackson racing but its long discontinued cant say i know what a turbo would cost but there are plenty of people who have done it already how much power are you looking to make      it was white  cant comment on the smell but burning oil isnt white my prelude throws off a good bit of steam from the hood/grill when i drive in the snow because my header doesnt have a heat shield but i wouldnt expect nor have i experienced that sort of behavior from a stock honda call the dealer up and complain until they do something for you any local dealer should be able to take a look at the car for you since it would be a warranty issue if theres something wrong      what are downsides to this  if the car is your daily driver expect a lot of negative attention and a good chance of vandalism the cars at conventions are probably show cars that dont get parked at the grocery store
  sounds like the alternator and then you probably fully drained the battery get one that fits you dont want a loose battery
idk man its seems all to fishy that a oil company is sponsoring something that will cuck them  its like cars 2 irl
heres the meme i thought would dd light to the subject
  ultra low sulphur electricity
  this video explains everything  
original original /hg/ thread post edition    h/o/ndur general  shitbox appreciation  lawnmowers  more torque in my lugs than muh engine    looking at buying a honda post here and well tell you our elitist opinions    need help identifying a chassis          vids  ef vs trueno touge    20 minutes of angry bees    hondafags at the temple    learn to hate crx owners      collage nigga post that shit
i have 6k to spend what yearmileage civic or accord should i buy
  0307 accord if you want a nice dd rsx type s if you want something sporty
what do yall think about this prelude    i know a little about maintence and driving but would like to get more into driving and working on cars would this be a good starting point or do yall have any other suggestions kinda looking for something sort of sporty with room to be improved on
  904 here been eyeing her for a couple months theres a reason its been up that long just sayin
  can i daily a 5th gen prelude without the need for a backup transportation also should i get one if i really dont know much about wrenching i only do small stuff like reluctantly change my fluids and filters want a fun car but i dont have enough saved for an 8th gen si and miata is too unsafe might get a mazda 3 still dont know
  good starting point but they want too much for a prelude that has quarter rust
  call the dealer up and complain until they do something for you   what kinds of things does a dealer typically do for a new car showing these problems assuming there is a problem
  youre the worst /hg/ op ive ever seen
is there anything to look out for with automatic 00s civics does the 3k civic meme actually hold weight
  rsx type s if you want something sporty  its fun
  tfw i should have bought one when i was in the market for a another car
tired of silent driving  oem radio shot   go to walmart buy shitty 20 bluetooth radio  buy 4 new speakers   pull interior panels apart only to discover that not only does the car not have rear speakers but only the sony speakers i bought would fit in the doors not the pioneers  you apparently have to use the speaker buckets in the doors but the pioneer speakers have too much of a lip to fit in the buckets   finish up radio and front doors  no hardware to do rears but wiring is there  rear shelf is wrong shape for speakers  end up with this  oh well got tunes now
ive got good and bad news     good news i installed a remote start on my 2009 fit    bad news the tpms light came on a couple days ago think my two front ones are bad
  i hope you didnt actually pull the front door panels apart the speaker grilles do pop off by hand
is there a car in united states that nobody wants to buy
  is the light flashing or on solid iirc if theyre not flashing its just low pressure flashing means a bad sensor       i sure as hell did i didnt know that also special fuck you to those little retainer clips on the manual window crank handles
  2002  134k mi  new timing chain tensioner and guides and valve clearance checked  5200
  dis some old school /hg/ shit
  oh shit you even posted my cars kek
  cries in monthly payments
  yeah its a feature i dont see in any cars or even other hondas with the door open just grab the bottom of the grille and pull     my cx eg hatch also had wiring for the back speakers and the clock but didnt have those from the factory pretty nice for upgrades
  i understand your pain bro   i put a new system in my car this weekend   bought new buckets that claim to fit  oem wiring harness pigtails as well  go to swap it  the fucking wiring adapter spade ends are one size too small  spend too much time fucking mangling them  theyre on there but theyre just going to fall off soon  realize the screws to mount rhe speakers to the buckets are a bit too long and hit rhe door steel  put washers on the screws for the one side  they kinda hit the speaker flexing thing  fuck it put it in anyway and put the door back together  knowing the pain preassemble the other bucket and wiring adapter  realize that i can just grind off the extra screw  put the other side in fairly easily after that  except the speaker is in upside down which bothers me but i cant take the screws out  a slight better job at the spade connector niggering though   think that the washers are going to damage the speaker eventually on the other side  cant be fucking bothered to take it apart again  need to solder the factory head unit adapter to the bt amp board  forgot soldering iron and solder at other place   find some acid core silver bearing solder for plumbing   heat up a screw driver with a torch  actually works better than expected and get some decent joints     i should have just taken the 120 i spent on all that shit and bought a decent bluetooth speaker and stuck it to the fucking dash
tell me why i shouldnt buy a 2018 civic sport hatchback with a manual for 22k sticker
  because you could get an si for the same
  yes and id get the si in a heartbeat if it came in hatchback flavor those fastbacks look sexy as fuck my dude
  trust me i know but i traded my 17 si for a type r the radio and improved turbo/internals are so worth getting the si over the sport now if you really want a hatch the r is the only choice
  into the wallpaper folder that pic goes    restoring junk yard leather seats for my 2001 bb6 honda prelude      dem feels when you find a half decent non eceleb wannabe channel yeee
  a shame really though i dont think itll take much to get si power out of the hatch a tune alone brings the power to just past the stock si numbers throw a few parts at it and youre golden     the coupe should have been a liftback at least like the integra/rsx trunk doors are stupid tiny now
should i get this  
  that same tune w full bolt ons gets you to r levels on an si
what is the appeal of hondas
  yeah why not try to heckle the price down 7k
  wait the sport hatchbacks are 22k sticker    seriously why dont they make the hatches in si form i dislike the coupe and the sedan si the sport trim doesnt come with the nice things the si has
    you know its classic /hg/ when i pass out just before i get halfway through the bottle lmao
be me  plan on working overtime to save money  need car for uber/lyft this week  saturday ac fan starts rattling more than usual  today the blower motor goes out  why does car repairs always happen at the worst of times
  also pictures from phone wont post correctly reeee
  can i daily a 5th gen prelude without the need for a backup transportation also should i get one if i really dont know much about wrenching  h22/5 spd is a fun car and can be a daily only thing is the h22 and gearing make it a thirsty engine mid 20mpgs usually  just get a base mt car and you will enjoy it atts can fail and cause a cel lamp ats of this era were hit or miss
  is there anything to look out for with automatic 00s civics  only big thing i can remember is they made the dipsticks too small so they leak atf all over the engine bay ghetto fabulous fix is to duct tape the plug to make it fit better honda updated the part but some owners claim the new part was just as bad some claim the civics had the same at problems as the accord/preludes of the era
  current collage
    how do i join the collage   see pic related
got in a car accident this morning goodbye to my 07 civic i loved him so god damn much
  f    hope insurance gets you something cool family
  who knows where the fuel pump relay is on a 2008 civic its a no start and i think this is why
not technically honda in america but im looking into teggys with the jdm front bc holy shit is it pleasing anyways i found a b16a swapped integra with the jdm front end for 3k but its a sedan and i think the rear is the ugliest thing to ever happen to honda on the sedans thoughts/advic eon what to do pic related
  ive always said 4door dc2 should never have been made theyre abominable im glad they didnt make a 4door dc5   i fucking love integras tho hold off until you can get a 2door imo
  kek theres a 4 door teg that lives near my mailbox and that booty with that front clip is the weirdest thing
serious question why are hondas so slow
  you try being this thicc and being fuel efficient
  ugly piece of shit    fuel efficient  lol who cares poorfags
  theyre economy cars man
  so what youre saying is theyre just a japanese knock off of hyundai
  nah
  im trying to dial back my duringtheweek drinking    getting too expensive buying a 175 of whiskey every week
  drinking is dumb    expensive  makes you feel like shit  keeps you from getting shit done
  just the posers in their single cam civics kswapped crxs and eg civics are pretty quick magne   i like hondas for the handling and driving feel more than anything desu
bout to write my final essay for english 121       topic why the 0307 accord is the best car ever made
  this having a glass of wine after a long day is pnice tho
  previous owner had to be a monkey idiot to kill the chain in k series motor i worked for an independent honda shop for 3 years and came across faulty chain twice and in both cases fault was a result of lack of oil changes for 60k and 80k respectively
before and after image of first attempt to mend weld and recoat part of the undercarriage  not the best photos    question should i just spray some on a paint stir and wipe it onto the exposed metal or should i go back and mask everything and spray the spot again      i drink wheat beers almost all week long these days   alcohol is getting way too costly      i hate when people do this  its really common on r series and j as well too   why the fuck do people go without changing their oil for so long
gm killing off 6 sedans to shift production to suvs crossovers and trucks  ford killing every car except the mustang  chrysler following the same trend  another journalist from detroit calling on toyota to kill off most of their cars including the 86 to make way for hotter suvs  mfw    i just dont understand why americans have such a boner for pigfat suvs they are more expensive and handle worse than cars have worse aerodynamics more expensive tires etcfor what more space so you can haul your wifes son around most of the suvs i see on the road only have one person inside them
    we live in the time were used cars are cheap because no one wants them and aftermarket parts are of fantastic quality cheap and readily available on the internet    this is the shitbox era son
  you realize suvs and crossovers are a world trend right even in europe they are the fastest growing vehicle segment with the 5th and 7th best selling car in europe being crossovers/suvs the only difference being the us buys larger suvs and europe buys smaller ones because of displacement tax
the only american company even still showing interest in sedans is tesla   yeah pretty shit time desu
  my point still stands regardless of what geographic region you are looking at the only good explanation ive seen is from another thread that blames literal boomers who need to be comfortable as they ruin yet another thing
its about women and basedboi inferiority complexes they need a high driving position or they feel intimidated and scared so they buy cars that put their eye level six feet off the ground a crossover doesnt actually have any more utility than a hatchback what it has is the ride height to feel controlling and powerful important in the lives of the meek and powerless
  because they need larger vehicles to haul their fat asses around in along with their pig wives and disgusting fast food eating progeny
  i agree my smol low cute miata a best
  man who cares what other people drive i already got my chevy sonic mini sedan and its not like all the ones they already made are gonna disappear and you can still get a miata sedan or whatever
  ignorance is not bliss anon when the global economy makes a trend out of wastefulness inefficiency and narcissism you should be concerned you should be fucking angry eventually other peoples poor decisions will affect you because our planet is finite in resources and space
suvs are now what land barges were in the 70s shit will pass eventually
  its a crossover its not gonna change the fucking world
  t knows nothing of globalization and raw material flows
  i just dont understand why americans have such a boner for pigfat suvs they are more expensive and handle worse than cars have worse aerodynamics more expensive tires etcfor what more space   suvs are classified as light commercial vehicles so they have fewer efficiency/safety restrictions than standard family cars like hatchbacks and sedans that makes them cheaper to engineer so us car companies started pushing suvs as family cars all the way back in the late 80s convincing people that they must have an suv for safety even though suvs have worse crash safety then standard road cars because theyre exempt from the same rules  if we closed the regulatory loophole and counted suvs as family cars cafe/crash averages would plummet and manufacturers would drop suvs like a fat prom date and start pushing sedans and hatchbacks to bring their averages back up
  replacing useless fwd shitboxes with glorious rwd v8 trucks     whats the fucking problem
  im pretty sure 80 of parts you see on rockauto and amazon are cheap shit chinesium parts i advocate for people to repair their own vehicles but to buy quality parts and not some cheap knockoff made of poor materials
  if your vehicles is older than 10 years the parts arent oem regardless of where you get them
  in europe cuckovers are poular too just the smaller ones which are literally lifted hatchbacks with 14l engines  simply because people believe them to be somehow more luxurious/comfortable than their hatchback peer
    who le cares xddd    youre part of the problem
  more expensive  less fuel efficient  takes up more space in our already overcrowded traffic infrastructure    retard
      this pretty much whats really annoying is that this is entirely a function of gas prices despite marginal increases in fuel economy i think some crossovers get closer to 25 or 30mpg now    its absurd though if gas ever gets expensive again people will complain about suvs like they did post 2004 and small hybrids and shit will be all the rage again     its ludicrous these companies could easily make 80mpg sedans but they refuse to
  sweetie suvs got 1418mpg back when gas was 5 not 2530
  more expensive  trucks are cheap if you get them in a poverty spec  less fuel efficient  full size v6 sedans are pigs on fuel and drink as much as a crossover which drinks as much as a v8 truck small turbo engines are memes and drink fuel like a v8 when you put the hammer down  takes up more space in our already overcrowded traffic infrastructure  thats only an issue in third world shitholes developed nations have space for slightly bigger vehicles
  this is why im going to buy a miata and give my money to the one car manufacturer that still cares about me
  developed nations have space for slightly bigger vehicles    confirmed for having never lived in the northeast or atlanta fuck atlanta btw
  why would i want a poverty spec vehicle why would i want a full size v6 sedan why would i want a truck when half the vehicle is a hauling bed that i dont need i need a commuter vehicle that gets good mileage to get me to my job and occasionally seat a few of my friends a compact car fits this purpose perfectly everything about your post is wrong  third world shitholes have more space than first world cities because they have less cars occupying roads and highways
  doesnt one of the german brands offer oem parts for all their cars back to the 1900s
  dude youve never been to america obviously outside of the major cities there is nothing but open road in every direction
  when did i say i lived outside of major cities there is no jobs out there unless you work in some blue collar manual labor position shoveling horse shit or pumping oil all of the wealthiest sectors are concentrated in specific areas
wah wah wah suvs who gives a fuck youre assuming that suvs will always be popular they will inevitably lose popularity in a few years time and then another form of car will take their spot
  your reading comprehension is shit
  ford killing every car but the mustang  last time i checked fiesta focus and some more where still on sale and doing reasonably well
  then you clearly havent looked at any news theyll all be dead by 2020 no focus no fiesta no taurus just mustangs crossovers and trucks
  protip thats because thats what people with money are buying dicksuck  its losers who buy and mcguyver old shit cars who are bitching the cars are going away everybody else is busy buying the products they want  why the fuck would they manufacture shit people arent paying for
  its too late women now associate being high up in a car as being above others socially
  porsche will make any part for any of their cars again as long as you pay up
i just want my wagons back bros
dont forget    storied legendary car brands are whoring themselves out by making suvs including lotus lamborghini and even fucking ferrari
    pretty much everything now is made of chinesium its just marketed or assembled somewhere else to appear not to be
  lotus sure but lamborghini and ferrari have been making status symbols for badgewhores for decades its not surprising
  local autist upset that companies that exist to make a profit are attempting to make a profit    how dare they anon how dare they attempt to get a slice of that free crossover money theyd get for slapping their badge on a cuv where do they get off trying to fund their supercars with their own money dont they know theyre loss leaders theyre supposed to burn money not make it
  hell yeah im upset  i dont want this crap  i shit on their profits
i honestly didnt get the love for higher seating positions until i bought an old beater suv    its actually nice being able to see more if youre higher up i get it now
  this and women are the ones actually making the majority of new car purchases    oversized cars  women  socialism  women  refugees that any man can recognize as cowardly men fleeing their country instead of fighting for it  welcomed by women    estrogen was a cosmic mistake
  socialism  women
    tfw mazda is the last jap company doing it right    todays announcement actually impressed with the mazda 3 countless engine options offered 25 l and experimental skyactiv x being desirable manual tranny and finally will offer awd      wouldnt surprise me if that 25 l gets turbo for a mazda speed edition
  mazda  best selling model is cx5    mazda3 is nice but most skyactivx engines will be found in the noses of crossovers
  thank you for posting the best explanation in thread once again fucked up policymaking is to blame
  agreed ive never owned a mazda but they are becoming more attractive by the day    dont forget that 80 of the population is retarded
  source
  their suv is still more popular than their sedan
  buying  its not buying if the bank just lets you have the car on the mercy of your money rolling in to make the payment once a month
  developed nations dont obsess over cars like a horse over a carrot on a stick
  people hate sedans for some reason everyone wants a wrx hatch or wagon and i sometimes feel like one of the few people that likes the sedan
  because ford only actually sells the focus and mustang if people bought the fusion and taurus they would sell them the taurus had so much potential especially the sho just couldnt justify that sticker price however in the pnw im seeing them rot on lots ill be taking a close look for sales i see 16s brand new on lots daily
  more space   most cuckovers dont even have more space than the equivalent sedan   there is more space in a corolla than a jeep liberty let alone a nissan joke
  its way easier to load a bike golf bag or your kids bullshit into a crossover vs a sedan the stupid fucking deck lid makes loading shit a pain in the ass      an f150 is just as quick as the sho yet way more versatile thats why law enforcement and the general public prefer them over the taurus sedans
  idk why you care were you buying corrolas and ford fusions no fwd shit boxes are dying and getting replaced by tall fwd shit boxes     who gives a shit what stacey finances and chad leaees     lotus is almost bankrupt because nobody wants your car and apparently you dont either bc you wont buy one
  you know absolutely nothing about car repair you dumb fucking nigger kill yourself asap
  fuel economy standards are dumb as fuck but safety ones should be universal i need a three row vehicle for my five kids and i dont care if it averages 20 mpg instead of 30
  atlanta sucks because of large vehicles   no it sucks because niggers
  living in the biggest metros  owning or needing a car  wut
    needs commuter car  lives inside major city where there is likely plenty of public transportation and can walk if he is too poor  complains about overcrowded traffic infrastructure
  chevy kills the fucking impala   brings back the blazer  its fwd and not a body on frame
  voluntary shares space with violent loud dirty assholes    car please thanks
   thing is the cars are selling reasonably well too its just trucks and suvs sell better and have better profit margins so ford is making this short sighted decision for the shareholder jew
  reasonably well too  not good enough any car line that merely makes some profit is actually a loss in the long run those workers employed on making that car have pension plans that will keep on costing money long into the future many also have retirement medical plans that will keep on costing into the future especially if they are married as spouse is typically covered too so any car line must make enough profit such that those future costs are covered
   killing off 6 sedans to shift production to suvs crossovers and trucks  thank soccermoms my dude
  most americans are too fat to ride in a sedan my roommate wont go for a ride in my ford focus if i offer because there isnt enough space for him to sit comfortably
  (((journalist))) they are pushing to eliminate the idea of affordable coups and sedans in favor of raising the barrier to entry via costlier products    it also eliminates automotive racing pride in ownership etc    it also provides fuel for the fire on the gas crunch but the agenda is being killed by electric    i can go on but this is 100 about taking away the common mans mobility and independence
  i used to be a truck guy but now driving one just got fuckin boring after all these years i want my camaro back
  to go off topic a bit why is it that fcas piles of dogshit cars rank worst in crashes its bad enough that they rank the worst in reliability
company memo says theyll no longer be purchasing import cars to be used as company cars due to public appearance  already drive a pathetic ford fusion  cant imagine how shittier my daily commute will be in another american car
  what truck a tacoma
  daaaamn fusion  bro you are so lucky to be driving ecobeast slaying most imports while comfy and connected thru mysync
  a fwd sedan is basically the worst of both worlds though which is what 90 of them are
  its because the cost of manufacturing new vehicles has become so expensive most regular people cant afford to buy something that cant do anything and everything  and so manufactures cutting cars to make cheaper suvs which is pretty much the only thing that fits the bill    just wait 10 years or so when no one can afford new cars at all and brands go bankrupt
  dude im 63 and 400 lbs and i fit in my vw gti just fine
  single cab shitverado
  rwd trucks  wow great cool thank you so much this is so much better wow
  then just make hatchbacks and wagons instead the crossovers are overkill
  they still look like shit
  this everyone wants the new shiny right now due to market getting flooded older jeeps trucks and suvs are starting to struggle with keeping their value people dont want cars anymore so their easy pickings too scrap prices are low too
  you dont know anything about car repair  anon hes not wrong
  scrap prices are low  exactly found a manual transmission for a volvo p80 chassis for 80 with 87k on it scrap yards are well hidden gems that ordinarys will never set foot in
  when was the last time someone gave a single fuck about what the company car is besides some boomer wants to make the brand image better by purchasing american ecoboxs if your company cant buy entry level luxury cars for your company car that company probably shouldnt have company cars to begin with
  he meant the price of scrap iron and aluminum what the bare metal is worth
  if the their central technology batteries are produced in china then is it really fair to call teslas american
  npc nipshitter tripfag literally seething he cant drive his shitty soulless gook econobox to his cuckshed  lmao
  when lithium is the primary component is it really fair to call it a battery
  youre wrong but thats okay
  thinks cuckbacks and fagons look good  youre retarded but thats okay
    in ausland 4 of the top 10 sellers are body on frame utes including the top 2
  that could be why i dont see as many suvs in the country they are mostly used by people who are stuck in city traffic i recently took notice of the cars that ive seen over the past few weeks and a pretty small percentage were suvs but i think it because people are keeping their cars longer now i think a lot of the popularity is that advertising has convinced women that if you have children that they are necessary
  because theyre garbage
  thinks sedans look good  i can do it too retard
  lmao spotted the asshurt cuckback/fagon driver
  spotted the buttmad baseddan driver
  shitbox era was 20 years ago
  the poor little fagon driver got cucked by the word filter   chadans are based arent they
  by volume most of the battery is polymer
  you seem really bothered by wagons did a wagon driver cuck you
  only faggots and women buy suvs and weve already established that women were a mistake
i just want a 21st century amc pacer with a four pot turbodiesel and a cvt trans is asking too much
do second gen forester count as suv
  well maybe dont get a wt next time
  the reason automakers arent making an 80 mpg car is because nobody would buy them buyers are convinced that they need overweight and lifted blobs with awd and automakers can charge more money for them
is the car scene racist in your country
  its ok to hate shitskins
  they should fuck each other i bet it would be amazing sex
niggers
nobody likes lebos  not even lebos
  yes  its full of turks and other muslims/minorities who dislike the native population
  this  hatefuck now
  yes indeed    a bunch of shitskins with riced out jap and euro cars
  this fucking thread is still getting bumped  this is why /o/ is a lowtier board
bunch of shitskins with bmws and the occasional leased benz so sure
do some cars actually not start back up if you flip them
  yeah flipping the engine has now put oil where oil really shouldnt be could fuck with the spark plugs easiest and burning it off could easily clog the valves depends on the car but if left flipped for too long it could definitely have its issues
  some older cars also have rollover sensors that have to be reset before the engine is allowed to start again but if its upsidedown for less than maybe 35 minutes and not running it should start back up with some smoke but no real problems after if the car is still running while upside down its probably fucked unless its a jeep 40 the oil pickup will be above the oil level and will lose all oil pressure to bearings
driving anything other than a toyota  you people deserve this
  driving nipshit  lmao
  wtf how do australians drive then
  the oil is upside down too you dumb fuck
  are you some kind of special stupid    if you had any automotive knowledge youd know that down under they exclusively run vegemite as engine lubricant and due to its consistency it does not really drip and thus can be safely run upside down
  australians havent invented automobiles yet    christ they only discovered electricity in 2011
  yeah when i was visiting i saw some aussie open his drain plug and start sucking the vegemite out and scooping what was left on toast
  many of them still do not have toilets inside their homes    that is because you drive shitty holdens try using anything other than marmite in a rollsroyce and see how far down the road you get
    if left on its roof for a long time oil can make its way past the piston seals and into the combustion chamber ive seen older high mileage engines hydrolock because a cylinder is full of oil
  well if you use carbs your engine is probably covered in fuel if its not covered in oil then if your battery is not sealed and leaks it probably loses enough sulfuric acid to not be able to power the starter    but plenty of older cars rolled over and then were driven home so it depends
  worse some explode after a while
    australia is a fucked up place
  no one has ever rolled a toyota
  roll over/auto shut down relay when your upside down the last thing you want is 20 gallons of raw fuel flooding the engine bay
  tip it back over itll be fine noone will notice
  still do not have toilets inside their homes  putting a toilet inside your house  wanting your house to smell of shit  this post reeks of an indian
  shhhhh leave it alone its sleeping
  dont be a retard op   if you hold the left thumb stick to the right or the left it will flip back over
the model 3 performance beats the ferrari f430 and porsche gt 4 it is a modified family saloon and noticeably cheaper than either    is it reasonable to expect 2025 econobox hothatches to beat the laferrari round the track  how about 2030
the model 3 is also coded by pajeets and manufactured by lowest quality automaker on the market  id rather drive a nk2 diesel golf
all wheel drive electric shitbox will be fun   instant torque  no gears
  cope
  i think well actually see a move away from tesla levels of performance but still be in the really fast ballpark
    i agree with this post tesla right now is just trying to show the capabilities with their cars and are still rather upscale compared to your average shitbox    when ev become commonplace they will be more sedate for better longevity and efficiency imo
  i agree no reason to have supercar acceleration in a family sedan it just facilitates the rapid draining of the batteries if the driver has too much lead in his/her foot limit the power output to be comparable to a 300hp v6 and most people would be happy with it and you wouldnt fry your batteries as badly
  you can always just limit it with programming but for costeffectiveness in the future we may see a move towards less powerful motors
  true but smaller less powerful motors would only be a small fractional cost savings in the production of an ev if you kept the more powerful motors but software limited their output then theyll likely last longer and produce less heat than if you just downsized the motors themselves
so i was looking for a 20102014 volkswagen gti all the ones in my price range have tons on miles are autotragic or have tons of sikk mawds     i found a jetta gli with relatively low miles in fantastic shape everything i read says the gli is essentially a gti with a smaller turbo and a less tight suspension     all im looking for is a daily driver thats reasonably fun to drive will i miss out on anything by getting the gli over the gti
  buying a vag cuckmobile  youre better off with a civic si or mazda 3 gt if you want a fun sedan
  i dont want honda boyracer bullshit or a smileyfaced rocket ship
  wants to buy an unreliable vag turd instead the only people i see driving jettas are women and stancefags
  good car but it is quite old but reliable
  how can you complain about stancefags while recommending a honda
   the only people i see driving jettas are women and stancefags  miles ahead of the mouthbreathing incels driving around in civics
  exactly also i wish mazdaspeed 3s didnt look so goddamn stupid
get a tdi
  why
  i have a 2016 gli its okay
the jetta as well as the passat is entirely designed in mexico and if i recall correctly uses a huge amount of mexican only parts for it buy a german golf or look for another car
buy mazda
  i have my whole life  been very satisfied with them
  its the only japanese brand that makes nonhideous cars honda and toyota are utterly repulsive
what if its really a ferd underneath
  id like to if the renesis wasnt so annoying to maintain rx7s were actually available in europe and i didnt have to import the 6 mps from fucking germany
im thinking on buying a 3 mps    anybody knows why mazda doesnt offer them in the new series
  fun dont sell
  if the rumors are true that they codeveloping a new ms3/celica with toyota then i would buy that i wouldnt buy anything theyre currently making i especially wont buy anything with that stupid knocking engine
  new celica  mazda chassis  yes please the 124 already proved that this works beyond well
  it would be on the corolla chassis though
  so it would be the reverse with the ms3 on the corolla chassis  why mazda why
  2017 mazda 6 is the best girl
  rew swaps arent hard
  but im not asian or a 20 something year old girl so why would i
  and can cost up to 4k in labour and parts since they require pieces from both the fd and fc
  hard not to like these cars the new camry with the nonpredator grille looks like itll be a better buy though
will they not rust away now
  when did they ever  inb4 1st gen 3  was only an issue for 2 years in salty areas  otherwise they are on par with the rest of jap stuff  t 1st gen 3 owner with zero rust
fd turbo in usa rare  none of the newer fd turbos made it stateside  best generation mazda 3 and 6 were manual but rusted away within a year  everything from the facelift of that generation on has been a mistake  oddly enough i see plenty of na and nb miatas as well as rx8s around here and i live in a rust belt state
  tfw 95 owner with 0 rust
  they are on par with the rest of jap stuff  so theyre rusty pieces of shit
  fd turbo in usa rare  you realise all fds are turbo  none of the newer fd turbos made it stateside  still see them for sale a lot if you wanted one you would go get one  best generation mazda 3 and 6 were manual but rusted away within a year  dank meme  everything from the facelift of that generation on has been a mistake  untrue  oddly enough i see plenty of na and nb miatas as well as rx8s around here and i live in a rust belt state  k
im starting to realize they arent worth nearly the praise they get
  i already did two of them
  only really requires the rew longblock since the rx8 trans would work the sensors and wiring from the renesis are used no change in wiring what so ever tune it with an adaptronic piggyback ecu the mountkit itself is only 380
mazda is toilet tier
  good contribution
  i thought it was i mean the mazda 3 i own is so loud on the road its bad its a fun car to drive especially in manual but its as loud as my old datsun was
  change tires mines quiet as fug love it  datsun  scum
  datto 1200 coupe is mint gtfo nissan is the scum also i should change the tires what would you recommend
roommate has a 2012 mazda 6 which is actually a mutt halfford     still has plenty of torque and is comfy
  gen 1 speed variant with haldex awd is way more fun

  what type of tires 18 inch
  bridgestone ep422  205/50/17
  i bought a top of the line mazda 3 grand touring s in 2015 with cash from scholarships/working in college when i finished undergrad desu though im about to finish grad and making about 110000 a year and i want a car that is more comfortable commuting/will partially drive for me while commuting im really interested in the new lincoln aviator but do i really blow all my extra money my first 18 months on the job on a luxury suv
  ecopia  can you recommend non shit tier tires i want something half decent
  been excellent tires for me
  but whats it like grip wise i like to flog my car and have lots of grip
  ive had no issues in the canyons and never felt understeer also hook up well in a drag race
  ok ill give them a try
  renesis have the same reliability as the turbo fds they made similar power even when contronted by an na rotary
welli sort of did
seriously considering a used 2017 mx5 club they just lowered the price to 20k my insurance would be 200 a month for base coverage and almost 400 bucks per month for a loan should i do it i love this nd model
  hapa car  based
   ayy lmao i see you were on my thread
  yessir thats the plan
bought an 03 mazda 6 v6 auto for like 800 when my prizm died body is in bad shape but mechanically the car is great for 160k miles
  camry a slut  a slut
  i agree toyota makes a lot of ugly cars but honda makes some good looking ones especially the newer models i like almost all of them
  i have one i dig it good car usdm version though
  pfft only if its a turbo 4 or a v6 otherwise not interested
  lol what honda makes the worst ones awful proportions and design forget about their entire acura lineup that thing is a fucking mess
technically i own 2
they were cool back then when they didnt care about normies and used independent rear suspension  but i like how they look and they dont use cvts or cuck tier turbo engines
  that picture is too cute to say no loading episode 1
auto industry so focused around constantly making shit that breaks down quickly  market system rewards waste instead of offering s few amazingly engineered cars meant to run for 5 decades  auto industry reliant on people discarding perfectly usable cars every 4 years or companies collapse    why is the system like this why cant a car company focus on producing a basic but high quality single vehicle in limited numbers simply to meet demand remaining small and only releasing new generations of their one vehicle when a sufficient tech breakthrough has been reached
  because change is not cheap or easy
  liberals
  would you keep a cell phone for 10 years
  jews
  i did i only replaced it because i got the replacement as a gift and my uncle only replaced his after his carrier stopped supporting 2g
  capitalism
  this entire post is horse shit modern cars are extremely reliable considering the complexity of them as a whole breaks down quickly 4 years what the hell are you driving the latest state of the art somalian automobile jesus christ i have been driving for about 17 years have racked up at least a combined 400k miles on the various vehicles ive had and have had nothing more than routine maintenance and the occasional minor repair on cars that had 100k plus and the great majority of those 400k or so miles was on 10 year old plus 100k plus cars this includes american jap korean and german carstake care of your shit and itll take care of you dont buy used cars from retards and be careful at the dealer too
because if you changed the system now hundreds of thousands of people would lose their jobs and blame the people who want to make the auto industry sustainable for the greater good of the market instead of the people that set up the bloated system in the first place if gm said today were cutting down to 1 consumer sedan 1 consumer truck 1 consumer crossover and our commercial fleet people would have a shitfit even if those cars came with a 500000 mile bumper to bumper warranty      if everyone rode the same car for 17 years like you the automotive industry would collapse its largely dependent on people buying new cars as soon as they pay for their old one or leasing
    honestly ive kept cellphones nearly that long i just have a habit of breaking them since new phones are so flimsy i had my original iphone 4 until a couple years ago i dropped it a dozen times dropped it in a tub full of water for 10 seconds fully submerged the works and it never quit going        its been done look at the toyota century the only major refresh since its birth was the 2018 model when it dropped the v12 for a hybrid v8 otherwise from 19672017 it was nearly same chassis and drivetrain same as some ladas for the last 40 years
  it sounds like you should be grateful for people buying new cars and relish the plentiful perfectly usable used car market
    new sti with the ej207 are blowing engines under less than 50000km the ford 35 ecoboost is blowing up the fiestas are cracking blocks dodge ecodiesel is shit nissan cant build a cvt worth a shit etc    the issue is we perfected transmissions by 1980ish and perfected efi engines by around 1990 all the bullshit since then be it 9spd automatics cvt etc has been to get better fuel economy and new technology suffers for years until the kinks get worked out ie cvt
  where did you get same car for 17 years thing miss the american jap korean german part i trade when i get bored not because the car fell apart thats really why most people trade cars cant blame the automaker for that you really want to drive the same car for 5 decades or 500k miles come on also reminder that capitalism provides the absolute highest standard of living for the average person of any system ever tried and is in fact the natural economic system get fucked commies
  nothing is perfect thats why warranties exist if you are worried about potential reliability issues dont buy the newest tech research what you buy avoid cvt brand loyalty is generally stupid as they all will occasionally fuck up also auto trans have gotten much better since 1980 efi has marginally improved since 1990
  in capitalist economies businesses are created to generate profit rather than to satisfy a need this is a feature not a bug
  so show me some great reliable cars from communist economies

  anon that isnt a lot of driving in 7 years ive done over put over 290000 miles on 3 vehicles the newest of which is 33 years old the only repairs outside of routine maintenance being the replacement of a slipping auto trans that had over 230000 miles on it and rebuilding a rear end after the differential gave up at over 260000 miles

  hella mad
  what is he so mad about
    your miata wont save you when the ice age hits and wipes you out along with all nonfaustian subhumans
  the sad part about it is he was the least musical talented guy killing the most musicaly talented but i guess blind followers would have a hard time to comprehend this since they probably have never listened to mayhem ever

chill out
why would you want to stop tesla  i wouldnt buy one myself but i do want an ev and tesla has been the only thing that actually put pressure on car manufacturers to get serious about them
wait til they start trying to make base model model 3s yet remember that he hasnt sold a single 35k 3 yet and theyre still struggling this hard plus the tax incentive has ended for them too q1 2019 is gonna get real hairy real fast
  do some research man tesla has the best batteries and motors in the electric industry they will never go under  they have become iphone tier with their cars they are set for life now
  the iphone was an immediate commercial success it never struggled like this
  the iphone wasnt nearly as difficult to build which is why theres thousands of comparable phones these days but no tesla competitor
  what are you going to say this time next year when every company on the map has several evs for sale tesla only got a headstart on the market because other car makers didnt think we were at a point yet where full evs would be worth the investment and they were and are right musk like jobs is just a good salesman
  are they going to expand their service departments now
  theyll just show off another vaporware concept to hype their share prices back up
  ill believe it when i see it  i dont believe well get much more than the 20km range phevs weve already got
  while im not exactly arguing about the vaporware thing tesla survives on hype do you actually think the roadster is never going to happen
more normies having machine smarter than them so they wont crash into my car  thanks melon
  iphones can be financed by the poor very easily and is one of the most common phones with poor people while these teslas are completely out of reach of anyone that isnt at least upper middle class
  good batteries and electric motors its a shame the rest of the car is as fucking trash as the muskrat who hypes them at auto shows
  the original titan of the technology industry with more experience developing building and marketing computers than anyone  the guy that made paypal deciding he wants to be bruce wane  seems like a fair comparison
  what is your point the first person explained that it has a cult following like iphones and the second said the iphone was a commercial success off the bat meaning that it was profitable from start and tesla has struggled to meet even their own goals all the time the comparison matters because the same type of people buy them and if musk cannot find a way to make it profitable with such cult followers hell fail   it does seem like things are going upwards unless they did some interesting accounting tricks to turn the recent profit chinese market might eliminate any problems theyll face losing the tax credits
  anything that is brought by the same demographic is comparable  i can compare two things that makes them the same thing  car companies should turn a profit right off the bat  wat

  no title but its ok since its 25 year old car  wont take a bankers check    that shit stole
  i know youre asking 11k for your car but i was thinking 4k cash  hows that sound

  i aint readin that shit retard
  i dont know where you came from with that formatting and god bless bit but the fuel economy difference at 80mph vs 65 isnt that extreme
  jesus fucking christ
  this post hurt to read
  youve gone too deep

on the flip side to lowballing are the moron private sellers asking for dealer prices yeh wheres your warranty snd forecourt mate      weve been traders before whiteys even had civiilisation haggling is just seen as part of the fun of buying and selling personally not my thing but its culture
  yeah thats fine but seriously all the messages were formatted the same  u take 100 doller  ok 120  all the whiteoids enquiries at least spoke in lowercase or used punctuation
  put all this effort towards a 1k shitbox instead of just buying a car with title in hand  wow

  thanks      for      typing      like      this      i will most      certainly    read      that    shit    thanks again    upvoted btw

  this is peak boomer retardation and people who do this need to be gassed
  literally illegal in italy unless its a slow speed/urban road    anon why do you like older cars  why dont you buy a new one  why do you spend that much money fixing her up when you can find something more modern  why are you installing racing seats its not an f1 car  to answer the last one maybe its because my car is a fucking landbarge and i want to save up on fuel
  racing seats in landbarge  okay im going to need more details here
  you mightve seen it mentioned in other threads its a lancia dedra sw from 1998 it weights 1800 kilograms taking out the seats alone lets me save up 150 kilograms since it has abysmal fuel consumption 11 liters every 100 kilometers that should somewhat help
  white halogens are actually based as fuck but i know youre talking about the retarded blue ones good luck to them seeing a fucking blue deer
  11 liters every 100 kilometer  nibba i would kill for that  21l/100km
  its a fucking fiat dohc 18 16v not even outputting half the power it should be im obviously plannin on atleast turboing it so it can do atleast 150 hp/liter
  worse thing is all these fucking normies who offer to trade their fucking outdated used smartphone
  the hgt engine
  what the fuck is wrong with your cars  i need like 56l/100km and my car turns 20 soon and is rwd

  if only 95 of the craigslist sellers i meet werent retarded  is there anything wrong with the car mechanically electrically  no its perfect it hasnt given me issues  go test drive engine shakes like a spastic  oh it shakes because it needs new motor mounts  over and fucking over i swear this shit happened 4 times and if it happened again i was damn near ready to knock their lights out for blowing my time and money another guy had bumper damage that he zip tied like a nigger and decided not to show in his pictures another guy had a dent on their rear fender another guy had terrible suspension that he had ran on for months     oh and there was another retard who i am pretty sure isnt running fake or scam ads i try contacting him for his car doesnt answer phone or text try email no answer check back a few weeks later ad is still up 500 dollars lower local phone number pics look like scenery from the area i live this dumbass cant even put up the right phone number or answer email
  well the title transfer costs about the same at the dmv at least where i live
  not just going same speed going 35 in a 45
  pay title transfer  or pay for bonded title  its the same thing the bonded title takes like one extra step that takes 20 minutes and you can usually get them for 50 less idiot keep grasping at those straws because you didnt know
  thats because they lowered the price and forgot they had the price in the ad
  seller puts up an ad new ad every day doesnt delete old ones  prices lowered one day then went back up the next and stayed up
  craigslist users need to be gassed
  sold sold sold sold 1985 vw fuckabout 500 sold sold sold  car is sold please stop message me
kias are nice cars  believing that a new car is a smart purchase
    fucking boomers and car flippers i swear
  a bonded title can be fought by the original owner 3 years later   or just buy a car with title in hand
  you would think people would respect the box but they think the big giant x on the ground is just for decoration same for the do not block intersection sign      cl has done me real fucking good but god damn some of these goobers  took a real long ride out to pennsytucky to check out some hicks el camino and he had to go inside to grab something while i was looking it over after i got inside and saw what a shitshow everything was no nothing in the dash no ignition just wires that kinda thing i realized that he had forgotten to tell me that both inside door handles were broken off and i just had to fucking sit there until this dumbass came back out to free me  wouldve been terrified i fell into a trap if i werent so pissed off
  is it still for sale
  kek
uber just made it illegal
if nobody owns a car who will drive the uber vehicles
so /o/ will stay the same then
  kek fucking this
  robots
  butlerian jihad when
  uber is literally the elon musk of taxis
and literally every media outlet eats this shit up    personal transport is never going away
greatly reduce demand for cars by efficient robot car services that keep cars moving people constantly instead of sitting parked     save auto industry which goes bankrupt if one bad year of sales happens    wat
  you can have my car if you can pull yourself out from under its crumpled burning wreckage    should probably do that sooner rather than later of they manage to gain momentum theyll just label it an act of terrorism and martyr the faggot
  is that a threat
  butlerian jihad  a fellow gentleman of culture i see
  /n/ here ironicly i actualy own a car besides my 5 bicycles and moped
  yes finally just as all those ecelebs have been saying it for years
  cold dead hands
retards responding to ops made up title  what the guy is saying is he thinks his service will render them not necessary to most people
thats the ideal future for uber so you can light your money on fire using their shit service id rather ride my bicycle everywhere than use uber
its another episode of  detached corporate suits talk about things that will never happen
    so this is how a eunuch thinks
  pretty much  
  a 20minute test in high school  fucking what is the murrican driver licensing process really that fucking retarded
  yup separates the people who shouldnt ever drive from the folks who have a natural talent for maneuvering a horseless chariot    no amount of practice will make you a natural
  thats hyperbole but our driving exam is still a joke
  im gonna capitalize to simulate screaming on twitter because im too stupid to talk like a normal person    every time that i see this post i gain more and more affinity towards someone who wasted probably 15 minutes of their day and wasted thousands of people who responded to this retarded post the fact that there is people complaining about something that was given to us both easily and at this rate the cost of rent makes me estatic that there are retards that dont understand that something as dangerous as driving can be downright safe if done correctly
  no hes just an overreacting beta cuck
  most cars made of fiberglass  i fucking wish
  the way uber likes to kill pedestrians id more likely say uber wont exist in a decade
  driving is a sublime experience  knowing you can depart this shithole of a planet at any moment is a relief  your adrenaline is high and your heart rate is low
  zero fucks given    if these asshats clear up roads with public transportation it just means i have less to worry about when none of the cops are good drivers and there are few of any other drivers to injure when i do a cannonball run through the mountains    and if im already doing something that illegal ill most likely ignore any other law i want to along the way for shits and giggles    fuck that jazz    all sarcasm and anger aside itll simply happen and then theyll all turn around after they jack up membership or ticket fees to the point where owning a personal car is a perfectly reasonable thing to do then people will buy used cars and then theyll want new ones and the cycle will be born
  yeah no ill shoot up every single fucker i san francisco issa joke fbi before i give up my civic to take fucking uber anywhere     tsomeone who was almost killed in a uber
  liberal city fag talks some shit  ill always own a car even if i have to build it myself
making manual driving totally illegal is unnecessary  once all the normies can have a robot much better at driving do it for them enthusiasts wont have to worry about teen stacey in her moms crossover slamming into your classic car because she was sending nudes to her bf while driving    also the anecdote of manually driven cars will mess up the robot cars11 not really the robots will react to everything way faster than a person can and will easily account for a manual driver    banning manual gets you nothing    in fact by this logic shouldnt motorcycles be banned already why arent they
  depends on the state
  its because of those reasons lol
  if nobody owns a horse who will pull the vehicles
  wow you are so smart your iq must surpass 150
  what will happen to the car i currently own mandatory buybacks we fell for that once with guns i wont fall for it with cars
  theyll lobby to make it illegal/tax it more
  after the ai kills all the kikes
  im sorry you cant understand what freedom looks like
  i mean he has a point  there are a lot of people driving that shouldnt be driving and getting a licence is way too easy
  aerospacebolts magically makes the frame indestructible  i dont even
independence is what makes car ownership essential why do people want to depend more on other people
what theyre saying is that if you watch cnn you wont need to own a car because youre mentally incapable of understanding the responsibility associated with auto ownership the people that read reuters and msnbc though theyll still have cars
    youre giving car ownership too much credit the vast majority of people arent important enough to make car ownership essential
i probably wont own a car in less than six months because its becoming utterly useless to me and i could save like 200 bucks a month if anything ill only have a project car anymore
  rely on maintained roads  rely on open stocked gas stations  rely on enforced traffic laws  y u want to rely on people  cars r freedum  america is the frontier
the most independent vehicle is a rigid 90s mtb  change my mind
  live where uber got btfod by taxi drivers union  checkmate
    my body is but a vehicle for my brain and reproductive organs so id argue that i am the most independent vehicle
  not legaly a vehicle
  i will own a car even if illegal  like in that song by rush
  virtually indestructible frame  and self destructing suspension murderous doors and a giant slab of flaming fuck you that spits out hydrofluoric acid and other nasty shit when it goes tits up which is more likely than youd think since tesla has been caught using bad batteries in their cars
stop owning cars goy rent them from me instead
  combining worst of cars and worst of public transport just to get some profit  capitalism is a mistake
    sounds like communism to me wait even commies had cars wtf is this
  communism is public transportation this is unregulated capitalism outcompeting itself at everyones loss except for shareholders
  nah it would be my vehicle of choice in an apocalypse  people severely underestimate how great of a tool the bicycle actually is
  omg air travel is communist this needs to be banned
  so they can run more people over
    what is this basedboys crusade against driving about jesus what a pussy pick a better hill to die on
  so just like they said theyd have fully self driving cars in the street by 2016 lmao
  manueverig behemoth of metal that screams like a hell beast  thats fuckin metal
  not in illinois i had to do 16 hours behind the wheel training in addition to a bunch of in class sessions a written test for my permit then a behind the wheel test for my license
  want to go somewhere  please come pick me up  not just getting in your car and going
  bbut those are the reasons why that post confused me
uber packed up and left from my country  a whooping 40ish evs sold in the whole country in 2018 doubling their marketshare from 009 to 018  sometimes living in a shithole is a blessing desu
    thats because to you and 99 of bikefags in /n/ cycling is a hobby
    uber hasnt even entered my country  no evs sold the only one in the country was imported as a second hand government demonstration to show how cool cars can be  electricity is fucking expensive because diesel generators power 90 of the country  only 1 hybrid sold in the history of the country and 1 hino hybrid box truck was grey market imported by some delivery guy  we can get brand new 2018 vehicles without abs electric windows backup cameras or airbags  or we can get them to american fully loaded retard spec  no one buys the retard spec with self parking or automatic windows
shall
  whats going to happen to my shitbox in ten years will i still have a dirtbike
  aerospace grade bolts  lmao
  old low maintenance dirk bike is the final red pill on freedom
  chile
  why do people want to depend more on other people  its like you dont fucking read
  this guy would shit himself if he knew about the fire risk of road debris piercing that massive explosive pack called a battery
    your own feet and hands    dirt bikes rely on tires fuel lubricants and parts
  your feet relies on food water and sleep adding tyres fuel etc is a small tradeoff for speed
  ontario leaf here   g1 test is a written test  g2 test is a road test  g test is a road test that usually involves highway driving depends where the town is in relation to a highway  there is zero mandatory schooling at all g1g2g is a 12 month wait its only an 8 month wait if you went to a driving school  huh maybe thats why our drivers are so shit
  why do you think your 3rd world shithole is relevant to global buying trends
  is this the fucking oatmeal  that faggot is shilling for tesla
  meanwhile 36 years earlier in sweden
  10 mile ride to airport  check uber for first time ever to see cost  100 each way  or drive my truck  park it for a week in covered 24 hour security parking  45  uber a shit
  i like u viva revolution
  in my state  permit at 14yo to practice driving with an adult  at 16 take very easy multiple choice test and a quick driving test  for me  sped up to 10 mph over limit for a long while  didnt use turn signal half the time  drove halfway in each lane  the tester even told me these things  my license came in the next week
what about motorcycles
cars will be banned at least from cities
  gotta be owned by uber bikesharetm
  pedal breaks off   huge explosive battery   
  hahahahahahahahhahahaa
ive tried uber latley every trip is 57 plus tip how is this even feasible just 3 trips is over a half tank of gas
  dubs of honest truth
  dumb tweet posted by some random effeminate tranny    of course    moves faster than any known creature   nigger a fucking cheetah can outrun my 80 hp piece of shit

  why do you suck americas circumcised dick god you fucking faggots deserve to burn i hope the muslims and niggers jump ypur chubby fat ass and they will
  ive talked to some one who works for gm and the best estimate right now is 1520 years for taxis 2030 for commercial vehicles and 50 years for complete adoption with no manual control vehicles the biggest thing holding it back is infrastructure people also forget not everyone lives in a city and half the countries roads are poorly marked at best
  official theme of /o/  
  awesome i just got my freaking l
  hes saying it like thats a had thing cuck probly never drove in his life its not that bad
    never said that just happy i dont have to deal with any sharia or sjw nonsense
    screams like an enraged hellbeast    i guess hell aint so bad if its most demonic creature sounds like brum brum 3
  here i added a scale on the yaxis to assist viewers
  gm knows shit they may go bankrupt soon
  74km to airport  66 miles  59 taxi trip    or i could take two busses the first on the same block as my apartment and that would cost what 10 at most lol
  where is the y scale    this guy is such a cunt ive met him in real life he told somebody that he agreed with them on an opinion and offered them evidence they were correct     when the person agreed with his evidence he got this huge grin and said lol that was a fucking lie its not true and youre a fucking idiot for believing it you retard he really seems to think hes smart but hes a huge faggot
  yeah i believe it
  good work saved    lol wew
    im scared of cars so no one else should drive  this guy is such a fucking pussy this generation is content to sell away their freedoms and agency just for the feeling of safety
  ive recently met this 18 year old kid at the local car parts store guys really into cars his dad is an ex rally driver and now builds custom race cars for living kids really into cars and has an awesome dad to be honest he bought him a wreck of a 205 gti when he was 16 and over the 2 years theyve rebuilt it together so he could drive it  thing is no one in his age group cares or thinks its cool not even the chick  i find that so staggering when i was 18 having a car was the most radical thing and we did so much dumb stuff and hooning what the hell went wrong
    it was a webcomic convention i dont think he should have been there with a booth considering the art he draws his personality is utter trash he puts himself on a pedestal by attacking peoples opinions and bringing other people down if i never meet him again i would be quite happy
  what the hell went wrong  i guess theyre busy being depressed and whining on twitter  t 31 y/o boomer
  back when we were kids a car was how you socialized with others its what got you to the party and friends meet ups now kids just want to car pool all their spending money goes twards other stuff also having an electric or hybrid car would probably get you more credit with the girls            imagine being so scared in life that you wont even dive a car
  story
  pussy bitched lel
  what the hell went wrong  higher empahsis on school meaning more time studying less time working also most places would rather hire immigrants than a kid for a minimum wage job increased insurance rates gas is more expensive stiffer legal penalties raisng the legal age to drive ect
    onions people who cant drive
fuck uber and fuck white people
  i can see ebike rentals becoming a big thing in more suburban/metro areas in the next 10 years rural areas still gonna need cars
  you know whats ironic about this   in 10 years uber wont exist     most these venture capitalist funded man baby genius companies will get ass fucked by the irs so hard as well as the trades commission they wont have a pot to piss in
  inb4 mass urban development to erase any rural areas
  there are rural areas that will pay you to live there and people wont take them up on it everyones focused on adapting suburban areas into walkable cities
  at least in europe ebikes are quite popular in rural areas
sounds good to me less normies on the road the better
they want to turn transportation into a subscription service like netflix
  on a somewhat related note how long before some sjwtype manages to convince everyone that owning an ice powered car is a hate crime
by jeff poor
  he can have my car when hes prepared to take it by force ill fight harder for my car than i would for my gun
i look forward to a future of public transport that can get me through my 30 minute rural commute quicker and more efficiently than just owning my own car and driving myself at my own convenience
  uber wont exist in 10 years
  owning an ice powered car is a hate crime  next year
ceo says in the future everyone will use his company  wow how dare he
  do people still even use uber
test
  lmao the rcr hat
  i dont mind but i just hope it isnt replaced with driverless fleets of millions of taxicars    i think a combination of high speed and light rail trains could be a solution but it would require cities to be redesigned into a conglomeration of multicentric villages
  i despise uber so much
you wont own a car
  wind in my hair    shifting and drifting
can somebody make a come and take it meme but with a car
  owning an ice powered car is a hate crime  haters gonna hate
  i dont listen to rapist organizations
  looks forward to public transportation  instead of driving self at own convenience
  thats like saying  come and take my butt plug  you can keep it homo
  god i hate white people
  this is top quality bait
  oooh god
  not trying to be a nigger i promise    
  this actually happened for me theres a rail line near me that shaves 30 minutes off my daily car commute it should be great in theory but theres nothing like getting to hop in your comfy car and be alone
  its because uber doesnt really make money
  this is autism
  people dont own horses
  my drivers ed teacher basically let us fuck off to go get food when we had to drive the class learners car he just sat in the front seat reading the news paper while we ate at popeyes he later got busted for doing coke with students
is the superior truck front suspension
had to work on a twin i beam at school as part of the suspension and steering class according to the teacher its an incredibly smooth ride
is superior  phased out of mainstream use  okay bud
  eats tires and doesnt really work any better in any way than solid axle
not riding on kingpin solid front axle    kys
solid front axles    have fun going slow
i have a ranger with twin ibeam and ive never had to replace a suspension component besides shocks its based and virtually indestructible doesnt handle too great but the ride is smooth    wrong please hang yourself
  macpherson is by far the most popular suspension type but that doesnt make it less shit
  volvo
  wheres the transfer case
  fordfags seething
  its superior for not going out of alignment easily and being very low maintenance but its a truck suspension from when trucks were not expected to be cars most truck buyers dont use them for the kind of work expected in the old days when trucks were tools       if yours eats tires get the thing aligned not hard ive had several dentside fords and still have my 76 f100 cab/f350 chassis holmes 440 wrecker none of my trucks ate tires nor did they require more than urethane bushings when the ancient stock rubber sort got loose
  i dont know if that one is especifically volvo but   i think this is more known in mercedes from the unimog
  kachow
  notice how it doesnt use twin shit beams
swing axles in any format
  will stancefags ever try running excessive caster or go full grader
  my new 2500 uses it
these cars are straightline monsters but how would they fare on a track none of the owners seem to be willing to risk their 2 million  cars to find out
  i heard it broke many times while attacking in the ring
  they are shit on a track if they were any good koenigsegg would market with it harder than i fucked your mom
  
  where is christian when you need him
hej
  all my cars are monsters in a straight line and around the track just take my word for it
  dat value for money evo
  that looks like 100 driver error carrying too much speed into the corner the tire marks are perfectly straight when you have 1200hp and weighs 1200kg corners come up significantly faster than you would think
our cars have decent track potential our nurburgring lap was sadly ruined by a mechanical error and weve set a lap record on spa
  rigged
  f
  koenig needs an aftermarket wing to even keep up with zonda  rigged  i agree
  it was a mechanical failure something like a single wheel having the brakes lock up out of nowhere
1340hp through the rear wheels  sounds awful
  and thats an old zonda at that
  and an old koenigsegg whats your point
hello im from /g/ and the most knowledge i have about cars is they drink dinosaur vodka and fart earth killing gases i want the minivan that is the easiest and cheapest to fix that has the least electronics the ability to go in difficult roads for camping is nice     is a t2 volkswagen the correct choice thanks for spoonfeeding me
  cheapest  lol no    you need like a 1980 toyota van
  only exists in california  doesnt help much
  75 or earlier american van with 6 or sbc
    i forgot to mention that i live in south america so international models are apreciated
  any vw bus is memetaxed
  toyota land cruiser
  why that year
  that might change things you guys have way more t2s than the rest of us
  yeah i just searched in the equivalent of craigslist and a t2 which apparently runs okay is around 4k in american rupees
those vans are shit and constantly break down  get a 1990s nip van like a delica or a townace
    
  air cooled vws are great to learn on because they require monthly maintenance and are old to the point where most shit needs replacing if you want a rock solid dd i would avoid these like the plague get yourself a old minivan van aerostar astro safari or a 1/2 ton fleet van e series express
  post 74 cars have smog regs that make them less powerful
  peak comfy
    whats this model
  it says toyota master ace surf on the side  t weeb
  they wont catch on fire if you replace your fuel lines every so often also keep all the engine tin on and turn off the engine if the fan stops working
  if the fan stops working  the easy way to tell is if the generator light comes on which means the belt has probably come off or something and the fan isnt turning as well since the fan runs on the generator shaft
  no it isnt they are massively overpriced they need care and attention that was looking archaic even in the seventies youll want one restored from scratch thatll cost a fortune and all need redoing in four years time they are purely for hippy dippy middle management types that wear oneil tshirts lets see what else you can get 0
  but you live in south america so you havent heard of marks and spencer which changes everything
  sounds like a lot of work just to keep your car from going jihadi
so easiest to fix and best at offroading is the vw    youll need to fix it often though  always    try and find a toyota previa
  mala idea compadre comprese un pan de molde y deje de huevear
if you get a t2 get the newer ones from brazil that are watercooled
  youre a faggot go smoke a nigger pole
a t2 or the old hippie bus is the most expensive choice out of all the vw vans   even if you were in europe sourcing parts for a vehicle that old would be problematic  a much better though not more reliable choice would be a t3 or the vanagon as it is marketed on your side of the puddle  i am currently exploring the idea of living in a van full time because i moved from a squat to a hostel and van life wouldnt be much worse than this and i decided not to even bother with the old vws not worth the trouble if you want a reliable vehicle     i live in south america  why not buy a ford eseries van much more reliable and cheaper in parts due to your location
from /g/  i dont know about electronics and tech    sounds about right
    liteace
  what part of south america
  the parts will be practically the same they have the same engine     he uploaded an ad from a chilean site so i guess he is from chile
a chevy g20 or similar high top conversion vanagon/westfalia/syncro or a previa
  i can manage to read it but i always have trouble trying to figure out what english word they are trying to represent with their bastardized katakana shenanigans
  trust me if you knew programmers you wouldnt trust your life on them not fucking up
    yes from chile weirdly enough it seems that the memetax isnt a thing unless the van has already been transformed to a foodtruck     theres a ambulance chevy which looks pretty nice
  pan de molde  esas weas de verdad son chantas hasta yo lo se
this is what youtube recommends to me about car related videos stupid o face images and clickbait titles    does noncancer /o/ youtube channels exist only one ive found so far is bad obsession motorsport
  literally only one of those is a clickbait title
youtube recommendations are like 90 pure clickbait thumbnails i saw one a couple hours ago that was a brushed dc motor directly wired into earbuds one pos on left one neg on right top 10 daily life hacks i mean shit nigga thats not how dc or speakers work at all what the fuck was the thumbnail trying to show i bet it wasnt even in the video
  any title with a focus on money is clickbait
  pretty sure mcm uses them ironically to boot    savagegeese is the man objective high quality occasionally mocks clickbait and other yt trends
  using clickbait titles ironically  nigger please dont tell me you believe that shit a clickbait title is still a clickbait title and still works as one   hurrdduurrr dont worry fans its just ironic please like and subscribe and dont forget to click that bell  though i dislike linus tech tips as much as the next guy at least they were upfront and honest about their change to clickbait images and title they said that their total viewcount went up by over 15 with the change to clickbait images and titles alone
  everyone uses them ironically until they get more views from it
  ltt  hes the shilliest fucking guy around dont you dare for one second think their honesty is anything other than put on
  donut media is alright for the most part
  same   oh by no means are they redeemed and i usually call them linus shill tips for a reason i just wanted to point out that they didnt give a bullshit explanation for using clickbait images instead of lol its just ironic bro
  i dont keep up with their every vid but for example one vid is essentially a long take of fucking around in the shop and the video title comes from some stupid shit they said and found funny disrespected nose or something like that    demuro has also stated this is why he titles his videos the way he does
  dylan mccool its a channel of a guy and his dad working on old muscle cars
honda doesnt make sexy cars anym
ore he he we are so in sync opsan
  ore
looks best in black because black hides all the ugly lines
  i like blue the most it reminds me of electron blue pearl on civics
  since when are massive fake plastic vents sexy
  looks like a crashed subaru imp
looks what would be if the transformers took a massive shit     the fuck was honda thinking that thing is such an eye sore
why is it so huge civics used to be tiny
  that thing looks like a squirrel that stuffed is cheeks too full
  so if they did away with fake vents and made them real you would suddenly like the type r
  i like the updated bumpers on most 2019 civics obviously honda saw they needed a change id like something like a civic si with about 250hp for well under 30k more than i would a typer for 35k
the last good looking honda hasnt been sold for almost ten years
  i dont think honda was really ever known to make attractive cars in general but yeah they have some lookers
  s2000  how much cock have you sucked in it anon
  this is what that japanese junk looks like to everyone

mk3 poopra order reporting in  just trying to get feedback on electrical problem involving some interior lighting   converting some interior lights   short occurs  foot light and the light around the key hole go out  dome light also doesnt turn on when i open the door  still works though with the buttons   if i order a 1 integration relay and just do i swap would the lights work again if the part was blown out from the short 
  i cant gotta eat m8
    understandable im struggling to stay afloat with my shitbox
  random guys mock up  thank god it looks like trash      but for the engine 260 still seems underpowered if they got it over 300hp itd be an option     decade old 370z  nothings been updated on them in forever  nissan doesnt even care about them  still faster than a brand new toyota sports car    like come on
  weighs as much as a crossover  faster  ishiggy
  would buying a 96 sc300 be a dumb move
  how much
  theyre asking 9000 for a 1996 with 75000 miles  its service history is perfect and its had one owner     please help im sure im retarded
the toms itegas i ordered off croooober should be here next week cant wait
  is it manual
  yes
  buy it now if you dont like it you can still flip it for a bunch
  thank you anon ill treat her well
i bought an 865 supra that had a 7mgte swapped in it has issues of the rpms being fluttery at idle and low throttle would that just be something with the maf the guy i bought it from did the most nigger rigged things to get this to work so im just trying to narrow down what could be the issue
  what engine    igk if you intended or not but thats a mk3 supra not sc300 and you cant flip a sc300 for shit they are very undesirable
  clean throttle body and adjust the throttle
  i had this issue with my supra and replacing the maf fixed it and a new filter would help  general tune up too if the engine are old   also if its old you have to drive it gently
  very undesirable  a 1 of 120 is undesirable  anon you have no idea what youre talking about do you
  undesirable   i live in a big city and the lower class love these things despite how theyre ancient and just being kanged out camrys   also toyota reliability meme
  shiet i wish i was employed to fund my toyotas
  what kind of trolling is going on here thats an es300 you know
whats the average price on a is300
  34k
  check the bulbs they might be blown though and im leaning towards they are
  depends which generation
  a 1 of 120 is undesirable  i dont get this part  but moving on im guessing its got a 2jzge since 1uzfe i dont think came factory manual on sc300  not the worst combo but must be a very boring drive even with manualnow in general sc300s arent very popular anywhere in the world so i dont see how a generally unpopular car with a pretty unpopular engine is considered desirable    as for the no idea ye here in nz we got the 1uzfe autos and 1jz twin turbo man/autos  no 2jzge version  no one buys the 1jz cos overpriced and the 1uzs are pretty much just used as dailys      they dont die
  i tested the foot well bulb and it worked soo something is blown
hey all  im currently looking at getting a 92 glimited sw20 mr2 since rhd vehicles are illegal in my country the car im looking at underwent an rhd to lhd conversion what are the chances that this conversion would cause me problems in the future if i decide to buy it

  update on this    the guy i bought it from turned out to be an absolute monkey and this car is turning into a nightmare cylinders 5  6 were filled with oil and the car was only running on 4 cylinders the oil was from him only hand tightening shit down steering rack is just destroyed and gushed out power steering fluid     all in all i paid 1700 and got a pretty great deal
  still a good deal you gonna rebuild or swap  rip anons bank account
  im on the fence about rebuilding or trying to sell it for a profit
i have the orange pickup in the montage my reverse lights have decided to stay on constantly how to fix
i have a manual 06 corolla s  i was just wondering if anyone would have a guess at   much a turbo kit would cost/ recommendations   much hp it might add  also   mpg is 2530 as of now how much would that degrade  im probably not gonna do it im just curious for the shits  giggles  also asked this on qtddtot
take gs to get brakes bled with new master cylinder  inform them via lexus manual on how to do it with the pump ignition has to be on  3 days pass  ok anon were done   brake pedal mushy as shit  take it back  we did what we could go away  mfw did it myself with a shitty 15 dollar plastic bleeder kit  brakes feel so much better  lesson learned shops are a fucking joke and so am i for daring to give them my money
  as much as i hate to say this you wouldve been better off taking it to a toyota or lexus dealership instead of a random shop  dealership doesnt do job properly  threaten to complain to corporate unless they redo the job properly or refund you  dealerships can lose their certified dealer status if they get too many complaints
bleed brakes multiple times  still have tons of sponginess in the pedal  is there anything i can do i have a 92 corolla and ive bled the brakes at all 4 corners  i dont think its leaking anywhere
  get a meter and check the reverse switch on your transmission if its closed when youre in any gear other than reverse replace it      new lines maybe a complete flush
is this fucking dexcool working on my 2000 land cruiser and this is the antifreeze that came out i hear sometimes shops or previous owners will accidentally mix the toyota red with green but i dont think thats what this is
  if you did everything yourself it could cost anywhere from 20004000 nzd turbo lines link ecu  it would be alot of trial and error tho and most likely youl only be able to run like 9psi before you bend a conrod
  well thank you  sounds totally not worth it  might as well get a miata or 240sx for that money
  new lines maybe a complete flush  it all started when i put stainless steel lines on and i flushed the fluid a couple times when i did that
was a bit slippy this morning with summer tires
fuck the internet and fuck everything i was told any 1zz would fit in my zzw30   the fucking corolla engine i just bought the block does not have holes to bolt the drive shaft on   now i guess ill just have to drill and tap them and hope they hold
  looking at a 2007 yaris base sedan with 130k on it for 4000 with clean title y/n    has lots of detailed maintenance records one owner
  looks like toyota red to me lol
  yes
  what are you gonna use it as
time to join the montage
  my daily driveru
  oops 1997 lexus es300 color code 1b2 antique sage pearl
    thanks for participating anon
   stupid
reeeee
  pic of the wheels you ordered
is this how i join the montage   2000 corolla
  theyre supposed to be here monday will update with good picture of them on the car asap
  yes anon thanks for following directions ill use this pic unless you want to use something else
  yea just use this pic but maybe rotate it
  tfw took out my yota for a night drive since it was raining  hectic skids were had
  guys the 3rd aw11 from the bottom is totaled i got another one now gonna post a breaded pic for the montage in the coming week
  the red 97 rav4 is no more
  thanks for letting me know anon mind giving us a green text
  wow backtoback rip posts did you anon get hit by a drunk driver on thanksgiving thanks for keeping us updated anon
  its definitely some bad luck for /tg/ but mine is nothing exciting i fucked some engine work yesterday and now my confidence is shot so id rather sell it off thats probably the worst thing i can do but ive already got someone coming to look at it
im really tempted to buy a used slowbaru and supercharge it is this a dumb idea
friendly reminder to wash your yota
  240sx is a waste of money unless you intend to swap engines ka24 is biggest dropkick of a engine made by nissan
  wtf did you do
convince me to get a 9th gen corolla over a 7th gen civic as fun and reliable daily/first car
  i gave my gs a lovely wash the other day nice rolla
  was replacing valve seals got to one that was stuck tried to grab it a few times with pliers and kept slipping off and only after half a dozen tries realized i screwed up the stem and now needed to pull the head     not even that bad objectively but its too much for me to mess with right now at least the guy buying it will fix/flip it so it wont be junked
  if you dont mind working on a boxer engine i think its cool
  would like to update my car its a celica 3rd from the top in the montage pic 1997 red with yellow fogs expires this month    however it still looks exactly the same and i dont have any more pics of it saved can the expiration date be extended without a new photo
  sure thing anon thanks for keeping us updated
  be me  really want to go for a late night drive  thursday 10 pm  think streets will be empty im going to take the side roads  sit in car  tell myself i have to drive carefully  drive full chill mode 80s music blasting  90 left turn coming up see light coming from behind the corner   slow down to 80 km/h keep to my side of the road  enter the turn  left side of the road a large truck is driving slowly  a fucking range rover is overtaking him in the turn  swerve hard right to avoid a headon collision  fly out of the curve narrowly avoiding another headon with a wall  literally thank my ancestors out loud trying to grasp what just happened  try to get out of the car cant find the handle  push with my elbow door opens  get out disconnect battery  truck driver called me an ambulance and waited with me  told the police what happened truck driver confirmed  still got a fine   car broken  3 weeks later  buy a ttop aw11
  heres the wall
  holy crap anon that looks nasty what did they fine you for
  not adjusting the speed to the conditions of the road  around 100  also broke a small bone in my right hand
  new photo of my hilux if you dont mind   thanks in advance      you got lucky there mate that wall wouldve made short work
guys my 1k mr2 runs now  but its now about an 1800 mr2  any recommendations for an aftermarket soft top
  damn what did the doc say regarding your hand just a cast im glad youre okay though fuck that other driver again couldve been worse
  dont mind at all thanks for the continued participation
  get a civic si or just manual bigger aftermarket
any generations of tacos to avoid
thoughts on the matrix did you ever own one or at least knew someone that did
    yeah i got a half cast for 3 weeks hand is ok now it was a clean fracture according to the doc at the er  basically nothing happened to me considering the circumstances
  what do you want to know
ah yes
  avoid the latest generation they have trans issues
  oooo i like the color
  thanks bby
  buying new  anon
  year  how you got it  interesting stories  weird quirks with that particular car  anything interesting about it will do
wheels arrived and im stoked but now the head gasket on the celica is blown so that puts a damper on things
  04  bought it from a mitsubishi dealer for 4k  this is the car ive had most of my auto related firsts in first launch first hoon etc  it doesnt really have any unique quirks    its been dead reliable for the year ive owned it and i love it even though it has over 210k on it now i expect it last longer with proper maintenance if it matters to you dont get one of these for any street cred or anything because if you dont know what it is everyone it looks like something a mom would drive her kids to soccer practice in that said i dont really care that much and embrace any of the minivan jokes that come my way online  its basically a more obscure civic too  relatively light xrs is about 2800 lbs  high revving
burger with a century here     any suggestions on getting new or used toyota parts from japan yahoo auctions japan has lots of parts but finding a 3rd party bidder /shipper that doesnt mind dealing with car parts and charges reasonable costs is proving to be challenging
  zenmarket maybe
  check croooober site can be difficult to use for finding specific parts but might be your best bet in that realm also call around to some japanese car importers and see what they can do for you go on facebook and message nippon2u and other such businesses yeah it might probably will be expensive but thats the price of owning a jdm exclusive car  absolutely gorgeous century btw
  is that a toyota stretch or did a coachbuilder do work  so beautiful make a ruckus on /o/ if youre ever bringing it near atlanta so i can come look at it
  thanks for the compliment   the croooober link has some stuff but its almost all gzg50 there is a set of oem alloy rims i wanted mine is a strange combo of the steelies and the alloys but they arent in good enough condition to make it worth the 400 for shipping      do they have any restrictions on car parts other than customs restrictions ive noticed a lot of the 3rd party auction shippers have tons of blanket restrictions on anything car related for some reason       its factory vg45 h type once i have some stuff fixed on it i will probably be doing some shows so i might end up in the area
  well my dudes    i just put down an offer for a 1984 supra and it got accepted  the owner thinks it may have a burnt exhaust valve  idk but ill be looking into it    this is my first stick that works half way decent and also my first dedicated sports car    what am i in for toyobros  pic related isnt mine btw
im fucking retarded and managed to rip off the sideskirt of my 05 corolla off on a curb i think the skirts fine but i know i broke clips where can i find them
  clipsandfastenersdotcom
  you can still put the wheels on and pretend everything is ok 
  not seeing what i need there at least not in the toyota section
  what engine auto or manual  either way dont expect much in terms of power or handling most shitboxs will beat you at standstill  parts arent going to be common and youre most likely gonna have rust either obvious or hidden
  good to know theyre still reliable after that many years and miles i picked up an 09 with only 27k miles for 8700 this year i couldnt care less about rep/street cred because good luck finding another car that old with that many miles within that price range
      use that to find the part number you can order through them as well but be prepared to pay out the nose
  5 speed stick didnt ask the engine but ill be picking her up soon enough    i assume she has rust but it wasnt visible from the pics  ill be putting away some cash after this and eventually getting her one of those fancy schmancy rust protection treatments
  im assuming ptype and not ltype for all of this  leaky hatch and windows but its 34 years old so expect that just open the hatch after washing/rain and youll be fine  body parts are hard to find see above  rust is suspect in the rear quarters spare tire hatch and sunroof if applicable  worn out shifter bushings not critical but it shifts like a truck people on celicasupra make a replacement  no decent 14 tires that are near stock size 16x8 0 fits comfortably under them  rear end will probably need to be rebuilt depending on how hard people have been on it celicagts has a list of vin codes for rear ends  not great aftermarket support better than ra6x though  dont know much about 5mges so cant help you much there    basically its an old but fun car get decent tires and youll be able to throw it around without too much worry i run a 430 lsd out of one in my gts with 100 less horses and am able to out accelerate and handle most hotboy shitboxes
  thank you anon  the difference between the p and l types was the interior and fender flares right    cause apparently this one has a leather interior
sold my civic and miata to buy an 87 mr2  ive done it lads ive found a car im comfortable with 
  ptypes came with optional leather interior 14x7 8 wheels fender flares and higher rear end ratios typically 410 sometimes 430  ltypes came with worse seats very little bolstering but typically leather no flares 14x55 27 15x6 20 for 85 wheels and lower rear end ratios iirc    there may be other differences but i wouldnt know
  are you trying to join the montage
  that means they only made 120 manuals that year 97 is also the facelift year something that the japanese market only had for one year us got upto the year 2000 the vvti 1uz is only a north america thing with new transmission and upgraded engine both for the 300 and 400 the 97 models are sought after
    p type have factory lsd rear end too
would you toy/o/tists recommend a 1991 corolla to someone looking for a reliable car i like how the 2 door version looks
  yeah why not
i was recently given a toyota truck i had never met the ownet nor seen the truck when i agreed to take it away     1992 4x4 5 speed 22re vin number starts with jt so i understand that means assemblend not in fremont ca   i pulled the bed off and theres actually most of a frame  its kinda a sweet situation
    carepo is really good for used parts ive gotten stuff for my toyota crown from them all the time like a new tail light etc shipping is the only killer no way around it i think my tail light was 150 with 200 shipping i priced a used fender with them and it was 150 with 500 shipping i think i cant remember the guys first name that handles parts requests but he speaks good english and is super nice    new parts i use partsouqcom its based in saudi arabia but ive ordered parts for my jdm stuff from them for nearly a decade never an issue they can sort toyota and subaru from jdm to usdm to uk spec and they have all the expanded parts images even for old models and shipping is super fair with them i got oem toyota brake pads for my crown for 60 shipped a couple years back and got 2 new tokico front shocks for 60 shipped    also the factory wheels on that thing are worth keeping the high end luxury toyotas from the early 80s to late 90s had that style of wheel with minor modifications ive had numerous offers for the oem ones from my crown i just run the ghetto aftermarket wheels because the tires are double as wide as the oem rims can handle
  what year is your aygo
  2012
  thanks for the links anon ill look into them     i do plan on keeping the stock rims but mine is a mix currently i have the 14 steel wheels w/ caps in the front and the 15 alloys in the back got the car this way should be steelies all around but if i go to the alloys all around came as standard the next model year i can at least make purchasing tires easier the alloys do have a somewhat different offset though     either way i have bigger fish to fry like replacing shocks and getting my window regulators overhauled     nice crown though what year is it
    man best looking century model and i love the color but my god that back seat   japanese really are dwarfs its like a scale model of a limousine
  thanks for participating anon  12 aygo
    forgot trip
  i wouldnt say theyre that small angle of picture doesnt help
  the 11/16 99 celica still with us i noticed it expires this month
  thanks for the update anon
  yea it means it was made in japan
  yea but get the next gen since parts are getting harder to get
  rip looks like no one knows anon
  i want to eat sushi in your backseat anon
tfw hot futanari doujin isnt translated  why live
/tg/ is dead 
  par for the course really maybe our cars dont break down so often so less shitposting time
  like always
  what year is the celica
  jacking off to 2d  i just fucked my fb and dropped her off at uni in my ae102
  85 dawg
feeling the celica love in here    thinking of moving to the us in the next year or so is it worth bringing my 1994 celice gtfour wrc whats it worth
  easily 10 grand but i have no idea why youd want to sell it because youd have massive clout and the thing is cool as fuck and has to be fun to drive
  could cost big  to bring with to the states    have no idea whats evolved getting it road legal in the us guessing it will be state dependant    i dont understand cloutbut yes its fun to drive kinda hoped it would be a good investment with only 2500 built and do t think yall got them in the us
    waited checked for multiple days finally check in and find a yota thread    literally posted about being given a free hilux and even tried to pull teeth by throwing out a neat fact i dug up about it     fuckin vehicle that made toyota famous but noooo /tg/ is ded ok ill take yall at face value peace     never was a toyota guy anyway
  no we didnt get them people would freak out over one over here as of next year it will be legal to import i dont know much about getting it registered i know a bit about registering jdm imports and its not a massive hassle or expense obviously it wont be cheap to actually ship
  what state you in
  washington
bump to keep tg alive
celica posting with a old interior shot  fog light switch was replaced with an aux jack and removed the nonfunctional alarm controls
  fuck off nigga

today marks another day of  tfw no st205 gt4
i was originally interested in the yaris but have since learned that it is a rebadged mazda 2 i am unable to find to what extent this is true is it mazda inside and out meaning no legendary toyota reliability
  only the current generation yaris 2015 is related to the mazda 2
  0_0 really im glad i asked that means i can consider it again
  im literally going to buy a yaris today just because you told me this thanks anon genuinely
  its okay anon today marks another day of   tfw no a80 turbo
  welcome to the yota club
posted about buying this truck a while back stock 30 v6 4x4 with the 5spd
  stock 30 v6 4x4 with the 5spd  and extended cab kinda jealous that you got my ideal truck how much was it
  paid 1900 for it 139k on the clock bought it from my neighbor because it leaked when it rained had some rust holes in the firewall but i patched them up
sup br/o/s im seriously looking at getting a 2008 crown athlete 35  300hp  cam chain  120000km  rwd  comfy as fuck  9000 new zealand rubles  it sounds like a sore dick deal and its not just a one off theres a shit ton just like it    so my question is l is there anything i should look for  i know about the shit water pumps the recall for the oil lines and that something called fifth cylinder overheating is a thing    is there anything else or are they under appreciated god machines
  tl dr  go bulls
  lol beat me to it our boy carter looked good tonight
  what kind of car do i need to buy to fuck her
  2014 or newer gs
  that looks mint as hell what plans do you have for it
finally a warm up day winterizing my car
  my power steering fluid is leaking like crazy     i noticed after i fucked up on a hill and got my clutch burning are they somehow related     i dont really have the means to investigate myself but could this end up being costly 06 corolla for reference
my first mini repair i did last week was switching the burnt out dome light with a new one feeling proud and confident lads
  not a whole lot keeping it mostly stock maybe a small lift i have to use it for long distance driving so im keeping the 31x1050s
  good job fren
bumb
im interested in buying a 2005 corolla xrs because of that sweet 6 speed and 2zz with vvt what do you guys think will it be a good buy
  yes
  is the engine fast ive watched videos of it hitting lift and it sounds fucking godly
why is modern toyota so frustrating    i love this company but i hate that the 86 is the only thing in their current line up thats even remotely engaging lexus has all their fun cars and even then theyre just not really what im looking for    i remember being excited when the corolla s came out in 2013 thinking it was gonna be a civic si type of thing but it wasnt it was just a corolla with a spoiler
  is it fast  lol no its not ungodly slow though 175 hp in a 2600 lb 2800 for the matrix isnt awful but its not going to win you any street races
so my aw11s timing is dead on if i crank it i can smell gas and i get a cel w/ code 6 i know its the dizzy but my dizzy seems fine is there a common area where these fail
r8 my 1800 meme trucc
  check the injectors arent leaking at that age and with shit petrol there can be shit clogging them up
  ill check around the engine bay for any gas i hope its not a leak  kinda sucks i have a dark blue aw11 but the bay is kinda grody so who knows
  no i mean the injectors leaking internally so theyre just dumping petrol into the cylinder i had that problem on my 4age and a good clean fixed it
  oh oh my bad i mightve fucked my injectors somehow when my timing belt snapped i cranked it a couple times before i realized it was the belt
  when my timing belt snapped i cranked it a couple times before i realized it was the belt  that wouldnt fuck the injector
  then what would it fuck besides my wallet
  nothing much apart from your timing i think those engines are noninterference so just make sure the dist is all set correctly
  i timed up the lil indents on the cam gears with the lines on the cam cover and even the notch on the crank with the dot on the block turned it a bit and set the tension and it hasnt slipped at all when ive tried cranking it the past few times  so im not sure my timing is off the cel was code 6 and thats the whole dizzy nonsense so im thinking i mightve worn the shit out of my dizzy when i was cranking it when the belt snapped
  disregard that last part i dont know why i typed that rest of the post is fine
  im not sure exactly how the ignition system works but if the dist wasnt being spun and was still trying to fire it might have just earthed itself and blown the ignitor or the coil  check you actually have spark
is there anything big to watch out for on the late 90s/early 00s corollas and camrys would they be decently fun cars for someone who likes to drive recklessly but only benchmark is a 2000 saturn l 
not the most ghetto thing ive done but its up there
january 14th official reveal of the supra plus a surprise  only one hint yellow
  i mean hey if it looks nice then the method doesnt matter
are pre2015 yarises as reliable as corollas would a 2008 yaris with 20000km 125000 miles still run for a fair stretch without problems
i drive a 95 taco with 4 cylinders 4x4 and 5 speeds lots of times i feel like i just need more power highway driving freeway etc will i see a big upgrade going up to a 99 6 banger with jump seats or just wait for a tundra to pop up both truck are 5 speed
  ive got an 03 with a decent intake filter and my gf said it perfectly it sounds like its going fast but it isnt
  thinn
had a nice little cruise in snow and skidz while testing my new hakkapeliitta 9s id give them a 45/5 sticks to snow really good and only downside being this weirdass sound they make at 50km/h on asphalt if i remember correctly 8s made that same sound cant wait to test them on proper ice
  weirdass sound they make at 50km/h on asphalt  its called 190 studs
  i find it hard to believe that that sound comes from studs its like a umm humming sound
  its the studs  like anything you can get a certain reverb when it rotates at a certain velocity
  what are you dumb metal studs and aggressive tread hitting asphalt at speed are gonna make a noise
how would i get a new cassette headuni to replacet/used one to repair my busted oem one i want my cassette jams
  ebay or junkyard
engine idles roughly and unpredictably when cold going as low as to lug or up to 2000 rpm  perfectly fine when warmed up    maf sensor or something else 94 mustang v6
check your alternator voltage and timing while youre in there
im the only one who loves 80s detective cars        is a good idea buy one car used by a police department i would like to get a ford ltd crown victoria like pic related
theyre old ugly and shitty in pretty much every way cant say im a fan theyve been out of service so long it probably wont matter much if it was used by the police or not
ill start
do you think this is a fucking joke
  yes
  implying i would be able to purchase any of those under communism
  basedford and bedpilled
suppose i want to get a used small hatchback because they are practical cheap etc however i also want to get something that has some potential to be fun if taken care of and tuned i dont know how far i am going to take it nor what parts i am going to use once i get there     but suppose now that i am going to start doing things like swaping out engines i suspect that pic related will be too small to fit a v6 what other things should i look out for when searching for a potential hot hatch
wants something simple and practical  wants to swap the engine out    how retarded are you
  get an mk3 vr6 golf  then throw a turbo on ot
  if you get a peugeot get one with the 16l like in the 106 or 206 dont get the 2l in the 206    the 16l takes boost like a champ and ive seen them run 400hp on pretty much stock internals    look for engine codes tu5j4 or jp4    i have it in my 106 gti and am currently tuning it to at least 300 whp and possibly stroking it to 18l
civics are actually very very fast and good with a k swap eg civic set up properly with a k20 is a mad daily
  a peugeot 106 with 300 at the wheels i highly doubt it m8
      see for yourself mate
  or you could just buy a 34k ep3  itd be less expensive than k20 swapping an older one
  this anon speaks the truth
  but da weight
  what kinda weight are you looking for i found that very important aswell when i was looking for my car
  also location which country
  i was just saying that the ek9 weighs like 300lbs less then a ep3  k swap ek hatch ftw
  jeah old cars are way better for weight
  us of a

talk me out of buying an 2010 ford fusion hybrid since i want to buy me a city car that doesnt waste tons of gas even if its a 24l    im aware of the 810 year/150k miles warranty car has less than the mile threshold its around 6k dollars and looks basically new im planning on going to see it soon    but some people have told me to not dwell with old hybrids since the whole battery meme and whatnot but reading upon reports and recalls the ones that do fail are less than 1 of all cars sold and the ones still on the road the batteries still work    can you at least give me another opinion thanks
i would go either full electric or full gasoline econobox a used electric car with not a ton of miles seems pretty cheap to me around 10k but i dont know the risk of it
  bought a 2nd hand camry hybrid for my gf cost us all of 180 to drive from chicago to los angeles and back    meme    wat
  last time i asked about a hybrid they told me i would fall for the hybrid jew scheme which i think its dumb thats why i gotta ask again
  ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

  actually electric cars are better for the environment since you dont have to burn any fossil fuels to run them     plus elon musk owner of tesla maker of electric cars is a modern day tony stark musk also owns spacexgoogle that and be prepared to be amazed so hes got that going for him
  but thats not what normies want
  its a mike pence which means hes from the future
  ah yes stripmining mountains away and then burning coil at the powerplant in order to charge up your cuckmobile is much better for the environment
  worst part is that is not even going to look like that itll be another generic bloated blob made for soccer moms  honestly i think this has to be the worst time ever for automotive design nothing comes close to these abominations
  coil  i can smell your sunburnt neck from here intel      do you fucking see this this is pure fucking water vapor coming out of this plant literally zero hydrocarbons to make clean coal
  fuck you cletus
     implying even 20 of coal plants are zero emissions    lmao
  ever heard of the epa fucktard they monitor everything that comes out of that stack    you can thank liberals for that too
  intel  i can smell your lack of intelligence     stay seething cuck

  the third world needs to use fossil fuels in order to catch up with the rest of us in terms of quality of life western civilization consuming and preventing them from enjoying the simple things in life is what got them to that point in the first place    besides id gladly pay a little more to save the environment for the future even if it means letting poor countries burn fossil fuels

  environment worship  ill be dead before i have to care faggot

      you ever notice how as phone screens get larger car windscreens and windows get smaller
whata bout this guise i still have hopes
does mitsubishi count as scum
  _
  its a mitsubishi eclipse  but its actually a mitsubishi eclipse cross  its a crossover  
  as much as i hate this i do want to see it lowered on te37s
  the rear is so gross tho can you cut the bulge out   
  thats because we look outside less but inside more or any crap like that
  everything in the alliance counts
  which bulge
  huh what did you even change there i want to day you stretched the bulge out but you didnt even do that
      its literally one of those fuckin /o/ photoshop memes where the doors are stretched up and the windows are like 2 inches high
    when you realize a less fugly mitsubishi is just a nissan
  the ass actually looks like the front of a new mustang
  are you talking about the bottom rear bumper bulging out    moving away from 3box was a mistake tbqhfamalam
  imagine if ur ass looked like a dick
  it would def be a hit at parties

  whats going on with those rims sheesh and i thought those shitty new honda or nissan rims looked like shit
  one can dream
truly a look of disgust
  lets hold out criticism until we see how it performs in rally
gm takes millions of tax dollars in subsidies   invests it in a mexico plant to build the new blazer creatura instead of american workers  honestly just buy japanese at this point
the only car that interested me was the volt its dead now
  ill buy japanese once they apologize for their war crimes and open their damn border to immigrants until then its only chinese cars for me
  nice shill nissannigger    nice corrupt ceo lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
  using a pic of a car thats been out of production almost a decade    why are people so lazy
  how the fuck did you extrapolate that i was shilling for nissan by shitposting about gm you fucking mongoloid  unrelated buy a stinger
  tax dollars going government motors  sedans will be heavily discounted    anyone else hyped to claim their bailout reimbursement
    volt or bolt    it looks like the bolt was the best way into the ev market with a nice mix of decent range and price point    
  volt bolt is nice but goofy looking
buy ford or tesla
  liquidate the 61 of the company the feds own and execute all executive level managers in the public square
  obama sold all the gm stock at a loss
  nissanigger this mad hes been exposed
  gm a shit  hopefully honda or toyota buys the 2 plants they closed down
  the website probably doesnt have the rights to use a more recent pic that was probably some creative commons photo or whatever
  buy a vw passat
  passat is the comfiest normal car on the market
  i worked at the gm plant in oshawa ont as an independent contractor    i had a non gm vehicle and came out to go home after shift and found my car completely covered in garbage grill stuffed wheel well etc etc    not to mention i saw a guy pissing into a frame of a impala cop car on the line    fuck gm
  goes into a union shop as a nonunion member  brings a nonunion car to work    what the fuck were you expecting
  just buy japanese   daily reminder nissan is no longer japanese its a french owned company run by criminals and building cars in india and mississippi shitholes     gm is closing plants in ohio honda still makes good cars in ohio ford is also coming out with the ranger soon too that looks cool and the bronco mazda is a proper japanese company and i like what theyre doing as well
  you know literally every car and good you buy comes to you via a gm locomotive right fine dont buy their cars but know theyre still cucking you
  im part of a union speciality trade but requires 3rd party as it would be a conflict of interest if done in house    also my car was a uaw car not aforeigncar
  unrelated kill yourself
  last uber i took was on a newer one of these it was pretty good was impressed by how good the screen look even when the sun was shining directly on it
not buying usa made cars is why usa made products are failing ill go to my grave w/american car keys in my hands
    this bolt is so fucking ugly i could afford one it would be great for my commute150milea round trip but i would want to hang myself everytime i looked at it  was considering a cruze hatch diesel
complain when gm makes a profit  complain when gm doesnt make a profit  complain when gm received subsidies  complain when subsidies are cut  americans are fucking dumb
  low level workers are often insecure dicklets  big surprise
  i have a buddy who relocated from ontario and works for gm in michigan he drove a mid 90s corolla and had to park in the non gm vehicle lot and got heckled by the local staff  he blew a brake line while he was up in ontario and ended up giving that corolla back to his dad to fix while he was back in michigan he bought a geo prizm made in the same plant as the corolla california but all of a sudden he could park in the gm parking lot and the guys left him alone both were uaw cars
how about gm start making good cars
  those days are long gone    96 impala/ buick roadmaster / caprice    now theyre all fwd shitboxes
  i bought japanese because they do these things
  this is why i dont feel bad about all of those shitheads having their careers handed to jose fucking chuds should go od on fen asap
  yeah worked at ford and got my tired slashed twice because i have a kia cant wait for all the uaw to go out of business and their families to go hungry fucking niggers
  they just announced they are taking 400k niggers this week so were halfway there
  i wish they would just die already instead of slowly dragging it out they cant even afford ts anymore
  north american mazda3s mostly come from their salamanca mexico factory    t owner of a mexico3
  but anon last gen imp and the cobalt were decent fwd cars  they asked way too much for v6 though
ill stick to companies that dont hire certain colored individuals
mary barra an open democrat played politics to hurt this country so she could hurt the president    fuck her i hope trump carries out his threat to cut gms subsidies beause there is no good reason with using americna taxpayer money for a company that keeps on shifting more and more production to mexico    and for her to do it at this time of year that no doubts pads her christmas bonus to help her have a nice christmas at the expense of fucking 14000 people        they dont need immigration stop it with colonizing the world with 3rdworld babyfactories who refuse to get their birthrates under control stop trying to fuck up the planet with savages who only lived to fuck up the places where theyre from         this is japan theyre not in danger of underpopulation unless they maintain growth by opening their nation tot he hordes of savages like western leftists claim
    the lacrosse is a top tier but affordable comfy boat
gms been shit since the 90s worse since the bailout
  so none of them you outdated retard
  i stopped buying gm during their big bailout a while back and to add salt on my wounds even more the cobalt killed a relative of mine who was only 20 years old remember the ignition switch fiasco
ive never bought a gm and never will    i saw the garbage they make and didnt want any part of it    dodge too
  kia  they were doing you a favor
  id buy gm just to stick it to trump fuck his shit
  was unaware i recently traded out of my 2014 first run of current gen mazda3 the build quality was great trading it in for a new nissan was a huge mistake
  i work at ford kcap  i can confirm this shit happens from time to time because these patriotic mouth breathers
  dodge makes top tier shitboxes with insane bang for the buck plus the challenger and viper will always be cool dont hate
  dodge makes top tier shitboxes  lol
zambonis have to work around the broken pile of shit  gm not even once
  diesel trains    this level of pre world war era in the 21st century    i wonder why gm is going to shit you burgerfags got overtaken with two less world wars on your back
  you can buy a brand new dodge grand caravan for pennies on the dollar compared to a real car and that piece of shit will last you 200000 miles with minimal maintenance but you dont even care about doing maintenance because its a piece of shit despite this you can pack it with features or not your choice and itll carry endless cargo with infinite practicality    so yes top tier shitboxes
  a grand caravan isnt a shitbox their shitbox was the dart which was so shit it got canceled
  shitbus
  what do european frigate trains use then
  citizen of the world xd  kys
  theyre not that bad anymore even fiat isnt completely garbage outside of the us because we get the mexico built ones that rattle themselves apart
    the volt sucked i had it and a cruze before as a loaner car the volts heater and heated seats/steering wheel were very weak the power was good off the line but it would immediately plummet very sluggish on the highway i couldnt get it to reach 100mph thencrize though is the exact same car at half the price and with a standard turbo it was good as all speeds    i think gms cars were very good but geared for fleets they didnt have options that felt special a base model looks the same as a fully loaded one lacked awd in their cars too
  theyre not that bad anymore
  most japanese cars in the us are built in the us any ways
this bland piece of shit is the new blazer    say something nice about it /o/
  dad
  jd power  get the hemi and dont get the air suspension shit its actually that easy
  is this real tell me this is real i wanna be one of those niggers in nip land
  no lol  japan is infamous for being incredibly xenophobic
  looks like a daddy camaro
  dont worry i wasnt planning on buying american cars anytime soon
  oh you gotta be fucking kidding me   looks like the camaros retarded morbidly obese brother
  they couldnt just make one off the colorado chassis to make it an actual blazer/jimmy  im still very pissed about this
  this is unfortunately the corporate america weve all grown to know personally i think mexico should be treated as a terrorist organization since the cartel manages the government there and runs a very large portion of child drug and weapons trafficking into the us but as long as they keep supplying us with political crap that we want cheap oil and cheap labor then we will never be rid of the problem
  this is the beginning of the end for japan
  more foreign cars are built in the us than domestic these days better drive the volvo made in sc or the subaru from indiana or the kia from alabama than a gm from mexico fuck gm
  implying bailouts to these kikes was ever put to ballot  drink bleach heeb
  based
  drive a kia optima  gfs grandfather gives me shit about not driving an american car  he has a buick encore cuckbox    optima sx manufactured in alabama usa  buick encore manufactured in bupyeong south korea    cars are weird these days
  fuck drumpf resist capitalism
  american industry is a joke bosses only care about filling their pockets before they get fired nepotism is everywhere so you end up with morons in high places most factory workers are lazy with no sense of pride in what they do
  it looks nice
  gook shit built by niggers   vs  eldergodtier american autos built by based koreans
jesus christ this thread makes you wanna shot up a gm plant
  globalist scum
  time for industrial revolution2
  cobalt a cute
  styling is okay still a soulless cuckbox should have done it on the colorado platform so its a real suv like the other anon said   bring back the k5
  my hyundai was built in alabama and its better built more reliable more efficient and more comfortable than any gm shit me or my family has ever owned weve had camaros tahoes caprices and a park avenue and now that theyre no longer building the ss/commodore or any good luxo barges im never planning on going back to their shit probably will only buy korean/japanese sedans and ford/fca performance vehicles and suvs     gm business culture is fucking appalling too they deserve to fail and they will again too hopefully some chinese firm will buy out buick and the holden brand and give them a blank check to reinvent themselves like geely did with volvo    t ex gm employee
  personally i think mexico should be treated as a terrorist organization since the cartel manages the government there and runs a very large portion of child drug and weapons trafficking into the us    i often wonder why america is so fucked then remember that people who think this shit are like 33 of the voting population in reality trumps bullshit is why these jobs are getting cut gm is ending lacrosse volt and ct6 us production because this trade war has made exporting these us built models unviable and there arent enough people in the us buying them to make their manufacture break even
  theyre dieselelectric the diesel engine is purely a generator and is not connected to the wheels
  why are they closing the toronto plant then
  my 09 kia has only had normal maintenance done on it its got 162k no breakdowns or check engine lights or shop visits  thats more than you can say about any gm car
  just bought a golf r wow this interior quality vs gm hard plastic trash
  because theyre consolidating the manufacturing to other plants because now they wont be making as much money due to not being able to easily export shit from the us to china
  it shouldve shut down 30 odd years ago but caw lobbied hard and screwed stethérèse over
  encore isnt even american its a rebadged opel mokka that opel outsourced to factories in spain belerus and russia buick makes the us encores in south korea but most encores are sold in china from their chinese factories
  man fuck the quebecers  ontarioian
  i dont speak hindi
  not having to cross their ts anymore  think of all they saved the taxpayers though
  im not even remotely close to indian try again faggot
  their alpha cars and the na corvette are ok and the camaro now come with standard lsd with the manual their opel rebrand are ok too but almost every gm with a transverse engine is crap
  china was keeping gm up  proofs
  stupid shill answer or some sort of liberal retard answer    no one in china purchases or owns american cars literally no one outside the us likes american cars other than muscle cars as they are garbage quality too fucking huge and hard to maintain at a reasonable price    who even pays you people to shill on these internet boards with poorly hidden orange man bad posts
  wrong on every account how are europoors dumber than niggers
  ok xhang    buick is pretty big in china its the only reason they kept the brand alive
  im a canadian born mutt who is part xhang so you get part marks for that
  gm takes millions of tax dollars in subsidies
  some sort of liberal retard answer  trump loves the poorly educated
  chuds  go back where you came from
  buying a car which tests on monkeys with gas  no thank you
  the fix they had for the ignition switches was some scuzzy shit they just changed the hole in the key so it wouldnt wiggle around instead of actually putting in ignition switches that work properly
  typical stupid paranoid trumpian response buick is one of the best selling brands in china and cadillac does pretty well there too
mfw gm rejected me from a job 3 weeks ago  dodged a bullet there
  the most fucked up part of the whole ignition switch thing was that they didnt change the part number when they fixed it so they didnt have any configuration management and had no fucking idea which cars had even been fixed    frankly the design authority who signed off on that change should be jailed for gross negligence
  when is a big company going to bail out poorfag taxpayers
  they didnt have a revised part number for the new part  jesus christ
  i work at toyota dealer friend better said acquaintance works at local gm diehard full union retard starts talking shit on me for working for a foreign car line on facebook i ask if gms are acceptable in his eyes of course he says yes take pic of a tundra door tag 88 produced and 100 assembled in us then a pic of the door tag on my wifes escalade 80 produced and 100 assembled in juarez but is uaw ask him to explain how gm is better for america and how the uaw is protecting the american worker get told to fuck off and grow up blocked and hasnt spoken to me since that was 6 years ago
bailouts are always a mistake gm and chrysler should have died and all the banks should have died but yall wanted socialism and now you have it thanks faggots
  but the chinese arent taking immigrants that dont immediately go to their correction facility
  yall wanted  nobody voted for that bullshit the government violated the consent given to them people should have rioted to be honest
  inhumane  companies dont have to employ their workers   you dont have a right to be employed by an employer that no longer needs the services you provide
  this that happened against most intelligent voters wills and cemented that the rich dont ever suffer for their mistakes at the cost of keeping the system unfixable almost made me want to see the nation collapse because we dont deserve to be proud of the us after the government fucked us all and we didnt clean every elected branch of government
  happy hanukkah
  chinese cars are coming cant wait
  bait
  the offer is only for chines immigrants due to their work ethics
  this is what happens when you give women purchasing power
  based and redpilled
      haha yes i also agree with you fellow americans
gas dipped below 2 per gallon here as low as 099 per gallon if you have one of those fuel reward things
  gas prices dip in the winter because less people are driving because of the holidays
  i may just have poor memory but i dont recall it being this low the same time last year
  it wasnt trump is doing the lords work
trump is doing the lords work  if by that you mean keep the american population dependent on oil and the car industry sure
  various levels of opec fuckery and nonsense in the middle east to which us and other producers responded by saying fuck you were going to churn out as much as we can so at the moment oil is getting stockpiled and theres more currently being produced than consumed thus creating a surplus in the market    its a nice reprieve but dont expect it to last long imo itll start on the long trend upward early next year if it hasnt already
  as low as 099 per gallon if you have one of those fuel reward things    who the fuck has 080/gallon rewards    its 185 at sams club right now
apparently oil fracking in a couple us states has increased the domestic stockpile for the us which is the second largest oil consumer next to china alberta laid off 110 000 workers because oil sand production is now economically unviable so anything we can extract is getting sold to the us as dirt cheap oil since canadas economy is partly dependent on it so its nice that i get to pay 999 cents a liter hear in toronto but theyre suffering out west and prime minister selfie is dragging his heels on pipelines so were forced to buy cheap american refined petroleum until we can ship it to china
    youre going to be dependent on something faggot would you rather it be s o y b o y windfarms and electricuck cartels    theres nothing more manly than ripping down a cold hard highway by the power of exploding dead dinosaurs in a chunk of iron    you fucking nigger give me your testicles right now because you dont deserve them
  id imagine you wouldnt when you live in some hick town in a flyover state
  kroger my man 1 a gallon discounts you can use phone numbers from the rich part of town to steal gas rewards
  dont you remember what absolute niggers albertans were 10 years ago when they were living high off the hog when they were swimming in oil money and rigpigs were raking in 120k a year the way they shit on the rest of the country nonstop telling us all to fuck off and that we dont deserve any part of their oil money     i remember it really well and it was funny then because i said in a few years these fucks would be broke and begging for equalization payments sure enough their economy shit the bed and the elected the orange commies to fix everything only to see theyd make it 10x worse     honestly fuck alberta i have no time for their shenanigans anymore theyre like the spoiled teenagers of canada     and this is in no way a defense of that dairyfree faggot fuck in ottawa i hate him too but his incompetence has little to do with albertas current situation the pipelines are getting quashed by amerimutt judges and politicians we were set to go with trump it was president nigger that didnt like the pipeline trump waved that shit through but some leftist cunt judge has stopped it again     america needs to get those death squads working asap
  oh yeah city slicker well i can leave any time i want for less than 2 bucks a gallon and no traffic in the way out
  got 55c off a gallon at shell yesterday paid 156/gal kroger is pretty good too but i dont think theyre top tier so i use those for the jeep       dick but i like it
  based
  gas prices are held artificially high by speculators hoarding oil reserves and processed fuel they keep tankers full offshore which also keeps that tanker from bringing in more and so on the price of most everything is kept higher than normal by these people who find a niche in the supply chain they can exploit it is winter so there is more gasoline available some of them are probably freeing up cash for other bets and they may not be able to inhibit distribution any more than they already are or it is just politics
  it was
157 per litre  whenever theres a crisis or protests the people need to be calmed down and gas dips slightly to 150 per litre
  674 a gallon holy fucking communism we have people paying 1 a gallon with rewards it is highly impractical to impossible for me to use mass transportation reliably for work so there is no way i could live with fuel prices that high
  gas dipped below 2 per gallon here  gasoline has never dipped below 3 per gallon here in the seattle area for some reason the oil companies resisted having price wars with each other so every brand of gas remains 314 or higher per gallon
tfw 165 for 98 and it has been going up every month
  yeah id rather be dependent on the car industry than be dependent on a public transportation system like some dirty communist
  french govt raises the max ceiling of gas belgium does the same something around 160/litre  my local shell thats usually cheap 130/litre or so caves in too as does every other gas station  slowly getting to 160/litre wallet is getting raped  the french start chimping out and kind of unrelated gas stations there start selling fuel at vendor price without profit to cuck the govt  chimping slowly spreads to belgium  2 days after it spread to belgium all my local gas stations have dropped to 120/litre    lmao belgians are incompetent most of the time but i guess at least one dumb faggot in the govt realised that cheap fuel and the fact that theres no chimpouts is beneficial for your economy good shit     t mutt
  dead dinosaurs  acktualy its dead plants from the cretaceous period  also sure the only manly cars are the ones running on gas and diesel since the alternatives are solely oriented on point a and b and economy but having this huge dependence on middle eastern petroleum isnt a stable pillar in the economy  itd be better to be dependent on our own resources rather than some tycoon in another country
  its not the exact same every year oil is a traded commodity the prices fluctuate with world markets there are about a billion factors its not like gas has never been this low 1520 years ago it was consistently under 1/gal
  your state has the 2nd highest fuel tax rates in the country
  i know it dips and used to be a great deal cheaper but i just didnt remember it being this low in a while
  180 here
  i shop at safeway safeway gas rewards are up to a dollar off so my gas is really cheap i wait till i am almost out of gas before going in and filling up
220250 p/l here shit sucks but its only a matter of time before we follow the frogs example
  i wonder why
  trump and saudi faggot had this agreement where they were going to increase production  then its winter and summer vacation is over and road trips are less common  then saudi faggot killed that one jackass and now they have to sell at prices low enough to make people throw their morality to the side  then trump and canada basically told saudi faggot to get fucked and ramped up production even more
  quebec fags getting 11billion in equilization payment when will they leave
gas prices arent low theyre normal adjust for inflation and its about 1969 prices  america produces 70 of its own oil now so we now have leverage against russia and saudi arabia in fact we produce more than either one of those texas produces more than iran or iraq    throughout the entire past 10 years america has doubled its oil production and even dumbass lefty environmentalists cant even trick people into thinking its bad even with 40 earthquakes from fracking no one gives a fuck about that     also chinas economy has slumped after the trade war put this shit in perspective we fucking sanctioned off an entire texas of oil iran and gas prices still fell  its over global market
  be in liberal shithole with high taxes  damn oil companies keep increasing prices  priceless
  its the saudis rewarding the us for letting them kill kashoggi free and clear
  i so loved paying almost 4 for premium
275 for 93aki lately a nice reprieve from 330    it will go back up in the spring though
engine is idling rough  probably not enough oil  redline the shit out of it  engine starts running perfectly
babys first italian tuneup
  serious question why does this happen i let my hog idle for 5 minutes if i ride right away she takes time to get power at high rpms but if i rev her slowly until she gets to high rpms while standing still she goes smoothly as a butter when riding is revving hard mandatory after a warm up before riding
bang rev limiter 5 times a day  anon youre gonna blow up your motor  5 years later and 70k miles and still sounds exactly the same with healthy compression

gts server maintenance notice for the upcoming december update has been posted  one week  just one week for the goddamn f50  i cant wait 
does anyone else play dirt rally with keyboard  its really hard to drive rwd cars

forza should make a rally game
  fm8 if it exists should have procedural rally stages
  i really should get the dedicated server for whiplash working again been too busy to though
  please do    i would also recommend to all whiplash players to use the svn versions of dosbox as opposed to the release version they are much faster and add voodoo 1 support for the 3dfx version of whiplash
  yeah im also having more fun stacking up games i think its because i am successful at having two stacks of my games but not very successful at completing them in any reasonable amount of time
whats your excuse for not owning this beast
is this luck or skill
  lucky as hell man
  i have an xbox 360 wireless speed wheel
  ten percent luck twenty percent skill  fifteen percent concentrated power of will  five percent pleasure fifty percent pain  and a hundred percent reason to remember the name
      stop using toys
  ah i dont have gloves i cant use that controller /
    what about this one
  now that shows some skill  nice turn before the last jump anon
  rwd cars are hard to drive in general i personally dont feel much of a difference between controller and keyboard im still pretty new at the game though and im afraid to do anything at all in my stratos
  officially controller of /ovg/
  the best disabled controller is a wheel with analog paddles where the shifter paddles would be
im disabled
why does race room run like such a turd in vr in spite of being so old pc2 runs about as well on high as this thing does on lowest settings
  how will that help with my disability autism
  autism isnt a disability its an advantage
  its rfactor its kind of a miracle it even has vr
name a better game
  dirt
  project cars 3
  because ancient game engines dont always scale good for for todays hardware
  theyre both rfactor
    works on my machine my toaster barely copes with acc in vr tho
epic downforce
  high quality takedown anon
proceed at snails pace  get predictably shit times  try to speed up a bit  this is what usually happens  i might be bad
  speed up a bit less  remember to slow down again for turns  drive a more controllable vehicle    rally gets harder the more you push opposite of circuit racing
  buying shit rally when dirt 4 exist  you sorry fool
  rendering two viewpoints offset from each other really isnt difficult its keeping them synchronized and at a comfortable frame rate that is the issue rr probably has some slow rendering routine that gets worse the more often its called you wouldnt notice it on one screen but on a headset any artifact from errors or dropped frames are really obvious
  i dont think you can pick another vehicle while youre in the middle of a championship i can play decently with fwd or 4wds but i like the stratos i also dont actually speed up much generally barely over 100kmh unless its a very long straight no driving assists outside of abs
  i was given 10 euros on steam so i bought this flatout 2 and garfield kart
  wrong    the negcon is the official controller of /ovg/  analog gas brake clutch and steering  native support in gran turismo 1/2/3/4 ridge racer rrr rr type 4 and rrv  other psx games just think it is a racing wheel because every psx racing wheel pretends it is one of these  works with most psusb adaptors for pc and other consoles    only downside is no ffb and they are rather old and the steering spring gets worn out after a while also some adaptors do not map the analog lbutton properly
  flatout 2  garfield kart  i see you are a man of cultured taste
  but if its that simple why is reiza saying its impossible for ams
  they forgot to delete coreshadersmas
  probably because the sweet fx they baked into the game shits itself in vr or they are not focusing on that because their market is mainly brazil and they just gave a lame excuse i mean easy in programming is entirely relative to the task at hand i dont mean to imply making a regular game work in vr is easy at all but its significantly simpler of a task than making an entire vr game especially a racing sim    rf2 is fucking glorious in vr and works beautifully though the menus could use some work i just have a 1060 and it was perfectly playable
why do you faggots never mention beamngdrive
  meme game thats only good for crashing
why does srs always have such a lack of honest gt3 action
  i need more of these  and its probably because popularity you could possibly get a really good answer if you contacted them most ac related stuff is refreshingly transparent
reminder that you will never roadtrip west for the first time ever again you will never be in awe as you hit the mountain state you will never slide your way through the snow covered hills for the first time again you will never see the lights of vegas in the distance as you descend into the desert for the first time again you will never climb into the redwoods for the first time again you will never hit la after an hour of travel for the first time again    _
  does it have online multiplayer
  there just isnt that much to do in beamng beyond putting automation cars in it if it ever gets proper multiplayer though hoo boy
  well you can rally but youll have to do your own timing and marshalling and recovery all the stock cars are fully tunable
  i have 223 hours in beamng trust me i am aware of all there is to do just for the average person there isnt that much to do but if you enjoy driving shitboxes around with little purpose it can be extremely enjoyable
  but if you enjoy driving shitboxes around with little purpose   driving shitboxes  that _is_ purpose
  comparing flatout to garfield kart  unironically kys
can you transfer liveries from fm7 to fh4
  implying garfield kart isnt a solid modern kart racer in a genre that gets literally no attention on pc  implying racing games from two different subgenres can be assessed as quantifiably superior to one or another    theyre both good games you shitlord
  from fh2fh3 and fm7  your liveries not shit you downloaded
  not shit you downloaded  that sucks
  forza cross game transfer thing is really really cool

finally a nsxr for 200k instead of 20mil
  fixed headlights  can you install the popups
  the 1992 nsx is already in the game i just wanted to be a special snowflake
  left over crest  i said left over crest sammy you got to leesen
  fixed headlights nsx  popups nsx
  im really looking forward to the reddit pass to get a lot more corners than that bit
  they need to fix the speed mechanics and how 100 mph looks like 30 mph and there is no reason for any vehicle to get air time at 30 mph over a small crest i appreciate their efforts on creating interesting crashes but the game experience itself needs improvement
  no way fag
  it looks so right
fr is the only drivetrain that makes sense to me  how do i mr how do i ff how do i 4wd
why is there no actual headlight flash button in project james 2
the pit manoeuvre is vastly underappreciated as a core racing skill on public servers
  rev it like bambambamam and select 2 for maximum respect
  how do i mr  dont let it rotate too much    how do i ff  camber iut the ass and maybe really stiff rear antiroll throw it in an use the throttle to keep stability    how do i 4wd  go offroad
  bind headlights  push the button repeatedly
  thats just faggot shit though
  no thats how it works in rfactor and rfactor is the single best thing
  i have no idea how to love ff but its probably related to driving it all the time and learning how it works i know that loving mr is next step after loving fr you just accept mr superiority after a while
yall motherfuckers need rr
  thx for the tip  is this better keep in mind on my screen this stripe is orange so theres differences between our displays
  project cars pro  
  thats for ascended autism
  project cars pro  lmao
  bring the whole think down and use the same brown/grey to break up the yellow and white rather than another color maybe try tilting the stripes a bit to make the design more dynamic
  based
  mr is like fr except it wont forgive bad habits so its less fun for new bois ff and frontbiased awd are the same just left foot brake everywhere
whyre there always more people watching jimmys stream than there are playing simracing titles
  simracing requires more investment to play at a proper level than pretty much any other genre of video game so watching someone do iffy to okay at it is a good compromise for people who like it but dont want to put in the time to do okay at it themselves
  nice
  what if theyre playing fun racing titles
  no hopefully it will eventually
ctype sees its first appearance in video games

    why cant you do this in automation
  maybe your car does have it you just dont know it does
i dont think you should be allowed on ovg if youre slower than highway
  larguu decides who is allowed on ovg not you
  cross ply bby      x
  kind of ironic that a person named after a road where you go fast is one of the slowest people on ovg

what are the most important assetto corsa dlcs to have for online  also assetto corsa meetup when i can host server
  tfw i cant get my controller to work properly in the svn daum build
bought a ps4 and pic related     i fucking hate it so far graphics are awful on everything except the car interior racing is the one genre of games where i give a shit theres no sense of speed the sound is weak and its buggy as fuck you cant accelerate without the framerate dropping     what is a better racing sim or should i say simcade because lets be real im not a sim guy if im using a controller for ps4     is asetto corsa any good project cars 1 dirt rally     i dont think its the game thats the problem but the port
  driveclub
  nice copypasta
  dont have a wheel  buy a sim  its shit  think buying an equally unfinished sim will solve your problem
  spork
  get gt sport if you dont have a wheel
remember juiced  those big dick long exhausts
  forza 4 doesnt have this problem it just works it looks good enough and it has a fuckton of cars that are fun to drive why cant they make another game like forza 4 with better graphics and a better framerate instead of just dumbing everything down
what type of ac server do you guys like
  forza works on gamepad because it is dumbed down
  gt3 at spa
  it just works
  to be fair assetto corsa is extremely playable on wheel
  modern spa or 1966 spa  im guessing the modern one server is up called /ovg/  gt3
  sim racing on ps4  ac has no vr  pc2 has no vr  gts has extremely limited vr  dirt has okay vr  big mistake
  ac has no vr  you can use the oculus with ac i have a friend who does it sometimes

  graphics are awful on everything except the car interior  good  theres no sense of speed  1000 horsedookie adjust fov/effects  the sound is weak  its average to good desu
  i specified on ps4
  actually is there not a good way to pirate studio 420 dlc or what i forgot that dumb shit is where it came from
  i think thats what they intended it to be
  sorry
  i meant gamepad fuck me im retarded
  shut up faggot
update rf2 for the first time in probably years  only way to download mods through steam is to update every single mod ive ever subscribed to at once  wow this system sucks huge ass like even more ass than having to download all of enduracers garbage for one car
  my bad
why are sim traxx so fucking good at mapping  its like ac official dlcs but better  
  cant join because im a cheap jew
  what are the stock cars i wish i coudl tell apart the vanilla cars from the dlc ones
  the huracan and non sls amg are dlc cars the rest are stock
  alright they should be out now
people told me about the whole vr thing and i thought they were making things sound bigger than they actually were then i bought into the meme and guise i couldnt be farther from the truth  the immersion is out of this world i almost came when driving the p4/4 around mugello at night in cornetto corsa good lord
  whats the best bang for the buck vr headset
  they focus mostly on rally and real streets where getting the exact details right isnt as important as it is on a proper road course or oval  plus they do it i assume in their spare time so they can get it to the point where theyre really happy with it
  welcome to the club youll like it here
  unfortunately youll get used to it    its good enough where i refuse to play any driving games that dont support it but not good enough where i will put up with sloppy implementations such as ac/rf2 where youre required to still use a fucking mouse and keyboard     also my oculuss face pad irritates my skin after 40 or so minutes which is annoying as fuck

id like to make a freeroam server with rally maps is this too many mods for a server should i make a pack with all the mods and put a pastebin in the server name
  ae86
  the fewer mods the better imo
how do i drive group b in dirt rally  its impossible to beat the times
  the tuned version looks like a rally car so i thought it would be fitting for a rally track    yeah theres a lot of mods i like but i dont want to force people to go download 3 different cars  if only assetto corsa had automatic downloads like gmod  this is probably better i was thinking of making an europethemed freeroam server with only 1991 and earlier cars
  there is not
  how could someone actually make rf2 even less desirable than isi did
  if only assetto corsa had automatic downloads like gmod  it fucking does but it requires a modicum of effort to set up so its considered haram by the ac community
  thats the best thing even without dlc pirating rfactor 2 is still the most desirable modern sim and by quite far
  man this genre fucking sucks dude
  i assume the assetto corsa devs never played other genres so they just dont know about downloading stuff from the server directly
  i love the game i have hundreds of hours into it so fun modding cars and just beating them around
  i dont have that tab  are you using premium content manager
  yeah of course its 1 euro
serious question i recently started getting into simracing how do i git gud
  with time
  you race with ovg
  i suggest watching this  same principles apply to other sims
  
  yeah looked interesting but i think ill end up being a backmarker and wiping other people out dont really want to ruin it for everyone until i can drive decently        thanks ill give it a look and put some hours in    i heard a while ago that there was a ebook which was decent black flag i think it was is there a way to get that without lining james pocket
  someone here can probably provide the pdf for you
  ask on mumble
  just join the god damn races that is the only good way of getting good youre not going to take anyone out if you can hold your line and that takes no skill
  how many people that have been joining /ovg/ races for half a decade and are still shit do you need me to post
  ye i run it with kb and cockpit view    its autistic how bad and innacurate input it is when using a kb    playing racing sims/arcade sims without a wheel is like playing dark souls without dsfix of racing games
    alright ill get that set up then and put some practice laps through and go for it
  there are some but its still much more fun than doing laps alone chasing a clock
morgan 3wheeler is actually pretty fun
  just go race on public servers those are so full of idiots already that one more new guy isnt going to ruin anything
  the first step is to learn what blue flags mean otherwise ill just pull a pit maneuver on you
if you have no tire a 22re can do sick skidz
  
  t absolute shitter
  for a dick on three wheels it handles nice as hell even bone stock maybe cause its slow
  t beta who tolerates slow ass backmarkers who connected to the server multiple laps after the start of the race
  assetto corsa is such a joke kek
  yes
  that only happens after you launch it for the first time    its very annoying but you only have to deal with it once
  its funny you should say that because its usually the nigger backmarkers who do the pit shit
  i hope i didnt overdo it
  pitting is a refined technique that goes beyond simply crashing into someone through incompetence     
    beamng and lfs are currently only driving games worth playing kinda sad really
  much much much better  id make the top curve follow the body like this if you could keep it up rr3guy
  i wanted to follow the headlight line imo enhancing the upper fender curve like this is overused    did you like the aliasing on the nonhorizontal stripes
  i say that to even out the negative space it also makes a nice dynamic shape with the bottom black shape its really up to you though     the aliasing i dont mind you cant really do much to get rid of it anyways
  hi super gt viewer
  i like super gt
  not that one
  i wih someone would make a driving game with the damage models of beamng terrain effects like spintires and speed and physics of dirt based on the parisdakar rally
shouldnt awd cars have the option to turn front wheel traction off with a press of a button why is this not a thing in games
  excuse you
  this is why they want us to move to vg
black cat county  lmao why is this forza tier shit even in the game
  the cruising around like a faggot not actually racing community is huge in r/simracing and they love their long ass tracks and mountain passes so kunos gave them something to play with that wasnt made by a man likely called oleg from google earth screenshots  its also an educational track because bcc is basically the biggest map ac supports before the physics start going to shit so you can use its dimensions to know if your track is going to suck then still release it anyway
  the biggest map ac supports before the physics start going to shit  tell me more about this how is simdadring able to work properly then when its considerably longer
fact gt3 is the most boring class of racing in any sim
  oval shit is
  we need to create the most boring shitty class of racing ever  gt3 oval racing
friend ditches me for cancerstrike instead of playing assetto corsa  /blog
  with spec gearing
  beautiful
  cs is actually a good game
  thats something i recall reading about when they presented the track plus since bcc has that one huge straight i wouldnt be surprised if the area of both tracks was similar  or maybe it was a limit related to rendering since its mostly open long distance drawing with plenty of grass and shit i dont remember exactly    in any case assetto corsa has a fairly low limit to how far from the zero you can get before the physics get fucky
  no tthe one you quoted but i find learning maps way more boring than learning tracks
  no movement skill required  point and click and holding angles  reaction time simulator  its the worst thing that happened to first person shooters imo
  kaz is way ahead of you on that one
  i shouldve known
  tbf id rather put up with the cs community than join an ac cruising/touge server
  this kind of thing happens with all games at a higher level desu
  traditional funfocused fps games died a long time ago  they were replaced by tacticool shit that tries too hard to be taken seriously to have any kind of fun in them  i miss rocket jumps railguns lightguns
  exactly like with racing games now its all shitty boring ass sims and no more arcade fun
  i actually started playing csgo last night after years updated new weapons and all    half the people now using 4chan memes as names and avatars    i no longer feel special
  the shadow govt is way ahead of you on that one
  the arcade ones are shit nowadays did you see the 2006 outrun   also theres a special fun in the added variables that driving simulators have over the simplified physics of arcade games  military simulators are absolute dogshit in the other hand
  4chan is now just a place on the internet the secret club died years ago
  arcade fun  is and always was dogshit
  reaction time simulator  how is this different from racing  no movement skill required  what  point and click and holding angles  holding angles depending on whats happening yes and its always changing thats good
  4chan memes as names and avatars  i dont really see any must be something more common in the silver sphere
  there is unreal alpha and quake champions they are not dead    even quake live is alive and i bet half life servers still exist
  well its not jumps like arena fps but if you dont move properly in csgo you will experience first shot rng or you will give up precious milliseconds waiting for your crosshair to tighten      from experience the community is almost as good as insurgency used to be the lack of toxic players is whats keeping me coming back
  milsims can be pretty fun if you play in an autism squad fucking dreadful on your own or with clueless people though
  how is this different from racing  racing doesnt rely entirely in reaction time you need to keep the racing line its completelly different from the reaction time you need in csgo so you can click in the enemys head faster than he clicks in yours  what  fps games are so dead and stale with tacticool shit that most people dont even know when fps games had bhop and rocket jumps jesus    quake champions hasnt got much people lately quake and unreal are a tiny blip in the radar compared to the absolute size of big games like cs andbattlefield    pretty much this you kinda need friends to enjoy milsims or battlefieldstyle games
  imagine hating fun so much that you just have to play a sim racer
oh vg
  imagine having taste as bad as this
my favorite arcade racing games are grid 2 crash team racing and sonic allstars racing
tfw james uploaded a video i partially agree with
  csgo  no toxic community  theres something wrong here
    what military sims i never heard of this
  milsims like arma squad insurgency  the whole idea of simulating human beings and warfare is pretty dumb the only real simulator genres are train sims flight sims and driving sims
  simulator is used for two different types of experiences true simulators which are accurately depicting the mechanical and technical aspects of a given task or machine but people also use sim to refer to something that attempts to have the same authenticity and feel of doing something for real even if the mechanics and technical aspects are vastly different  language is dumb
  last time i remember cs had bh and the reduced movement in those games does not remove moving skills id say it increases skill gap because in fast shooters you dont lose aim while moving unlike tacticoolers you have to be more careful
  ah i thought you could simulate tanks and aircraft realistically i doubt those games have realstic simulation
  correction  i thought you said
  bh in cs is minimal the devs have been trying to kill it since the earliest version of the original cs    ah i thought you could simulate tanks and aircraft realistically i doubt those games have realstic simulation  i wish theres vehicles but the only realism is probably the top speed and the sounds  tfw no flightsimmilsim mashup game
  tfw no flightsimmilsim mashup game  just play dcs dumbass  or i guess falcon 40 if you want something with a better campaign
  i played il2 and war thunder for a while  not interested in jet aircraft much
  oh gee see
my favourite arcade racing games are rfactor assetto corsa and gran turismo sport
  nice
  i can agree with all but   gran turismo sport  arcade
  serious dont know what it is but the people im usually paired with dont back seat game scream when they die or shit talk their team and when it does happens it usually stops when i or someone ask them to stop doing it usually followed by an apology    maybe this is the trust factor valve has been working on since last year but my experience has been positive      bhops still work in go simply strafe in the air without pressing w and steer your aim into the direction youre strafing jump  d  turn right    mag7 and mp9 have minimal rng when running/jumping too which breaks the mold of strafe cancelling aim duels      mine is whatever game i was playing as a kid
what should my antiroll bars be set to i know their relative stiffness alters understeer/oversteer but how high should i go for both of them
  optimal
  until you stop getting faster
i feel vr makes learning new tracks a lot faster
how can fuckers justify the cost and hassle of triple screen setups when vr exists
how can you fuckers justify the cost and hassle of triple screen setups and vr when owning a car exist
how can you justify the hassle of owning a car when vr exists
how can you fuckers justify the cost and hassle of vr when real racing 3 exists
how can
  vr can fog up its a lump of plastic sitting on your face which gets uncomfortable after a half hour it requires beefier hardware to hold a steady 90fps unless youre paying 1500 for a vive pro youre getting the screen door effect head tracking can also be done with 3rd party software      race tracks are not open 24x7
  hows the bus ride
  only mongs drive cars in european cities with narrow streets and limited parking spots
  theyre cheaper more convenient and more useful than vr
tripple screens are only justifiable if theyre set up properly like this anything else is just retardation
  is 122 a slow lap time for laguna seca thats my pb with an m3 gtr on ac
  nobody would ever not do that unless they fell for the super duper widescreen meme
  not bad i shitpost on /ovg/ from the bus sometimes    i do both in this crowded european city bus to get to work car for fun
  nobody would ever not do that unless they fell for the super duper widescreen meme  idk i see plenty of mongs like this fucking guy and his pc setup  
  odds are that guy doesnt have triple monitors for simracing specifically but rather for gaming in general as well as general workflow improvements so his setups going to be different compared to a dedicated sim rig
  its shit for a workstation too only makes sense for playing kuso games without angled monitor support and even then just get a 219 because they are going to be fisheyed as fuck
  that seems like a pain in the ass if you dont have a dedicated sim dad rig     want to edit a video have to switch it from epic sim dad mode to work mode
  the whole idea with angling monitors is that when you turn to look at the middle of the side monitor its facing you square at the same distance as the center monitor why would you ever not want that its only inconvenient if youre doing something like that shit where you have 3 tvs at 90 degree angles going all the way down the sides
  iirc rfagtor only supports 45 degree angles  so much for customize control connect
  why would you ever not want that    cause i have no real reason to do so i race just fine with the way my monitors are if i wanted the epic experience id just get a vr headset
  2005 was a long time ago
  so how does a sim from 2002 have it
    dont go for triple screens if you cant even afford a proper setup vr is still the poor guys budget choice
vr cucks so desperate for their gimmick peripheral not to die that they resort to this kind of evangelizing on an indonesian sand art newsgroup
  objectively and subjectively wrong
  being poor
  two more good monitors imagine having a single monitor though is like 150200 theres absolutely zero extra setup to use them every time besides switching monitor modes and you can use them for watching 3 different porn videos in full screen at once
  how can people be so unimaginative and stuck in the present vr is the future by 2050 the technology will be so incredible that nobody will want to look at a flat screen again
  even planning to be alive in 2050
  you cant get a single high refresh rate of decent size for 200 and you need a mount for them if youre going to do it properly
    the tech is already here soon to be demoed with project cars pro
  and then triple the graphics power    triple screen is outdated now anon
  how do i know if im getting faster from tuning or just getting better at that one circuit
  soon  its already dead lmao  
  you dont need fucking 27 monitors for triples unless you really like staring at headliners if youre worried about refresh rate you arent going to use fucking vr      and then triple the graphics power  not actually theres only like two sims in existence that have enough graffix for that to even matter though
  90hz is way better than the 60 youre going to get on some cheapo crap monitors
  thats what happens when you team up with project cars
  rip james career
make a new thread
  youre not my mom

  wtf
its been revealed lads now with awd
side shot
  inb4 they dont get the 50mpg they claim
reminds me of a brera
    ree ive always loved the brera and thought it was one of the best looking cars on the road        whatever i just hope the skyactivx will be reliable with the added benefit of more torque and mpg over the previous gen
  man fuck those long noses ruins an otherwise clean design
  reliable  301 compression in an unproven engine design
  now with awd  it has always been with awd
  i already got like 40mpg in my mazda3 with the 25l skyactivg and thats without trying to hypermile
      perro caca
  no it hasnt
  diesels get a super high compression ratio and are generally more reliable than gasoline engines    only time will tell
  more like 161  current mazda engines run at 141 and are already very reliable
  did they claim 50mpg  i didnt see anything when i searched  but a diesel engine getting 50mpg highway is not that amazing  there were cars in the 70s doing that
  allwheel drive will be optional a first for the 3 and mazda says its possible that it will be offered with the manual transmission  its a little frustrating that it would be relatively easy for mazda to do an awd 3 with a hot engine but almost certainly wont
  awd on a hatch  eehh
i too hate being able to see out of my car
  there was an interview when some exec told the reporter hot hatches are immature for the brand and said the msp and ms3 where childish     really tho between the hatches out there they dont stand a chance rs for hoon sti for dirt and ctr for performance its doubtful a new ms3 could best any one of these cars it would end up like the golf r cool if you want a golf r but if you care about anything else you will buy the aforementioned hatches
a nice 100whp    zoom zoom right lads
  based
wow that looks horrific
  there was an interview when some exec told the reporter hot hatches are immature for the brand and said the msp and ms3 where childish   yeah ive read that interview i dont understand how mazda thinks theyre going to break into the upscale segments if they refuse to build performance models mr midlevelmanagement doesnt want to buy a shitbox with a 180hp and weird engine that knocks by design the illustrious german luxury marques certainly dont shy away from building cars that are down right infantile by mazdas standards but they carry the performance wing of the brand image with them no problem    they could probably compete with the base wrx in the practical but fun category especially if they can get decent mpgs out of the car in a turbocharged awd configuration keep the price down and offer a slightly more refined package assuming the car doesnt do too well and subaru bring the levorg over badged as the wrx to steal their market share
  first time ive actually felt exited for an everyday modern car release in my short life and although its far from mazdas best styling this is probably one of the least worst looking modern cars cant wait to see this engine combined with hybrid tech too which im sure their testing as we speak
i want to hold hands with the sedan version
    why arent all automakers using website builders like this
cause you spend all your time building your dream car but then you realize that you only get to choose whats in inventory demanding your dream car means you are forced to pay sticker price because they know they have you by the balls
god what the fuck the way they set up the packages is cancer    you have to pay 43k extra just for a heads up display because it forces you to buy retarded stuff like heated rear seats electric review mirrors and lane keeping assist
  ford is that you
  the manual is more expensive and gets worse economy
wasnt this supposed to come with a green color  also my colorblind ass cant tell the difference between ice and silver is ice just slightly blue biased or something
  welcome to the future gramps manuals are nothing more than an /o/ meme
  ice is a very light shade of blue
  the manual gets worse economy because it has fewer ratios to work with and usually uses more aggressive ones that keep the car higher in the rev range for performance but fuck it over in epa tests    the manual could have more ratios if it were a sequential h patterns are unusable past 6 forward gears but old farts dont know how to drive them rich poseurs in porsche clubs either get the dct because lap times because the manual is built for larping or get the manual to larp and millennials interested in actual performance buy bikes
  when will we start seeing performance cars with sequentials theyre so much more fun  
  you get bigger brakes lighter wheels a limited slip wider tires and a better interior with the manual
  why the fuck dont they tell you that on the website
  jaguar has used the exact same website set up for years now they just dont have the fancy 3d shit
  but the manual is only available on the 20l turbo instead of the proper v6
  its not even funny how obvious the hyundai/kia shills are anymore
  you spelled proper v8 wrong  i would trade in my paid off car literally today if they offered a v8 manual gookbarge  but alas here we are
  manual in a luxury car    why the fuck do people thing this will ever be a thing    also who even makes manual v8 sedans anymore can you even get a v8 dodge charger with a manual
  tfw no more commodore  i miss it lads in 10 years the v8 manuals will be overpriced as fuck
  who wants this  me im sure a few other people like those who would buy fucking caddy/bmw/merc/etc manuals but are middleclassfags
you live in an apartment  you park in the same spot for years  faggot will randomly take your spot once in a  while  you shrug it off  starts parking near you like pic related  get annoyed tell landlord  he leaves notice on the guys car  faggot ignores it and still double parks beside you  without exaggerating i kill him fuck his wife etc what would you honestly do in this situation
  id pretty much grow up and get the fuck over it unless the spots have apartment numbers painted on them
literally park in front of the car until he or she comes out and rages cause they have to leave and then confront him or her they wont do it again    thats what my neighbor does shes fucking ruthless lol
assigned parking spots no find another spot to park
probably just a bad driver confront them like a man instead of the pussy way you do it
    they do have numbers and they are assigned you pick your spot when you sign the rent agreement     and how do you propose that wait around the entire day in a parking lot
  this just confront them look outside every hour or two and get a general time when they leave you dont have to wait all day from them to be there
cut their brake lines
  keep making complaints to your landlord and make sure they are documenting them so when it finally comes to a confrontation or property damage youll have a nice preface for the cops and insurance companies and/or maybe ask your landlord what towing company they use and call them up when theyre parked improperly like that
build a wall
   ignores it and still double parks beside you    guy in the red car is probably pissed the mazda guy doubled in his spot i would park right behind those fuckers and block them in
  its an aveo just move it
  give him one of these
  get in thru the passenger side and park yours literally an inch from his   if you cant enter/exit the drivers seat of your vehicle through the passenger door your vehicle is fucking gay and you deserve the bitch treatment youre getting
  you live in an apartment  you actually own your fucking garage because you dont live in an apartment so awful it doesnt have a garage  case closed move on
  did you have trouble passing english
plaster his windshield with stickers at night so he is late for his wageslaving
  wtf are those lines lol why is the mazda spot so fucking tiny compared to the other two
  meant for motorcycles
  what part of that was incorrect  inb4 his opinion
  i have three cambridge certificates you fucking moron
  send pictures to your insurance company they will tell you that you are not liable if you damage his car then scrape the fuck out of it a month later
  or just park with your passenger door to his driver door    but dont actually hell hit your car with his shitbox youll have no way to prove hes done this and even if you did hed just mention how shit you parked and its still on you    do as another anon said find out a towing company after confronting him and warning that youll tow him dont be a cunt as step 1
  do as another anon said find out a towing company after confronting him and warning that youll tow him dont be a cunt as step 1  i disagree go straight to towing let him know that too get a dash cam and in case he hits it
  without exaggerating i kill him fuck his wife etc what would you honestly do in this situation    kill him and fuck his wife
your drivers door is on the right opens into the grass  then just ignore them   otherwise park the other way
  so that car is parked illegally have them towed the red car will have space to park properly problem solved
  pay money for a gimmick that nobody will care about    kicked off mirrors are for free
call company have it towed
  weak youre supposed to kill his wife then fuck him
pull them valve stems
  i just make it harder for them to take my spot  just a couple inches at a time until they soon realize they are stuck and fucked
  tbikerfag
im a physically intimidating person so i enjoy the luxury of rarely being inconvenienced by this sort of passive aggressive shit from other men though i sometimes do get in fights with badasses but as i grow older i just call the cops on them more often since theyre always the ones to cross every line if presented with the opportunity
op can just ask the landlord to designate him a new spot for his car    problem solved
  call a tow truck is that difficult
    ofcourse you live in vancouver i swear this entire city is full of npc assholes    just wait in the bushes with a piece of rebar make sure there are no cctv cams nearby and just cave his fucking head in
  her
  we usually just call them shit
niggers
  they are crossdressers cars
im going to say the n word
  dont do it its racist

mfw there are people browsing this board right now that financed their vehicle  lmao
if you have good credit and dont wish to deplete a good chunk of money at once its not a bad option good credit plus decent down payment  not getting fucked on apr  t bought all my cars in cash because no credit
there are people presently posting on this board that have never even visited a picknpull  they pretend to be car enthusiasts and tell you your project is an inefficient way to go fast
  not just blowing a lump sum on a swiftly depreciating asset or driving around in a piece of shit and hating life  id rather enjoy life while im young instead of save for when im 65 to have a half decent car/house except i wont because id have no credit
  that pick n pull looks nice  my local one is pretty freakin sketchy and there are all kinda fluids on the ground mud and its just packed with vehicles so much its almost dangerous also bring your espanol
  2018  buying new  financing  not driving a 5000 econobox paid with cash

  can you help put that ridiculous meme to an end that crosstreks are dangerously slow and underpowered i had a hyper blue loaner and it accelerated well and handled surprisingly good headrest is a literal brick wall however
  not a meme
  quit busting my chode
  but anon    they are ridiculously slow
  the cvt shifts were smooth and without much effort im able to overtake other people on highways what more is expected my complaint is the cheap seats
  mine was a manual    its really too bad too because with a bit more power it would be a 10/10 car i think they are worried they will dip into the wrx/sti market if they put a turbo in the crosstrek
  yeh its pretty nice whole place is gravel and they dont hire skids to run the loaders so everything is nice    can barely find my car because squads of immigrants strip any old bmw/merc clean in an afternoon  confirmed the e30 coupe in the receiving lot had been moved to the picking yard that morning by the time i got off work literally every valuable part trim popout windows lsd bumpers etc had been stripped off  absolutely fucking insane i dont even know where these parts go theres never anything on classifieds and i never see other e30s out on the roads or at meets/shows
  crosstrek is near perfect for what it is an urban commuter with cargo space ground clearance and mpgs the good looks and manual option is nice too people that want and or need more power should buy the outback or forester of course more power would be nice we shall see how things go in 2020 surely subarus lineup will get bump in power
  my crosstrek is a cvt it is unbelievably slow   i will do all that is in my power to never own a cvt equipped vehicle again
  its slow yes but not painfully slow by any means its sufficient
  not only did i finance but i hit a rough patch and had to refinance 
  this i think your average anon forgets how adequate just about every modern car is actual econoboxes are just as shit as they always have been but everything even slightly upmarket is perfectly okay for dd use  theyre all muted bland plastic potatoes but theyll get you to the parts store
  mine is   hell i almost got into an accident today  in leftmost lane on a 3 lane road way  traffic is backed up in just the left lane because some dumbass is sitting on their cellphone  45 mph speed limit  see a large gap in the middle lane go for it  step on gas revs go up go practically nowhere for 7 seconds  almost rear ended by a mercedes that was probably doing 60 and was nowhere in my field of view when i pulled out  when i step on the gas i expect to go somewhere but its like with the cvt it will think nah he doesnt want to go fast oh wait his foot is still to the floor maybe he wants to go a little bit aw hell his foot is still to the floor ok i will go now
  what year i had a 2017 and drove on highways for about 2 weeks maybe your cvt going bad how many miles
  2013 with 78k miles
  financial device on 4chan u understand thats like giving relationship advice in a strip club
  tfw never been to a picknpull  only been to pull a part  am i doing bad /o/
  idk man thats a first year model right mine was just over 12k miles and accelerated fine maybe the later year models are just better if you get it serviced at subaru dealer maybe you can test drive a new crosstrek for shits and giggles while its in shop
  i had a loaner cvt 2018 impreza sport at the beginning of the year when getting the car serviced and while it did seem like a much snappier trans i dont want to fall for the cvt meme again   im planning on either paying this thing off and trading it in for a civic type r in the spring or buying an aw11/sw20 mr2 and continuing to daily the crosstrek
  why didnt you get manual i could be wrong but is that first year cvt for subaru bet its been revised a few times keep the crosstrek youd probably take a hefty loss
  i purchased it certified used from a subaru dealer and i needed a car then and there and it just so happens my favorite color is orange   its my 2nd subaru i love subarus just hate the cvt in this thing   i wouldnt take a hefty loss subarus hold their value almost as good as jeep wranglers
  subarus hold their value almost as good as jeep wranglers  im sorry to say thats not really the case with first gen crosstreks theyre dirt cheap around me but if you do decide to sell or trade it in the sooner the better since your mileage is kinda low id honestly keep it maybe even talk to the technician at dealer asking him if he notices any inconsistencies with your cvt your warranty should still be good or just expired either way subaru of america would help in some way
  no 150hp is not enough not for a vehicle as heavy as the crosstrek
  i financed through bank of dad interest is non existent and payments are minimal
  you can get a bike that outlaps and outaccelerates supercars for 3k brakes will suck though    you bet your ass its inefficient
  enjoy having no credit and having a harder time finding a place to live paying high security deposits on both your apartment and any services you hook up higher insurance premiums and building no equity

shitboxes will deprecate until they reach an inflation adjusted price of 1000 any running car that passes relevant regulations emissions etc will always be worth exactly 1000 2018 dollars inflation adjusted
my friend got one for 700
my ranger was 850
  buy a shitbox for 1000 euros  spend another 3k fixing body damage and mechanical problems so it doesnt grenade on you and passes the biyearly check up  yeah nah unless you want to get constantly pulled over by the police and collect fines whilst looking like an hobo
  incorrect
    you got a good deal i assure you any running vehicle in okay condition can be sold for 1k on craigslist
  biyearly checkup  fines for rust  i said dollars not euros you stupid fucking serf
  biyearly checkup
  shitboxes will deprecate until they reach an inflation adjusted price of 1000  nah shitboxes will depreciate until they hit 23 weeks of minimum wage in the area they are selling which in most of the us is close to 1k
  fines for rust  not for exhaust falling apart or driving something so poorly maintained that it puts your life at risk as well as the others  ask me how i know youre a flyover state guy
  italy ladies and gents  first checkup four years after the car is registered  afterwards every two years  then every year once the car turns thirty  of course if youre friends with the guy who releases the certificate your mechanic if he has an authorization hell pass anything but as a result the amount of shells on wheels is as close to 0 as it can get
  michigan
  oh i thought you meant twice a year lol  thats still ridiculous to me since the only time anyone says i need to do something to my cars is if traffic cops happen to see it and give me a warning
  cops will only pull you over and ask for drivers license insurance certificate and pink slip once every thousand years   and it can feel ridiculous at first but as i said if youre friends with the mechanic who does the checkup he can even pass a tuned car my guy once passed an eclipse gsx thad had its displacement raised to 30 with lan evo pieces even though it should be illegal here
  who the duck drive thirty years old cars
  he doesnt have people drive tiny 500 shitboxes from the 60s all over his town and making more noise than a f1 grid in 1991  he doesnt have that boomer with his turbo alfa romeo driving like he stole it  he doesnt have a parent who bought the car new had it stolen found it again and then fixed it up instead of buying a new car  anon thirty years old is manufactured in 1988 right now soon a lot of /o/s beloved shitboxes will be thirty years old even the miata
are they any good i want a nice reliable large sedan
  dont get the awd version it comes with a cvt     you should really get an 08 taurus or whatever the mercury version was called 35l duratec with a lot more power and 6spd auto
  ah my first car    great highway cruiser big back seat which was awesome in high school for screwing     the main problem mine had premier awd cvt was one of the cylinders would give out on the highway     bought a new car but kept it awhile no more issues as long as i didnt drive it in snow when i say snow i mean down a highway at 80 mph in a blizzard started to rust when we got rid of it you should watch that make sure it is clean underneath     repairs will be expensive if you dont do your own so be careful     overall though it was a good car
get a grand marquis you giant assblasted faggot
  cv/gm is a dinosaur compared to the s80 based 500/taurus or montego/sable
  whatever floats your boat butt pirate
  i want the slower worse handling less safe less economical less roomy less equipped car  an open diff grand marquis is nothing to write home about its almost like you think rwd makes up for all the panthers shortcomings
  this    vic fags need to die theyre the equivalent of furries who always manage to bring their shit into a conversation and not shut the fuck up about it
  panthers shortcomings    the shortcomings for this car pale in comparison to the advantages    stupid reliability  slow v8 boat classic driving experience like in grand theft auto for you zoomers out there  excellent beater / highway vehicle  v8 engine noise    the op said the criteria was a nice reliable large sedan and panther platforms are really worth considering put 500 into a nice stereo upgrade and you have an excellent daily    pic related is mine rip
  so have you ever driven or ridden in a 08 taurus     they drive really nice they have more power and better gearing which is noticeable the interior is nicer and theres a lot more rear leg room than a in a regular cv/gm and a little more rear leg room than a lwb panther like a town car or fleet vic but not the extra long town car l and again the taurus is better equipped too     just looking at the raw numbers the 68s 060 is 7s faster than even a 355 geared 250hp p71 let alone a grandma geared 273 open diff 220239hp gm     and theres plenty of duratec v6s with over 200k on them out there panthers have their common faults like autohvac unit failures power window motors failing bad intake manifolds etc no car is perfect but any car thats maintained properly can last
  wants a nice reliable large sedan  now he wants top of the line 060 times as well  can you get up to highway speeds in time to be safe yes 7 seconds is diddly squat and no one gets in your way when youre driving a panther body anyway
  i want an objectively ugly fwd bloated attempt at an avalon  carry on fudge packer      not a vicfag op wants a large reliable comfy sedan and is looking at a mercury that isnt the grand marquis hes clearly interested in driving it to and from rimjobs
  speed racer in muh better equipped sable  calm down
  defending the vics aesthetics   ah yes you mean the land boat sized blob with a six gorillion long front and rear overhang and an interior thats straight out a 1980s american shitbox     panthers arent even close to being considered really reliable cars shit breaks on them constantly   but muh taxi cab services and police use  the reason both the parties used the vic was because it was an extremely cheap mass produced large fleet vehicle that ford sold at a discount if bought in bulk if he wants a car that will go 300k miles he should just get a camry and call it a day
all these zoomers itt shitting on panthers and actually shilling nuford mid sized cars when op wanted a large sedan      if you want a nice reliable large sedan you get a panther because they made them till 2009/2011 and are pretty much the only way to get a modern day large sedan    otherwise dont say you want a reliable large sedan    hurr shit breaks on them all the time  not whats important the drivetrain is literally bulletproof air suspension obviously a shit but if you dont get that you wont have to deal with it    its roomy comfortable and more than adequate for daily driving    hurr its too long  thats why its a large sedan    fucking hell 4channel was a mistake its allowed all the zoomers to show their shit taste and power level
  ah yes you mean the land boat sized blob with a six gorillion long front and rear overhang  you mean the last of the longlived american sedan with a proper threebox design a flat beltline visibility for days and the trust that a driver actually knew where the corners of his car were  and an interior thats straight out a 1980s american shitbox  does it not have enough touch screens and knobs and dials for you what the fuck its got a flat dashboard no huge gauge cluster hump with a glovebox a radio hvac two power points and some cup holders its gloriously utilitarian and you can still stick an aftermarket cabinet thing on the transmission tunnel so your autistic ass has someplace to charge your dumb fucking phone youre posting from  panthers arent even close to being considered really reliable cars shit breaks on them constantly   every car has shit that breaks aside from the manifolds the shit that breaks on panthers is rarely if ever actually worth worrying about and is easy to fix or replace  the reason both the parties used the vic was because it was an extremely cheap mass produced large fleet vehicle that ford sold at a discount if bought in bulk   except there was also the gm bbody in the 90s and the fwd impala that replaced it both of which were also cheap mass produced domestic sedans with fleet discounts
  with a six gorillion long front and rear overhang  yes thats a large sedan     an interior thats straight out a 1980s american shitbox  the crown vic forever stayed in the 90s shitbox territory the gm and tc were much nicer especially in the 00s    the reason both the parties used the vic was because it was an extremely cheap mass produced large fleet vehicle that ford sold at a discount if bought in bulk  they were also easy to repair had no shortage of cheap parts and had large roomy interiors    its why police have opted for the explorer instead of the taurus that ford was trying to shill hard as the next crown vic because thats a large car exterior with a mid sized interior due to all the fat
  the crown vic forever stayed in the 90s shitbox territory the gm and tc were much nicer especially in the 00s  from about 98 on the interior and interior options of the marquis and the crown vic are identical in all but the badge on the steering wheel and maybe the quality of the leather seats if you got those instead of cloth or vinyl
  i guess theres a reason they axed mercury when the crown vic stopped really being different from the grand merc
  for the first six or seven years of the modern panther body 91/92 onwards the marquis actually outsold the crown vic consistently sometimes by three or four to one people especially old people really didnt like the the upside down bathtub appearance of that generations gm full size cars and hated it even more when ford used roughly the same body style but with the front clip looking like a squished taurus that didnt even have any chrome for the first year thats why in 1998 they started unifying the bodies the crown vic gained the marquis squared off roofline and quarter panels and in 2003 the marquis gained the crown vics fenders replacing the backswept cornering lights it had had since 91    mercury died for the same reason pontiac and olds couldnt survive no one really wanted to buy a middlebrand car especially when it was so similar to another cheaper marque that shared 95 of the same features sure you can take a crown vic or a taurus or an exploder and slap a silver wingedhelmet badge on it but its still not a lincoln and youre not fooling anyone that it is the vic survived so long primarily because of fleet sales and the town car and marquis by this point one of only a handful of mercury vehicles period nevermind ones still turning profit because they ran on the same platform and ford is a notoriously cheap and b didnt want to invest in a whole new replacement car quite yet
  if you can find a good one yeah go for it personally i own a crown vic though and i absolutely love it sure it gets bad gas mileage but you can abuse the shit out of it and your insurance payment with a vic would more than likely drop as a testiment to how safe and easy to fix they are
  maybe its just me and my stuck in the 90s mentality but 15/15 still seems like good mpg to me and i get about 165 city which tickles me silly
  you can abuse the shit out of it and your insurance payment with a vic would more than likely drop as a testiment to how safe and easy to fix they are  depends on where you are and how your insurance gauges how dangerous a car is mine fucking reams me because they ignore big slow car primarily driven by police and the elderly and only see v8 rwd
  oh ok youre just twelve
  twelve year olds are the ones shouting panther body bullshit and cant articulate why they disagree with something its a worse meme than the 3k civic
  no twelve year olds are still here defending a point of view the rest of us are just wondering who you know that had a lemon because ive never met anyone with anything negative to say about a panther car except on here where some asshole has deemed them too accepted and has decided to go against the hivemind for the sport of it and defend a shitty sable
  lol i just dropped in panther bodies are just dated and slow only an option if you literally dont have money for anything else its a sign of a newfag when people praise the panthers like its a godmachine probably why you dont ever see people talking shit about it because they get downvoted where youre used to talking about them
  downvoted  go back where you came from
  your reading comprehension is bad even for a 12 year old
  tbh i think the taurus is kind of ugly im considering the montego for its size and styling i dig the appearance
  see
  get a better insurance company
  reddit is next door buddy
  panther platform or get the fuck out
  you want the 0809 sable bigger engine and better transmissions otherwise very similar    the next gen taurus took all the things these cars did well and trashed them in the name of muh bolder stylin
  7s down to a 250hp 355 geared p71 without equipment in it and againthe gap is only going to worsen to a 220239hp 273327 geared grandma spec grand marquis that big of a gap will be noticeable in daily driving and youll be getting better fuel economy in the s80 based taurus/sable to boot       i want a car that was already 20 years outdated in the 00s  carry on luddite the panther chassis is like a wet noodle compared to the s80 based taurus/sable         just pointing out that the panther is slower less economical and most important in a large sedanless spacious even the trunk is half a foot smaller than the taurus/sable and 3 inches more rear legroom is a noticeable difference     its almost like were comparing cars from different generations
so after discussing with my local dealer im able to walk off the lot with one of these come january when they get it for around 25k after trading in my older veloster turbo    is there anything better than it new for the same price point i already looked at things like the si which costs a lot less but is a lot slower and the new gti but that is closer to 30k after trade in i want a turbo hatchback since im used to it at this point and i really am looking for that 25k sweetspot posttrade in
25k after trade in  fuck me i need to get a job as a hyundai salesman because those niggas are absolutely slaying right now like catching retarded flies with shitty cheap honey
  my car has lots of cosmetic and body damage due to an ex being vindictive along with having 150k on the odo    older velosters drop price like flies they were the best deal i got for a trade in worst was someone saying they wouldnt take it lol thats also 25k after taxes and title costs i think he said with no trade in its closer to 31k after tax and title costs
  31k after tax and title costs  31k for a fwd hyundai
  only 47k in my country
  only 47k  the amount of new cars better than a fucking hyundai group car you can buy here is astonishing
  if you live anywhere near dc its worth taking a trip to the area just to buy a gti its the most competitive vw market and you can get a new 2018 autobahn for 28k
  the only comparable hot hatches are the wrx hatch the gti and an optioned out si the first is a subaru and cheapest new wrx hatch around starts at 30k before everything said and done plus i dont want another subaru after the trainwreck of a legacy i had back in 2006    the gti cant even find new for some reason but the only one i was able to come across was 31k and the dealer only took like 2k off the price after trade in     the si was my 2nd choice cuz my gf has a 2014 si and i liked it but a new one is slower and roughly around the same price for an optioned out one     i dont want a sedan ive already got a pontiac g8 gt that my dad gave me and i dont want another rwd car either awd has always piqued my interest but ive never needed it really so it felt like a waste
  sadly i dont i live the most northeast you can get and dont have the time for travel lol
  meanwhile you could buy a st1 for about 20k otd with no trade in
what the fuck kind of gti are you retards looking at that shit is 27k off the lot with taxes /freight fees/docs included in taxafuckingchusetts
get a focus st base models start at 24000 and you should be able to get a few thousand off the price plus the hyundai is ugly and gay
  i live in a college town that also has multiple major military installations  gti civic si wrx focus st  they all fly off the lot here so dealers are far less likely to give significant discounts  mustang/camaro are in similar positions but we have 12 ford dealerships in my city and just as many chevy so theres a supply glut that leads to dirt cheap cars
  the gti cant even find new for some reason    as someone that owns a 2017 gti i will tell you that 2018 shipments have stopped awhile back and 2019s are very slowly beginning to trickle in     the 2019 gti rabbit comes in that same color op they will probably go for around 30k but i implore you to investigate it
  get a focus st    you do know they stopped making those right
   a focus st  you do know they stopped making those right  only just recently theres thousands of new ones on lots
  no one wants a car thats discontinued also it makes a poor daily for some due to the mandatory manual trans not that its bad just a hardship for some
  no one wants a car thats discontinued  no ones dumb enough to think this
  nah focus st is slower and ford is even cheaper than hyundai when it comes to parts and interiors if i ever buy a performance focus itll be the rs
  its slower but the n isnt 10000 faster or nicer that 20l problem history doesnt exactly inspire confidence either
  that car is worth 20k trade in or not its good but its korean
  you mean the engine problems the theta had from what research i did that issue was fixed for all models 2017 with it    and id need a brand new focus st hatchback cheapest one i can find brand new is 25k without figuring in tax and title fees
  fwd  hyundai  pls be trolling    you have so many better options  bmw f20 140i / 135i  golf r / gti  audi rs3 / s3  civic type r  brz
  all those are too expensive or not a hatchback
  it will be worth 9000 in three years no matter how well you take care of it why would you do that to yourself
  you know i found out gti has pretty good discounts in socal i found average of 4 to 6k off msrp
  yeah i said earlier i tried finding one but the cheapest i could get it was well over budget /      i dont think so the new performance trims of kia/hyundai seem to hold very well
  get a golf you beta fuck
  all the cars i want are discontinued

/o/ i fucked up     i put in my resume to a major dealership for a sales position the interview went smoothly the manager liked me and hired me nigga was wearing a rolex my shoes were worth 14 dollars     i have literally never had a sales position before ive never even had a job where its required to wear anything other than high visibility work clothes and steel toe boots     how can i prepare for this position
  oh look its another i applied to a job i know fuckall about episode     you goddamn moron i hope you know a lot about cars or a lot about bullshitting enough to sell them   i will tell you its a very cutthroat business and the second you outlive your usefulness to the company theyll just fuck you over and move on to the next schmuck     good fuckin look op your gonna need it
  nofap and reading makes you more eloquent
if youre working at a gm owned car dealership youll be fine just say yeah its safe and got good economy and boom the retards that buy gm vehicles will hand over the check
youre going to get two distinct kinds of customer the one that knows exactly what they want and the one that has no fucking idea  for the first show them exactly what they want theyre already sold on the car so youre just there to finish the deal    for the second let the customer talk  theyll drop some hints about what they want theyll focus on a few keywords big safe whatever shit people want in cars these days  then you show them the most expensive car on the lot while repeating all the buzzwords they said    in either case when you show the car to the customer let them fucking look at the car  nothing bugs me more than a salesman thats reluctant to show me the goddamn car  the best dealer i ever worked with drove the car to the front door jumped out then opened all the doors the hood the trunk and let me look around
youll know within the first two weeks if youre cut out for it or not    be prepared to have no time off always available to customers working past your schedule missing holidays/birthdays all for 14 minis and maybe 1 good used car crack per month     t sales manager at a mediumsized dealership
  this guy sales
  im not in sales just spent a lot of time in dealerships and like to people watch
just try to convice as many people as you can to buy a suv or a cuck over use arguments like safety and comfort whether its true or not  use all kinds of retarded boomer and stacy stereotypes theyll work pretty well just say stuff like  higher seating position is safer and easier to get in  suvs are always safer  they need that park assist or they will crash into something  that android / apple carplay / whatever the fuck will improve their life significantly  that package that includes a lot of useless shit is cheaper than buying 2 or 3 of those options separately  their little shits will be cooked alive unless they take the tinted windows option  the overpiced rebrand of some eco shitbox youre trying to sell ackchyually has completely different suspension and engines than the original  that 3 year maintain package with free air refreshers is a good deal  also try to figure out which cars and options your dealership has the largest markup on asking your boss which model he wishes would sell most is a good way to find out  during college is worked a bit in a used car dealership i once convinced a literal boomer that a clapped out golf was precisely what he was looking for and that the shittely installed subwoofer was perfect for classical music
i worked at a ford dealership briefly  all the salesman were compulsive liars i then got a job at the dsm plant in normal the people were fantastic the company could not sell cars and just couldnt compete     my opinion is that its better to work for the company actual not a franchise

  this is a fight you wont win  it may not be today  or tomorrow  or next month  but youll see
we doing fh4 tomorrow dont see a group yet
is it fun to drive in fh4 with a steering wheel
its another having to play a old version of rfactor 2 because of catering to subhuman poorfags
r3e has better sounds than most paid sims
  i have fun with it default ffb settings are crap though
  rfactor 2 isnt a bad game but its funny how some anons have been around this thread for years and in that time period couldnt save up thirty dollarydoos for something more relevant
so what i understain is that this guy posts here    
  no he posts on the sim racing reddit
  rate my driving  also i choked on the last 1/4 of the track because i dont know how to take right handed turns with a left hand steering car and for some reason the blow off valve sound doesnt play in the replay 
  james needs to understand that people with real jobs generally dont have the time to get into setup fiddling and multi hour races the way he does
  there are exploits in my game  but as a tester i choose not to report them to the devs and instead just use them against other people while feeling all smug about myself
  how is that relevane when those people arent going to win shit this way either because they dont have 10 hours a day to hotlap
  james  autism jamesetty ogonosketty btfo and exposed  never the guy  never drew a dime  benchracer  wescar jobber  fat  shit hairline  never had the balls to like 2d girls in spite of his daddy/girl problems  thinks oval racing experiences apply to gt3 and vice versa  banned from iracing many times only to return many times  banned/chased out from almost all known racing game forum known to mankind  all racing game developers hate him even ian bell secretly hates him  literally and legitimately autistic cuck and incel at the same time thanks to his bpd problems  manufactured the simracingdesign nr2003 drama by warehousing nr2003 mods in the first place  counters elitism in simracing with elitism  worked into a shoot by hornbuckle over t10 buying kunos news  worked into a shoot by ian bell so much he had to kill his own blog  worked into a shoot by sj over a track conversion  did two qa sessions and never completed the second one  is canadian but frequently pretends like hes american  his guide was cringeworthy  his novel was cringeworthy  endorsed paid forza rips  endorsed loot boxes  huge mark for himself in general  had a front for pedo shit livery in iracing  complains about simdads only to act like a simdad himself  unironically calls himself da best simracing journalist   is the simracing equivalent of that one insufferably mediocre developer whose sole professional achievement is staying in the same shitty job for 5 years  the biggest impact he had on the community was sitting around in the back and telling one of his nodraw buddies to bury games who could actually draw dime and have simulation value
    if you dont fiddle with setup so the car drives its best or practice so you drive your best you will not win ever  most of racing is pure luck the fiddly shit is just what you do to sway the luck in your favor
  james doesnt even drive the car in the picture you fool
haha i make the same 5 posts every thread thats what im famous for being the guy that makes those 5 worthless posts sometimes i even have to make them twice a day    can you imagine how impressed employers will be when i tell them on my resume im that guy who makes the same 5 posts in every thread in the /ovg/ thread on the 4channel image board not only will they give me a job instantly they will ask me to have sex with the ceos daughter daily between making my 5 world saving legendary posts
  thats okay but dont complain too much when the races that feature those two things prominently are ghost towns
so apparently someone dug through that mobile hotlap simulator called assoluto racing and found out the models of the cars were identical to read ripped from low lod models of other games  pic related the r34 gtr allegedly uses forza 3/4 lod1 model  and somehow the devs managed to get official licenses from car manufacturers to the point a racing game forum admin verified it talk about the carmakers being tricked into giving a license to an asset flipper
  gto  anyway heres the r34 gtr i incorrectly mentioned earlier allegedly it also uses forza 3/4 lod1 model too
  yea i havent done the tracks yet so its not all posted  should happen very soon
  sauce
who would win in a race one james or one /ovg/
why isnt the wat club showing up
  its already been proven many times james is not good at racing
    his novel was cringeworthy  you havent even read his novel
  the guy has like five championships
  you havent either
  i have though
  i was talking about a 3year old assetflip attempt called project ignition this thing  a while back on a discord server and someone pointed out on that server that assoluto racing ars dev did post something about project ignition used ripped models for starters i was recently shown pic related the forza r34 gtr model had a subtle flaw on the right bumper area which was naturally carried over to ar
fuck the dfgt my poverty tier setup is ruining muh immersion
  time to buy thrustmaster

  better game please
  i looked into doing a garfield kart series but its a hassle so sorry were stuck with horizon 4
  also if you own the steam version of garfield kart there is no online multiplayer the non drm version has mp for some reason
  but its a hassle  yall bitches are just too pussy to go up against my mad garfield kart skills
  this time i definitely overdid it  sorry      have a you      lol whats next  inb4 stolen gt4 models found in rr3
    he doesnt drink and drive
  forgot to mention the rr33 livery uses all 50 layers
  its not like the new version adds anything interesting anyway
  is the a class template as awful as the mg and levorg ones  by that i mean the left side is slightly rotated vs the right side so you cant just duplicate shapes you have to rotate them a bit and its fiddly and awful
  it just fixes a bunch of bugs that shouldnt have even been there in the first place and modern logitech wheel support
    i now have had an epileptic fit followed by a series of sharp migraines
  ah yes the red bull camo livery pretty good
  take that paul ricard shite out of my face
  rbdk/10    btw what does uop stand for
  its pretty good  its not that deep but its pretty good
  its don but its written that way so you can read it when hes rolled

its    race    day

if youre having trouble with unpacking the game files in the nested zip with 7zip use winrar for some reason some versions of 7zip cant deal with split files and shits itself

tfw just about ready to launch ricardofactor to see if ive installed it right  decide to delete everything and not race instead
  nice blog
  i thought that was what /ovg/ was for
  difference is firemonkeys/ea is a wellrecognized name while infinity vector assoluto racing devs isnt theres no chance firemonkeys/ea would do an asset flip otherwise the backlash would be gigantic
  pussy
  more importantly the mas file is necessary if you want rfactor to upload your entire livery without mas only your main livery file will be uploaded
  is this why i cant get my goddamn window banner to work on the mg

good races boys its been a while since i had this much fun
best series ever  i would like to thank the shadow government for being able to invent new never seen before multiclass combinations that are the pinnacle of fun
  i streamed or recorded the two first /ovgfh4/ events and likely the only 2 because there is exceptionally low turnout for tonights event so ill probably just can the series  
keyboard pride
  new tm slogan  thrustmaster the name says it all
  join wecjr
  i streamed wecjr you dick sucking homo faggot  
unironically the best fun ive had playing sims
  wow you really fucking suck at racing dude
  p good
what time do we start fh4

i can still signup for wec if i missed the first race or did i cuck myself
  fuck off were full

upgrading the default engine of a car in forza horizon 4 always sounds better than the replacement engines upgraded the 95 corvette with the default engine to s1 and it sounds brilliant
  tfw no autistic sim racing bf
  id turn up but i got a job and dont want to feel tied down on a sat
  you can come for a bit dont need to do all the races every week its not the spirit
s2 dirt racing  this very idea is fucking retarded but what should i use awd hypercar
sign up to wecjr
  are you looking to have fun rs200 goes in all fields  do you want to win whatever fucking s2 awd hypercar you also use for road racing because race tires grip dirt better than dirt tires do
  couldnt come today because i spent all day staining doors  maybe next week      awd senna
  rs200 sounds good trying the 959 rally car but its absolutely abhorrent
entire field except the ais has over 100 incidents  thats the ovg i want to see
  how the fuck did the ais get less than 20 incidents
  you cant upgrade to a default engine
  ranek is just that good
  have to swap engine to fit into a specific pi class  fug
  it has more trolls for sure but that collision model in that video no longer exists now that its been change its more controlled you still get wrecked by rammers but the billboard balls effect during accidents is not there anymore

  my favorite part about assetto corsa just joining a freeroam server and chilling driving at slow speeds and enjoying the view
  enjoying the view  i dont think anyones ever said this but freeroam stuff can be fun to drive going a bit below your limits means you have more room to drive a bit goofy
  i honestly love freeroam the feel of just driving with your mates or even with randoms is pretty nice  i just wish there was more variety than transfagarasan and mt akina online
assetto corsa roleplay servers when  you start with the cheapest street cars like fiat 595 or fiat 500  buy better cars over time by doing jobs taxi / delivery / cop / robber
  a properly set up brz with my waifu on it
  that sounds dumb as hell  id play it  but im pretty sure the game doesnt really like scripting on that kind of level
  the game doesnt really like scripting on that kind of level  i remember trying to join a pursuit server and it was retarded af you had to manually upload screenshots of street races to get the money its a shame but i guess its too much to ask for a simulator to be literally samp
  honestly if one of these sim racing devs made a barebones game but opened the whole thing up to lua fuckery ala garrys mod im pretty sure that trash game would still end up being popular
  oh so assetto corsa
  no thats just a barebones game that happened to get popular because people were tired of fucking around with rfactor i guess
  new game is boring af
  needed 5 ai just to get 23 cars in a multiclass race  sad  ai wins its class by over 20 seconds  ahahahahahahaha
  i think theres more chances of a gta ripoff casually adopting some realistic physics than any racing sim allowing modding to that degree
  wrong
  good taste
dirt racing team adventurer  fastest driver is in a fucking truck  he rarely brakes just bounces off walls to change directions  he isnt even a shitter because he corners properly around turns without walls  its just that hes realized this is the fastest way to race  nose diving meta
why do brakes in rr3 feel so bad i have my cars fully upgraded but the braking power still feels like shit
  stick with the mustang then use whatever you like and tune it till it feels good if you know what the brake pedal is youre already better than 80 of the people online
  what a sad game
  give me collision off racing with no barriers on the turns
why is this in /o/ shooters are not in /k/

why is fh4 multiplayer designed to reward skill as little as possible why did they make the game as uncompetitive as possible
  we have always had ai drivers like staiguy
  playground sucks dick and if youre on pc your other options are fh3 and fm7 both of which run like garbage
  there are different models for different cars  some focus on downforce and require little to no braking you can coast across corners without skidding  some have just weaker brakes but allow for longer braking they dont skid when you keep braking on the turn  and some just require slow in fast out    protipif you can ditch rr3 and play gt2
is forza horizon 4 worth it i just want to play around with engine swaps and britain
  on sale maybe otherwise no it gets old quick
  because its forza
  how about horizon 3 or motorsport 7
  horizon 3 is garbage  motorsport 7 is ok but youre not going too all that many engine swaps in britain
  if that is what being sad is like sign me up for some crippling depression god damn

i bought g29shifter on black friday coming in a few days and i am pretty excited   havent driven a manual in 4 years since i got my driving license and i got a question  so like say you are in 5th gear and a turn is coming so you have to slow down do you go from 5th to 4th to 3rd to 2nd one by one or can you go directly to say 3rd or 2nd  if the last option how do you determine which gear to go to is there a like a formula to keep in mind between speed and gear or something like that like how do you determine if you have to go directly from 5th to 2nd or from 5th to 3rd
  just gotta know each gear has a max speed it can handle exceed that and your car will spin and your engine might die
  buy my summer car and learn the fun way or beamng if you are boring
  rrrrricardo milos do brasil
  yes
      
  
how many people play pcars 2 online on pc is it worth getting for that
  usually like 3050 people online
  thats not a lot for such a big title i thought they were trying to mimic iracing surprised that didnt catch on
  the online multiplayer system kinda sucks    the first title being ass didnt help
  afaik pc2 has no online structure like iracing has only lobbies and league dedis so much for trying to mimic iracing  if you cant afford the superior product you can get srs for ac or reeeeee and maybe find some scheduled public races like iracing has or wait for chapter7 or s420 to release the modes theyve announced about 20 years ago and pretend to still work on maybe acctd will get it at some point idk i estimate it will take them at least 2 years to get the game to a point it can do a whole 3 lap race without crashing so the whole scheduled races with matchmaking thing looks like a very optimistic target
  you memorize at what speed each gear needs to be shifted up make sure when you shift down you are not exceeding that gears correspondent max speed it needs some practice but going by sound is easier learn the sounds your car makes at the beggining of a new shiftup and use that sound to know your shift downs when braking i cant think of any use for gear skipping other than when for some reason you stopped your car maybe in a crash and you are still in high gears
  tried cant do it  either that mustang is one of the meta cars or that mustang is niggardly awd tuned
  where do i find the club i searched that in the xbox app and there is only one wat club with 4 members
  pc2 suffers from a reputation of being a simcade console game with cunt devs
  i do play on iracing but its all spec shit and not classes with different cars besides gt3 i frequently play r3e on simracing system so i guess ill just keep doing that
  you memorize at what speed each gear needs to be shifted up make sure when you shift down you are not exceeding that gears correspondent max speed  there are people who dont drive entirely by sound  when the vroom is at a certain point you just know you can jam it into a lower gear you can even do this irl to a slightly lesser extent
  watr  wat was taken because the good goy early accesers were slow
  pc2 is mostly just gt3 too desu
  read the wiki  
  if you are in the uk there are a decent amount of servers during uk evening hours it drops off during american hours
    im in
tfw will never set a good time for anything no matter how long you spend hotlapping  just kill me now and send me back to the arcade shitterpit
why are americans not into simracing every game shows a big dive in player count during their hours
  theres no such thing as talent only experience and patience
  even iracing
  arcade racers can be hard too anon
  who the hell said anything about talent  also you lie
  yeah
  there is people without talent will never be truly good no matter how long and hard they train   painful mediocrity is the best thing they can hope for
  who painfully mediocre race team here
  not me im a /ovg/ shadow government sanctioned race winner
  there cant be only 150 people playing iracing at peak times
  well fug you too
  yeah so slightly more than painfully mediocre very nice
  thats true but for your average simracer competing in an average league talent isnt needed just practice
  through steam
  remember slow in fast out
  i do that but i never get the line exact and the other person/ghost keeps gaining and gaining even if i get a slight lead at the start  and because 4za i can never know how much of it is actual difference in skill and how much is just using the wrong car/tune
  1 iracing member site numbers are wildly inflated because its everyone on the site rather than in game  2 most of them arent on steam    but yeah 100 people at a time racing three fixed oval series every night arent going to compensate for literally every road series being fucking dead after 5pm et
reminder that this is the last thread
  like hell it is          
why is public transportation more expensive than owning a car    bus/rail pass is 6/day  30 per week    car is 50/m insurance 14 week  22m roundtrip at 2/gallon  24 per week    also you waste a fuckton of time walking to and waiting on buses/trains also not being able to go wherever whenever you want to sucks
  because the state has sponsored a private or even public industry by more or less forcing you the tax payer to subsidize the company even further     also where the fuck is gas 2 dollars a gallon youre also assuming that insurance is that cheap because you drive a garbage 90s/early 00s car that is only worth like 3k at the most
retard tax for being too stupid to pass a drivers exam
zoomzoom no like independence zoomzoom rely on bus
  because thats what it costs to run rails and busses you think this shit is cheap and free
  6 bus pass  2 gas  what part of the world do you live in
      not living in the south  not driving a 3k civic
  plus the thousands to buy the car and repair it when it fucks up
  not actually answering questions
cars have significant double up upfront and upkeep cost
  and secure parking
  public transport has significant sitting next to niggers costs      pay for parking  hivepeople are adorable
  leaving your car on the street for jamal and jose  whew
  public transportation  the south   nobody in the south has anywhere to go except the welfare office anyway
  living in a city  not having a five minute drive from the street to your house
  ur car listing isnt even including the cost of the vehicle lol
  living in a state with niggers  move to maine or the midwest
  implying white meth trash indians etc dont embody the spirit of niggers
  i hate public transportation but those car numbers are bullshit
    shit boxes are cheap to insure and gas is 2 or less a fucking gallon     whats hard to believe
  dallas  but a monthly dart pass works out to about 3 a day not 6
  those mainers sure do love their meth as well as lobster and hunting i enjoy 2/3 too bad im deathly allergic to shellfish 
  yeah in one fucking state its 34 everywhere else
  gas is under 2 here in texas amigo       not taking maintenance into the equation  thats a big ass part
  walk to bus stop for miles  stand and wait no matter the weather  no matter what time you need to be there you have to abide by the bus schedule  ride in a disgusting cesspool for 30 minutes  get dropped off somewhere kinda near where you actually need to go  walk miles to get where you need to be  96 local/monthly dart website  or 192 regional  literally paying money for this    or save 3000 buy an old crx lol 4050mpg and spend 40 a month to drive up to 800 miles wherever you want throw in 60 towards maintenance a month same price as public with 10x the advantages
  gas is under 2 here in texas amigo   thats only around some of the larger cities where theres a lot of competition
  banged a girl from maine and can confirm
  wrong only if you live on the cuck side of the country  
brand new nonchinkshit/noneuropoor 40 bus is at least 130000  bus gets 2 mpg on a good day  120125 gallon tank of diesel  engine still spits out absolute garbage  with the exception of extremely busy routes in places like brooklyn or manhattan every bus line actually loses money per run  all the costs associated with paying drivers and management salary  benefits
  midbest here just filled up at 213 at the friendly pajeets around the corner stay jelly or dont its still cold and shitty here
  bus/rail pass is 6/day  30 per week  you can save a lot of money with annual subcriptions i pay 340/year so about 1/day or 7/week in burger money and it covers pretty much everything but hsr  regional express trains are included and go up to 160 km/h 100 mph here  car is 50/m insurance 14 week  22m roundtrip at 2/gallon  24 per week  plus wear depriciation and parking
  post blond bikini gf
  parking  i havent paid for parking outside an amusement park or concert in like 15 years lol who pays for parking except people who live in garbage places
  people that live in nongarbrage places
  soco its 240 my grocery store has a rewards program that lowers it down to 210 by the time i pay for it
  live in toronto  government constantly bitching at us to take public transport  costs more to use public transport  takes 3x longer to get anywhere  no incentives to drive small cars asides from charging gas guzzler tax  gave out a 14000 rebate for tesla purchasers including the bigass model x   every politician and their stay at home wife drives a suburbitank   literally 0 incentive to get rid of their obnoxious murdermobile  every wannabefarmer accountant/ it guy drives an f150 platinum to tow their 500lbs sailboat twice a year  company vehicle so no reg sticker lol  pic related smaller vehicles  less space used who woulda thunk     we need kei cars to fix things and a social stigma against driving long ass vehicles
  to fix what
  fuck off
  live in boise  bus is 50 cents for a oneway trip  laugh at overpriced canadian public transport
  why is public transportation more expensive than owning a car  bus/rail pass is 6/day  that price is actually much lower than the true cost of the public transportation if you had to pay the actual cost it would include prorated amortized portions of employee medical plans that cover all family members cost of 401k matching cost of lifetime pension plan cost of automatic col increases the cost of the multiple bus terminals park and ride lots trashcans and trash pickup vandalism repair training programs etc even for my city it is billions of dollars it was said more than once in multiple decades that it would be cheaper to the taxpayers to lease a new car for each bus rider and provide it to them for free than to run the bus system and collect the fares thats how the numbers worked out    so while you see the bus fare as being large to yourself it is actually small because a lot of the cost is still subsidized by the taxpayer who has to keep paying pension plans and medical plans and disability plans until the employee spouse and dependents die off its pretty huge costs into the distant future
  north alabama reportin at 207/6 for the best price and even further down with rewards cards    i filled up at 195 the other day
  now look at the cost where i live    unlimited 7 day pass is 32 30 day is 121  lowest insurance rates are 260290/month depending on car gas is 275/gallon    and this is before you consider that parking spots practically dont exist and in many cases the train is faster than sitting in traffic
  is that just for liability    my town has bus routes lolnope and insurance can be as low as about 20/month for nothing but liability in an old shit box a 1983 mazda b2000 and thats coming from a new driver
  you forgot to include the cost of tires oil other fluids batteries other miscellaneous wear items repairs and the cost of the vehicle itself
  he pays for things himself    noob
  is that just for liability  yes    to be honest it is partially me i am 22 and have never been insured because aforementioned factors make car ownership seem downright unreasonable but part of me still wishes i could actually partake in the automotive hobby    oh and one pro for cars even in the city is you dont have to walk to work when its raining or snowing or just 10 degrees and really windy
    in vancouver they want 170 a month for a transit pass for that money you have to be crammed on busy trains get sick from all the flus and colds sit next to chinks niggers and poo in loos and take forever to get anywhere    170 gets me a month of insurance in my car and over 1000km in gas to drive around with in my metro public transportation is for absolute npc proles
  where i live an unlimited monthly bus pass is 50 insurance is 150/month and gas is 130/l you also have to maintain a car to keep it running pay for parking buy it in the first place etc not even a busrider but come on op
  my cars are around 25/mo for insurance  what are you doing wrong
  170 a month hooooly shit
  i always get really anxious the few times ive used public transport like the bust leaves at x time and if you miss it by 10 seconds youre fucked until the next one comes around in 10 minutes while in a car you can just drive faster if youre late i cant stand having a series of timers set out for me that i must meet and revolve my life around
  how about they allow fucking lane splitting   also toronto is the last place anyone would want to not drive that western wind is fucking brutal i wouldnt want to spend any more time in the winter outside than i had to
  lmao for me public transport is like 15 a week versus car which is like 70 a week
  car is 50/m insurance 14 week  22m roundtrip at 2/gallon  24 per week    damn dude i dont know what fantasy land you live in where its that cheap but id be happy as fuck to drive my car for that little    meanwhile in cuckfornistan  150 / month for insurance  gas is 4/gal   120 / month for my 62 mi / day commute
bicycling to work  not living 60miles from work  owning a small truck to haul shit that would be inconvinent to carry on a bicycle like furniture friends and scrap material    living in an innercity tiny yardless box with no room for furniture friends and scrap material   walking home from the bar instead of driving drunk home from the bar 3
  ops estimate is dead on for me in the midwest
  not having both  poorfags the lot of you
the trick is to live in a civilized country not america and enjoy a cheap short reliable air conditioned trip into the city center while expanding your knowledge with a book or appreciating any song the world has to offer also there are no black people here
even in germany where petrol is basically liquid gold because of taxes going by train is still even more expensive and thats not even including tram and bus tickets from/to the train station its ridiculous you can get a card that reduces all prices by 50 for 250 but even then its not much cheaper than a car while being absolutely unreliable and slow
  nigger retard idiot dumb fucker  i hate this reply theres something about the way you write that makes me want to beat you up god damn bus rider i challenge you to a duel
  same in the netherlands    it doesnt work like that though there are many extra costs to consider on a triptotrip basis though even in europe often car is cheaper than public transit
  5k shitbox use it for 10 years  500/year not including gas maintenance and insurance costs  unlimited bus/tram/subway pass  45/month    your public transportation is just shit m8
  bus/tram/subway  whoa i can reach any part of a fucking city for just 45 bucks every month i really dont need a car now
  youre also assuming that insurance is that cheap because you drive a garbage 90s/early 00s car that is only worth like 3k at the most  t drives a car on loan stipulating full insurance  stay made retard  insurance is dirt cheap if you arent driving a loan or arent a total idiot such as yourself please consider leaving this website
  damn then i envy you guys been thinking of moving out to n carolina might be able to actually save for retirement there
  buses do the most road damage by far so those fuckers should pay
  depends    going to job 1  subway 35m  car 2560m depending on random jams  bike 30m    going to job 2  subwaytram 15 hours  car 40m  bike not even worth trying
  pretty sure a dump truck overloaded with gravel does far more damage than a bus
based w220 s class  gas is under 3 a gallon  insurance is about 90 a month  procuring blowjobs and sex in the back on a whim    pricless    not having to look at smelly niggers and other disgusting mud races more than necessary during the day    worth fighting for    public transportation would be lovely if it were a homogeneous country
  nope most average 6 axle dump trucks in north america cant really carry that much weight if its gravel boulders can get a little heavy but theyre usually under 30k lbs city buses are 40k lbs and ride on a single rear axle you can see the massive ruts they form on the bus routes
  definitely depends on your location  my work fully reimburses public transit but its a 44 min bus ride vs a 14 min drive the routing is terrible
  is this western maine were talking about never saw meth heads in south east maine i always thought heroin was the business in maine
public transport in usa is ass  brother needs to get across pa  start near bloomsburg  take bus 20 minutes to scranton to board for erie  bus is late to scranton and another one doesnt go from scranton to erie   miss bus transfer  have to call parents to drive me to college  get 20 dollar voucher for getting screwed out of 90 of the ride   fuck public transport the ticket was 200 dollars
  i guess if we are talking about a poor country but if we take germany for example why not make public transports free they absolutely have the money to make it free
  woah is that scranton from office 
  yeah but the office wasnt filmed in scranton it was just about scranton
  live in chicago  public transit is 250 each way  5 a day x 5  25 a week to take the train  gas is 289 a gallon  i live 3 miles from work    id totally drive if my office wasnt downtown and parking wasnt 20 a day that is where you get fucked over
  live in idaho  50 cents is the weekly salary
  dont care that is awesome
  literally nothing happens in scranton fam  they do have sheetz instead of wawa though
  going backwards from bloomsburg to scranton instead of just going to williamsport  willingly going to the shithole that is nepa  anon i
  they only have sheetz where meth is a common pastime
public transport is free you just walk on the bus or train
  was never my gf buut okay
  wearing a seatbelt  what a fag
  you dont pay for parking in rural suburban and medium density low rise urban areas i can only assume youre referring to high density high rise downtown cores which are objectively shitty places to live ie garbage places
i paid 50e for a year lol  best public transport in europe too
  199 in north west missouri frend
  depends where you live public is more expensive and not that convient but with owning cars theres all sort of extra payments insurance taxes inspection maybe something breaks and youll have to buy parts and have to pay for someone to do that for you if its out of your league   even though im poorfaggot ill rather pay some extra instead of waiting for fucking busses or trains
you have to get a subscription
looking to buy a luxury car for driving around and impressing clients    i am not a car person at all i just enjoy the look and feel of cars    the two i am thinking about are the 2017 alfa romeo giulia in that nice blue with a tan interior or the 2017 lincoln continental with the light interior    any advice on these cars i do not want to have to spend mad time and money maintaining them other than oil changes etc
if you really dont give a shit about cars but want to appear like you earn at least median wage theres a thing called lexus
  i am looking to buy either italian or american i did like the lexus hybrid i tried once though
  not a car person at all  buy the lincoln then the alfa will require regual maintenance from your part
the lincoln will make you look like a uber driver
if you want to impress clients get the giulia its a conversation starter and its a good car the lincoln will make you look like an airport taxi
  this at least the lincoln has ford parts the alfa is from the fca family so good luck i personally like the lincoln better anyways best interiors on the market right now for anything close to its price point
  anon hes not a car person the giulia requires the kind of attention only an enthusiast can give near rx8 levels the lincoln is not as good but atleast doesnt require that much attention
      what kind of maintenance to clarify i am able to do maintenance on cars as i rebuilt a saab but i dont particularly like cars as in i would rather be doing something else than fixing/taking a car to the mechanic all the time
  impress clients  not thinking that the client just thinks youre overcharging them since you pull up in a new alfa
  parts  depends on the country honestly alfa in italy still has brand new parts for the 75 and 90 for fucks sake they are producing them again under the heritage program i can see why itd be a problem in the us though
  rebuilt a saab  okay thats impressive if true however because youd rather do something else im not recommending the alfa just regular general maintenance but by someone who actually gets shit done well in the us a mechanic specialized in italian cars sadly else the car starts falling apart around you
  it was a pain in the ass to do my dad and i did it when i was younger hmm seems like everyone is saying to go with the lincoln    i guess that will work out fine because i only use a shit pickup truck now damn though i might grow old never having enjoyed a luxury sports car when i was young
  looking to buy a luxury car for driving around and impressing clients  i am not a car person at all i just enjoy the look and feel of cars
  luxury sports car  literally a meme op if it has luxury then it weighs down the car too much be true sports if its a true sports car then it has the bare minimum equipment really if you want something that is luxurious and sporty youre looking for a grand tourer like an aston martin or a late 90s ferrari
  look a massive larp post
  not sure why this makes me a retard i can enjoy cars without being a hobbiest that knows stats and all about models and types      i guess i might as well go with the luxury of the lincoln then hope it doesnt actually make me look like an uber driver lol      how is this a larp at all i am asking a question sorry if i did not ask it properly i have not used this board before other than to ask something about my saab
your clientele matters as well if you have younger and/or more hip clients giulia might impress more if you entertain older/more reserved clients the continental may appeal to them
  stelvio its italian so any noncar people will instantly think its better  and its an alfa so any car person is instantly going to know its awesome
  if it really worries you that much save up some cash and have some specialist refurbish the interior in a worst case scenario doubt itll have to come down to that though
  the giulia requires the kind of attention only an enthusiast can give near rx8 levels    are you a fucking retarded idiot talking out of your ass or youre just memeing    hes not buying the quadrifoglio were talking about a 20 turbo petrol engine with regular manteinance    the car is reliable so fuck off already with this disinformation
  stelvilol  fuck no literally a giulia crossover takes the worst of the car and turns it into the worst car type currently in existance
  yeah to clarify i would not be buying the top of the line sports edition of the giulia but the sedan one
  believing surveys  if theres one retard here thats you im actually italian my mechanic specializes in alfas and i know as a fact that any italian car requires regular maintenance done by a competent mechanic in order to run perfectly which can be a major hassle for op since he isnt interested in cars
buy a tesla
  the stelvio is literally the only crossover that driver like a sedan in this case like the giulia you get like 85 of the drive feeling of the giulia and this is fucking cool
  (((trust me im italian)))    sure thing rabbi
  this is why we need the fucking flags from /sp/ almeno mi risparmio il mal di testa con ste teste di cazzo che credono di conoscere lalfa meglio di uno che è cresciuto tra alfa e lancia porco il demonio
  inculati te ed i tuoi meme    la giulia è affidabile e non ha dato particolari problemi di sicuro non con i multiair ii nè con i multijet nuovi    se sei cresciuto con le alfa di 30 anni fa non significa che quelle moderne facciano cagare in quanto ad affidabilità    tldr he grow up with 70s alfa romeo and lancia cars so therefore modern ones are still unreliable as the ones he used to live with pottery
  the lincoln the interior is hella nice
  fpbp    lexus ls460 is always the answer
  i do not want to have to spend mad time and money maintaining them other than oil changes etc  then get the lincoln those two cars are polar opposites when it comes to maintenance
  u need something thats a mix of reliable frugal and comfortable since u r a car pleb anon    highly recommend lexus or acura    t mk7 golf r owner no biases
  driving client around in your alfa  anon why is your engine light on
  the continental also has much much better rear seating very spacious and comfortable
  executive cars  volvo v60  wagon  what now
catch me with my brz eating machine
  just stop please
  isnt that a fox body mustang
yall remember what happened to that idiot with the ralliart and the chicken  same shit will happen to this retard and his daytona
bruh its got like 20 year old chink rubber on it
  nice pontiac sunbird
  i remember the impreza one but not the chicken  refresh my memory
  please tell me someone killed that faggot
  crashed impreza that was a meme surrounding equinox and his idiocy  was a guy in aus or nz and he kept fucking posting pictures of his lancer ralliart and his chicken hed occasionally post pictures of like look what i found and its an exhaust in a bush near his house he also had access to an 8th gen euro ctr kept posting pictures of his chicken in and on both of the cars   he eventually stopped posting or got banned i hope its the second one
  that sounds hilarious  probably because i rarely lurk here
  i remember
  how the fuck could you even think it was a foxbody
  theyre both really ugly
  oh youre the fag from the other thread cool keep being delusional and having awful taste
    because it is dumbdumb
  the rear spoiler lights etc im not really into fast muscle cars so i dont know
  the fuck are you even talking about sounds like im not the only one who thinks its ugly
  i mean you pretty much nailed what separates it from the foxbody the headlights are highter and less wide while the rear ends lines are more straight
    because you arent the only one foxbodies are fucking hideous
  your moms fucking hideous
    she is i dont know what my dad ever saw in her
  i see the headlight difference but its literally the same car i guess it comes down to if your prefer dodge or ford more
  but anon thats a mercury capri
  which is a foxbody that manages to be even uglier than the mustang
    shes a foxbody aint she
please kill yourselves
  that has cobra wheels
  i still keep seeing the mercury capri mark ii
  keep on posting man love how the 89 civic owner gets aneurysm each time he sees a daytona
  it does yeah ive been wanting to try to make the cougar mini hub caps fit into them but everyone tells me itd be impossible      what do you think fox body is
can somebody explain to me why carfags think that dirt bikes are for children youd think that people here would fucking love motorcycles in general    
anyone who says that has no skill or is too scared to ride a motorcycle of any type
dirt bikes are for children get a real bike
  to ride a dirt bike well requires a huge degree of physical fitness which most carfags dont have
like 90 of the carfags who bug out when dirt bikes are mentioned are people whove never rode a single bike or rode their youngest cousins crf80 up and down a driveway
youll understand when youve grown up
  who in the fuck says that besides the one guy here anyway
  be boomer  rides overpriced underpowered merican iron  gets easily passed by cheap reliable japanese dual sport  gets triggered  talks shit on /o/
      these guys are on point
is the new 2020 corolla going to be able to compete with the new mazda3
if by complete you mean theyre both soulless hunks of shit then yes
  holy shit didnt realize we had the real jeff gordon in /o/ sorry it isnt as amazing as your soulless unreliable piece of shit vw jetta
  mercedes s class thank you very much    with no exhaust so fags in their corolla can hear and smell the toxic masculinity
  bread on hood you know the rules
  he will avoid this thread like the plague now that you asked for pics like all the others do
  taken at gas station  no bread
  how about bread and the key its cold out
  how about bread on hood stop being a pussy and prove us wrong
double nigger
  shitpile rustbucket s class about to fall apart     the rust looks so ugly on it it kinda wraps around and makes the car look awesome again
  you actually dont have to prove anything when you say you own a w220  theyre known to rust like absolute hell bags are deflated and you have to replace the whole suspension setup hence they are cheap as fuck to obtain
  now with dick need to know if male
  6 month bus pass carrying /o/tist    now your turn bread with keys i dont need to see the whole car
  the truth that im a busrider does not change the fact that your s class youre so proud of is rusty as absolute fuck though  if you took care of the rust everyone would appreciate you but with all the rust on you just look like the typical guy who gets himself a cheap s class for 2k and expects to attract bitches with it which you most likely are
  literal god tier car albeit showing its age    hurr durr its rusty hey boyo ur suspension is deflating ha    its your turn post that bus pass baybay    and to be serious the car is lowered about an inch and is sitting on 20s
  and no you dont have to replace the whole suspension if one component fails if you actually knew about cars and didnt ride a bus youd know
  post that bus pass baybay  i dont even have one and just buy them per ride probably even more of a poorfag than you are  still whats the point of getting your car rusted to shit under your ass if you actually liked the car for what it is youd take care of it
  truth is you ought to actually own a car before you try to run with the big dogs boi    youre talking shit about cosmetic issues that ill deal with in the spring meanwhile youre walking    keker    and if you must know the s500 alone doesnt really attract the hoes the 20s do after i shine them up
  and if you must know the s500 alone doesnt really attract the hoes the 20s do after i shine them up  kek good luck
  cosmetic issues that ill deal with in the spring  alright then
  the mazda will come with and without a rotary engine the corolla will come with an optional 2l i4 and has optional manual in some models of the sedan although it isnt known which transmissions will be paired with which engines
  oh my point being both are getting new stuff and major cosmetic upgrades so both should sell decent the corolla will obviously sell better
  if you only knew lol    ill say this ive never actually fucked in the car but ive gotten blown many a time in fact on two occasions i was parked right there at that gas station in the pic my old job
  the mazda will come with and without a rotary engine  you make it sound like thats amazing but then you look it up and see they will use the rotary only as range extender slave
  baby steps fuel economy was always the primary selling point of rotary if mazda could somehow make a hybrid rotary engine capable of unseen fuel economy without risking much power or performance and can shove it in a car not much more expensive than a base line camry they will eventually own the auto market for decades while everyone else plays catchup
  finally a sexy looking toyota
  old merc with wheels that dont match the car  are you black or arab
  how do they not match the car     ill admit theyre too big for the car but they certainly match just fine
  how much did the lot lizard cost you
  rusty w220 with wheels from some mexican chop shop
  wrong thread
corolla looks better outside mazda has the better interior
  the corolla looks much sharper than previous models but it doesnt look as good as the simply beautiful mazda3
neither can compete with the civic    skyactiv 20l drives like a smooth boring vacuum cleaner with no punch at any point need hcci    toyota just does not make any fun or powerful engines ever and if there is one in their car they never made it
  these two car styling is kinda different you know mazda looks beautiful with subtle lines but corolla pursue the sporty looks    i like them both but if i must buy one of them id buy silver corolla wagon 20l m/t if they dont sell it here id get 3 hatch with polimetal grey
    which one has android auto
  neither can compete with the civic  too bad the corolla will outsell the civic
nothing will beat this    prove me wrong
    econobox shilling retards nowhere to be seen after sclass anon raped their assholes    top kek
  raped their assholes  posted shitbox pair of keys from 90s  posted well known garbage land barge capable of being purchased for under 5000 today   like bragging about an old town car tbqh
  corollas havent been fun in decades
  nice depreciationmobile
  has that car been reliable is it still on the stock suspension   with no exhaust so fags in their corolla can hear and smell the toxic masculinity  ha did the exhaust rust off
  to be fair who the fuck spends 20k or whatever that piece of shit costs you can buy so many better cars if youre financially retarded mechanically retarded a new mazda3 or corolla is for you
  who the fuck spends 20k or whatever that piece of shit costs  a metric fuck ton of people do or they wouldnt keep making them
  toyota not implementing android auto due to privacy concerns  why are you still spreading your ass for jewgle
  hurr i drive an s class not a fucking poorfag 2019 mazda or corolla  drives a fuckold rustbucket   pfthahahahah
  theyre good cars because destitute brain damaged retards buy them    wow you sure got me
     other people destitute brain damaged retards    t realize that cheap used cars wont exist unless people buy expensive new ones
  the 20 corolla have the vvti kick and sound really good though
  i understand that but here why do people even talk about them if youre into cars enough to post here whats the attraction of these cars i dont get it
  yes the car is still on the stock suspension components minus one air strut that the previous owner replaced with some clever fiddling ive lowered the car about an inch    the weak point in the system is the plastic lines i suspect i have a hairline crack because the car will air out after about three days sitting oddly if i park it with the wheels full lock it wont lose air    i chopped the secondary cats off and plan on running straight pipes to the stock resonators and then straight pipe out the back gonna weld in some nice v band flanges     its a big comfy german muscle car and it sounds mean for only a 50
            bus pass brigade strikes again
  privacy concerns  what does that even mean what can the car stereo do to spy on you that your phone cant do already
  admitting you actually bought a second hand mercedes on /o/  yes im sure everyone that sees the nigger in the old merc thinks you are very successful
  wheres your lebaron freddy
its a shame theyre so shitty they seem fun as fuck
  bmw part cost  bmw reliability  they may as well wear the bmw badge
  yeah they clearly just stuck the mini badge on there for brand recognition
and gay as fuck
  no u
  they seem fun as fuck    they are its the only reason i put up with all the other bullshit mostly parts cost reliability is hit or miss depends on the specific car mine has been perfectly reliable
i drive a diesel luxury car
diesel makes a lot of sense for luxury cars as opposed to boyracer cars such as bmw mseries
tfw no awd diesel v8 panamera
not driving an almost 1000lbft or 1350nm diesel luxury sedan that can tow 25k lbs
most of my german coworkers have mercedes diesels exactly because it allows them to comfortably travel long distances at high speeds with good mileage and reliability   ergo i think diesel luxuries make a lot of sense
  sedan  sedan  bloated like the burgerclapistanis themselves
i drive
  it makes sense you save money on fuel lasts longer unless youre a race car driver you dont need the performance
  from a luxury standpoint diesel cars in general also vibrate less and drive smoother
  vibrate less  hahaha what  have you ever sat in one they vibrate so much more
  stop driving ur moms dildo
  only at idle or low rpm in general as long as you dont lug it which is easy since diesels generally have higher torque it shouldnt vibrate more than most other engines
  
  is it at least 6 cylinders    would be neat if its got 10 or 12    diesels can get pretty nice with more than 5 cylinders as bmw 6 pot dervs are sweet as is vags v6 tdi but their v10 and v12 dervs are proper banging
  diesel literally exists to tow huge boats
  sq7 got an electric compressor but a v8 instead of the v10 or v12  id rather have an m550d desu
  just patiently waiting for a new one
this is the citröen bx 1982  1993  why did this type of car go out of fashion
  why did this type of car go out of fashion    honda uh found a way
fuck citroen and especially fuck xantias
  why i bought one a few days ago and drove it 800km yesterday its pretty comfy
  its french  its ugly  its citroen  xantia  probably diesel or some 4 cylinder 14 55kw motor  comfy lmao as if that matters  no heritage whatsoever  npc car  no modding community  no enthusiats  driven by elderly or gaybois  no presence on the road  probably expensive to fix just like any german except germans are built better
  are you retarded or just american
  cringe
  im a retarded european
  no idea love the bx and especially the cx    definitely getting one at some point for commuting
  american opinions  yikes
  buying a 21td activa was the worst decision of my life citroen is literal dog shit and citroen fanboys are the vegans of the car world
be my uncle  circa 2003  love citroen whole my life  buy cx to restore do it wonderfully  rust prevention new paint etc  took car apart and put it back together all alone  one day take car to mechanic smth with the engine it was diesel without turbo  idiot puts fuel return back to engine  car somehow works better than before makes more power than trd gti  sick blue smokes comes out from behind  one day some stupid cunt tbones my uncle wrecking one side  shit happens car gets fixed  month later another cunt hits the other side wrecking car again  uncle rages fixes car and sells it    he drives c6 nowadays
  its french  here we go again
citroen  citron  lemon    imagine producing shitty cars that you already know from the beginning being lemons aka pieces of shit
    see 
shit that just kinda seems a bit unsettling for some reason
  any car with 3 headlights
  youre not perfect
  cannot unsee
    i dont think op just means spoopy cars    theres something unsettling about these specific images      this one almost has it but i think its more the plant life and house than the car      the e31 feels like one of those photos of miners from the late 1800s who died a horrible death  you know when you look into someones eyes in a photo and something just isnt right    the e31 is not a spoopy car but ops image is spine chilling
  god tier in fh4 i had no idea it was awd
  ugly as sin though only a mother could love that snout and weird headlights
  spine chilling  my guess is the lack of interior pitch black light insets and plates lacking some stamps seems kinda surreal because its very close to the one we all know but still isnt actually the actual 8 its a concept model
  aaaaaa

but sexy as fuck    
close the thread guys
im looking for some late 80s/early 90s russian concept luxury car at least i think it never came to production  it was boxy as fuck had huge wheels for the time a low roof think it was smoke grey or champagne and i guess it was meant to be a s class competitor  cant find it but i think it would fit in this thread
i liked it when there were cars that looked serious as fuck  now its all gaudy tryhard shit
  when you nut and she keep sucking
ive always thought the lister storm gt to be a bit unsettling from the front
  why does that race car have indicators though
  legality reasons

dodge m4s concept
what are some of your best stealership stories i hate this place with all my heart fucking people there think they are special
at ford i would clock in and literally walk out the door used to go to the bar but some co workers saw me when they wanted to fuck off too     then i found another job nearby and would show up to ford first and clock in and take off and work all day at the other job then leave and finish the day at ford my manager would say he was looking for me all day and blah and why are your eyes so red i would say something like if it was so important why waste time looking for me and just do it yourself     anyway i worked there a year like that before i quit
  walk into dealership  tell salesman i saw a car online that i want to look at  check it out  test drive  like the car  decide to buy   while filling out paperwork i find out the guy has the same bike as me  talk about riding  go to the financing guy  have good credit so got it for a decent price  fill out more paperwork  leave with a new car   sorry op i dont have aspergers so i cant relate
  schedule appointment to look at a vehicle they had online  get to dealership and give them my keys and id to have car appraised  sorry we sold it earlier today but heres a brand new f250 thats 4x over your budget  keep telling them i have no interest in any of their vehicles and lets not waste each others time  offer a test drive while car is being appraised  so we can offer you 500 for your car and finance you at 800/mo  as soon as i get my keys and id i bounced the fuck out of there  keep getting calls about new stock they have  find what im looking for at another dealership and they still keep trying to get me to come in and buy this fucking f250 for months
  gets financed and scammed by dealership   thinks he had a good experience   imagine getting fucked over this blatant and not realizing it guess they sold you well naive retard
  500  your trade in was probably worth 2000 easy
  financing a car can be cheaper than paying cash boomers walk around saying cash is king but if the dealership does its own financing then thats free money they would rather sell a car at invoice plus 48 months of financing than to sell the same car at invoice  whatever the financed amount would have been if they take cash for the car then thats it but if they finance it for the same total amount theres the chance of the guy falling behind on payments and having to either refinance or forfeiting which is even better for the dealer
  finance for who gives a shit months at whatever apr and pay off the whole principal the first month
i dont have any interesting stories but a salesman did try to sell me a golf gti for a 40000
  story
  fucking bmw dealers had an ignition coil that the boot split on toward the bottom when inspecting the plugs put it back on anyway and behold no miss at all so kept on driving almost forgot about it until i decide to go on a trip and the bastard finally decided to start misfiring i could buy the coil on amazon for 21 dollars bosch oem and all but i was already on the road the miss was intermittent enough to not be too worried hit the first bmw dealer i come to go in and ask for a coil118 fucking dollars for one coil i laughed and walked out jesus no wonder npcs think theyre so expensive to own
  no story just shady dealerships  i was buying a gti and started to talk numbers with the salesman and he put down a buyers order with 40k on it  the price of the car itself was at msrp but there was 12k in various fees and a paint protection package  when i asked them what some of the fees were they insisted it was processing the paperwork for the title transfer and things like that even though they still had a separate 900 dealer preparation fee    i went to a different dealership told the salesman that story he laughed and i was out the door for 25k  a few days later the salesman i bought from sent me a text message saying he told my story at a regional vw training event and the other dealership got laughed at by a dozen other salesman
  most contracts wont let you do that without penalty
    im not a brainlet so i dont go to dealerships to buy cars    when i was younger i did trick them into letting me test drive cool cars though
  9/10 of the ones i put through allow it    tstealership employee
  you dont have to trick them for a test drive  as long as you dont look like a bum most salesmen will insist to take the car for a test drive
    you should always check the terms of the finance agreement and make sure there arent any prepayment penalties thats the legalese you want to use prepayment penalty
  yes and where i am canada its quite well written it even gets its own section
go see a car  we just sold it  see the same car next week  your lucky day it was returned  marked up 2k  yeah lets talk about a td anon  i would if you didnt just pull a fast one  literally the nigger almost fought me over calling his bullshit
  go into subaru dealership and sit down with a salesman talk about what im looking for and i tell him im interested in wrx and the sti but im not ready to buy today im just doing my research and want to see the car in person and take a test drive salesman is like sweet ive been dying to get out of here all day let me get the keys to an sti we end up spending an hour taking turns just beating the piss out of it all around town     cool guy will buy car from him
  did you suck his dick too  buying a gaybaru   lmao literally donating money to the lgbt car company
  just heavy petting
  sweet ive been dying to get out of here all day  thats pretty common  protip thought go in the middle of the day on a weekday  theyre busy on weekends but most dealerships are dead since everyone is at work
  it was at the end of the day he just wanted to kill his last hour
here are 8 of the stealerships favorite tricks    1 make you test drive top trim level even though you clearly are only interested in base model this gives you the impression the vehicle you want is nicer than it is    2 make you wait for a long time while they work the numbers that actually only take about 10 seconds to work that way you feel like theyve invested a lot into the deal in the hopes that you will feel guilty if you dont buy it    3 refuse to talk numbers until you theyve found you just the perfect one youre looking for that way you get emotionally invested in the buy before any numbers come up    4 show you an invoice price as what they paid for the vehicle in reality they get a kick back for selling the vehicle meaning that invoice price isnt their real cost    5 pull you into their office and sit you down across from their big desk to give them an air of authority over you    6 never know any technical knowledge about the product they are selling what so ever at all    7 lie to you that an upper trim level will have a much higher resale value than the base model and is a much smarter investment    8 talk about wanting your loyalty and how the deal you are getting is so great because they hope youll come back and theyll be able to make more next time implying they didnt make any money on this sale
  all of those everytime
had a salesman tell me that he came in on his day of to meat me i overheard another customer on a different day thank him for coming in on his day off say to him i thought yesterday was your day off you work to hard i would like to stop by on your regular days what days do you normally work  oh monday uh uh wednesday and um thursday  oh so your only schedule for 3 days a week  um yeah but you know you got to do what you got to do
  he wanted to meat you not sell you a car 
  god damn it look i know how to spell meet theyre typos and their my fault there but their mistakes people make when there typing theyre posts fast
  theyre
  well played
    adding onto this anon i was taught by the scummiest car dealership in my city and i will share my info with everyone as penance for selling some poor girl a jeep     online sales    we would advertise used cars at great deals online however this was obviously just a lure the scam would work like this customer comes in looking for car x on the website the salesman would say that it had just been sold but we have several other good deals let me go grab some keys and show you then wed run to the back and have the manager pull a few similar cars  always the premium or limited trim off the website then go grab the keys and continue the normal sales song and dance this was to keep people from being able to lookup the cars listing and have a position to negotiate making us keep our word with the online ads i never did this but i watched others and still feel shitty     valuing your trade   i was instructed to look at the customers trade in with them present on every scratch ding dent or scrape i would physically touch the imperfection with the customer watching without me saying a single word inevitably they would blurt out what had happened and this served to make them devalue their own car in their head priming them to take a massive hit this one works really fucking well ill use it from time to time when i go look at cars either on a lot or from craigslist and it absolutely makes people squirm     ill add more things if i remember

    however no cause of action will exist if the purveyor is capable of actually selling the goods advertised but aggressively pushes a competing product     if you came up and said i want this car right here that you have advertised at this price theyd sell you it to skirt this legal wording they were masters of violating the spirit but not the letter of the law     thanks for posting a 26 minute video about something i explained in three sentences youre very good at using the internet and a smart guy for letting the dealership take your trade
  e46 need a new door fender and bumper  ended up costing 9k usd  didnt car tho insurance paid for it
  are you too illiterate to see the 4m5s that was plainly typed you asinine sperglord i was agreeing with supplementing your shitty post with video and pointing out to anyone that may be a victim of your crimes that it is illegal you started by adding to the list that i posted you fucking hypocritical piece of shit criminal piece of shit im surprised you didnt sell that girl a nissan
    i work at a honda dealership in the accounting department     the biggest scam in the dealership are those products the finance and income people try to sell you     our dealership a fairly large one gets the bulk of its profit from those products sold     do not buy those products they are rip offs    feel free to ask any questions
  by that you mean the gap insurance and extended warranty and such
  yes exactly    all symtech products like the rust module tireguard secureguard etc and the warranty stuff like gap honda plus and lubrico stuff     all of those are heavily upsold the actual cost of those products are 1/3 to 1/2 of the price you pay     if you really want those shit products go to them directly but even them they complete shit
  ziebart package through the dealer    i paid 750 for a ziebart rust proof once because it included annual detailing and refresh in the price thats like 60 a year value if you are someone who actually gets the refresh and washes/waxes their car i ended up having the car for 5 years and im not sure if i actually got a good deal on that or not
buy my new land cruiser  pay msrp  im not good at deals
  i dont believe you a dealership will literally give you 1000 off instantly just for saying you dont want to pay sticker
stories you say
  our dealership doesnt have that product but i guarantee with 100 certainty that youre getting ripped off
  i guess you havent ever shopped for an lc its common for new models to sell over msrp i upgrade every 5 years or so and have rarely ever paid less

  its been too long my friend
    i was between mechanics mine of 10 years had just retired and was trying to find another good one my transmission cooler lines leaked they rotted out and my vehicle was like 70km from home part wouldve taken a week to arrive from vancouver so i had to go to the stealership    they charged me 700 for some new custom bent lines     i finally found a mechanic who was honest asked him what he wouldve chared 300     fuck
    i know this is in one of my tftd threads in the pastand i probably remember less details now but i will reshare the story of the absolute worst trainwreck of a deal i ever had someone actually take     be shuffling around showroom on the weekend see someone pull up in a rough looking bmw x5  older black lady mid50s gets out and comes in i greet her she says she wants to trade up and out of her bmw  says she is only interested in looking at other luxury suvs nothing else   start by getting info on her bmw will get it appraised while we go look  car is a fucking trainwreck every single warning light on the dash is on  bottom of the car is wet because every possible fluid that could be leaking is leaking  exhaust smokes/engine is obviously burning oil  interior is completely ragged the fuck out stained and just nasty  no way she could still owe money on thisriiight  of course she still owes money on it  in fact because of a series of poor financial decisions involving refinancing this piece of shit she owes over 10 grand on it still  already suspect well kick it straight to auction as a for parts car but let tech and purchasing manager look it over  take lady out on lot to start looking at suvs that we currently have  of course we start looking at 50k suvs that i know she has absolutely no fucking chance of getting into  start to try and manage her expectations of what is going to happen point her in the direction of shit that might work  also try and speed her along as much as possible because the possibility of making a deal is near 0  find out this lady is a superintendent of a public school system in the neighboring city   anyways she finally lands on a mercedes glk that she likes i walk back in to get the bad news and send her out the door  or so i thought
    imagine being the guy who buys an sti that people beat the shit out of without the engine being broken in first lmao
  get back inside contact the lien holder for her bmw and get a payoff  finally get a number for the trade   if memory served she still owed 12k and we offered her 4k which put her upside down by almost 8 grand  i take it back to her explain the chances that a bank will absorb that degree of negative equity on a luxury car are slim but she wants me to try to get her financed  put together loan application figure in negative equity  fuck since were doing this might as well go balls out  get her to add on most expensive extended warranty option we have plus gap insurance plus a few accessories  if memory served we figured a selling price for th glk at 34k  once we rolled over the negative equity plus the add ons i think the number we submitted to the bank for financing was around 48k once you figured taxes and fees  tier ideclined in less than 10 seconds  tier iideclined in less than 10 seconds  tier iiichewed it over for a full minute before declining it  but the tier iv lender oh this bastard thinks on it for a solid 15 minutes  i know that with that sort of delay it got sent to an actual human loan officer for review but still i have 0 hope this lady is gonna get jack shit back  but wouldnt you know it after 20 minutes it flashed backtier ivapproved  i have no words or thoughts as i open the application to see what this approval looks like  approved for the full 48 grand  289 aprthe legal interest cap in my state  60 months  monthly paymentover 1500 dollars  i literally laughed out loud it was so fucking outrageous i didnt even have a chance of stopping myself   this lady took it without even a second though  literally spent less than 15 seconds thinking it over  took a car payment that is larger than most peoples mortgage  i kept up with the this loan and she made the fucking payments  as of the last month i worked at the dealership she was still in good standing/the car hadnt been repod
    please dont tease me its been too long since a good longpost
      90k total for a 48k car and this person is in charge of teaching kids
  ahh there it is i got too excited fren
  paying over msrp
  kek actually underrated
  the finance guy at our dealership tacks on a 1000 that he calls his sitting fee people are so happy theyre getting a new car they dont question the extra 20 a month sometimes an asian here or their will say something
  the key to this sort of investment it is an investment its image is to never use your own money shes in good standing so shes getting some extra money from somewhere which likely means shes taking either bribes kickbacks or both
     the piss out of cars off the lot    yeah ive gone through this as well when looking for a wrx i sure hope you didnt buy one off the lot  if its got like 25 miles on the odo then those were probably the roughest 20 miles the car has ever experienced
  i mean on one hand jesus fucking christ but on the other hand good on her for not missing a payment or trying to get out of it
  we dont have that but that doesnt surprise me that he does that     the fni guys are just plain sleezy theyre good at covering it up though and thats why their in their position
  there was a mystery 20 on my paperwork and when i asked about it he said he didnt know must be a typo he then told me i was one of very few who actually read the paperwork
im an apprentice and have been at my current vw dealer for about 10 months but heres a few wtf moments    we use offsite storage that the customer pays 80 cdn a season for this company is supposed to deliver the tires at least a day ahead of the appointments but mistakes happen today i didnt have 2 sets for 2 customers so instead of asking the people to comeback tell the truth or offer them a discount on the labor my manager just takes tires from a different customer that are the same brand model rim and size and slap them on as long as the tread wear is similar to the odometer they say fuck it what the customer doesnt know wont hurt them     also today i found a brand new diesel exhaust fluid heater that was supposed to be replaced under warranty in the garbage so one of the techs is being lazy and not doing work i have an idea who it is because this guy also has 4 cabin air filters a dozen oil filters and dsg transmission fluid stashed in his toolbox even though none of the parts fit his car     golf r customers always think their shit doesnt stink and we always kiss their ass to make them feel special as soon as they are out of earshot we bitch about them and how particular they are     30 cdn each for a vw centre cap i have 2 dozen i took off the tdi recall cars before they went to the crusher in case i break one    if you come to a dealer for just oil changes while in warranty but dont pay for any of the maintenance or recommended service youre wasting money odds are you getting the oil change done by a barely qualified tire buster if its busy and they dump the job on a mechanic theres a 95 they wont even adjust tire pressures or perform an inspection oil changes pay crap for flat rate techs and warranty pays only 60 of the labor we normally charge if the work was customer requested so most mechanics wont call a bad wheel bearing or coolant leak because they dont want to be the one to do the warranty job
    decent dealerships arent going to count on that shit  its an extremely piss poor way to estimate revenue and manage inventory buyherepayhere shitshacks do that kind of shit because they know that a significant number of their customers will have a hard time keeping up with payments     dealers want you to finance because it helps them move cars off the lot and because they get kickbacks from lenders that they have partnerships with because theyre helping the lender originate loans    when its 0 financing its because the manufacturer themselves are eating the finance cost to move stock aide their dealer network and get better financial reports    boomers say cash is king either because theyre idiots    the key to tradeins is to understand the tax structure where you live and the difference between what the dealer will give vs what youre most likely to get selling to carmax or to a private party some places have sales tax as high as 10 so a trade in worth 10k will save you 1000 in taxes vs you having to fuck around for ages with tirekickers and gas burners just to get maybe 11500 good fucking luck selling nonrare cars at 20k too  not many are going to be willing to do that on craigslist unless its a super legit seller with lots of backup
  be me     drive to dealership i frequent   tell them what im looking for  bullshit with sales guy as i work with his son  he keeps trying to convince me i want whats on the lot  tell him i dont he looks up what is available locally finds what i want   says he can get it ready for tomorrow  go to finance guy i know hear all about how his son is going   800 credit cheaper to finance and get those freebies plan to pay off 72 month loan in 12 make out with 4000 off versus cash that should have been interest   go home get a call truck is in   go down and realize i get free gibbes they forgot about because government worker   they fudge paperwork and give me even more gibbes because one of my part time employment employers has national pricing program   get truck for less than expected   half way done paying it off in just 4 months     im not a retard and have positive interactions with human beings
  most states dictate its an illegal practice what state are you in where that is legal regardless of the contract
  thats not true at all i work at a dealership and on weekends barely any cars get sold
  where the fuck is long post guy when you need him
  literally in this thread already
any suggestions on negotiating with sales people what do i need to keep in mind and look out for
  if its got like 25 miles on the odo then those were probably the roughest 20 miles the car has ever experienced  no shit sherlock those are the only miles it has ever experienced
    except the 5 miles where the car was tested for basic functionality and driven to transport locations/vehicles dumbass
    when youre 20 you sure as fuck have to trick them to let you drive a lotus elise
about ready to give up on looking for a fun daily driver almost bought an n/a automatic impreza wagon  see a 2004 toyota matrix xrs at a dealership  look it up 6 speed manual and a 2zzge  wow that looks like it might be a good choice  call them up and they have it  go to the dealer and look at it  oh lol its in the garage getting serviced come again later  convinced salesman to drive it to me to test drive  he somehow does even though i live 30 minutes away  shows up at my house friday evening  drive it around and i like isalesman is a cool younger guy we have a lot of interests in common   cant go that weekend so i have to wait another week  worried some other schmuck is going to buy it  never happens because who actually wants a fucking toyota matrix  go and sign the papers  talked to the salesman  added him on steam  we occasionally play rocket league and shit together      all in all a pretty decent experience
  that would make it 5 miles of unusually light driving and a norm of rough driving do you even into statistic
  land cruiser dont really need to bargain they know it will sell and they know you arent cross shopping if you are its the lexus lx    looking for used landcruiser/lx or gx or mdx  volvo dealer has used gx photos hide swirls in paint a weird wear patter on interior door owner must have been very fat sales guy wastes a little time  go to carmax to check out gx and mdx gx ok mdx interior materials are kind of shit in some areas carmax prices inflated  end up at lexus looking at gx and lx  have financing already lined up they bumped 500 off their listing  both cars are pristine  test drive then they run my numbers to see if they can beat financing spend about an hour total  there were no used land cruisers for sell in my budget within 200 miles
  a superintendent probably makes an ok amount of money enough to make the payments  being a black woman working for the government its just about impossible for her to be fired or even passed over for a raise    if i was the loan officer i would have approved if she had been in the job for over 4 or 5 years she is most likely a life long government employee
  i used to work for a chevrolet dealer i didnt know that a general rule of thumb is that every dealership is crazy or has some shady shit going on with no exceptions     manager and sales guys would regularly go out drunk driving in the brand new lot cars every night  would leave beer bottles and trash in the footwells and door pockets for the detailers to clean up  managers daddy owned the dealership so his job involved doing jackshit  one of the sales guys abused lot cars by high revving cars with less than 5 miles on the clock he also looked at porn at his desk regularly  service area would constantly not do work but say they did it  one of the guys would just not show up for work at random or just leave early and somehow never got fired for it    this probably isnt super crazy shit but it was a real surprise to me
  this is pretty standard shit for non white collar work
  ding ding ding    blue c/o/llers should be gassed

    wtf was your job at ford didnt you have something to do over there
  any suggestions on negotiating with sales people what do i need to keep in mind and look out for  1 dont get emotionally invested in the car ever period  2 dont be in a hurry  3 let them make the offer to you never throw out numbers to them  4 dont offer any explanation for anything  5 be noncommittal with things like im not sure i want to commit to a large payment and i havent really looked around at used cars    i promise theyre making money when they sell you a car
  1 go at the end of the month theyre struggling to meet quotas then and are hungry to move units  2 schedule multiple meetings with multiple dealerships on the same day when they want you to start signing things tell them about your other appointment and say youll come back later use the name of the other dealership and everything theyll know what it is thats when theyll get nervous and start spilling a little spaghetti to try to keep you there   3 if youre trading in the trade in value they will offer you is going to be like 6x less than what the trade in car is worth the second you see it ask for more   4 you are purchasing a car that is the only thing you are purchasing do not purchase anything else from the finance guy hes gonna sell you extended warranties hes gonna sell you paint treatment hes gonna sell you key replacement plans hes gonna sell you all kinds of horseshit do not accept any of it
looking to scrap my first car and buy a decent reliable ride  daily was 92 camry with 360k miles on its last legs  thanks to a family member got into a great credit union so top tier rates on auto loans  as a first time buyer they give me a max of 15 grand and i fine a nice 2013 civic for 13k at 20k miles   cu approves the loan and just asks i get the purchase order form the dealership and theyll deal with the rest  drive down to see it and test drive all goes well no pushy salesman or anything   alright anon lets run your credit and see what we can do  no thanks my cu will be financing just give me the payout amount and ill have the check here tomorrow  salesman goes silent for a moment then says he needs to talk to his manager  sorry anon were giving you such a good deal the manager says it has to be financed by us maybe get you an even better rate  i doubt theyll beat 2 apr for a first time buyer and i have a good relationship with my cu so i decline   deal falls apart and end up buying a 2012 civic from dealership nearby that didnt bother me about my cu  did them not being able to finance it really put them off that much i was gonna give them a check for the full price the next day what was the issue
  its only free money if its 0 and u were planning on getting full coverage insurance anyway
  nothing bad at a new car dealership mainly because my broke ass isnt buying new went to the local bmw dealership yesterday to get the blower motor wiring recall done on my shitbox gave me a free car wash and vacuuming and their service/sales staff was friendly so no complaints there though im sure internally they were laughing at my old e90 among all the other fxx cars there    used however was a different experience i went to go test drive a used m235i and the sales guy wanted to immediately run my credit im not extremely poor looking but i thought that was crazy seeing as the entire reason i was down there was because i had simply shot them a text asking if they had the vehicles service records and the same guy told me to come test drive it     told him not until ive had a chance to look at it at which point we walk to what i think was the back of the lot and its stashed behind like 4 different car has no gas in it and has clearly not been washed in over a month im not too much of a prude because i know that a little attention would fix this but i had scheduled an appointment for this shit over 24 hours in advance     we open the interior and the seats are coated in dust like it had been abandoned in the desert i brought my dad with me to stop me from being an idiot and falling in love with the car and he wouldnt even get in it i managed to convince the sales guy younger looking dude that i was fairly knowledgeable about the car and what i wanted from it so he let me test drive it before talking finances the test drive was fun but his knowledge of the car and what the previous owner had been like was nonexistent so i didnt end up buying it too many redflags for how they cared for it very shocking that the presentation of the vehicle was so terrible i had already secured financing through my credit union to jump on it so it should have been the easiest sale of this dudes life
  always get gap insurance though when you total the car the gap insurance will eat the entire debt regardless of the insurance company low balling the value of it     gap insurance is the one dealer addon that is allowed
  most insurance providers include gap as standard anyway if your policy doesnt you should look at prices from the insurance company directly anyway as the dealership marks up massively
  most dont include it since most people are looking for the cheapest insurance payment getting it from the dealer is more convenient for little extra
  i promise theyre making money when they sell you a car  oh fuck theyre making a profit from selling you a product fuck no how can a business operate like this in good conscience
    progressive had it included in mine at up to 25 of cash value of vehicle over owed which should be plenty unless youve rolled over some insane amount of negative equity
  your stupid sarcasm isnt necessary every single salesmen ive interacted with made comment akin to we arent making money on this sale haha when thats clearly bullshit
  we arent making money on this sale haha  youre a complete moron if you take that literally of course they are making something on the deal otherwise the doors wouldnt be open and the lights wouldnt be on that said i think you would be very surprised what most dealers are actually making on the sale of the car itself the aftermarket products people buy from finance managers can be high profit but the actual sale of the car is truly almost nothing in most cases    even so profit isnt a dirty word businesses should be allowed to make one without getting shamed about it i dont understand this mentality at all
my toyota dealership has its techs record themselves looking over your car they showed me a video to prove i needed new brake pads the tech literally recorded himself walking around the car glancing at each wheel and said that was evidence new pads were needed    needless to say the pads are perfectly fine
  ill spell it out for you they act like invoice price is what their cost is and show it off like it matters but that cost is only on paper and its dishonest for example the dealer may will have a vehicle stickered at 34500 and an invoice cost of 30000 they agree to sell it to you for 30500  anon weve only got 500 mark up on this deal and we have to pay the accountants were not making money  in reality theres a backside agreement where the manufacturer pays them a 5000 kickback for selling a model whatever theyre lying to you
  withholding information is not the same thing as lying
  that cost is only on paper and its dishonest  not at all true in anyway you fucking retard the invoice is literally what the dealer paid for the vehicle yes in some cases certain manufacturers offer kickbacks or holdback on certain vehicles on certain months but that is always changing and never guaranteed to the dealer in a lot of cases a lot of oems have a certain vehicle count that must be sold for them to get that back money if the dealer does not hit 200 units sold or whatever then they get nothing    it is a lot more complicated than you are making it out to be but even if what you are saying is true the manufacturer giving them an incentive later at the end of the month does not change what the dealer paid for the car you dense faggot    finally your numbers are insane   5000 kick back  lmao try like 300 per car depending on the manufacturer if they are lucky enough to get it
  i buy 20 apples from an apple farmer  i write a check to the wholesaler for 7 which is 35 cents per apple  i then resell the apples at a gay farmers market for 40 cents each  30 days later the farmer writes me a check for 150 bc i sold off the apples quickly and now want to buy more    does this now change the number on the original 7 check from 30 days ago
    bullshit
  not true at all retard well in some cases well its complicated well there are goals  okay thanks for proving my point      when they act like they dont have money coming in form the sale that they do its dishonest at best      yeah it makes it 550
be me  go to dealership looking for a car i saw online  online price advertised it as suspiciously low but i should qualify for the incentives  go in with my dad he was bored and wanted to come along for the ride  test drive vehicle okay feels pretty good go back to dealership to talk about what kind of price  mention the online price ask why hes quoting 34k over that price  salesman tells me well thats the bait and switch price  to my face he said those words exactly  boomer dad starts laughing hysterically  tells the guy that bait and switch marketing is illegal  asks him why either of us should want to buy a car from someone who just casually admitted they were attempting to deceive us  guy goes uhhuhhlaughs nervously  yeah alright i think were done here thanks for the test drive  salesman says okay thank you goes for a hand shake which is rejected we get up and leave instead
  not a word of my post is false i sold cars for 4 years   im honestly confused what part you find so unbelievable       okay thanks for proving my point  your point was that the invoice price is not what dealers pay for a stocked vehicle you have been unable to prove this point so far because it is simply untrue
  sitting here trying to explain the world of the dealership to 19 year olds who couldnt even finance a sandwich    youre wasting your breath anon
    the world of the dealership  its not fucking narnia you utter fag there are no secrets to it that youre exposing youre false flagging for the purposes of discouraging everyone from negotiating on price like you and every salesman at every dealer likes to do and its so fucking pointless i dont know why you continue to try to do it
  its not fucking narnia you utter fag     no one is saying that   im the other guy but the only point i was trying to make was that you seem to think you have the entire thing figured out when you clearly do not i dont work for a dealership anymore so i dont have any stake in the game just really frustrating to hear people like you touting blatantly untrue shit like its gospel    i am all for negotiating even when i worked at a dealership its somethign i legitimately enjoyed doing by all means go in there and get a good price on a good car thats what this is about just be realistic
  wife needs a new car  really wants a rav hybrid  whatever at least its not expensive  go to toyota and test drive it shes in love with the car  but not the color  boomer salesman offers to order her preferred color theres one just a few counties over  two weeks later havent heard back  call salesman tells me they accidentally got the wrong trim and didnt want to sell you a car you dont want as if i would just pay for the wrong car  two weeks later havent heard back  call again tell the guy i need a car and im starting to get impatient  he starts screaming and cussing me out calls me a dishonest man and says he doesnt even want my money  start laughing and he hangs up on me  buy a honda across the street  i looked him up to see if he still worked there turns out he died a year later
  5 pull you into their office and sit you down across from their big desk to give them an air of authority over you  i like to lean over their desk and put my elbows on it like its my desk and im interrogating them
  i like to lean over their desk and put my elbows on it like its my desk and im interrogating them  you sound like a very shrewd negotiator anon im sure you strike fear deep into the deepest depths of their hearts
  same story here dealership listed gti online for 22k out the door sweet get over there find the car drive it want it start talking numbers and they started going on about how it had paint protection package this package that package blah blah even though it was just the bare bones s 4 door model with stick they offered me 38k i told them to fuck off ill only pay online price and whatever dealer fees that come with it or im walking out wheeled and dealed settled on 24k pretty good to me
  thats pretty cheap for a gti
  he starts screaming and cussing me out calls me a dishonest man and says he doesnt even want my money  wait what i feel like there is information missing why would he just start cussing you out all of a sudden
  i have no idea its been a few years but i told him basically its been a month and you still havent got the car in if you cant get it in soon im going to have to walk when he started getting pissed and calling me a liar i said lets calm down and talk through it which in retrospect pissed him off even more i told my coworkers about it the next day they started asking when the new toyota was due and two people said theyd had the same problem with this guy but hed been working there for 30 years according to his obituary
   he was the quality control guy duh
  based boomer
  thats so weird maybe he started becoming mentally unstable
  just beating the piss out of it  youre supposed to drive the car not jack each other off
im huge into toyotas have been my whole life owned many lhd/rhd toyota cars/trucks my whole life     gf has toyota aristo 2jzge  needs new throttle body  lexus dealership wont sell part alone unless they install it for over 1k labour i can install it in 20 minutes  go to toyota dealership  say its for a toyota aristo but its the same part number as a na jza80 supra in the parts book  he says they dont supply parts for jdm vehicles and walks away   call him over and say fine its for a 1994 non turbo supra  says he doesnt care and walks away again in the back    seriously left a bad taste in my mouth especially since ive bought stuff for my toyota crown from that dealership for years no issues and they were willing to deny a 1500 part sale over it
  except a car salesmans job is to fuck you in the ass as much as legally possible
    i had a dealership net one out for me so that on paper they didnt make any money the salesman a kid who was new at the job told me he was only making 250 on the deal i spent like 20 minutes with him he personally made 250 off me for 20 minutes of time which is fine but dont act like thats not good pay also if he made 250 i guarantee you the dealer cut was a lot more than that on the net out vehicle  of course i want the dealership to make money and the more of you fools that pay sticker the more room they have to not make money on me which is fine however look at this guy  just sold someone a honda at 5k off sticker im sure he was happy to do it too what do you think invoice was on that
have 2015 audi s5   need to get its 25k mile service   when i bought the car the previous owner had payed for the 25k mile service but their lease had expired before than   go to the only audi dealership in my entire area of my state sw virginia   really tiny dealer but get decent service in a decent time frame  however i have some issues with wanting to talk to a tech about some issues i had with the car   given the run around mainly because the audi part is separated from the acura dealership/ service department for both  annoyed but i finally get to tech to talk tires/issues with the car   all is good until i go back
  i did buy a tire protection warranty for like 500 bucks along with minor dent protection too kinda ripped off but i went with it because i live on gravel and get sharp rocks stuck often it cant be voided but doesnt cover construction or vandalism and you cant be lower than 3/32 but its a truck so the tires i get are like 18/32 anyways
  a few weeks later car displays worn brake pads warning   i knew this was coming so i phoned them to get the work done along with new tires   get their and they tell me i need brake rotors even though they are perfectly fine   ask why do i need rotors if i brought the car in as soon as the pad warning came up it wasnt like i drove 3000 miles with no brake pads   they keep giving me the run around and refuse to give me a clear answer   listen im gonna level with everyone here i love my car and i know the basics but i am no where as in tune with the technical details of cars  that being said i decided to take their advice because i needed these brakes done   also as stated they are the only people around who would even work on audis and there are no independent shops around me   wait 4 hours to do the work   get car back wheels look like shit as they moved bunch of break dust around and got oil all over it   main receptionist lady had no interest in my desire to talk to a tech or my concerns with the rotors     i fucking hate this dealership so god dam much this is what happens when you have a monopoly on selling/maintaining every audi in sw virginia as soon as i get back to nj im having our local shop look over the rears which they did not do because they didnt have the part i swear to god im gonna be furious if i got screwed which i probably did
  im confused by that post it looks like he is saying he charged her 5k over msrp to buy the car even if it was a 5k discount like you are saying that post doesnt really prove anything either way invoice on hondas and all cars like that is 2k less than msrp so either there is massive public rebates on it right now which i doubt she got killed in the finance office or that guy is making shit up
  do you believe audis are special anyone can change brake pads and rotors lmao
  do you believe audis are special  he bought an audi what do you think
  vag vehicle  you deserved it
  rotors on vag are really soft and meant to be replaced with pads as they wear down much faster than jap/american stuff  not shilling just telling you whats up
    what are some examples of free gives for govt employees
  duncan audi  i bought a used benz from them back in college was actually shocked at how relatively unjewish the process was but when i lived in va i usually waited until i was back in nj to do anything car related usually ends up being cheaper and easier
  talk to the tech  yikes how entitled are you lmao

when going to a dealership to buy a car how do you know if youve obtained the best deal possible i read that using sources like kbb only inflate prices as its owned by autotrader/cox
  i read that using sources like kbb only inflate prices as its owned by autotrader/cox  scotty pls go    but to answer your question its not too hard to figure out what your local market is like do some research come up with the number in your head youd like to pay if you come to terms then great if they laugh you out of the store then youre probably way off
  audi  did you expect anything but disaster my friend took his a5 in for a service and somehow they fucked the hood struts and made the indicator stalk make a high pitch beep when using it

  not him but explain to me how that would be a bad thing ever
  not calling a manager making a scene getting him fired and getting a discount on the tb  way2go
    not at all true you fucking retards go work a car sales job or research things       invoice price is real those salesmen save you thousands of dollars and all they get paid is a 100200 commission once youre at invoice price if you want me to start posting some pink commission slips just to emphasize how absolutely wrong you are i will let me guess those paychecks are fake too amirite dumb fucking zoomer
why do stealerships exist  cant i just buy off the manufacturers website/hotline if i want a new car  literally no purpose but to grab extra cash from the buyer

  sure post em please      do not say his name again
  end of month deal were behind on new car objective asian man comes in to buy a new car cash for daughter see name hiep doesnt believe invoice pricing because invoice pricing for which there are federal laws enforcing them muuuuuust be a huge hoax right     wants it for 2000 beneath that after rebates or he walks  we need the sale to meet dealership unit objectives and ask him to do 1000 beneath so we can at least not get completely raped   he says 1500 under invoice we shake hands just to get the deal done  he is buying a new car for 1500 under invoice   pays cash and gets no gap or warranty or anything in finance     total profit on sale 135275 the  is there zoom in on the  sign    that makes our hidden top secret customerraping behindtheinvoice holdback a glorious 14725    im sure he still thought we were making a killing because he doesnt think federal laws and the internet have changed how cars are sold and that its not the 1970s    my total commission 100    dealerships and managers will make sales like this to hold onto their jobs or to win regional sales recognition they do not do it to make money on that sale theres more to the car business than money     ive got more commission slips and stories if ya want em of course im hoping someone can post some counter proof that dealerships are holding onto thousands of dollars in kickbacks
  thos is a stories thread not a role play thread
  forgot to add  the 100 is a mini commission basically even if the vehicle is sold at a monetary loss the salesman still makes at least 100 for all of his work and for helping with monthly objectives    this shit isnt hard to research you ever wonder why car sales have such high turnover rates hint its not because people are making thousands of dollars on every car
  so you sold a car for 1500 under invoice and dealer profit excluding their costs like your commission was 147   did i understand the post correctly   if i did that means real actual markup on the vehicle began after at 1647 under invoice okay that would be more or less what im saying   is that enough to survive on   no   should the dealer make money   of course  am i saying you should try to negotiate for the 1500 under invoice the asian guy got  no    all im saying id that if a dealer sells a car at invoice theyre still making some money on the deal
  financing a car can be cheaper than paying cash  do you know how interest works  even if it was 0 apr youd end up paying at least the cash value
  no to clarify we sold it for 1500 under invoice alone 1500 with all kickbacks combined the 1500 loss became a 135275 loss that means we only had a 14725 kickback from the manufacturer after invoice pricing     view it this way if the customer had bought at invoice we would have made 14725 after kickbacks thats 14725 profit to split between salesmen managers and the actual business itself on a 30000 vehicle who is getting raped here again    dealerships have minimum commissions to extend to salesmen to protect them as far as money goes in the long run usually they will sell new vehicles under invoice because they can try to make actual money in finance selling you a 900 cost warranty for 2000 or in followup service appointments residual income to offset the initial loss dealerships actually make their real money in service not sales if everyone bought new vehicles below invoice and didnt get anything in finance and never took their vehicles in for service there would be no profit anywhere for anyone
you dealership employees can all burn alive in your fucking cheap ass buildings
  ps i make 25 commission on profit or at least 100 whichever is greater if that top line says 500 i make 100 if it says 200 i make 100 if it says 800 200 or 3200 800 etc not all dealerships are structured this way but generally a minimum commission is between 1200 regardless of financial loss
  okay i misinderstood what you were saying so how rebates work anyway  if there is a 2000 rebate from the manufacturer how is that not separate from the invoice price
  based
for fun stop at dealership to look at an r/t challenger see where i need to be to eventually get one  despite firm insistance from the beginning im not buying they make repeated attempts to sell me  they eventually actually come down to a monthly payment im comfy with but i hadnt even began looking for other deals turn them down all the same guy is furious  two weeks later get a call says offer is still available ive since looked around and felt i actually wanted that one  go out to get it drive off everythings pretty great unexpected good fortune thought i was years off from being in a position to get an r/t  3 weeks later i get a call from the manager  i regret to inform you the salesman lied on your loan application weve since fired him and i hate to say it well need the car back unless you can afford x increased payments    despite being beyond enraged at the time i came out on top i got my down payment back and the car i had traded in came back to me with fresh wheels and an oil change and i effectively got to test drive the r/t for 3 weeks when i wasnt 100 it was gonna be worth it    it was worth it planning to try again next year
  rebates are direct to customer unless specified otherwise always check on this     they act the same as customer cash and are applied after taxes just like cash out the door cost  sale price x tax rate  licenses and fees  rebates  downpayment whatever the difference is is what you pay in cash or its what you end up financing
  so when you said he got 1500 under invoice after a 2000 rebate that was actually like 3500 under invoice  sorry for being a little dumb    i guess what im asking is if i see an offer of a 5000 rebate if i went into a dealer and demanded the car for 3000 under invoice with rebate to the dealer it would be the same as buying it at 2000 over invoice
  at 0 apr you can keep that money in investments to generate revenue the reason a lot of smart people finance is so they can have whatever lump sum they have now in some investment instead of being tied up on a depreciating asset really if whatever youre investing in generates more than what you lose in interest youre doing well
  makework jobs generated by regulation its illegal not to buy from an instate dealer in my state
alright ive never been to a dealer or owned a new car but ive been working a new job for 25 years and have about 40kaud saved i really wanted a v8 commodore with the ssv redline trim they dont makes them anymore and there arent many examples of new ones most of them on carsalescom go for about 55k new  do you think id have any wriggle room for a better deal i know they use the its the last of its kind as a sales pitch but since its been sitting for a year i thought theyd knock 5k off or something
  what is the time value of money  what is inflation  what is investment
  buying a depreciating asset with money you dont have  k
  implying financing is only for niggers  not how it works jamal
  fair warning if gm is discontinuing a car theyll make it out of the cheapest garbage pot metal they can find the last year of production my uncle wanted a sunbird back in the day and got one their last production run it rusted super quick plus crumpled like tissue paper when he hit a deer the body shop guy told him hed never seen such shit metal and told him he should get rid of it as soon as possible
  no sorry my wording was retarded he essentially saved himself about 5000 out of pocket 2000 of that being from rebate 1500 being the price difference he saved between sticker and our invoice and then another 1500 from beneath that invoice until he felt like he had a good deal    you should negotiate price separate from rebates because rebates are a given my personal advice is to negotiate down to invoice on the price then add in the rebates then pay for the vehicle how you wish come in with a preapproval from your bank or a credit union so you can get the finance officer to give you a competitive rate instead of straight raping you
  2000 of that being from rebate 1500 being the price difference he saved between sticker and our invoice and then another 1500 from beneath that invoice until he felt like he had a good deal  what
    it sounds like you are saying his rebate is included in his price negotiation but if rebate is separate shouldnt that be added back in meaning if the dealer got the 2000 for the rebate and he negotiated to 1500 under invoice it was the equivalent of paying 500 over invoice    im really trying to follow
  i hate to say it well need the car back unless you can afford x increased payments  this is when you say sorry but im keeping it  shits a contract if both parties signed its good    obviously this may vary from statetostate but i would have at least called a lawyer to check
 sge is definitely embezzling money from school
  lets say the vehicle was listed for 30000 factory invoice was 28500 he negotiated the price of the vehicle to 27000 without using the rebate yet     at an 8 tax rate 27000  27000 x 08  29160 with the 2000 rebate now redeemed he himself paid approximately 27160 taxes included of his own money on a vehicle the dealership paid 28500 for
  im not too worried about that the same model was sold in 2016 too and its almost the same as the first series vf except it has the ls3 besides our consumer rights in australia are pretty good if holden really did reduce the quality so much just for the last run id have a good chance of just getting my money back
  the customer gets a customer rebate not the dealership factory gives rebate to dealership who legally have the funds released only for the customers purchase it reduces the total cost the customer not the dealership this is why you can sometimes get offered rebate or 0 interest both save the customer money not the dealership
  okay didnt realuze taxes were being included
question    pic related should i then go in and excluding tax and financing fees demand close to the invoice price and then an additional 12k off of that
  best post in this thread
  2014  see a 2003 avalon at a buy here pay herestyle dealership  website lists 6000 for a car with 179000 miles on it  call up the guy tell him ill offer 5000 cash for the car  he gets instantly irate starts yelling over the phone  are you kidding ill keep the fucking car goodbye  a month later price came down by 1000 on the site
worked at starbucks in my early 20s  driving shitty cobalt  go to nearby dealership to see about getting something better  meet with one of the salesmen who frequents the starbucks i work at  tell him im looking for something fun/sporty  brings me over to a prius  mfw
buying brand new bmw  walk in finance office  oh anon my manager told me youre a ______ he said to make sure youre happy you guys bring us a lot of business in fact im only allowed to do this twice a month but im gonna upgrade you to our platinum maintenance package for the same price as the gold maintenance package  a little while later he makes a fake phone call to his manager to ask if he can get the price of the roadside assistance down  i didnt buy any of his extended warranties or roadside assistance and he was salty af he didnt even put my paperwork in an envelope he didnt say thanks or shake my hand or anything fuck him and fuck the 72 month term he wanted me to take
  because people want to sit in and drive the car to see if its for them and if youre gonna have people coming in to look at a car you should probably hav people to try and talk them into buying the car right then and there thats got a salesperson do i need to keep going with this
  because car manufacturers sell all of their cars to dealerships its guaranteed sales every season the dealerships have a loan on every car on their lot that they pay interest on the manufacturer already made their money and washed their hands
  youre an asian
  he didnt even put my paperwork in an envelope  speaking of which when i bought my car i had to fucking hound the dealership for two whole weeks before the fuckers gave me scans of all my paperwork what the hell is up with that
  i dunno bro i walked out with like 50 pages of shit i had to sign a bunch of shit saying stuff like did the salesperson talk to you in in your native tongue
  
why do dealerships exist again tesla lets me buy it directly from them despite all of teslas other bullshit they do that one thing very right all you salesmen can find other stable salaried jobs
  thats just a tldr version but it was legit the issue came up with the loan and bank and blah blah bscly the salesman fudged numbers so he could tack on another sale last minute at the end of the month
  shopping for pic related  looking at all dealerships within 1500 miles and intend to drive it back  contact two dealerships and tell them im very interested in buying  dealership a makes no effort on the sale try calling the salesman 3 times and am unable to get a hold of him  dealership b was proactive about getting me numbers and paperwork and all that  knocked even more off the already good advertised price  worked with me on getting the car prepared ahead of time  picks me up from my airbnb before work  paperwork was all ready sends me right to the finance guy  asks to take a picture of me and the car for his facebook work account  called me up a couple weeks later to ask how everything was going    overall really positive experience id buy from them again

    i had this happen to someone i know as well theres something in the paperwork at a lot if not all dealerships that says they have a short period to change their mind its supposed to be in case of errors like selling the wrong car on accident or something
  seriously asking    what are cash allowance  how does employee pricing work in terms of the money flow with the purchase   are these rebates  if theyre rebates should they not be part of the price negotiation
anybody know what the invoice would be on something like this    also theres 12k on cash allowance and employee pricing for everybody sale through chevy are those rebates  pic related  these are also my posts  
  you will get 12500 off the sticker price of the pick up you decide you want to finance so long as the pick up you choose meets the requirements gm allows for this deal you will have to finance through gm financial in order to get the 12500 discount not the bank or credit union of your choice     so if your sticker price of the pick up you want is 41390 you will get a reduction of 12500 so long as you finance the remaining balance depending on the rules chevy has laid out for the 12500 discount you may be allowed to add more money for a down payment and finance the rest through gm financial or you will have to finance 28890    if you want to know what you would pay monthly there are plenty of calculators out there for you to use with your own credit score to provide more accurate results

      thank you  thats not really what i was asking though after the lengthy discussion above it seems to me that negotiation should be focused on getting it close to invoice price excluding rebates and taxes    so what i am asking is if i buy that truck regardless of price is chevrolet writing the dealership a check for the 12k  would it be reasonable to find out what invoice is negotiate to a 1000 over that and only then subtract the 12k making my pretax purchase price 11k under invoice    or is that fantasy land if that is fantasy land then how do these cash allowances and employee pricing sales work like what is this
  he literally answered what you asked youre just dumb  is chevrolet writing the dealership a check  no   clearly explained it you have to buy a qualified truck most of them wont be the dealer already got the discounts through their deal with chevy they dont take a loss chevy literally pays them for the trucks to sit on the lot   if you negotiate the price to invoice you most likely 9999999999 not qualify for the discount   the discount will be on and i quote the other guy  the pick up you choose meets the requirements gm allows for this deal  be a smarter person
  so its not handled like a rebate   was that so hard to say
  it was explained to you in detail sorry you need it so fucking simplified because you cant take 10 seconds to think about what you read what fucking difference does it make how its handled worry about what you can afford for total cost not monthly then go to the dealer and find a truck at that price then work out all discounts which you wont get most of because they are a fucking scam and know 99 of customers will qualify for maybe a little bit off but not all discounts
  in other words the only trucks that get such a discount are high end expensive models gm mad too much of and had to dump on dealers theyre attempting to make up for this mistake by that discount and convincing you to finance with their rate and terms so they can recoup some of their loss if youre a moron who happens to have good credit
  exactly and spoiler youll probably not get all the discounts to begin with all car dealers are still scum outside carmax at least they are upfront about their inflated cost they just had to change tactics

stealership expects me to buy a car after i can only drive it for 3 minutes around 2 blocks   all of you do this why
  my dad wanted a new ute for towing a caravan the local dealers let him use the cars for a whole weekend he tried about 3 cars before settling is that common or were they certain theyd get a sale from him
  dude grabbed the keys after the stealership test drive and folded his arms over asking me if i deserve the car
  older guys probably get better luck and service
  i joked with him that it was ageism because they wouldnt do the same with me he agreed and said i wouldnt do that for you either because youre a little shit  i love my dad

gonna look at a second gen gmc sonoma tomorrow    wife recieved it from husband who isnt here anymore she used to drive it but parked it up 6 months ago because it is wrong hand drive for our country    what i know    reg cab  2wd  automatic    she doesnt know anything else    are there any s10/sonoma fans on here that can give me a quick run down of what to look for on these things i am hoping for a 4 cylinder because this will primarily be a city equipment and staff transport and i already have a v8
is that one of the euro market ones that was built in the states or is it a south american truck wwws10forumcom has a bunch of good stuff biggest problems to look for are rust the entire front end being loose and the automatic trans slipping    ive owned one for almost 2 years and despite the issues with the build quality its extremely comfortable to drive and its fairly solid mechanically v6 s10s do really good burnouts
    thank you    i have a tendency to buy non running trucks and build them back up since i can get them down to 1/4 the price of a running rust bucket    i always have to rebuild the front end and replace all 4 wheel bearings because 3rd world so that is in the plan    i wont know where it came from until i see it but bets are on that it is an american market second hand import we dont import from south america because you can buy something equally shitty locally without paying duties and shipping    i guess what i am really looking for is something along the lines of avoid the triton because they have spark plug incontenance type advice    i will check s10com
  if it were 4wd id say be wary of the vacuum actuator but since its a rwd you dont have to worry about that  like most 90s gm fleet stock s10/sonomas are pretty basic and will run longer poorly than some cars will run at all
  youll regret it theyre absolutely miserable  so bad in fact im trying to get an 80s plymouth running so i can go back to using the sonoma as a last resort      t currently forced to daily a 97      but this is probably true
    thank you i see no shifter or dial in the pictures and the woman says it is 2wd so we shall see
ive got a 4wd jimmy suv s10    they are the sunfires of pickup trucks not great at much but will keep running forever
  if its the 22 with the automatic dont bother theyre extremely slow and dont get great gas mileage for how slow you go also the 22 eats through automatics for whatever reason usually a rebuild is having to be done at 100k miles my guess is its because you have to floor the thing to get it going to regular speeds
    but this is probably true    i live in the third world so if it runs alright i am 10x better than my own grandmother who owns a fleet of vehicles but asks me for a ride every now and then because we are waiting for a power steering pump for one vehicle3 weeks an immobiliser bypass for another2 months a trans rebuild kit for the newest one 2 weeks before customs siezes it for whatever reason and an engine to come back from being rebuilt in trinidad for the 12 year old one see you i february the environment is tough on vehicles and the more tech you have on it the more downtime you will see    i dont have the option to be as picky as you guys when i am looking for something ideal i am lucky to see a pickup for anything less than 5000 usd vehicles with manual windows are more sought after vs electric due to this fact for instance
    i average 11 mph on the trip of my current sidejob company car and thats all on road driving this will primarily be bush or town driving    bad mileage    if i get 13 mpg out of it i am laughing my current truck gets 9 and my 16l 2800 lbs 4x4 gets 15 but the problem is the load capacity i would actually cut the top off of the escudo and turn it into a pickup but it is worth significantly more than this pickup stock if i ever wanted to sell    trans rebuild at 100000    thats about 9000 hours of driving i would have probably rebuilt the engine a couple of times
  its simple but its also poorly thought out and has laughable build quality i have 130k on a 22 5 speed and just for major work its had an engine rebuild trans repair 5th gear/synchro and output shaft and fuel injectors     just ordered an ignition switch as it has started cutting off and i still need a caliper 4 balljoints and new shocks/struts and itll be a pos even after all that    if you have any other options seriously consider them first i look for cars with the same qualities you do but the sonoma is really one of my worst purchases btw even my window crank broke off
theyre built like shit i owned one for a year before i bought my 4runner last summer
    i have 130k on a 22 5 speed and just for major work its had an engine rebuild trans repair 5th gear/synchro and output shaft and fuel injectors   just ordered an ignition switch as it has started cutting off and i still need a caliper 4 balljoints and new shocks/struts and itll be a pos even after all that    that truck of yours has already outlived everything i have ever seen 60000 miles in my country turns a landcruiser 70 series into a shitheap    if you have any other options seriously consider them first i look for cars with the same qualities you do but the sonoma is really one of my worst purchases btw even my window crank broke off    i have already owned a truck that i permantly left a grip wrench inside because that was my method of turning down the windows once down no tropical monsoon would make me turn them back up because it had no a/c or even a blower so the windows fogged up in seconds    my other options are paying triple for some shit heap hilux that has been exposed to sea blast for 25 years     i have never not had to deal with ball joints and calipers with any vehicle even a 5 year old toyota fortuner needs new tie rod ends ball joints and bushing all round
    would you pay triple for your 4 runner
i should say sorry what i am trying to get at is if there are any inherent sicknesses with these trucks    ie    ford tritons shoot spark plugs  gm 3800 and their intake problems  bmw and their vanos problems  ford 60l and their headgasket problems  nissan zd30s and their piston melting problems  tacomas and their frame snapping problems    that kind of shit    kia build quality is no problem for me in the price bracket i am looking at
  that truck of yours has already outlived everything i have ever seen 60000 miles in my country turns a landcruiser 70 series into a shitheap    keep in mind it has only ever been used on paved roads if its all you can get go for it but i wouldnt recommend it especially in conditions like you describe    to answer your initial question though the engine will tick badly and have lots of timing chain noise if it sounds like its slapping youll need a new tensioner plastic shoe essentially easy enough theres also a plug in the block with a small hole in it that supplies oil to the chain it likes to clog so plan to replace it and clean the passage behind it check the cab for leaks since you have monsoons i trashed my carpet and sprayed bedliner in you may need to as well to prevent rust
you should buy it and when your sitting in it remember that she sucked his dick countless times in the same exact seat that your cuck ass is sitting in

   op  how many times are you going to create threads begging for attention for your automatic gtt    at least its not another fucking daytona thread
  you removed the battery
  you forgot the ls
  its not really a great engine it had redundant systems to make it run if one fails the other doesnt take over it just shits down the engine then have fun with diagnosis   also an engine doesnt make a car the sum of its parts do and nissan is known very well for using cheap parts inside and out
  get a brass brush and just rub it off then use some rustoleum and paint it right away cause that surface rust appears within 15 seconds

  driving a manual requires skill driving an auto does not i take pride in developing proficiency in a skill whats so hard to understand
howd you clean it so good anon power washer
  oh yeah absolutely shes awesome the sound is sex to my ears    and on top of that i aint got no problems with her    i just have to do some little fixing up like the leather driver seat left side which is a bit open but the rest of the leather is perfect that leather is really tough
  driving a manual takes skill    literally 6 gorillion keks    id love to see you drive my old datsun pickup    dont act like your washing machine is hard to drive
  operating a lever isnt a skill
  driving a manual takes some dexterity and metal processing not a shit ton but it does require some practice    so youre some sort of magical being and can just jam manual cars into different gears
  driving a manual car smoothly and efficiently takes some skill practice and affinity for the machine youre sitting in
  a washing machine would be hard to drive
    git gud
  
    here friend
  glad you like it and are having good luck i just got mine back from the body shop and loving it
  driving a manual takes some dexterity and metal processing  what kind of metal do i need to process when driving a manual  aluminum  copper  iron
  what kind of metal do i need to process when driving a manual  most believe it is lead

toyota land crusier

  /thread
defenders are fine so is the land cruiser
  mercedes 200d
  your problem is the bits you cant see  frame bulkhead door inners etc those are poorlypainted steel that rusts like absolute crazy  that said this is also true of most similar vehicles except they have steel body panels to rust too    if you get one get an older one on a new galvanised frame preferably one thats also been waxed/oiled underside and inside panels
  may i ask why my uncle has a modified defender he uses for spotlighting with dogs while its very very robust it does require alot of care and maintenance
    85k starting price    holy shit those nips are proud of that thing
toyota corolla    defenders leaking oil at 30 miles is not unheard of
  if you want an suv that will last for a long ass time the land cruiser is the way to go the president of toyota basically said that they are designed to last 25 years in a 3rd world country theyre pretty boring to look at but theres a reason why there so popular in undeveloped countries
  any car will last you 20 years as long as you keep it serviced without fail just buy the car you want and take care of it
  wax/oil does very little in the long run
  you can get a good land rover discovery for 80k less and it will be more luxurious and just as good off road as a defender
  toyotas are the most popular military vehicle dindus and ragheads can only kill them with gunfire or ieds
  if you want to drive into the wilderness drive a land rover if you want to come back drive a landcruiser
  boy you really wanna break down at the worst time possible dont you
lets see your transformations    ill start
  how did you fix the rust that was under the outside body panel
    thats an example of why i would never move to wear they salt the roads
  i didnt touch the rust underneath my repair isnt perfect was just so i could repaint it before that rust gets to be an issue ill have either sold the truck or replaced the bed       yeah the prairies of canada suck for that among other things

  beautiful you should always keep the decals there    how are these trucks
  it was sweet when you got it you wiggered it all up with the instagram tier shit thankfully its all reversible
  put a heavier engine on the drive wheels  i dont see a problem with that 
  it gets me wherever i want with whatever i need to carry in the bed cant complain      the decals will probably one day go as i plan on painting the entire truck in raptorliner to get better protection against scratches and dents    and honestly its a great truck the engine is a tad underpowered and it does have the toyotatax but it has handled everything ive thrown at it is a dream to work on and it its in good shape
   yeah thats already off i dont have a recent picture

i have audi a4 b6 2001 20 petrol manual transmission pic attached its my first car im from europe croatia so i dont know if there are some differences between usa/eu models but here is what happened its beginning of winter here in balkans and its getting cold 6 celsius / 212 fahrenheit and i noticed that its quite hard to shift gears in the morning while car was sitting for a while during night its hard to shifting gears like transmission is frozen even car was in garage during night    what could cause that cold weather or transmission fluid brother had honda accord 1997 eu and never had problems like that during winter
manuel  transmission fluid
likely that the mechanics at your place are total shit and used some grease that easily hardens at laughable temperatures 6c is nothing and shouldnt do anything
  i have a c5 a6 and the transmission and clutch pedal feel heavier below 10c but its not so bad if you rev match  since its an audi there is a possibility that most of the transmission oil has leaked out last winter i topped up my trans oil and it was almost 2 liters short shifting is much better now  id reccomend changing the trans oil completely but use the correct spec my 01a 5speed takes 3 liters 75w90 full synthetic oil if i remember correctly
  i drive the same car those rims are very ugly please buy some better ones next time the stock audi rims look quite nice so leave them on   the grease is probably shitty like this anon said reapply better stuff that does not harden in cold   here in germany it also gets cold and i notice a difference while shifting but only a small one and for like 2 minutes   also beware of the water pump issue these models have a plastic water pump wheel mine cracked at 160 k km and car almost overheated

anyone here a master tech or know anything about the ecu/software hard codes on the most annoying 3series which is the e92      last week my two front tires went flat on my e92 m3 got it towed this morning for free warranty expired but supposedly cause its m3 its lifetime rsa for flat tires and was able to slowly mount it back on a flat bed truck with no codes other than tpms       the problem is the tow truck driver didnt put the hook on the front bumper location but under the bumper near the left drivers tire somewhere on the sub frame upon hooking it i think he jerked it almost a bit too much to where even w/ the ebrake/park the tires rotated and i heard a locking sound    i didnt think much of it until we got to the stealership when i tried to insert the keyfob in the ignition switch/fob wasnt making that start up click noise and it literally wouldnt even unlock or light up a single light on the cluster such as gear its in or even show the time/temps just pitch black i waited a bit then tried to ignite it againt no cigar      the jackass got hesitant then decided to use tire polish on the bed to move the car up and down the ramp until it shimmied with the ebrake off and flat tires making an odd noise luckily it was a small incline and the car descended but a bit too quickly where my tailpipe just barely kissed the ground he told me to try turn it on now but the steering wheel was still locked entirely and now tilted to 45 to the right    idk what the fuck is happening ive been trying for hours using the metal key to unlock the door and leaving fob in hoping it would come to life not even the trunk opens    i went to aap asking for a battery alternator check but they said car its too far for them to help but they told me that its most likely the car had a security lock that the towing hook prob caused it      i dont know what the fuck to do the car in the dealer service parking lot and the bmw cs techs supposedly dont help until 800 am monday
ahahahahahahahahahahahaha
  dont be a cunt about it m8 at least be helpful and provide something of use to the situation

no ones gonna help huh damn
people probably arent replying because your post has the most cancerous formatting anyone on this board has seen to date it took me a solid two minutes to decode what the fuck youre even trying to say so lets get this straight you think a tow truck operator incorrectly winched up your car which caused the wheels to rotate and broke something in the steering lock
  you need to use your bmw money to hire a lawer
  good post m8 keep it up    since when did 4chan have fucking formatting rules      anyways my car is basically fucking immobilized/security locked thanks to the antitheft sensor or some shit following the locked steering wheel which means the keyfobs wont work none of the cluster lights even come on as they should and the ignition switch wont bypass to even allow the batterys electricity to receive the rf sensors from my key to unlock/lock
  bmw  looks like youll have to wait for the stealership to help you get an uber home and call off from work on monday
  why did you get a tow to a dealer thats closed are you retarded    
  cause roadside assistance only tows freely to the dealer
im a tech at a dealership does the steering turn fully
did you try putting air in the tires
you should go ask here  
  no man it will budge like 15 degrees max and then return to the original angle    its really fucked up it had something to do with getting jacked after being turned off or a key fob misreading/ejecting
bump
  speak like a retard get treated like a retard   go back to your shithole theyll be more likely to understand you and help you
did you try sending your ultimate driving machine to the junkyard because its absolutely useless after committing suicide after being towed
call tow truck company head office bitch they will fix it  they fucked your car its their fault
    for some reason i took this pic just as a precaution to see where he decided to tow it     luckily this could be evidence but honestly the tow hook placement is literally in the lower right bumper and this man decides to hook it on the fucking sub frame
this whole post makes me wonder whether you actually have any spine at all     you dont let some random retard fuck up your car while standing passievly at the side taking pictures of it top tier faggotry     ill ask my father about the steering lock could also be that the towing broke/bent something have you jacked up the car removed the wheel and looked if he did not do any damage

  is this a joke
  my man   i have this interior it is certified comfy
volvo interiors are top comfy
  disgusting
  i think a h3 has bigger windows than that
  disgusting
   top solitary confinement
you may not like it but this is what peak automotive interiors look like
  did you draw that interior with colored pencils
seems true comfy interiors ran 1960s thru 1990s
  its nice i guess doesnt look comfy though
  i think i mightve missed the point of comfy i was just going for an interior thats literally a nice place to be and not soft looking and retro like most of these
  nah i gotcha that looks like a nice place to click off miles  i was thinking more like worn out old sofa type comfy my buddy had one of these and it was great for just rolling around in top comfy 
select all comfy interiors
  love cadillac seville
  i understand that now volvo seats are literally just super comfy though none of that usual ass/back fatigue after long trips
  i know /o/ hates this but i think it does look extremely comfy id feel safe sleeping in there
  toyota chr  fuck me i actually like the exterior styling of this and considered looking at one but the way that cpillar it must be nearly impossible to see out of the back its like having a paper bag over your head and expecting to see clearly out of it

  friends were retarded and bought cars with bench seats  theyre great i wish i grew up in the age when these were standard
  bench seats are great for trucks and huge cars
  the center console turns into a middle seat with its own seatbelt shits nice i forgot how comfy bench seats and no center console in leg area is
  10/10
  did someone say wool interior
  niiice    certified comfy
  this is what true luxury looks like leatherfags take note

whats more important to you actual speed measured by track times etc or the perception of speed for the driver
  depends  race   actual speed  trackday  fun

how far can you drive with no alternator
as long as the battery can keep the ecu running not far    based carb and distributor
    not far my wifes 1994 vw golf had a broken wire so the alternator wouldnt charge as soon as it drained to 9v it started to get wonky electrical issues and ran like shit from the ecu going nuts fully charged it went maybe 4km until issues arose    depends more on the vehicle newer stuff with all the modules etc you arent getting far on just the battery a 30 year old carbureted shitbox if you turn off all the electronics like headlights radio etc you can probably get a ways on just the battery
  the harm of uv radiation is dose dependant and mostly depends on burning
  after a while doesnt the spark stop being strong enough at idle without the battery ive never had a carbd car since ive been old enough to actually work on things so my only experience is with motorcycles where that happens stalls at stops with low battery
  your idle would have to be really low on a bike i could see it happening more often
men use tanning beds for health benefit
  sounds like your battery was also dead average alternator puts out less than 100amps at roughly 12v that means your car must draw less than 100a while running much less obviously since this 100a can still charge the battery most car batteries are anywhere from 40 to 100 amp hour capacities which means even at the absolute most extreme worst case your fully charged battery should last about a half hour in reality your car usually draws about 10a running normal stuff like lights and the ecu so 410 hours without a charge    i think youll drop volts around 20 capacity so realistically ecu might have problems after as little as 3 hours from a fully charged battery
  health benefits of skin cancer
you could hook up magnetos so you can lose your alternator and still run
  i only got about 10 miles when mine died
  i did about 4hrs with a severely failing alternator i had to keep the engine in 4th instead of 5th gear to keep it having just enough charge to run    i have heard without an alternator you are lucky to get half an hour out of a brand new battery
  pretty fucking far with a decent battery and if you dont run the heater radio headlights wipers or fucking anything last winter my alternator died and its literally a 6ish hour job on my car so i bought a genius battery charger and just charged my battery every night worked for the 3 months before it was warm enouh for that hateful job if you want to go even further and wont be sitting in traffic unplugging your fans will free up a lot of power as they draw a shitload
  what car
do you drive a diesel
  unless you have a mechanical fuel pump a diesel wont last that long
  pretty far people run races without alternators
  not having a mechanical pump diesel and manual transmission  its like you almost want to be hacked by the cia or rendered immobile by emp/ solar flare
depends on everything    how much power the car draws  how hard its run  temperature outside  type of battery  capacity of battery  amount of batteries    i ran a good three weeks with a dead alternator without it dying but mine has two large really good batteries is a diesel and does not have much equipment that draws power
  pedantic but  many thousands of miles  dynamo is not alternator
when the no recharge alternator light shows up  i was in rush hour morning traffic it took me about a min and half before it turned off  every second that goes by more idiot lights will pop up until they are all on at once and then the car just shuts off  02 acura tl auto  there was like a week of those red light sightings popping up now and there at the time i thought it was just a bug because old car if you see the no recharge red light on the dash and lets say it goes on and off it definitely means your alternator is going out  luckily i was in corona and 2 guys got in a new one within an hour from me autozone was like 2 blocks away
can drive forever     be me last year   alternator is busted  boost my car  gets bitches wet   drive 200kms   yes im canadian  car is such a beauty and a beast  make it to my mech with no problems  he looks at me  i look at him  we both look at my 30yr old classic benz   together in uniscent the best or nothing right   feelssoamazingwordscannotexpressmyloveformybabypng  happy knowing my car might be the only good thing in my life  happy car happy life maybe one day a nice wife but i doubt it cuz  millenials
on modern cars not very far before all the computers and shit were added in as long as you had enough juice for the stater motor it would be fine even after the battery died you could just push start it too
  what model is that my good man
  using hyphens instead of greentext
not very far in my e21 at least it would stall at stoplights when the alternator was dying unless i kept a foot on the gas
  who are you quoting
  just newfag scum from facebook shitty car forums reddit twitter etc that keep pouring in
  i really miss my sl500 i was only the second owner and it still had plastic on the carpets when i got it receipts for every single service part and oil changes from new from the dealer does yours have a super heavy throttle pedal flooring it it feels super satisfying because you have to really stomp on it
alternator died on my saturn back in 2000 car went into a limp mode and wouldnt rev over 3000 rpm i did 60 miles like that at about 45 mph
  i did about 100km during a trip to kuopio two years ago with no headlights in a b6 a4 spooky the charge controlled died fixed it the next day with basic tools at a cabin in the middle of winter
magneto  mechanical fuel pump  forever
  yes
it took me three weeks to figure out that the voltage regulator on my truck wasnt working alternator wasnt charging in theory almost indefinitely
  depends how good your battery is and the current draw of your ignition system i drove my car with a non functioning alternator 30 minutes turned it off and restarted it then 30 minutes back home and it still had enough charge to start again
1000 false im an oldfag ive been browsing /b for years this /o is new and posting is new so i dont know how to greentext i honestly thought it would auto do it ill learn for next time also forgot how to reply to someone lmao but its a 1990 built in 89 300sl24v amg japan importer in 2000 still left hand drive but has japanese exhaust regulations and a warning light not as rare as the sl73 but that just fine with me spent my whole life trying to acquire a benz a classic benz to be specific and ya im happy shes old and needs more work but meh shes worth it and havent even dumped over 1k into her yet i will many things to come but ya super long post yall will shit talk but thats ok  my car is real and the things i speak of are real and shes sexy as hell and for those that really wanna shit talk my monoblocks are worth more than your life my amg body kit alone is worth more than your familys life so please be respectful im not a honda fag im a euro fag with a euro/jspec car d
  saved
  cringed hard go to sleep grandpa
i drove my fd 250 km this summmer when my alternator broke then i switched battery and drove 250 km more no lights or fan on thu   insert dorito joke
  what is this newfag shit  lurk more
ya shes got the heavy throttle but because i have the inline 6 and 24v the kickdown is interesting eventually im going to twin turbo the big bitch lol
  yeeeeee
  got any pics of ur mum i can save
  whats up with people that unironically and with complete seriousness type like this
   not having a hand cranked inertia starter
driving at night over single lane suspension bridge  alternator ded battery voltage dropping  bridge ends back on interstate where speed limit increases suddenly  car in limp mode  hazards on at 1/4 normal brightness  going 40 under the speed limit in the shoulder
  not startexting
  interesting when my e21s alternator got disconnected accidentally the only way i knew it was not working was that it cranked really slowly when starting ran fine though
  having a car with a limp mode
  tfw pre boomer diesel  no electric fuel pump  no ecu  old trucks just keep on going
legal to import to canada next year  is this a fun way to kms
if you can drive its a fun way to km/h
  you missed your chance to go km/s in a car bud  as for sagaris get a tuscan or t350 sagaris is rare as fuck so its accordingly overpriced
going to visit this bad motherfucker 22 liters automatic what should i be aware of
  what should i be aware of  its slow boring and 20 years old better than a bus pass i guess
  that is a n o i c e colour
  it has the powa but eats fuel
turns out the suspension went bad and theres substantial noise      wont buy it
  struts and mounts are ezpz i wouldnt discount it for that completely normal for a car of that age
  3000 255000kms plus an oil gasket went bad too
  begone satan  respect it keep the tires full and youll be unbeatable on the downhill    best color  pic related is mine
  these engines eventually throw rods
    nigga thats a good price its an older car so there will be regular maintenance    my mechanic used a 1994 camry as his loaner car    the odometer stopped working at 790000km and that was a few years ago    it still runs and the suspension feels like there are no shocks only springs but it starts every time and has proven cheap and reliable    camrys are the ultimate shitbox bro get it
  considering whats wrong with it you could probably get it for 25002700
2018  camaro zl1 1le  faster than a ferrari enzo and 488 gtb in nurburgring  camaro zl1 1le does 060mph in 35 seconds  the camaros price is less than 100000  impossible to say anything bad about it performance wise  just wow
gm product
  i dont care about brands its all about performance out of the factory
  oh so were here to benchrace great
  it beat supercars in the nurburgring it just beat an enzo a freaking enzo ffs its that good like i said the price isnt even in the 100k mark    i truly believe in the 60k price bracket brand is just a social construct
    how much are you inbreds getting paid for this    its a fucking cast iron and plastic piece of trash ya knobs
id rather have the ss 1le  650 horsepower  racing slicks with thin lines drawn on them  brutally stiff suspension hard mounted to the chassis  too much for the street and even for some tracks
    the only reason it isnt more popular is because of the way it looks    such a shame
  thats pretty impressive honestly
  dont forget that anyone who disagrees with this a nissannigger with a corrupt ceo
its a hella impressive car and im leaning towards one this coming summer that being said youre not going to sale even a base model camaro here this is the land of the bus riders and clapped shitboxes 1 of the board at most would even qualify for financing go shill somewhere legit
  its not something youd want to daily the spool valve suspension is pretty brutal unless you have perfect roads unless youre a big trackfag the ss 1le with or without an aftermarket supercharger or just get a hellcat     granted i own a ss 1le and have only ridden in the zl1 a few times but it struck me as something i would get tired of pretty fast
wanting to drive fast in a car that you cant see shit out of    what could possibly go wrong
    yeah it has great performance but it cant outrun its looks
  and the newest type r civic is faster than ferrari supercars from the 90s
  performance self reported by the factory like most ring times  performance you couldnt replicate  performance that requires an expensive barely streetable summer only tire    but muh msrp
  lets cut out all of our money making common man commuter sedans and focus on overpriced boytoys  gm is retarded
  still looks retarded
  normies are buying crossovers and suvs not cars
  not if theyre not fucking making any of them its a selffulfilling prophecy normalfaggots dont buy camaros either
  not street legal in yurop  canards like that can never be street legal in yurop due to pedestrian safety laws  hurr what about that magazine in germany that had a plated zr1 and 1le  they had z06 and zl1 plates
  performance that requires an expensive barely streetable summer only tire    isnt this going to be true of any official track runs across any brand though
  they werent buying them when they were producing them either gm isnt that stupid to cut a profitable lineup also low volume sports cars exist to promote the brand retard
  id be happy with a basic 2ss
  normies still buy cars just not from gm
  buick sedans sell like crazy in china though dont they
  spoiler  camaro    into the trash it goes
whats wrong with the v6 camaro i dont want to spend a million dollars on an as
  but what if you wanted to look good doing it
  wear a black leather jacket white undershirt jeans black leather boots sunglasses sport long hair 5clock shadow and you now look good driving a camaro
  650 hp  you are stupid never post again
  hes right though zl1s have 650 hp he wasnt talking about the ss 1les hp seeing as how he was listing reasons why it was too much for the street
  visibility otherwise its just a better 370z
  and in all honesty the z has dogshit visibility too i bet the 1le is better on the track than the nismo too
would you buy an electric car that had a standard 2 din radio slot stereo as an optional extra a 200km range 6s 060 basic safety just enough to pass regulations hatchback etc etc an extremely dacia sandero level basic electric car for 1012000
  no theres so many reliable options available for half that price
no because i could get a really nice used mercedes for that price
  cant really get more reliable than a new basic electric car but i agree that the entry level price range cant compete with used cars
sure
  a 200km range    haaard no i actually leave the city and actually need more range than that on a weekly basis
  i actually leave the city  i live in a smallish town and commute to the next town over 50km away daily    you realize that charge to 80 time is way shorter than full charge time right generally around 20 minutes the upcoming audi does it in 12 given that you probably want to stop for a piss or a snack every 200km or so whats the issue
no because i already own a working car and im not gonna spend money on an electric car to save money on fuel because the price difference between the fuel and the electricity will take a long time to catch up
  given that you probably want to stop for a piss or a snack every 200km or so    no i only have a weekend to spend and i want to spend it in the mountains not sitting around waiting for shit to charge i dont even like waiting the 30 seconds it takes to fill my tank theres also the issue that most places i go dont have a cell signal let along a charge station or electricity even with the 500km range in my shitbox i need to plan where to get fuel when i hit the boonies
  and im not the only one who does this type of thing skiers snowboarders and mtbers typically drive 200600kms to get to the mountains
  so you have adhd and drive into the middle of nowhere every month    surely the most common and relevant use case
  some people actually have things to do bro lol
  no its called being active having fun and enjoying the mountains and nature and i do it multiple times a month so do others as long as you can get to starbucks is all that matters right
200km range  thats fucking useless my dirtbike has a longer range
    you fags realize youre less than 5 of the population right the vast vast majority of people dont care about your games    but snow is fun hehe  literally overgrown children
  what the fuck do you do for a hobby video games fuck
  electric car  no i like ice      many 90s cars are heaps more reliable
  asks if 5 of the population would like a 200 km range vehicle  gets btfo by facts  but youre less than 5 of the population  why the fuck do you even ask a question if youre gonna start a fucking argument when somebody gives you an answer you dont agree with
yeah it would be a backup vehicle in case my bike is broken or something
  /thread
  yes i would use it as my work/errand car
horsepower is a measure of torques per minute
fuck trump
  the constant is only there because units are shit without units power is just torques per minute power is commonly expressed as horsepower qed
  torque per minute  not per second    what kind of a pleb are you  kwshps    ptomega  omega 2pirevolutions per second
  minutes is a measurement of time  horsepower is a measurement of power  force times distance equals energy  energy over time equals power  force times time equals acceleration    these are all physics equations from high school  if you dont know them when youre 18 youll never know them
  knowing them and truly understanding them is a whole nother dimention
  measures the mechanical output of a mechanical system in electrical units  why are roos so dumb
  retard
  to know if a car is fast or powerful i need to know the hp spec however the moment you start calculating anything with the power spec you need to convert it to metric or youll end up in the sillyjumble of imperial units  to an engineer there is no such thing as imperial units calculations the conversion is only done so normys understand whats going on
  i cringe whenever i see power associated with a car measured in watts
  and fuck wypipo clicks tongue
  ayo gibs me dat wytee
torque is that wonderful twisting almost tangible energy that were getting from modernday turbocharged engines  mr jww    /watchvtdf9p8hsvg  216
alight you guys  i have a range rover classic that needs new weatherstripping and in the tradition of british automotive production theyre broken and replacement parts are no longer produced  so i was thinking about making my own with silicone glue and seran wrap the door seals i replaced with generic weather stripping but this is specifically for the window track seals which are a factory molded part    so my question is has anyone tried this or think it would work or am i just asking for a mess
  1 for mess find some good window stripping from another car and cut it to size then glue it in with something that wont stink
  try a company like woolies trim or europa specialist spares theres probably something generic thats close enough
thanks guys so far owning this thing has literally involved replacing or upgrading everything that came from the factory pic related
  god damn i want a rrc so bad i live in new england too so it would be a perfect car imo
  these cars are total junk but looks cool and are off road beasts
  these cars are total junk but looks cool    british cars in a nutshell
thank you for keeping one of these beauties running
is there anything you can do when your auto transmission starts slipping or is it fucked
  check junkyards for a manual transmission and third pedal that was offered for your model back in the day or if you reaaaaaaally wanna go back to autotragic again either replace it or you can try replacing the clutches in your current one replacing snap rings and maybe bearings then doing pressure tests to see if operates well again then throw it back in
  sometimes all you need a fluid change and a filter other times all you can do is add a quart of lucas and hope for the best
  check junkyards for a manual transmission and third pedal that was offered for your model back in the day    how much would that cost to do in an 05 rsx
  i wonder if you could find a junkyard to throw one in yours and you pay them cash
pour some stop slip juice and pray to your preffered religious entity
  assuming you found all junkyard parts thatd be like 200 at my local yard
  most shops wont touch that shitask your local car group on facebook every town has the dude who does the shit right then pay that dude is money if you dont wanna do it yourself
  ironically the legend in your pic im pretty sure went 500k miles on the factory clutch
  you buy a real car
  yeah no idiot
bong here how hard is it to get away with not telling an insurance company about mods to my car
hello sheckleburgs
insurance hates mods  oh no no no no
  bongs  getting away with modding anything  no chance in hell
  so long as you never have a crash or get pulled over by a traffic cop theres no way they can find out
  bongland is mainland europe  everywhere is grmany  the uk is one of the easiest places to do mods legally
  move
  depends entirely on the mods  a swap/fi setup absolutely no way bolt ons and a tune or aero shit all day
  the most they ask you for is some pictures of the car if you do an agreed valuation and i only had to do that on my e30 because it was under a classic policy    other than that they dont care because it gives them cause to back out of paying up in a claim if they find an undeclared mod when youve crashed    basically dont crash and youll be fine 
no you are all wrong you cant do things in the eu without your loicensr trust me i know because murrika
  nigga theres even a road legal couch in the uk
  be australian  insurance is roughly 1k for meteor strike tier comprehensive insurance  they dont care about mods aslong as  a theyre road legal  b they didnt contribute to an accident    slammed falcodore shitheaps need not apply
what does /o/ think about the s15 pros cons  memecar/gem
  slow noodle meme car
  very nice machine desu
  slower than my car
would kill for a lhd version
  stop playing forza you zoomer instead of shitposting on 4chan why dont you get a damn job lmao          t people who havent driven the car      no need to kill but if you had enough money you could pay someone enough money to swap it to lhd
  all the s chassis is noodles the 15 is just newer not a burger so the s15 is less rare than the s13 where i live
i have one theyre great cars full of great tweaks that make them more serious about driving for reals than s13/s14s revised rear suspension geometry additional bolt on and welded in bracing throughout the chassis the helical lsd which puts power down very well and consistently as opposed to the old viscous lsds the gearing in the 6 speed aisin transmission is well spaced for the engine and is just as tough as the 5speeds if you dont drive like a retard my only gripe now is that parts are getting harder to find as the drift fad has fucking destroyed the used parts market and people in australia buy functional cars and wreck them to make a quick buck
  basically needs autistic jap to make it fast like in your pic stock they are slow
  the top secret s15 wasnt made to be fast lol    that was a d1gp competition drift car dumb ass
  what the actual fuck is that skyline on right i know it was one of autismmobiles he took on highways but what are they ascended beyond my understanding
  yeah but yours is ugly
  swap it to lhd  fucking cringe kys retard mutt
  top secret v35 gtr            the stock vq35de was replaced with the 45l v8 vk45de from the nissan cima      looks like you have the reading comprehension of a retard
  yeah looks like you dont even know what your are talking about  idiot
  mirin that power level
  if you want to make a show car sure go for it it will never be a daily though
  why is the engine shit
    stop playing forza you zoomer instead of shitposting on 4chan why dont you get a damn job lmao    yeah he should just start being a complete retard like you lmao
  its one of the best looking cars ever made i think and thats even more special because it isnt the typical saloon silhouette      its fun but doesnt have performance to brag about unless you mod it the interior is great too i love this car very much but am aware there are better cars out there for the same price
  better cars out there for the same price  mind spoon feeding me they seem cheap here in au
  t zoomer
  ive owned two you dumb cunt the gt86/brz is better just a bit slower
  stop this reposting at once
  daytona poster strikes again
you could buy a vehicle that is faster than 1m sport cars right now for 15k brand new why are motorcycle sales declining what is your legitimate excuse if all you want is speed you cant get it cheaper than this
im going to ride a 600 on a track next year to see if i might buy one    still probably wont go new though
i want speed and to not die or get wet when it rains carry a months worth of groceries drive around with friends and not have my hair fucked up by wind/helmet every time i go somewhere
boomers getting too old  some bikes getting rekt by emissions  idk what region youre talking about because western yurop is still having more and more bike sales asia is also a huge market  its just the 600cc i4 bikes that got rekt it doesnt cost that much more to say cast a valve cover for a 1000 vs a 600 but the eventual bikes cant have a 2k or so price difference because nobody would buy the 600s this lead to manufacturers tryibg to spread out development costs which caused stagnating development the 600s also got destroyed by emissions the r6 went down 10 hp from euro 2 to 3 and another 8 from 3 to 4 gaining back that power is possible but a full pipe  exhaust is another 2k in euro 5 vvt or some other tech will ve commonplace bmw ducati and suzuki already have it available  tldr boomer becoming too old for bikes new middleweight bikes too expensive for what they bring
  thats what you have a daily driver for faggot
late stage developing countries shun motorcycles as two wheel transport reminds them of their poorer days     im the usa and other western nations the motorcycle is not seen as serious transportation worse in the usa traffic filtering is not legal in most of the country so being on two wheels doesnt provide a benefit in urban traffic
not all motorcycles are meant for speed    why else do you think people buy sportsters
  who drives their track/fun car to the grocery store or in the wet most cars that come even remotely close to bikes in performance only get driven on weekends in nice weather for daily driving people usually have a separate car
  pussification of males
  motorbikes are for kids lol
im trying to save up for one as a poorfag
actually the real reason for declining motorcycle sales is that the preowned market for them has grown absolutely out of control riders turnover pretty regularly die get spooked family guilts them into quitting they get bored etc so the preowned market has become incredibly competitive furthermore motorcycles themselves are incredibly reliable which is why you still have millions of these perfectly good jap inline 4s that have been banging off the rev limiter for 20 years straight there is just no reason to buy new
current gen doesnt have a lot of disposable money i honestly see a big boom in motorcycle sales once self driving cars take off and millennials have extra cash    motorcycles will be the last bastion for real drivers
  and this is a good thing
id love to have one but legit scared of becoming some tragic quadriplegic i see stacy run stop signs everyday due to snap chatting herself on a dog filter
  its doable mate i bought one for like 1200   payments of course bc shitty local dealer  my first baiku 
  insofar as western developed countries go we have a persisting culture of sissies cucks and man children whom their parents either helicoptered over them or let video games babysit them and whom are unable or unwilling to learn things on their own without being spoonfed it doesnt help that media outlets are portraying all forms of masculinity are bad and claim it all falls under the umbrella term toxic masculinity    yes there are exceptions to this but the overarching norms of society are towards the sheltered dont think outside the box everyones opinion matters and is equally valid mentality and both the left and the right are responsible for the state were in
  why are motorcycle sales declining  because a bike from 10 years ago is just as good as a bike made today and they are like 1/3 of the price
  same with cars
i thought it was only harley sales that were rapidly declining    and the majority of the bikes being bought/sold are via the used market    i think but idk
  but what will people from 10 years from now ride or another ten years or another    if we dont buy new today
  i think new bike sales will drastically pick up once gas powered cars are taxed to hell and back and a lot of vehicles on the road are autonomous in this sad future a motorcycle gas or electric will be the enthusiasts refuge
  too many mexican and salvadoran drivers where i live they run red lights and constantly turn in front of oncoming traffic theres no way id survive more than a few months
  they keep upping the prices im not going to pay 30k for a v4s
  i have dogshit credit so i dont know if thats an option
  as a huge motorcycle enthusiast owned 18 bikes so far your question is retarded bikes are  less convenient  slower on a track  more dangerous  shit in weather  bad to carry passengers  less reliable  than most good sports car a bike is a very specific kind of toy its not a super car replacement not to mention supercars go up in value most of the time bikes plummet they also get stolen like crazy ive owned all kinds of bikes from 1000cc sport to mini hog they are not a comparison  not to mention my 1000cc sport bike got btfo by quite a few cars at tx2k17 turbo lambos and gtr made my bike look like how my bike made a stock mustang look
  picking one of the most expensive superbikes available  a 200 horsepower gsxr1k is 14 grand if you really want italian the rsv4 is 15
  slower on track  that sounds like more of a you problem
  99 of literbike suids would get their asses handed to them on a track by guys on 250s it taks a fuck load of skill to get all the track performance out of a motorcycle compared to a car most squids cant even launch their bikes properly or shift properly
  so youre admitting you have no skill cool
  you never know they never even ran my credit when i walked in 2 put money down on the bike    thats not taking into account that i live down the street and kinda know the dealer i guess or that i have pretty good credit    its hit or miss anon but if you can find something even with garb credit simply making the payments if its reported in  will build ur credit     most  dealers which arent big brands might not even report it in if u pay it but if u dont pay theyll hunt u down
  i dont ride a sport bike but ive smoked many across intersections and can keep up with most on the twisties im saying most quids have no skill i target fixated bro
  i can beat an f1 car with a pushbike as long as its against a dog
  go to a suzuki dealership they offer 0 down financing even with ass credit
  natural selection bikers die before they can breed most of the time the rest of us enjoy four wheels and being alive to see our grandkids  t emt
  ive smoked many across intersections  what does that even mean sounds lethal or gay
  dogs wouldnt go piss off another driver in a 5000lb vehicle so i guess theyre still above a squid      when they race each other on green i and other cars can easily beat them across the intersection because they all have shitty clutch control
  are you retarded bikes are slower around tracks than good sports cars they can beat a miata they cant beat a gtr you dumb fuck ask me how i know you dont track your bike    tsukuba  102 for a gtr 2008  1065 for cbr 1000rr 2016  in 14 laps the original gtr will be lapping the bike
  tfw i bought my zx6r with the money i got from getting hit on my ninja 250    and even though the bike in only worth like 3k i recently spent 1500 replacing the motor
  men
  because people dont want to be killed my retarded soccer moms in crossovers
  if love to but im too scared of ending up a quadriplegic nigger
whats the best liter bike and why is it the rsv4
some generations have a problem learning how to drive a fucking manual clutch    yes im pointing at you lazy millennials
  maybe if you were a better emt they wouldnt die as often  t biker and emt
normies and zoomers are legitimately afraid of them
ridership is declining because manufacturers are retards who cant make a proper starter bike there is a reason the ujm was so popular
  not sure if ironic boomerposting or not at this point
  hair messed up by helmet  bet you let someone else cut your hair sad chicks love helmet frizzled short hair
  gear up and ride protectively
  just filter anyway idiot
  there are plenty of proper starter bikes but why spend 5k on a new 300400cc bike when an old bulletproof ninja 250 is still 1000 or less
  too many paki chink nigger drivers here its a death sentence  toronto
my husband wont let me get another one but i was a total squid fuckwit so its probably for the best
  fag
  people dont want crotch rocket styled starter bikes
  i was a coroner and have seen more dead bikers than anyone here still ride sounds like ur just a bitch nigga
  you should learn proper terminology before attempting to argue on the internet you just sounds silly to people who know what theyre talking about
  ninja 250  1000 monopoly monies  y tho  you can get a gs500 or an er5 for 500 bucks
  the bikes look like a crotch rocket
been playing mc3 on pcsx2 emulation and ive been enjoying the hell out of it been wondering if its worth getting nfsu2 also wondering which game you think is superior
  holy fuck underground 2 was leagues better its arguably the most fun racing game of all time
both were pretty special back in the day but nfsu2 will always be the most memorable imo    mc3 remixs multiplayer was cool i remember running an ethernet cable from one end of the house to my room just so i could drift online with randoms on that island in tokyo
  gran turismo 3
ug1  ug2    but really i would consider them equal no need to place them above one another
  nfsu2 was geared way too much towards nignogs most wanted a best hot pursuit 2 was awesome in its time too
personally i like midnight more
  played ug1 at a mates house on dolphine emulator car selection seems pretty weak desu
  really i always assumed it was mc3 because it had the chrysler 300 yukon escalade ext 3 hummers and a colbalt
  thats what you get if you work with dub magazin  mc2 had the better atmosphere
  ug2 adds shitty cars but removes cars that are rarely in games such as the dodge neon nfsug1 also has the s2000 and integra which are integral to car culture especially at the time    ug2 adds an audi a3 audi tt ae86 is300 infiniti g35 mustang gto and 106/corsa on eu release and some suvs most of which dont fit thematically customization is geared towards niggers with spinners scissor doors audio systems etc ug1 was much more tasteful    furthermore ug2 has an inferior sense of speed what im about to link was dropped and it makes cars feel much slower than they did in ug1 which is lame as fuck
  
  i love that shit has a kid though desu
  no real cars in mc2 though still love mc3 but if i want atmosphere id play the first one
  yeah but ug1s customization was more consistent    actually all of ug1 was more consistent the car list the city the soundtrack all lead to an amazing atmosphere that the sequel failed to match in which it compensated for with nigger shit     also this mc1 has the best atmosphere and soundtrack
  no real cars in mc2 though    most of them are close as fuck to their real world counterparts though its obvious what theyre based on also this thread is bringing muh nostalgia    
  eh never really played the midnight club series much juiced and flatout series were fun as fuck    kinda wanna play flat out now
  nigger customization doesnt bother me as long as it isnt the only form of customization in mc3 i niggered out a cobalt for the irony and humor factor but my other cars generally have more tasteful mods the techno mc1 seems pretty nice but the dnb isnt as good as the one in mc3
  to be honest mc3s techno soundtrack is 90 shit while mc1s soundtrack is 90 amazing
  heard techno on mc2 was the best but mc3 had a better soundtrack in all other genres
  mc2 definitely had the better electric soundtrack between it and 3 i never played 1 mc3 had the rap part of its soundtrack down
  i do enjoyed the dnb part of the soundtrack
nfsu2 still holds up as an arcade racer today no nfs has come close to that game
  no nfs has come close to that game  wrong
underground 2 was fantastic  dub edition was pretty good  gran turismo has always been god tier    but do any of yall coloreds remember how kick ass srs was  smooth graphics and a good selection of cars and boy racer mods
  mw05 is still better than ug2
  nfsu2 if you want an overperforming ae86 which demolishes ever car in the game seriously that thing is completely broken a few upgrades and it corners like an f1 car and to relive the peak ricer period of the early 2000s    the game actually requires you to rice the shit out of your car to progress and its just fucking hilarious in retrospect
  i never got into mw i dont like the car list much and its world is disgusting
emcee  two
first game i recall ever seeing weeabood out cars
  that game took a few pages of the book  how to increase the car list without actully having that many cars published by polyphony digital   that game had abou 4 or 5 different r34 skylines
  srs  good  that game sucked ass
  agreed it was fun for a while but ehh
100k dollars  060 in 22 seconds  literally the fastest production car on the planet seats 7 people  is this the end of the internal combustion engine
  are there even tires available that could do a 22 second 060 on a track
no youre retarded joe six pack could never afford that
  street tires
  overheats in 3 minutes at full performance
  whats the wot range of a chiron
not in production
  about 30 miles before it runs out of gas at full speed if the spec sheet is anything to go by
  needs an hour to warm up
  the w16 is an engineering masterpiece so thats a bad comparison the tires will fall apart before it ever overheats
  gets beaten by a brz on the track  kek
the fuck is this
  one trick pony the fact musk tries to sell his brand partly on the notion that theyre the most fun you can possibly have in a car is stupid considering the heat soak which literally shuts the cars down on the track
  100k  no no no no no nobody will pay south of 130k for one and u know it  seats 7 people  midgets yes maybe 5 asians and 2 amerifats and their 2 fat kids
  60 to 130  keeps up with an isf  theyre slow and hype the standstill time where electric gas max torque youll never see a tesla in a rolling race with anything decent since it gets bus lengths pulled on it
  is this the end of the internal combustion engine  until they can charge the damn thing in less than 15 minutes then no sure it would be nice to put around town but having to get a hotel and charge for a day every 200 miles no thanks
  but muh supercharging stations    gets overloaded
br/o/s i am looking to lease a fun/sporty car that is also comfy amd somewhat practical i really wanna stay under 800/mo but if the deal is ridiculous id do more like a 911 for 900/mo or something    anyways can anyone help me out anyone know some lease deals that can get crazy if i find a demo/exec car or previous model year    i was looking at m3/m4 cayman rs3 s4 c63/c43 hellcat ftype etc i strongly prefer a manual or do i just say fuck it and get a miata again
  personally i wouldnt lease anything  but the hellcat is an excellent choice lease shouldnt be ridiculous more torque than you could ask for
rs3
save up for 4 months and buy a civic with 200 of simple mods
i wouldnt lease but i mean you could lease a new m2 thatd be a pretty sick cheap sports car
  yeah i was gunna say if youre gunna spend 800 monthly you could save up and buy a turbo honda or like and old camaro or something
      a civic isnt comfortable like something new for long driving and i want to lease because i want a factory warranty and i want a car with a warranty im not buying new or certified since payments will be too high and ill lose the same amount in depreciation as im paying monthly in a lease anyways
  right then id pick the hellcat without a doubt warranty support from dodge is great dealership everywhere  scary fast super comfortable on long rides lots of room interior wise and shouldnt depreciate too much  the srt and scat pack cars are cheaper and still very fast too
  warranty support from dodge is great dealership everywhere  so much this  fiat and chrysler have several millenia in combined experience of warranty work
    this is actually a good idea a hellcat would be fuckin awesome bitches love chargers too
  im not just saying theyre good because people online say theyre good i had a 2010 srt that was great one of the faster cars ive driven even with the 61   for a modern muscle car they are very comfortable
    the leases are pretty ridiculous on them too the only thing that turns me away is the  not good at turning thing    ive never owned a really fast car like that but i know id be out car shopping if i gave up my s2k for something that cant turn
  why not a demon if you got 800/mo to play with
  mine handled pretty good for what it was they do a lot better with wider wheels and better tires stock theyre not the best but it is a live axle car
  eh too hard to find and they dont make a charger which id be more interested in for the added practicality
bumping just to clarify im trying to find out if anyone has made any stupid good deals on any of these types of cars    or maybe i will go with cpo
car retard here dont really know shit about them but id like to keep my car working for the longest time possible     pic related
  depends on engine overall try to do what the manufacturer tells you to do
    bought it used  75k kilometers im going to look for the manufacturers recommandations online    heres the engines spec but some of it is in french
french  y i k e s  keep an obd2 reader handy and take really good care of all the electronics check the wheel wells for rust too
    memes aside are you planning on driving that thing for more then 5 years if its your first car that you want to keep for a couple of years and then buy something nicer just regular maintenance is fine fluids tires etc
  check your oil and all other fluids every month more if it leaks change the oil at least twice a year preventive maintenance is key look at airplanes they are in perfect condition even at 40 years old check your tire pressure and keep good tread on your vehicle old worn down rubber wears out everything else out on your suspension
  dont  touch  the  electronics  t meganefag    and prepare for sensors stopping working after you unplug the battery
  divide the recommended oil change interval by 2  change the oil in the manual transmission even though citroen will tell you that it does not require changes ever  do not skimp on other maintenance shit except maybe brake fluid recommended change is every 2 years but in relatively dry climates you can easily get away with 34 years  paint the scratches on the metal panels with lacquer if you arent going to repair them right away    overall tu3 is a fairly good engine by french standards and should last 200k with good maintenance
  prepare for sensors stopping working after you unplug the battery  i have a berlingo and my sensors tend to do the opposite
just follow the maintenance schedule
be having great night out with a friend  driving home truck feels sluggish  transmission slipping so bad that i cant drive over 40mph  also grinding while coasting especially in od  have to drive home through neighborhood streets in 1st and 2nd only     now i have to try and find one in a wrecked vehicle or something i cant afford a rebuild cant sell the truck for shit with it like this and cant outright buy another car either    i knew this day would come eventually but why now
good thing you updated your blog all of us subscribers were waiting for you to make a new post
  check fluid level and add if low  if not low  drop transmission pan  change filter
lemme guess silverado 1500 with 4l60e
  how do you feel about using aftermarket gaskets eg wix on a transmission pan where the oe uses something like gasket maker or rtv
  ive always used gaskets and a thin coat of rtv on the pan side only
  heh dead fucking on 1998
shoulda went ferd yea dip
buying shitty mutt trucks
i want to die
what am i looking at here some kind of cannon from cybertron
  looks like a pressure plate and some splines
  why impact marks around spline
  its an old ass car that has been beaten on its entire life and has no warranty but dont worry op isnt a debt slave
output shaft spline damage that is a real fuckin bummer
  not my picture just kinda looks like whats wrong with mine just replaced clutch a few weeks ago yesterday i heard some weird grinding noise so i dropped my transmission and this is about what i saw fucking rip
    i posted this because im not sure what caused this did i not align the clutch properly
  honestly idk but that is the most logical thing to assume yeah
  or the tolerances between the splines were bad / the wrong size and it slipped teeth
  you get used to it
  small hardon particle collider
  were the splines slipping idk what im looking at exactly
did it affect drivability pretty quick after you did the work  or was this a slow degradation 
  mechanical anus
  sounds like somebody is banks little goyim cuck
  inside of cern collider
  im not seeing the damage and your pic doesnt even show the shaft
  i want to die  besides the goober install of a roller bearingwhy bushing what is the matter  junk on the splines looks like grease  diaphragm spring fingers dont appear to be damaged but they are out of focus
  just take finance goy
  im not seeing any issues in the pic what has your knickers in a knot opie
  theres a distinct lack of spline teeth on the further away spline at 36 oclock
  did it just destroy the clutch splines or did it also destroy your input shaft
what are those far away splines supposed to be my cars flywheel doesnt have splines and my input shaft is male
  thats the pilot bearing
  those are replaceable whats the problem
    its hard to see in the picture its not in focus but a couple of splines got stripped off not really a big deal just replace the clutch unless the input shaft on the transmission got stripped too
me too
  diaphragm spring fingers dont appear to be damaged    if op says he replaced clutch a few weeks ago and this is what they look like then there are problems bad/poorly installed throwout bearing or linkage problems      not my picture  yeah thanks for that  heres a picture of a clutch that is busted up in a completely different manner
  underrated post
nice car for a great price why wont anyone buy this car
    make an offer    low ball him see what happens
  ask him whens the last time it ran
  how many km on it there
  no lowballers please i know what i have
  ran when parked
  post the link faggot
  not a bad deal had one just like in high school
ok so i aksed him about it
  ask him for the carfax kek
link  
runs great
no tire kickers dreamers or lowballers i know what ive got
  the memes make themselves
  it always makes me laugh seeing some retard think ss or anything special means shit when it doesnt have the original engine
fuel injection was a mistake
  well that fuel injection for sure
  have fun in your 200hp 80 liter
multi point injection is great single/dual point injection as shown is retarded the worst of carbs and injectors put together
  carbs werent actually the big issue for malaise era engines gimped cams heads intake manifolds and exhaust were dual injection is best though
  what the fuck is dual injection
  direct injection plus port injection you get the performance/economy benefits of di without the carbon buildup
  you are a mistake    port and direct injection direct injection is more effecient than port injection or carberators but it doesnt clean the intake valves like port fuel injection or carbs dual injection also means more fuel can be delivered which is good for tuning
it quite literally wasnt
tinted lights always ruin a car  prove me wrong
theyre illegal anyway
  and thats a good thing   should be proper fined too like 750 and you have to change it within a week
  i dont even understand the aesthetic preference for tinted lights anymore with how intricately ornate head and taillight design has gotten why hide it
  art deco as fuck
i think mine look nice
  mine are e11 certified bmw e34 so theyre legal in europe headlights would be harder to make legal thooo
front tinted lights look stupid but rear lights that remove the redness and a little bit of tint are decent looking pitch black lights look stupid and are dangerous
darkening the housing is alright   
  a light smoke is always nice whats surprising is honda and mazda come with fucking stock smoked taillights how far weve come
ive always wanted to tint the headlights on a new cadillac so you can only see the drls make it look like some of their concepts
  get lights to see   make them work worse by tinting them  light tints are for retards
  are those ek headlights if so do you have a link for those
  im gonna go one step further and say that body color housings are also nice
  nigga are you dumb  theyre ctr lights
  doubt anyone disagrees with that blacked out taillights are the official mod of people who rice out cars like darts and velosters
  this looks great
tinted headlights should be mandatory for cars with led lights
  i completely agree
dont know if caps count as tinted but the black headlights dont ruin it i think 
  not always flyeye is legal in bong
are schools like uti and lincoln tech really worth the money is the education received quality enough to actually land a job in automotive service is this even a good career path to take
  yeah if you graduate cousin of mine went to mmi in florida and graduated years ago now he lives in washington making really good money fixing boats i kinda want to do the same thing but idk
  id love to get a business degree then bring my skills up to the point where i could start my own shop but from what ive seen the majority of people absolutely despise the job i guess you just have to love what you do
  potassium injected v8 awesome
  uti is a scam just like most for profit schools cant vouch for lincoln though    also all the money in the mechanic trade is in aircraft diesel engines and boats cars and bikes pay shit
sup op i go to uti im about to hit the road for like 20 minutes but if you have any specific questions shoot and ill answer when im back  disclaimer im a veteran on gi bill so idk how much tuition costs but i heard lots roughly 33k for the 12 month auto program
  no no no    let me give you some examples  best friend  super competent mechanic  goes to uti  works for a shop for about 10 years  we open shop together  super succesful  then  hire uti kids  six times  they all are shit  they are all retarded  they all sucks balls at working on cars  we have to eventually fire all of them  hire people off cl  all 3 have been with us for years  this exact story will be told by my several friends that also own their own shops    you are either just good at working on cars naturally or you arent sure people can learn a bit but those people wired to work on cars dont need school if you can do engine swaps and wiring right now in your garage and understand exactly what youre doing you dont need school just start at a shop and prove yourself over time if you are going to school to learn to work on cars you will forever be a lowmid tier mechanic that will get a shitty job at christian bros and make less than 40k a year while spending 10k on tools   dont become a mechanic just to get a job either become one because you know you have the top tier talent to eventually open your own place or find a good job
  33k for the 12 month auto program    jesus christ i knew uti tuition was fucking crazy but thats utter insanity     33 grand for a year of school you could get for less than 4 grand at a community college
  would you say that the education is actually worth it ive done minor things to my car and am currently buying a project just to better myself but have you actually benefitted from uti so far ive heard many stories about kids that went to school for automotive and were just shit im confident that i would soak up knowledge as this is more of a passion than just a job for me but the idea of spending that kind of money for an education with such mixed reviews frightens me
  car runs on bananas
as far as the training facilities tools and instructors go uti is an awesome program it starts off with disassembling and measuring out and reassembling an engine than an intro to power trains real basic basic undercar which is done on skeletonized bare bones chassis for esse and then 2 electric courses after that it plunges into working on actual carsreassembling 4 different entire suspensions and doing alignments rebuilding a rwd manual trans a manual transaxle rebuilding 2 auto trans one of which has to run on the dyno so you cant bullshit it driveability and diagnosis courses including scan tools oscilloscopes various specialized test kits for every system in the car brakes overhaul steering overhaul more advanced electrical hvac hybrids and culminates in 3 power and performance classes where you build a small block 350 from parts measuring every clearance lift it and install it into a t bucket and then drive it to a dyno and dyno it bolt on mods and re dyno then pull it out and rebuild it with performance internals and re dyno it again the third power and performance is a modern course with some honda motor where u play with bolt on mods and tuning software to dyno it  cont
  as far as learning and retention yes absolutely i went in knowing just the very basics and having done small repairs and upgrades to my car and i can say i have learned a ton every class comes with a packet the size of a text book and i have each packet totally annotated and highlighted plus questions i asked and got answered scrawled in side columns each one in its own 3 ring binder at home in my little automotive library i also have 3 composition books full of notes sketches and diagrams from the online learning modules and exercises i have a perfect 40 gpa 8 student of the course awards highest grade in that course and im currently actively being recruited by porsche motorcars usa to attend free training at there training center for 6 months with a guaranteed 2 year contract at a dealership afterwards i work at a shop as an apprentice and am able to speak intelligently to the 30 year master doagnostic tech work on my own unsupervised on small to medium things and assist the senior techs on big things ive rebuilt a valve body for a 2014 mercedes benz that fixed the problem diagnosed multiple electrical and sensor failures and thats just at work on my own project ive applied literally everything ive learned at school and midway thru and engine rebuild for my blower 355 suspensions steering and brake overhaul and conversion to fuel injection and computer controlled spark retard under boost  cont
  im doing that right now and its totally worth it you get out of it what you put in put in the effort work extra hard to earn your certs and youll come out a desirable mechanic
  this my mechanic is who pretty bad ass is self taught with no school
now here comes the bad the cost is outrageous like straight up shut the fuck up your fucking kidding me highway robbery bad over thirty grand and thats for one year the other guy is totally right you could definitley 100 percent go to a junior college and learn everything for under 4k guaranteed the only benefits of uti is that its a straight shot one year no registering for classes petition full classes switch to evenings to get into a class and all that but honestly fuck paying 30k for this if i wasnt on gi bill i wouldnt come here also its impossible to fail the standards are super low theyll teach you how to be a very competent technician but the passing grade and tests are a joke you can pass the entre currículum and not learn a thing i see it every day its usually the dumb fuck lube monkeys that work like at pep boys and shit that think they know everything sleep through class dont do anythin in group projects then pass the easy multiple choice test and boom graduate with no more knowledge than they had before those are the people that get all the bad rep an end up being lube or tire techs bouncing from place to place for 5 years before they quit and sell their tools basically you get what you put in and no one will hold u accountable for not learning because its a for profit school and their getting paid anyways the recruiting aspect is pretty cool there always hiring out of here and not as lube or tire techs and 1 year of uti counts as a year of experience for ase and they let u take the exams early here so basically since ive been working this whole time ive been in school ill have (((2 years))) of experience and theyll give me the ases that i manage to take and pass while im here
  yeah well i think youre a computer controlled spark retard
honestly just working with the higher techs at a shop is all the learning you need you can skip the entire training part by just piggy backing on knowledgeable techs learning as you go and passing your ases/manufacturer equivalent      at my shop weve got two people in the mopar program that have to get shop time in between semesters theyve learned so much more actually working on the vehicles and asking other then theyve learned in class     i guess this goes for any field though
help me out here guys  i bought a car oct 25th and the dealer said since i paid with a check hed mail the title once it cleared then he said it would be within 30 days finally i called him on the 28th and he said he would mail it that day but i have no yet received it  what can i do to finally get my title and who can i complain to   i bought the car in ohio and am a pa resident
  bump
  bump
  keep calling or drive back there you fucking dipshit never buy a car without a title being given to you    check  jesus dude what year is it get cash next time grandpa or at least a money order
    keep harassing him for it otherwise maybe can go to small claims court if it gets to that        meh ive bought alot of vehicles the last decade with a certified bankers cheuque less sketchy than carrying 5k cash or wiring the money
  he doesnt seem to want to give it to me  what else can i do
  what we just said keep calling him or go back there idiot literally call him every fucking hour if you have to call him from different numbers or show the fuck up in person be a fucking man
  what if he tries to bullshit when i show up in person
op your mistake was thinking every seller is a honest and good person and would actually go through with this
  are you 12 have you ever had to be a man in your life
  police
  i am a 20 year old female
  so be a man its 201811
  ok i will physically threaten a dude who knows my address and see what happens xd
  you do know guns are a thing in the real world right they put women on the same level as men in confrontations  but seriously show up and demand that shit then if he fucks off start screaming rape or some other girl shit or take a dude with you and make it clear you arent leaving without the title
  get a lawyer
that isnt how buying a car works you are given the title at the time of purchase if you are going to pay by check like a retard and not a cashiers check then you should just go back to the dealership once it is cleared and get the title
  no dude to go with me all i had was my mom who sat there in silence while i got fucked apparently    i just want to know if theres some government department i can complain to
  government department  not really are you larping because you are making a ton of fucking excuses
i just wanted to buy a car
  what excuses the only advice ive got in here is to continue harassing him or pull a gun
  tell him youre going to small claims court or that youll call the cops on him for fraud  he has to give you the tittle
  is the car plated  run carfax to see if its clean  got notarized bill of sale  attempt to register as lost title funky if guy decides to lay claim to it again
  alright op on the chance this is legit ill break it down     what most likely occurred is that the dealer sold you the car before he himself actually had the title in hand its fairly common for dealers to take physical delivery of a car before they have the paperwork for it given the logistics behind how certain auctions/banks/repos work it often takes weeks to months before a dealership actually gets a nonbranded title for a vehicle    a reputable dealership will refrain from selling a car until they have the proper paperwork in hand     shitty dealerships will go ahead and pull the trigger gambling that nothing will happen that might delay or prevent them from getting the title and that itll happen quickly enough that you dont ask too many questions    this is in fact illegal which is why the dealer is being so evasive     step 1 contact your local dmv they can use the vin of the car and look up the title status and perhaps provide some insight into what is going on it had a lien waiting for release dealership fucked up paperwork    step 2 most states are going to have a department within the dmv/state government called license  theft that deals with deceptive/illegal business practices as they relate to car dealerships/car titles/illegal plating contact them provide the info you gain from the dmv ask if they have any recourse to intervene on your behalf     step 3 contact a property lawyer preferable one who has experience dealing with sales contracts/auto disputes google will be your friend explain everything to him he will know what direct legal recourse your state/county/city may provide and can advise you accordingly 99 of lawyers arent going to charge you anything for a basic consultation and if they do it will be reasonable    step 4 sue the dealership in small claims court its a simple/easy process go to your local courthouse and any court clerk can explain the steps you need to take
  i am hoping the title arrives in the mail tommorow as he said he mailed it on the 28th but it doesnt seem likely    thank you   saved this post
  even if it did arrive in the mail tomorrow i would still contact the dmv and get any history they could provide you on your title then contact a lawyer and have him review it     if that dealer sold you the car without a clean title in handwhich the title history and lawyer will be able to determine its illegal and you could sue the fuck out of him which i highly recommend doing     i have a bad feeling thoughevery reputable dealership i ever interacted with that mailed something importanttitle/loan documents/ registration/platewould have sent it in such a way that it had a tracking numbercertified mail fedex ups    if he is bullshitting you then refer to steps 1 through 4 above    either way take it as a life lesson learned and as shitty as it is to recommend if you dont have experience with it never go buy a car without taking along someone who knows whats up doubly so if youre a girl
  just did a title search for ohios dmv   he actually had the title and it is now listed under a private owner and was transferred on the same day i called him    i think i will be alright d
  what else can i do  call the cops
  your state may be different but in pa they have to get a new title from the state every time you sell a car     i just bought a 2009 honda fit and the state sent the new title to the dealer not sure why it usually comes direct to me then the dealer sent it to me
  spends entire thread complaining  gets best advice you could possible find on /o/  i think i will be alright d
  hopefully youll get in the next couple days then    and since surprisingly no one in this thread asked what did you actually buy op
  2000 toyota camry with 165k miles for 2150
  you could always bring a big fat guy along to psychologically bring the dealer into submission while you ask for your title if that doesnt solve it id bring it to court op the dealer seems like a real scumbag shit sucks sorry this happened
  london
  this is why women without fathers or husbands typically keep disgusting fat gay bears as friends just an fyi
  i like my dick sucked ill buy you a sick truck
  honestly couldve done way worse check the oil often though those old toyotas like to burn a lot of it as they progress through their life cycle  t brother owns a 2000 corolla sedan
  she said thanks and saved the post calm down incel
  i just wanted to buy a car  oh man just wait till the first time this car breaksdown on you  and then youll probably keep driving it until its fubard

the stigma against fucking your cousin is the most retarded shit there is yea ok i get it if you actually breed with her theres a risk of genetic damage but nobody is talking about doing that im talking about straight up just fucking her for pleasure   theres no drawback its literally somebody who is similar to you in the most possible ways as in she shares your actual genetic code more than anybody else you can fuck and grew up in the same conditions of course your bodies are going to be a perfect match and theres never going to be somebody you can have better sex with your penis will fit inside her like a glove its honestly stupid that people are missing out on the actual best sex possible when theyre growing up just to please society   yea ive fucked my cousin weve had sex hundreds of times growing up i remember summers were we were fucking three or four times a day and ive covered every inch of her body with cum at one point or another and painted her insides white with my semen i wouldnt choose any other way to lose my virginity it was safe somebody i trusted and the dynamics of secrecy make her the perfect fucktoy since she knows we cant go public some of the best memories of growing up were fucking her and i wouldnt trade that for some random high school slut that im going to forget about later in my life   when we meet up at holidays and have sex its extra special because we both remember all those years before weve been fucking each other and all the times weve traded fluids when i cum inside her its as nostalgic as looking at old photo albums you will never understand how much better cumming inside her feels when its combined with the strong memories of growing up none of the other girls ive been with have ever satisfied my cock the way she still does every single time  anyways pic related its my daily

tfw its legal to fuck your cousin in canada    cant wait til shes 16
  i wholeheartedly agree op
  lets be honest everyone in the us hates brodozer drivers too stock trucks or proper offroaders are fine
  tfw canadian  one time my cousin drove me home and we were sitting in her car outside my apartment just talking    then there was this silence for a few seconds and suddenly my body is screaming at me to lean over and kiss her    i looked over at her and she was staring directly at me with sex eyes    i leaned in a bit and i saw her leaning in but then my brain took over and i ran the fuck away    as i was leaving she said some shit like hey we should watch a movie or something but i was panicking at that point and couldnt really hear    sometimes i wonder what could have been
all of my cousins are males except for one and she looks like olive oil from popeye i cant relate
  is that a bad thing
  yes it is and no its not because youre not supposed to fuck your cousin like an inbred fucktard from arkansas
this post is based and redpilled
  dont even fib you still would if you had the chance with no repercussions
  the risk of genetic problems aside from actual recessive heredity disease are greatly overstated fuck your cousin if you want to cousin fucker and have kids    theyll likely be no more fucked up than yourself you degenerate cousin fucker
  
  o b s e s s e d
  telegraph  poor source  pakistan  retarded already  systemic continuous inbreeding causes problems  i havent said otherwise    if someone randomly gets their cousin pregnant kid will be fine there is a big difference between that and systemic inbreeding
  rent free baby
  if theyre first cousins and a shitty gene runs in the family the kids will most likely get it
  most likely  false assuming the parent isnt symptomatic of the of the recessive gene there is a 50/50 chance that either of their related parents got it thats a 25 chance both related parents got it thats watered down by a factor of 2 in the next generation and then again for the cousins kid this is assuming only one set of cousin fuckers which is what im saying
  ill cum inside her tonight thanks anon
  np godspeed cousin fucker
  i would if i had a hot cousin and an opportunity but i have neither
  if i had a hot cousin and an opportunity  tfw have no hot cousins  sister is most conventionally attractive family member  even if she werent my sister shes still not my type  still not going to stop me from nutting to incest porn but i dont really buy into the fantasy part of it theyre just the best
  why did incest porn become so popular in 2018 its like the top porn genre now
  no clue but it probably has more to do with the taboo nature and interplay of power between the parties than it does any actual incestuousness
  porn just has random trends
why is this true
  t autotragic driver
  twitter literal who thread  keep coping sticklet bottom line is you dont know how to drive
  theyre the gurl gamers of the car world
  this
  automatics arent even in the game
the guy that drives auto has no interest in driving   the guy that drives manual has some interest in driving  seems about right
  the guy that has some interest in driving has strong autistic tendencies  sounds about right
  ive been driving a new manual transmission for about 3 months at least 500 miles per week  today i drove my suburban for the first time in that long drove 60 miles on back roads through little towns and let me tell you faggots something   it was damn comfy
  i dont like manuals in cars i have a motorcycle for fun i let my car be the grocery getting slowmobile it would be regardless of transmission
    this kinda behavior happens in any hobby where autistic spergs that spent 10k hours honing a niche skill and then rants about normies not appreciating their autistic swordarts    pc vs console   dslr vs phone camera
  based
  thats because theyre for the real world not for games
  its true because soibois think rowing a gearbox substitutes for never getting laid
guys who drive automatic my car is automatic  some sherlock holmes tier thinking there
tragic driver gets seethed  starts talking about dicks out of nowhere  obsessed
  its only true in america in most of the world nobody even tried an automatic
  they belong in mom crossovers  ok hear you loud and clear
  niche skill  might want to ask the rest of the world what they think of that
  t thirdworlder
americans are so pathetic lmao i will never get this obsessesion with manuals and autos literally everybody in germany knows how to drive manual but manuals are becoming more popular since new cars basically come with dcts standard we will actually regress and i can see a future where people get auto licenses only and are not allowed to drive manuals anymore cause if you get your license in an auto you arent allowed to drive manuals and it would be like driving without a license here a few schools offer this already and it probably will only get more common if you have a manual license you can drive autos obviously
  busrider projecting his autism  sounds about right
  ok this is epic
  cringe
  t busrider
  most of the world nobody even tried an automatic  most of the world is too poor for an auto
  not really  we just dont want to waste money in something like that    why do americans call everyone 3rd world arent they on the verge of latin american murder rates
is the prettiest comfiest interior on the market  comes from fucking kentucky    how does ford do it
  a tablet just slapped in there because designers forgot about it during designing   randomly assymetrical things like center console buttons and center storage  fat people handles on a pillars  lcd dash some terrible   chrome but also bland blue  nice try but no  comfortable maybe looks okay but didnt seat in one
  plastic chrome
animal skin  disguisting
  faux car experts its real metal cadillac and lincoln are using real premium materials
  t seething europoor
got to drive one of these the interior is damm comfy but something about the design is very soul touching that makes you feel relaxed
  european  yes  seething  nah imo 95 of european modern cars interiors are as bland and boring as it gets and 80s mercedes beat the devil out of them when it comes to comfort  i still want to see displays done the way mazda done them in kai / vision coupe concepts  those are by far most perfectly blended displays
  britbong here  love it is this a production car or concept
  production
wheres the gear shifter
  dont you see those metal buttons under the center climate vents indicating that it is in park
  disgusting
  usually i dont like buttons as gearshift too but lincoln actually pulled it off great
  it looks nice otherwise i agree
ford  making a good interior  did they get their shit together its the only reason i wouldnt get a new fiesta or focus the interior is just too distracting
  looks fucking ugly as shit theres no continuity in the design    now this is a luxury interior
op pic is low quality and the blue looks weird therefore it looks like crap but i saw a black interior of that suv at the ford dealership and it looked like a 100k interior
  rent free
  kentucky is a much classier and upscale state than it has ever gotten credit for   have you ever been to the kentucky derby
  ive been on taylorsville road next to the kentucky derby its uh not uptown by any means people carrying trashbags to laundromats and a mcdonalds with cops arresting blackfolk at the one time l was there
  fit for a kang
  looks amazing but that fucking screen
  still arresting black folk  not classy  pick one
  would great in a different color that blue is awful
  true ironically i think the second best looking interior on the market right now is in the new genesis g90 its hilarious that ford and hyundai have figured out how to make better looking interiors than the germans
  its real metal  citation needed
  not that hard to imagine considering bmw and mercedes have been hiring muhammads to do the work and it shows
  its from korea my dear anonfriend
crown vic pedals   cheap ass white plastic  piano black climate control     the cheap ass crown vic pedals is something that will always trigger me
  jesus christ i cannot articulate how ugly that interior is reminds me of my grandmas 84 buick
  hands down the finest interior ever conceived by manikind
  where are the cup holders where are the cup holders
  you gonna have to find them
  whats with /o/tist only thinking that germany has a monopoly on luxury interior deigns give the gooks a chance ffs
the newest luxury cars are not as comfortable as the older vehicles for two main reasons    1  the seats are always too firm  2  the head rests are always designed for people who recline 45 and anyone sitting like a human has their head pointing down at the bottom of the steering wheel if they sit back into the seat
  if its so great how come these dont sell ive seen like 3 of these so far and hundreds of suburbans and escalades
  kinda ugly but those seats look comfy as fuck
  wtf are you on about theyve been selling these like crazy ford is having a hard time keeping up with demand in fact    
  theyve been selling these like crazy    to fucking rental fleets the story of fords life the escalade literally sells 3x as more to actual customers
  this just came out last year how can you tell between the 18 suburbans and escalades and older ones when their appearance hasnt changed at all recently
  stop paying the haters attention anon
  i love the rear end of this car and the detailing on the interior trim but that center console is fucking hideous as is the grille    i wish toyo would just sell the fucking crown and century here
  ferd  didnt they go out of business a few years back
  same but i dont think people will buy it that most people dont want that kind of luxury without having the brand you have to remember most people in the us see the brand first this is why many luxury brands are releasing models that are at the low price point maybe if they sell it as a lexus then some people might buy it the century is still an expensive car so keep that in mind
kentucky is a nice place and car manufacturing is big there why does this surprise you
  theyre pedals though you put you dirty ass shoe on them you want them made from pure platinum or something
  whats with /o/tist only thinking that germany has a monopoly on luxury interior deigns    the whole german car meme is a headfuck  here in yuropooristan germans have only ever had a reputation for ugly trashy rednecktier badtaste design but they have spent so many billions of yurobucks advertising their painfully average npcmobiles as something reliable and upmarket that all the dumb sheep have actually been brainwashed to believe it
  no most models being sold are top of the line black label models that rich douches are buying fleet buyers buy lowmid range models k2 platform gm suvs are unreliable as hell btw buttblasted gm fangirl plz leave    t ex la limo fleet tech
  that looks disgusting tesla tier
those handles on the pillars look like shit
  i like this but i also hate this
  that interior looks like senior citizen with blue/violet dyed hair with a hint of a lavender scent
  its because they have been programmed even if you give them the best interior from japan theyll still ignore it they cant be unbiased most people find it difficult but overtime they overcome the brand loyalty garbage
  id be angry if mb was expected me to buy that piece of shit interior
  fuckin kekd
  its all about the badge people will legit defend that picture and call it luxury because its a mb
  i read this and one other article holy shit that thing is doing well i was way off i told my lady its much too expensive especially considering the quality of the last one but i was wrong people are buying them like crazy comparatively speaking at the price point
  how did they still manage to make it look cheap and terrible despite being premium materials
  why dont you see it in person and figure that out
    i like it it feels like a proper reimagining of the classic american landbarge interior and i love the design on those seats       while that screen is terrible the worst piece of this interior is definitely those vents those xs at different angles bother me
  im not defending mercedes design but those vents are the ones they use on a ton of cars and theyre freespinning so you could just reach over and make them all the same angle in two seconds its a pretty silly thing to complain about when you have the shitty plastic and what looks like those padded tablets they give to autistic kids slapped on top
every german interior makes me think of some cheap chinese interior
  german  luxury  topkek
im not sure if any of these interiors would be comfortable going 150mph down the autobahn
  being blinded by shiny black plastic isnt either you shouldnt be looking at your interior when youre doing 150mph
  europoors dont actually drive since gas is too expensive they just sit in their cars to shitpost on /o/ about the interior and handling
  wew lad
  hell even the koreans have stepped their game up in interior design

u using a fucking brush to wash your personal car
  moved from a medium size city to a huge city because all the jobs are there  have to park outside now  cleaning is impossible  car is always filthy  driving is a nightmare 100 of the time  i fucking miss my garage man i hate fucking city life why cant there be jobs in smaller towns
  in the summer my car wouldnt really get dirty since it would only be dust but now its got dirt and looks awful  ive just decided to wait until late spring/early summer to wash and wax my car again fuck this shit and fuck paying for a car wash    i wish there was some kind of megagarage to rent
  i mean my city has that it just costs as much as a studio apartment to rent
i cleaned my windows and wiped the grime off the interior panels with some bubblegum smelling stuff i found in the garage but theyre still cracked and scratched the floor is bedliner and i think ill need to actually scrub it with a sponge to clean it maybe ill hose the leaf debris out of the bed if it doesnt rain tomorrow      heat gun on it followed by buffing apparently works as does a mix of blo/paint thinner not sure which would last longest    
  ive literally never seen something that actually works except frequent washing and maintenance

work christmas party  get my car all clean so i can show up in style  arrive go the wrong way in a directional parking lot because the painted arrows were faded and i didnt realize until too late  park quickly to avoid embarassment of driving around the lot the wrong way  end up parking far away from everyone else  spot is both out of sight and inconvenient  dont want to reposition for fear of looking even more autistic  free dinner use up my drink tickets and buy a couple more  party turns to the stage where people are dancing and staggering around and the disgusting old women are hitting on younger guys and the angry drunks are starting fights over literally nothing  remember i dont even like parties and im incompatible with most of society at my core  leave completely unnoticed and speed home listening to my engine  at least my car is shiny
  best rust protection on the market  minimizing the number of hours each day that salt remains on the cars rustable surfaces that means getting rid of the salt after i park the car at work by using the pump sprayer full of water from home this rinsing is briefly on the sides but mostly on the bottom of the car i do it efficiently to take advantage of drip to remove dilute salt water before going over again i make the most of my 25 gallons of house tap water rinsing the car before i go in to work means 85 hours of salt time prevented right there    after i drive home i then rinse the car but more thoroughly as i have hose water this lets me spray the top of the car to remove salt film up there from all the other cars sloshing and throwing it up into the air the hose is on a hose reel with wheels so i can unhook it from the spigot i move the reel into the garage after draining the water out of the hose that way it doesnt freeze up the hose     ironically i keep the driveway deiced with a mix of magnesium chloride a type of salt and sodium chloride salt

  automation and/or beamng stories  mfw    didnt we have a dedicated autobeam general for a while
  yeah three threads lasted maybe half a month until people got bored nad started being faggots like op
is automation worth it
  any links to it
  if you want to put 10l v8s into miatas or 200cc 3pots into bro trucks yeah its pretty fun also with beamng you can drive the vehicles although its pretty basic drivetrain body and sounds
    ive sunk over 350 hours into in     although im fairly certain im autistic
  its extremely granular allowing you to overlap things warp body panels and design nearly every aspect of the engine suspension etc    autists like  love it 350 hours is insane i have about 25 in automation and 25 in beamng driving my failed abortions around
  lmao thats who im thinkin of
  last two threads were pretty much just op posting one or two the two threads before that had a lot more    
i never knew how much beamng needed a modern landbarge suv until a couple days ago its like racing a bouncy castle
  why does everyone say this but the camshaft options are non existant
is the 4th gen legacy underrated  best subaru interior of the time  wrx engine or based flat 6  can outrun most average cars  cheaper used than a wrx and owners dont abuse them as much  sleek design with frameless doors  why shouldnt i buy one
  because they are needles in haystacks to find in wagon form gt trim is hard to find when i trim is more common and the best option to bypass that is a 25xt outback    you are better off finding a 3rd gen or older if you want to get more bang for buck 4th gen just seems too distant from what the legacy was meant to be
  theyre easy to find in wagon form in australia and new zealand 3rd gens in clean condition are next to non existent here
  if in australia/japan/nz then definitely i understand why for 4th gen wagons here in the us they are impossible to look for without having to pay obnoxious amounts of dinero for one either in gt/i 3rd gens are pretty common but sedans for 2nd and 3rd gen are a rare sight    if you have the chance go for wagon in a 4th gen because it looks snazzy for older gens definitely do sedans if available
  70/30 weight distribution
  exaggeration the post
  its actually 60/40 which is just as horrible thats literally the same as a pickup truck
  are you that fucking piece of shit faggot who keeps saying the sti weighs 3700 lbs actually i dont care kill yourself
  60/40 isnt terrible in a midsize sedan with a good awd system they still handle well given what they are
  are you that guy who thinks theyre 400hp 3100lbs and actually quick
  a silverado is 60/40 thats fucking inexcusable in a sports car they do not handle well and are understeering pigs
  are supposed to be sports cars   i thought the legacy was supposed to be a reliable awd commuter
  if thats such a big issue then relocate the battery and weight reduce
  is weight distribution all that important in awd sedans
  awd commuter  aggressive aero addons  hood scoop  big brakes    an impreza is a commuter not this      thats not going to fix the entire engine hanging over the front axle even subaru wrc and grc cars with their rear mounted rads carbon fiber and 15k per corner suspension still understeer like pigs
  im not sure how appearence addons and large brakes declassify a car from being a reliable commuter
  a 750hp corvette can be a reliable commuter that doesnt make it a reliable commuter like a civic or corolla it was designed as a wrx/sti for grownups
  hood scoop  a large amount of diesel japanese pick ups have hood scoops does that make them not suitable as commuter vehicles
  i have a 5 speed manual gen 4 wagon best car ive owned to date purchased with 89k on the odometer for 3 thousand bucks from an old white guy
  shame the turbos only got the 5 speed manual excluding special trims as much as i prefer the easier power gains of the turbo i love the reliability and 6 speed manual that came with the flat 6
  what country are you in in the us only the specb came with a 6 speed and that was an ej255 as well im also not so sure that they even sold a h6 in manual here
  4th gen just seems too distant from what the legacy was meant to be  are you actually retarded when this monstrosity exists    understeering pigs  bullshit faggot i owned one and it could outmaneuver my 10th gen civic even with 215 vs 235 tires because its suspension was stiff enough and the cg low enough to compensate theyre sports sedans too retard
  no cause bp/bl and up are retarded like you shame on you for trying to defend 4th gen legacys thinking that they arent as shit as the 5th and 6th gen bh and before are the only legacys that count just because the 4th gen had the epic spec b meme doesnt make it better than how legendary blitzen etune and gtb were
  australia here the h6 was marketed as a more upscale model eg got a better sound system than 4 cylinder models
  telling someone who owns one something wrong about his car
  in cases like these the fanboyism is so strong that it has to be done
  out manuvered a 10th gen civic   muh god musheen
  i work for a subaru dealer and only now did i discover you could get a flat 6 with a manual option i want one
also what is wrong you all  clearly neither of you are willing to change you opinion and the used market isnt going to be affected owners arent going to throw out their legacies because of who wins this unwinnable argument    why bother 
  what the fuck does this even mean    kys my guy
im sure we all know the yugo and how it was a real piece of shit but has anyone ever tried rebuilding one like what if we bought a yugo for pennies not like theyre worth much more and just gutted it and made some supercar amalgamation like we drop an ls or some shit and a bunch of other parts clearly nobody would dare try something but thoughts
  i want to see a built yugo without an engine swap even something like 175 hp from the original engine would be hilarious
  easily agreed a yugo doing anything but breaking would be a legendary sight
  tfw your engine weighs more than your chassis
  stop posting this faggot on here all he does is spread misinformation on cars
  suck a dick dumbshit
  op here  to be honest i didnt notice him in the image i just had this stupid thought of a fully functioning yugo and took the first image i found
  you would probably have to make it midengine or something just so it wont fall over when it exists too hard
  why not just go with a twin engine setup at that point  that power to weight ratio
  like we drop an ls or some shit and a bunch of other parts  why do idiots want to ruin a nice piece of history with an ls swap  faggots like you ruin yugos not many left  ruin jaguar xjss  ruin everything with your fucking swaps kill yourself
how would one go from i have no idea what im looking at here when seeing a car engine to someone who can maintain and fix a vehicle by himself    im currently the former though i want to learn how to maintain and fix a vehicle by myself as im looking into buying an old van so im expecting lots of maintenance  what are some resources i can use besides the haynes manuals how do you suggest i get started
bentley manuals are where its at anon they arent cheap but they are second only to shop manuals    if thats your 240d engine bay that shit is unusually clean for a diesel
haynes manuals  thats all you need to start
  learn how to do basic maintenance like oil changes cleaning / changing air filters etc first by watching some youtube videos then get an obd scanner tool i use a bluetooth dongle thing  an app on my phone to pull codes and aid in diagnosing problems when problems arise look up how to fix it on youtube and scour the internet for forum posts about your particular issue
  this   why people even ask this quention this days its so easy to get educated on any subject thanks to millions of people doing videos and a huge amount of resources    btw if you got a mercedes forget about bentley or haynes manuals do not buy anything first get the official mercedes factory manuals they are easy to find for example i use this page a lot    
  chrisfix makes good videos but honestly understanding basics of how a car actually works will make your life way easier i would suggest watching some videos on 4 cylinder engines and auto/manual transmissions to get an idea of whats going on internally
  would those work on an old 80s/90s vehicle      i didnt get anything yet still debating over a vw t3 and an old merc diesel van      i have a rough understanding of it but you are right ill study it more thoroughly
i bought my car and didnt know how to change the oil i build/assembled my recent race motor that sees 34psi and im in the process of building a tranny for the same car ama
would an old mercedes with the om616 engine be a good start for someone to learn on
the term fix a car is very broad     the college courses in my local area are structured as follows   year 1  fitter   year 2  servicing mechanic  year 3  diagnostic technician    you may wish to progress in a similar fashion
  did you learn by doing got someone to teach you or learn mechanics online
thinking of buying a manual 2009 ford focus for 3300 and 139k miles exhaust smells fine engine runs smooth music works ac is perfect no accidents or major servicing should i go for it    pic unrelated its same shape but blue with cool paint job
arent focuses reliable in endurance i think that have high mpg too what are you using for
  i bought a loaded lesabre for less than that with only 64k on the clock
not a bad choice but listen to the engine for timing chain slap and intake runner door failure
  too much money especially for a ford you can get a 2009 manual civic for the same price in good shape that will definitely be a better deal
yeah should be fine
  dumb nigger
  unless thats 3300 cad its a bad deal especially since the book value is 2700
  civics are for insecure pussies
  op here what does cad mean
  its 3300 usd
  canadian rupees
  i have an automatic with 62000 miles its got heated seats
  2009 civic  3300    you fucking serious youre looking at 6000 at least and thats with 100k miles on it or more focuses are way cheaper than civics less reliable and less fun but thats why theyre a bargin
  go for it generally reliable dd
he didnt start on a h2r

tell us the story of your car purchase how long did you look what was your budget did you get what you wanted was the car better or worse than expected    pic not related
  wasnt looking the car found me my mothers coworker was selling off items from a friends estate and pointed me towards it     bought it for 500 couldnt ask for much more fox body v8 wagon wish it was less rusty on the undercarriage but thats what 39 years on salted city roads will do to a car
  put some dishes on that boy
just turned 16 and was in need of a car my uncle lived at my grandparents house to assist them in needs he passed away two years before hand my grandma said i could buy his car i never scrounged up 500 that fast in my life got it towed over to my house because i did have my licence then i then came to realize the front driver side rim was cracked bad no way to fix only replace but that would cost 900 to do so so i bought all brand new rims for 750 total as well as the wheel problem there was no exhaust installed on the car as well another 1200 spent for it to work then shit hit the fan the differential would slip like a mad man yet to get that fixed so all in all condition was way worse than expected
why do virgins especially the ones with a 89 civic fear the daytona
i cant go one fucking day without this fucking car appearing
  muhahahah
  i dont even know what a daytona is
  its the big gay
  except for one lad every single one of you fuckers isnt even shilling the shelby daytona but the fucking base one with the awful engine and most of the times the ugly facelift one with no popups
  the dodge that is feared by virgins like this  
  best car ever
  i thought that was an rx7 from the thumbnail
  first the guy thinking the facelift daytona was a foxbody  now this  fucking hell get some glasses anons
  i thought it was a conquest
  nobody fears that car its pile of trash
  thats a mr2 retard wtf is a gaytony
it was reddittier and it was on /o/
      the fear of the virgins is real
  yeah im totally scared of a car where the highest trim has less hp than my 2001 v6 mustang
  thats literally a rebadged mitsu starion anon
  to be devils advocate here thats not the highest trim the highest trim of the daytona is the shelby z which makes 173hp so yes still less hp than the v6 mustang but its barely respectable when compared to that
  i know anon
  the strongest one was the iroc shelby with 224hp    the virgins fear the daytona
im looking at reasonably priced used full size suvs for hauling stuff and towing my reasonably light enclosed trailer for my race bikes and the first gen sequoia stands out ive test driven one and it was comfy and quiet far beyond the suburbans and expeditions ive been in and i have no interests in paying out the ass for a land cruiser because i dont go offroading anyone here have any experience with sequoias are they reliable and relatively trouble free as youd expect from a toyota
my dad wants to buy a mercedes c43 but i want a c63

    switch monster energy with alcohol and yes can confirm for someone who makes 1/4 million every year he is one stingy mfer
why has porsche sucked at proper midengine car design
be me  a highly intelligent gentleman who is picky about quality and value  often looking for a quality ride  try an f150 on a whim  my friends i tell you it was one of the best vehicles i have driven this year the crisp throttle response of the twin turbo mixed with the raw power torque figures the refreshing ac and heating  the amazing quality and cabin features totally blown away  i was able to get a well outfitted truck for 32000 off the lot and they even complimented my shirt they dont let black people touch these trucks and they also have a free first oil change
i bet you made the onions face when writing that

how does /o/ survive winters you daily your funbox or do you switch to your shitbox if you have one rustproofing or undercoating or nothing winter tires or all seasons
what funbox
  i daily my wrx with blizzacks this shit is great    rustproofing  i just dont drive on days its wet
  dd my shitbox which is only car until april
  i stop driving my car when they start to salt the streets
  daily  except today its wet out lol
  im using all season on my subaru but i wish id gotten a set of winters dont really need them where i live but it would be a lot of fun looking into doing some fluid film or something dont want my shitbox to become a rusty shitbox
ive im moving far north what should i do to prepare my fiesta for the harsh winters
  lease car for 3 years  trash the shit out of it and never wash it during the winter
  buying a winter beater when you drive a fucking brz or a 370z  i know people who do this and its hilarious
  live in the south   doesnt snow much and we rrely salt  drive a lifted truck really easy to spray off any nasty shit
  pls dont let this sweet mx3 be lost to rust
rains only 1/10th of the year  zero snow  feels pretty good not having to worry and run the same car on summer tires all year
in my accord in winter i do the following    switch from 225/50r17 oem alloys all seasons to 205/60r16 steelies with winters  put rubber mats in front floor wells  keep small case of basics in car like lighters thermal blanket candle first aid kit jumper cables extra socks gloves sweater  top off all fluids to add weight  put passenger seat forward rarely used moves weight more frontward for fwd  wash and put a fairly heavy coat of wax      and well i just go slower brake earlier follow a car length or two extra away than usual leave room for sliding in turns and downshift the at to help brake down steep hills just know what areas of your town are shit in winter and go around them
i daily my e46 323i with almost brand new winter tires i havent really done any rustproofing although i do wash it down once a week so hopefully that should slow down the rust at least its probably the most fun you can have with this car i drift around every corner when its snowing
throw on some rustproofing before winter  keep it clean  winter tires allseasons are not an option here
  winter tires winter is best season for you to improve your skill
  throw on some rustproofing before winter    you make it sound like its super easy what exactly do you mean
  man i want to build a truck like that to go camping with looks so comfy either a taco or a colorado or maybe even an xj
  it snows only once per decade where i live so i dont even need winter tyres lel   sucks to be op
  getting salt and brine on the car you actually care about instead of a throwaway winterbeater
  a throwaway winterbeater    ive never lived in the north so this seems crazy in the sense that you drive a piece of shit during the season where you can literally die if you get stranded so you buy a piece of crap and when the transmission fails do you go roll the dice again at sals udriveit or change the trans in 20 f weather    my guess is that everyone over the age of 22 drives a solid vehicle in the winter especially when you go further north
  how does /o/ survive winters  sideways and smiling in my funbox or comfy in my luxobarge
  easy i stay at home
  we just dont want our nice cars to rust away from what ive seen winter beaters here in mn winter beaters are usually old jap econoboxs or subarus plus having a car you give very few fucks about is fun when the roads get slippery
  clean the underside with a steamer while its on a lift    throw on some rustproofing on a can ive uses shitty cheap stuff but i most recommend fluid film      this thing has zero insulation  would not recommend in winter suv with folding seats or a van is much better
can youre eurovan do this i didnt thinks so    euros dont understand that when you are working some times the boss needs you to pic k up a 21 cu ft fridge because the customer made a change order and we work on a tight schedule unlike siesta euros so thays why a company cabt hire you if you have no truck because in america we are about work euros cant work with vans because their fridges are babbier than the coffee table if they are even in the province to be allowed one
  no but my van can keep niggers from stealing my tools and it can tow a trailer which i could put something like that on
  he has to add a trailer to tow the same thing  this suddenly means niggers cant steal it  are you a retard also how are niggers going to steal a fridge when youre going point a to point b not to mention they literally steal s class mercedes and you think they cant steal shit out of a trailer
  nigger boarding parties on the open highway jumping from their caddy into the bed of your truck and absconding with your cargo tool and girl
  i dont live in the congo sorry
    that doesnt even happen in the congo    only in culture pot american cities
  anon im pretty sure hes joking and disneys pirates of the 405 isnt real
  you can fit whole cars inside a mercedes sprinter
  but in real life a eudm passat with a trailer is enough for most stuff
  lmao my ranger could haul that dumb euronigger
  youre absolutely right thats why fridges are forbidden in europe if you want to get a fridge of that sie you get shot because of that kind of communism bernie sanders is bragging about  thanks for clearing that once and for all man i wish i was american so i could transport anything anywhere for a company and brag about it
  i want to see a ranger towing a ranger on a trailer
mfw when american work trucks surpass the germans flagship sedan quality
  is there a car that can be bought for less than 500
burger trucks cant pull video related a vw with some fuel efficient tdi engine vs a significantly larger chevy  
    they are not forbidden are you rarted    you cant fit a fridhe upright in a van thats why trucks are spuerior and euroniggers dont realise it because they just use vans to carry flowers and think they need a 21ft flatbed to carry a 21 cu ft fridge they only buy a fridge once every 30 fathoms but we like to change our fridges everytime we change our house because we like it clean we use our trucks not like they with their babby hiluxes with the 45 bed cant even fit a sheet of osb how do they even build over there
  add a couple hundred lbs in the bed of the truck and see what happens hook that vw up to a 50hp airport tug and see that happens
  add a little weight to the touareg and it becomes the airport tug  
  a human can do the same anything with a torque converter will get that plane going eventually if the tranny doesnt burn up
  that is not even the same model
  dumb euronigger moving the goalposts
  nothing surprising about a larger vehicle towing a smaller one
  nothing supersing about truck being better
  beige plastic with fake chrome accents is higher quality and more luxurious than fine european leather matched with hardwood  burgerclaps cant be this delusional
  he thinks euro cars have nice interiors anymore  lol kys eu tax member number 400340340
  20 chink tablet plastic    imagine being outclassed by a work truck ahh how the mighty have fallen        
  creaky interior panels arent really important having a good interior is more about how well the interior looks the build quality of the plastic doesnt really matter as you will be changing your car to a new model every few years anyway
have any of you niggers even been on a jobsite    90 of the work vehicles are candy vans
    they only see the handy men their mothers bring over when dad isnt home    mom doesnt hire guys with vans because she thinks trucks are sexier
  youre  pic k  21 cu ft  siesta euros  thays  cabt  babbier  in the province to be allowed one  with that grammar and intelligence i think  would be a better board for you buddy
  thats why fridges are forbidden in europe  the point of baiting is to at least make it somewhat believable then again i had a coworker all the way from wisconsin in around 2006 or so which before coming here thought we still didnt have color tv so hey ill still hold a small chance you actually believe that bullshit  tsouthwest european
  nah pretty sure thats sarcastic problem is you cant feel sarcasm through text  t southern european
  problem is you cant feel sarcasm through text  read again   and im not making the story up btw the guy actually thought we were that far behind
    did i understands correctly you use your personal truck to make your boss richer    that must be ultimate hamburger cuck thing
  yeah but lets be real anon even fwd volvo estates can do that  
  not posting the audi video    no problem anon i wouldnt post it either if it contradicted the notion i was trying to make

  in the developed world your employer provides work vehicles and you dont have to drive around doing fridge errands for your boss in your private vehicle you laughable fucking dickheads
  boomer tier last century murrika was a mistake
  it has a bed cap on it dumb euroislamist one is rc one is ec but hardly worth crying about
  dumb niggers say stupid shit all the time itd be like me bitching eurofags think texans ride horses and shit if anything her association with you makes you look equally as retarded since shes your peergroup    average american doesnt realize you exist or even think about europe at all id imagine hope europeans are the same way toward america
  average american doesnt realize you exist  so thats the power of american education
you see in europe when we order a fridge we have it delivered to our kitchen for the price of a single big mac nobody takes care of that themselves  why would we nobody likes hauling large cargos even more so if you happen to live in an apartment complex and gotta carry get it to 10th floor  same goes for any other large delivery its all covered by the place you buy it at
  giving a shit about irrelevant countries   were on an entirely different hemisphere and barely trade with anyone not named chinacanada and mexico    how often do you think about mongolia didnt think so fag youre borderline irrelevant to the average burger beyond politicians stationing good goys there to keep the spice flowing
    in america you cant get a job if you dont have a car
  youre actually trying to pass ignorance off as something to be proud of baffling
  yeah im sure you spend a lot of time pondering rwandan internal politics too    maybe you do after all you learned english like a good goy global citizen would and consume american media 24/7 lmao
do you know any discords specific for a certain car brand or anything
discord  any type of social media  irc or nothing faggot
people use discord for car stuff now

ladies and gentlemen we got him
  2006 chrysler imperial was powered by a hemi v8 range topping special edition variants would have got a version of the viper v10 basically a widened and lengthened 300 with some more sclass parts and an interior benchmarked against bentley products that would serve as the brands flag ship and retail for 6500090000    daimler axed it because they thought it would eat into sales for the new w221 sclass
  daimler axed it  that fucking sucks daimler chrysler was a huge mistake
  the basketball american population would have bought so much of these
what happens to these cars afterwards like the pontiac stinger or the dodge copperhead there were real physical models of these cars that were toured around at conventions and stuff do they get carted off to a warehouse never to be seen again are they crushed
  some are sold do dealerships for display most are crushed
  cadillac sixteen was crazy too
  nice
wish they made this a production car
  definitely its both a step up from the 300s that poor black guys aspire too and a domestic alternative to big euro stuff that rich black people like chinese love big sedans too and had this been built theyd probably be making mad money exporting these to china this would likely be on its second or third generation right now    sad because it being just a stretched 300 with sclass air suspension means it could have been built very cheaply most of the additional rd just went into the interior quality this thing also had so much wood trim it caused some journalist to write an article about wood heavy styling trends being bad for the environment lel im perpetually mad at daimler over this thing cancellation i think it looks better than the w221 too
  what happens to these cars afterwards are they crushed    depends if they are significant enough they end up in a museum on the car show circuit someones collection or end up stored indefinitely  vehicles based on existing vehicles/chassis may be lent out to vocational schools and eventually may be recalled or told the car must be destroyed after it has been used  much like early production or preproduction models they will usually end up in the scrap heap
    you can still drive it just gotta get it from the bottom of the ocean brah
  i think it looks better than the w221 too    youre fucking high
  no fun allowed
    holy fuck thats comical  they managed to make it look like a chinese ripoff of itself
  2006 was before chinese knockoffs were a notable thing so it was truly an og car in that its a prechinese chinese knockoff of a bentley

chrysler copperhead   as if viper wasnt bluecollar enough the absolute madmen just made it cheaper shame you cant get away with just putting tons of horsepower in a cheap sports car with medieval suspension
    shit like this makes me want to buy something like pic related put suicide doors and a custom interior in it just have the perfect luxury tourer

  lets see  sling shot  na 3cyl making 100 hp in the back  five speed manual  smart roadster  turbo 3cyl making 82 hp tops in the back  autotragic  lets not even get started on the styling the sling shot wouldve btfod the roadster any day and wouldve been a much more popular platform
  but it looks like that  and its a godawful ugly piece of shit driven by people who have no place on the road
  you know there was a 101hp version by brabus
  it was still a turbo engine mated to an autotragic the sling shot had the na engine make that much power mated to a lighter higherrevving transmission it wouldve also been cheaper at launch
i will always be upset by this
  i can feel the 80s through a monitor 10/10 would drive through miami at sunset with a tears for fears cassette

  nice m45
  at least chrysler hasnt given up on these the next gen 300 is going to be bigger and a bit more expensive and fca is promising an interior better than anything else in the non lux large car segment    considering that fca has managed to make the interior of a 38000 truck look this good im inclined to believe them
  it says 88 on the filename tard
  then aesthetically its well ahead of its time the era of wedges and boxes didnt really end until 95 at least as far as ive seen

    jesus christ that is ridiculous    justfuckmyeverythingupfam
this would be great if the prevailing design language wasnt gggrrrrr im fuckin angry all the time
  looks like a hot wheels toy
  unironically was one of the first hot wheels toys
    maybe if it was designed by a guy who molested children but hid his criminal record by assuming the identity of an orphan who died in 1927    that car is a disgusting shitpile of everything retarded in the 1960s    lets make the front open up lol0l0l00liolololol  lets make them trip over the fuckin gas pedal getting in lolol90l0ol0olol  lets have some horrendous ratcheting bar hold the giant pane of unlaminated glass over them l0l0lo0oo0lolol  and lets make the cargo area the most useless fuckin configuration we could possibly conceive lol0o0ol
i think this might be the first car that actually moved from concept to production while still being recognizable
  the rear suicide doors are just ridiculous even more so with the front seat belts attached to em    i wanted one back then _
  no
    fj owner here the seatbelt thing is almost never an issue most people with fjs dont use them as a primary vehicle or family hauler anyone who rides in the back is an afterthought and usually a spur of the moment passenger the backseat is also uncomfortable so no one wants to ride back there    i had mine removed for like 6 months one time to get extra cargo space hardly ever use the rear doors when youre sitting in the drivers seat
whats the last thing you got for your car /o/    i just picked up these steel wheels and tires for the winter i like the look
i got 3 cans of plasti dip and some taillight tint my cars about to look dope
its old
just the engine
  old school op old school sips yep dont make em like this anymore
  the driving experience of a 2018 sti is not meaningfully different from a 2004 sti same engine same power to weight same handling same interior
  if they ditched the awd and put the engine behind the front axle where intelligent people put it it would be a lot faster
  true but most people dont buy stis for the speed they buy them for the awd most of the people who like them are wrc fanbois different strokes for different folks
  same handling  same interior
  there are plenty of other awd sedans these days ironically a modern pickup is more of a rally car than a 20 series tires and 2 inches of ground clearance sti or wrx
  rally cars can be pretty low though
  my coworker with an old sti upgraded to a new one and he says it feels exactly the same just with more computer screens and better brakes
  only on the smoothness of tarmac stages otherwise they run quite a bit of ride height and have more suspension travel than most pickups
  
  but i like to live in the past
  better steering rack on the new ones less of a dead zone
  is that bad everyone complains about new cars not being like old cars so heres a new car thats almost exactly like it was 15 years ago
  this  even a fucking mrs has more ground clearance
  is that bad everyone complains about new cars not being like old cars so heres a new car thats almost exactly like it was 15 years ago    thats literally it its an old school car its amazing its even sold at this stage at this day and age no wonder europe pulled it out of the market with all the emission laws it doesnt pass it anymore its an old gaz guzzling engine that drinks more than modern v8s    but thats the beauty of it i dont get why people hate on this car hate the crowd but the car is amazing in its own right
  its good because its shit  pretty sad when a 20 year old sti can keep up with a brand new one that you spent like 40k on
  pigfat
  this has to be bait oh wait youre an obvious bus rider
  2004 engine 2004 interior  2018 weight 2018 price 2018 exterior  literally the worst possible combination
  this x 100
  same handling  nah the chassis rigidity is pretty good nowadays still most modern budget cars have a bit of a soft frame so they can get away with cheaper suspension rather than say poosha and mclaren whom have diamond tier chassis rigidity and actual good suspension
  car company makes car with newest tech  reeeee computer car   car company makes a refined version of their halo car  reeeee old pigfat     /o/ needs to be purged of momscarriders bus riders is to respectful of a term
    perhaps 2018 chassis rigidity is the only pro    also no way it gets imported into eu we are all cucked with 20 na with cvt now gone is the rally heritage and woosh noises never selling mine

    who was in the wrong
bikers violated the nap
  both but the guy who run over them will probably get a murder rap
  go figure he just got everything short of that     
  i love when biker pussies act like tough guys smashing mirrors and then get their panties in a knot because the car drivers dare to do something back
  this i had one start road rage with me once and i moved into his lane really fast he shit his pants and took off
  whats nap
  non aggression principle
  lol i remember this it happened back in february here in raleigh     bit of backstory    you had several instances where large groups of shitheads on crotch rockets had been blasting up tryon rd doing all sorts of dumb shit  cutting up traffic  blasting by people doing 100  slowing down to 10 just to piss people off  when this guy went to court you find out the youtube video was heavily edited   bikers were actually doing anything and everything to provoke dude into doing something stupid   had done it with several other cars as well but this dude snapped and went road warrior on them
  even if one of them smashed the mirror it was because their safety was threatened    experienced motorcyclists who watched video of the incident said it looked as though the motorcycle drivers were doing everything right  okay
  see      long story short they were all acting like shit fucks then got surprised when someone rumbled them
  do you have a link to the unedited video
  i dont know if the raw video ever got posted online if it did i have no idea where to    the local news here had a couple clips they played over and over of one bike doing a wheelie and another repeatedly swerving over into that guys lane
  of course this is how they act motorcyclists are their own worst enemy i lain changing three car lengths on a busy highway in front of one once and she felt the need to lain split cut me off and swerve back and fourth in front of me i dont ride street bikes anymore because of the toxic community is so bad
lmao fucking dumb arse bikers
  full video  
bikes bring it upon themselves neither side was without fault driver being impatient however hogging the left lane is silly and trying to block a lane while your buddy goes for the smash and run definitely is not the smartest solution to being passed
someone post the video of the old dude beating up the motorcyclist who started it a fight with him
i ride but trying to stop a car with your foot after they already ran somebody over is retarded
  you caused me 10 in damage so i get to murder you  cagers should be institutionalized
  start shit get hit    if you dont want to be shot or ran over dont give anyone an excuse    t biker
  what kind of inbreed nigger thinks like that in the adult world  this isnt middle school
  if you kick a hippo and it fucks you up do you blame the hippo or the inbred nigger kicking it
  seeing shit like this makes me thing the us is a fucking shithole  imagine driving in a group larger than 12 people and not following traffic rules  disgusting mob mentality and squid 20 iq aggression    granted we dont know what happened before the video started but if the rr just wanted to pass then let him fucking assholes just block the road
  people arent wild animals and the ones who are should be put down theres a reason that methhead looking fuck is in jail and the bikers arent
  youre an idiot preemptively trying to rationalize your future acts of vandalism
  hit someones vehicle   its justified  they try to hit your vehicle  attempted murder  might as well tape a gun to your forehead barrel facing towards your skull challenging people to fight you
  he didnt get jail
  man was arrested put in jail but made bond before his trial  i havent found any further updates     so either you dont know what jail is or youre making shit up      t shitmonkey who will end up in jail     i never said hitting peoples mirrors was justified but escalating to attempted murder isnt sub humans like you honestly need to be taken out back
  escalating to attempted murder isnt justified  yeah better just let them go so you dont risk harming anyone
    the cager has a rap sheet too  hahaha this aint his first time in prison
why is it always crotch rocket riders who  police those around them  break every traffic law known to man  speed nonstop  lane split at 80mph  think you should have a 15 car length seperation front and back from them in order to seitch lanes  run from the police  break mirrors  complain about cagers  run into other peoples cars while lane splitting at low speeds  wheelie their feelies away endangering other peoples future because of vehicular manslaughter  chase and gang up on people who made an honest mistakeno they didnt faggots  act like their some kind of outlaws  also those faggots on the yamaha dual sport bikes are just as bad  sportbike riders should all be gassed and anyone who rides one is a gay faggot like harley riders  inb4 reeeeee fucking cager reeeeeeeee  fuck yourselves
  hahahahaha look at this jealous nobike   too fat to ride a motorcycle anon figures   bikes pose no threat to cars so if they wanna break traffic laws then its fine theyre taking all the risks onto themselves   traffic laws are all set by old white men who drive suvs bikes dont need to pay attention to half of them thats madness
  bikers obviously always bikers
  anon if youre trying to be funny well youre not  2/10 you didnt even try
  got  no he was arrested on the da surely dropped some immediately at arraignment and theres a huge fucking difference between 4 years served on felony assault and 20 years for murder
memes like these only happen in the land of the free
  knew this was brazil before even clicking
  gets coerced into getting revenge by retard squids   damn cages
i love how motorbikes doing dumb shit makes every non rider on here act like a fucking soccer mum    he was doing 100  wheelies  lane weaving    wont somebody think of the children    put your petticoats on and get back in your camry you soul sucking plebs
  the problem riders are usually the younger folks that dont get proper training if they even have a license and have a seemingly low iq so cant understand the basic laws of physics    ive been riding for 20 years and have never come into contact with a rager ive been cut off had people try to lane change on top of me etc etc but i know people are stupid and dont know how to drive so i catch it happening and take appropriate action no one loses their shit on either side of these interactions
  thats because were responsible and keep it on the track but i guess if you can only afford a 3k bike for a performance vehicle a 300 track day pass is probably too rich for your blood
  yeah and my 3k bike shits all over your 30k car    responsible  as i said put your petticoat on and get back in your camry
  gets run over  yeah my bike shits on ur car lmao oh fuck i cant feel my legs
  this fuck them for being aggressive  that idiot got too close and was in his lane messing with a moving vehicle idiots it makes me upset to see the comments
  bikers they deserve everything they got
free brandon    i put 400 bucks on his gofundme
  the sadness in his eyes
  lmao at rider one screaming in the helmet and bigger lmao at the two heros chasing him on their bikes like they are police
  i sincerely hope everyone that means something to you dies in the most inhumane way possible
  woah be careful of that edge
  that idiot got too close and was in his lane    it looks to me like the cager was going the same speed as the dindus when he ran over the first one so im guessing the dindu thought it was a good idea to brake check    and yeah i know there white but still theyre a bunch of video editing we didnt do nuffin officer
  using edge on 4chan  go back
  if someone tried to kill me over a car mirror id edit the video too
  supposedly 18 year old or older  i hope all ur friends n shit all die in a fire xdd  you need help bruh lol
  i hope you drown face down in a puddle of piss
  
  dumb squid the one still awake is the one that gets to report to the officer
    chinese banker feared for his life gassed it and swiped a guy cleared of all charges due to reasonable fear for safety    undercover cop was also one of the bikers and got a hefty charge lots of people convicted of assault serving time
   its very scary said kimberly atkinson president of ebony angels  ebony angels  i for sure hope its a motorcycle club full with sexy and thicc black girls   hot
  welcome to 4channel 4chan still reigns supreme
  nobody wants to be supreme at edge on 4 chan
  when youre old enough to purchase a bike/vehicle youll understand how important following the traffics laws are
  hes white so naw use that privilege that the rapists use
  bikers deserved it but driver will probably go to jail though the argument could easily be made that he failed to stop due to intimidation
  it isnt dipshit youre using confirmation bias
  lol lets murder someone because they lane split and wouldnt get out of the passing lane  that seems like a good idea
  you mean hit someone who brake checked me in the passing lane
  what brake check you cant even see the front riders brake lights even if he did brake check him is that grounds for attempted murder even if you argued that he hit the rider on accident he has no excuse for running  inb4 intimidation
  its not an excuse to run someone over but when you get that booty blasted someone passed you you shouldnt have a licence    car brakes and slows down  see biker look behind him to check distance and gives hand gestures  tries to control traffic while his buddy goes for the pussy smash and run  gets run over   all the biker cucks have to heavily edit their videos to look less like faggots  guy avoids prison many lols were had
i try to avoid everyone as carefully as possible in my fucking car what is it about a motorcycle that would instantly turn me into a big dicked daredevil as if a base trim kia forte is suddenly incapable of killing me
fuck bikers
  start shit  get hit  maybe you shouldnt be starting shit when youre immensely less powerful and entirely reliant on other peoples restraint
  squids like you should be removed from the gene pool this is why people hate bikers
  kekking at the impotence of the bikers selfish pricks
  see   cagers  you
  they deserve it these people acting like fuckwits on the road are only making it less safe for non dipshit riders
  people are animals everyone has a breaking point
  bikers deserve everything they got and then some
whats some real advice or experience you guys can give me about these
pretty sure the frontiers from that era had some catastrophic radiator issues
  havent read anything about that but apparently 20052010 have problems with coolant leaks mixing into the transmission
if you want a reliable dd shitbox and you dont tow much look for a 24 in manual flavor if you plan to tow get the 33 but be warned its a gas pig that likes to crack its passenger manifold and has knock sensor issues from time to time make sure the timing belt has been serviced if you go with the 33 the 4 speed re4r01a auto trans is rated for 5k towing 5 speed manual 3500 the manual will give you far less trouble as the auto will have valve body issues if pressed hard though a reman swap is easy    if you live in the rust belt keep an eye on your u joints and your gas tank both will rust to death in short order if neglected before everything else    also  pertains to 2005 and up frontiers with the strawberry milkshake of doom 1st gens dont have this issue
  thanks for the tips im going to test drive an automatic v6 today i need the 4x4 sucks about the auto id love a manual but idk if ill find one in ct
gas is currently 195 per gallon
another episode where usfags complain about high prices  its 190 per liter here now stfu
  are you complaining or what
  but it was 3/gal just a few months ago
  195 a gallon is super cheap eurofag
its fucking 150 per liter in europe and we have lower wages kys americans
195 is pretty low
  boo hoo why dont you go riot about it
  95cents/litre here in canuckistan still a lot higher than it should be
  dont worry opec is about to change all that
    061 for a litre of lpg in netherlandistan getting cucked is a choice
  based potsmoking cheesehead
   is currently 195 per gallon  putting spicy water in your fuel tank
ca here fuck you
  thicc burger truggs in netherlandistan can be cheap as shit pic related happens to be a cummins but regardless i see many petrol v8 truggs converted to lpg they have the running costs of a 316d due to loopholes
  i want a pick up here in netherlandistan but i want one pre 1978 because fuck paying taxes    also i want a datson 620 or a mazda light truck and they are rare as shit here
mfw filled up the tank this morning for 20  199/gal
  nj here 93 is still expensive but more reasonable now  filled up from half on 26 dollars instead of 38 just two months ago
  youll probably spend more reattaching the rust that falls off it than you would in taxes on a modern vehicle
  they literally give me 80 for every single gallon i get here in alaska  eat a dick yuros
  being poor
  really holy shit
prices dont budge in arizona because lol no snow just gets cold at 40f  dont even get me started on stupid fucking northerners coming down here
  poor   its currently a 189 in my state thats cheap as fuck cheaper than its been all year atleast
tfw still 320/gal in commiefornia
i paid over 4 for 91 driving up i5 thanksgiving day
  its 330 a gallon and rising in vegas
  we can bitch about it because our cost is mostly market fluctuation you faggots have high gas because youre socialist cucks who taxed it to fuck and back
  us gas tax is typically 55/gal  average gas tax everywhere else in the world is 250/gal  it also helps a whole lot that we drill extract and refine like 80 of our own oil versus europe which i imagine is substantially less
  isis this bait
  you should be fine though what with the government provided healthcare and free education right
  gallons  liters  litres  stone  lbs  kg  oz    why the fuck we need all this shit
  appreciate your post but 44 of our oil comes from canada and 9 from saudi arabia do you might need to go update your sources
  i put 23 stone of premium petrol into my 46 quid v8 range rover and it only cost me 45 liters    good deal
  wtf its 325 here in chicago
  124 here haha
  be in leftist shithole that gives ass tones of money to poor and criminals  surprised when taxes are high    thanks for the lol anon
  well everything would be better if a few faggots stopped being snowflakes and used metric
  your point
  its 262 in west virginia fuck off and learn how the world works
  its 230 a litre here no joke
  blocks the bike lane    seems to me hes doing gods work over there
  damn i thought gas was expensive here in the netherlands i can get a litre for 150 here
  he wants cyclists to leave the bikelane
  2 burgerdollars and 60 burgerpennies by where i work 220 or so where i get gas by my house and i usually end up with 3 cents a gallon discount or more there
  yeah because 262 is basically the same as 325 chicago is closer to hawaii 340     hawaiii an island in the middle of the fucking ocean where everything is imported    kill yourself for being retarded
  kiwibro i know them feels
  hes talking about us you fucking dumbfuck america refines 80 of its own oil majority of that like 7080 comes from texas and the rest is from alaska no one gives a fuck about you europoors
  wanting cyclist in your cities  ill take trucks over cyclist any day fuck those peddle cucks
  blocking bikepaths will just make them ride on the road more
  i can get a gallon here in chad america for that price taking into conversions into account 150 is roughly 185 thanks to superior chad american dollars
  literally every developed country refines a majority of its own oil save for a couple europoors retard refining costs dont fluctuate like crude production costs do please explain how crude costs which can fluctuate by as much as 100 percent over ten years are not a more important economic indicator than naturally stable processing prices     fuck off
  neger dat is nieuwzeelandse dollar dus 230  140
  maybe european cities should have actual lanes for actual cars and trucks instead of cuck lanes for cuckmobiles
america gets tired of dealing with middle east bullshit  fracking gets developed  america has literally doubled its oil production in 10 years  70 or more of americas oil consumption now comes from itself  40 of the worlds oil is made in america  over 10 million jobs are now connected to fracking itself  prices are nice stable maybe a little oversupply  americans live nice and comfy   can sanction iran and still have more than irans oil coming out of texas alone  can pretty much forget saudi arabia  if gas prices went back up new wells in almost completely untapped shale will be dug  prices will return back to nominal amounts  we now have leverage against the rest of the world on the biggest commodity  were even trying to divert away from using it with electric cars    this is the future i wanted i am so happy thank you bush obama and trump
  but if you get cancer you have to sell your house in the us lmao
  there are decent roads in most european citys
  sorry i cant hear you over all our oil refineries and billions of barrels worth of untapped reserves
  you do realize americans have health insurance right thats only a problem if youre a dumbfuck who doesnt get insurance at which point you deserve it also hows paying for the medical bills of every dumbfuck in your country who does stupid shit because lol if i get hurt its free guiss also ive looked into european medical care versus american medical care and its a laughing stock private sectors will always do better than the government
  the only thing that would have made it better would be to make the destabilize venezuela are bitch for a bit make them rich as fuck while maintaining control at a national level dump all that oil right into our country without having a fuck up our own reserves we could also give the middle finger to the middle east right away venezuela absolutely has the potential to take over saudi arabia share of crude imports but theres an initial investment that cost money and the fact that we can sell relatively obsolete weapons to the middle east for top dollar is a pretty big driving force    crude imports from saudi arabia equate to something like a couple billion dollars a month when we can take our obsolete hardware and sell it for tens of billions of dollars a month its a pretty hard deal to walk away from
  i think venezulea oil is a little thicc and it makes more of the denser shit most american consumers use propane gasoline some kerosene maybe some lanturn oil   all can be made from fracking iirc so that real thicc shit from venezuela is not really preferred     but thats all ive ever really heard about that subject im not really sure  either way having that much cheap oil would destroy frackers and let us back into a subsidizing drillers hands    basically the higher price stuff made it the right price for america to supply itself so going for the cheapest isnt what we want nationally
  health insurance companies here are also private
  i hate when euro parts start flaunting universal health care literally the only reason they can afford it and they can barely afford it by the way is because of us defense spending but god forbid when the president brings up the fact that only four member states of nato are actually contributing the mandatory 2 gdp of military spending that theyre obligated to lol its not even funny how disproportionate the spending is     god forbid we actually listen to them cut our defense spending for universal health care and watch them get their shit kicked in by russia and china routinely the i told you so just wouldnt be sweet enough to watch them burn
  the problem with socialism is when you run out of money from someone elses pocket   or however the fuck that quote goes im gonna laugh when all this blows up in europes face while i sit back on my 15 acre ranch driving my v8 full size f150 chugging gas at 188/gallon with wide open roads and cops who could give less of a fuck so long you arent an asshole
  i read a story once that new jersey had to rewrite their entire tax code because one of their pay pigs just ended up moving away
    well gee if the availability of refineries drops off say after some sort of major hurricane hits a major refining area the cost of refining just might go up
  litres and kg are the only ones you mentioned that we actually need please read the si brochure
  do they also make you wear trackers that monitor your health to make sure you arent doing anything remotely fun exciting or dangerous and cancel your plan the second you do anything outa line or is that just your car insurance companies
  wouldnt surprise me nj fucking trash the only thing american about them is namesake and heritage theyre a bastardization of what america is
  i grew up in houston for the last 18 years and dealt with harvey and the oil refineries shutting down caused a huge problem for us we went almost 4 months with gas stations being dry for the most part and gas almost got to 4/gallon
  stuff like that happens all the time in america california loves to tout its hippie bullshit but they dont relise that over half of the state income tax comes from the ultra rich these are the same retards who want to grow their economy but also have the most expensive gas taxes in the nation even worse is when the dumb bastards relise they pay a shitload in taxes and then move to other states and proceed to vote for the same stupid pollicies that made their original states borderline unlivable
  where in europe is the average wage lower than in usa excluding postsocialist countries
  poland for ex
  issue with that comparison is that the minimum wage in the us varies just like it varies in different european countries and also you have to do the math to convery euros to usd cause 1 is like 120 or something
  convert
    liter
  just like there cars europe has shitty everything
have huge oil reserve  could easily make a fat profit off of selling our oil  our cucked leader lets the americans shit on us and by our oil for dirt cheap while our economy fails  fuck canada
just a reminder to all europeans you did this to yourself you allowed your government to oppress you through taxes you allowed yourself to be cucked to bad you dont have some kind of constitution with a bill of rights that carries a power above all courts of law and if the people view something to be unconstitutional we can take it to supreme court to be thrown out despite how our government is at times our military and everything required to make the governments power be carried out is controlled by american people who have an oath to the constitution
  i remember last week on /o/ some guy in washington state said those stupid gas companies never lower the price of gas here  he didnt realize his state has some of the highest gas taxes in the country  yet he was so ready to shit on the companies    they trick themselves into thinking capitalism is bad
it always gets cheaper during winter and oil crashed recently  feels good
thats cheap as fuck
  e85 is currently 112 per gallon
  most people are to stupid to realize the nature of reality i blame how dumbed down our education has become sure we learn mathematics science basic physics and biology but we dont learn how to think for ourselves or how to properly process information this alone cultivates us into mindless sheep who believe were smart when in reality were being pulled by the very strings we were taught to trust and believe in
  give me 80 for every single gallon i get here in alaska    free meth with every purchase of 10 gallons
  when you account for cost of living in purchasing power pretty much every european country might as well be impoverished compared to the us    and im not just talking about yeah you have more access to healthcare versus you cant buy cars or guns or land and things like that im talking just in general essential commodities are far more expensive compared to wage after taxes then they are in the us    when you account for costofliving some 70 of the united states has a greater purchasing power and access to social service then the majority of the eu
  gas is 169 in my state all because dumpf said fuck saudis lol    we   cant   stop   winning
  what the man literally is doing everything short of sucking that goat fuckers dick
a core problem with socialism is that in order to remain sustainable the ideaology basically requires state sanctioned population control particularly of societies least valuable if you have an expected value of 18 children per household with one participant in higher education engineers doctors etc and 28 for low contributing families there simply isnt enough to go around after a generation when the least contributing members tend to breed persons who will not pursue contributory lifestyles in the age of technology this problem is sevenfold     i have no problem in a single frame of reference that high earners contribute to preserve quality lives for low earners but short of state forced sterilisation there really is no way to keep the low contributors from overpopulating bankrupting the state    i cannot see how you could argue for a hardcore socialist state without recognizing that your impoverishhed are trading healthcare for sterilisation
has anyone seen e85 below 1 a gallon yet  it was consistently 1/gallon below the price of gas over the summer and ethanol prices seem to move in line with gas prices
  tell the british to stop measuring themselves in feet and inches and their speeds and distances in miles
  wew fuck snowbirds and fuck northerners
texas wins again
  jesus christ  wtf do you drive that is 322 lbs of gas or 146 kg of petrol
unleaded in australia went from 116/l to 149/l last night
filled up with 98ron  261/l
imagine being so poor you complain about gas    yikes
  mfw gas hasnt been that cheap in nz since the 2000s
  you guys drive 1/4 the distance we do
  reminder
  my country has higher wages than the us
  yeah but it takes us 4x as long
  except for providing alternatives for cars
i literally dont give a shit about the price of gas dumb cage nigger cucks
  what is inflation
  kut kiwis    maar excuses
i couldnt find the sports car of my dreams so i built it myself  ferdinand porsche      what will it take to build the car of your dreams mine is simple  get two k20s  merge them into a v8 called the k40  put it in an nsx
it already exists but theres only one
  and while im on bmw dream cars  weld two m57 inline six diesel engines together at the crank  create a godtier dohc turbo diesel v12 with enough torque to drag an oil tanker  drop it in a sportier x5 and call it the m60d  line up transmissions and grenade them for fun  think audi q7 v12 tdi but smaller and doesnt handle like ass
  thats not rearmidengined nor japanese much less honda   so no it doesnt exist
  i will always hate bmw a little for making those basically production ready m models and then just going nah you cant have them
  the same but with two f22cs to make a f44c
m3 csl with a p86/8 and a lifelong supply of spare parts
  i wasnt referring to ops dream car i meant mine already exists the e31 bmw m8 protoype    this and their iirc s62 powered rwd x5 prototype and the mclaren f1 v12 powered x5 which has been around the nurburgring
looking at a used car just as a shitbox really is it only cosmetic or will water get in anything i can do about it
maybe but probably not just looks like shit would need new rockers and cab corners spray foam silver foil tape and spray paint
i want a ford bronco but those things are too expensive is there a similar car to a bronco under 5k
  probably a land cruiser
  an early expedition but i would rather pay more for a older nice bronco than the early expeditions either way you literally get what you pay for
  similar car to a bronco    lifted fiesta
a bronco ii
  i was thinking is a 2door suv like a land cruiser or maybe a cherokee
2door exploder
  differences between bronco ii and bronco
  do they come in manual
  bronco  f150based suv  bronco ii  rangerbased suv
  size engines the only things they have in common are being an suv the broncos were much more trouble free than the bronco ii
  yes
  yes good luck finding one though
  thanks for that
jimmy/blazer
  chevy k5 blazer/tahoe  dodge ramchager     all of them are going to be expensive but look hard enough        youll find one
  good to know any advice for finding them cheaper besides looking harder
  i heard theyre a pain in the ass to maintain especially if it hasnt been taken care of so expect to drop some cash if you buy one pretty typical for old pieces of shit
  lifted fiesta
  lifted fiesta  why not
  f150 with one of those leer cab things on the bed you can find older ex military blazers for cheap sometimes maybe an xj cherokee of land crusier like some people said old 4runners are cool too my mom drove a dodge ram charger when i was a kid and think they look better than the broncos but good look finding one
  where would i go to acquire an ex military blazer
any 2door pick up based suv    dodge ramcharger  chevrolet blazer  toyota 4runner  nissan pathfinder  isuzu rodeo/honda passport  nissan xterra
broncos are dirt cheap stop being poor
  i see them on craigslist sometimes i doubt theres anymore in gov inventory i saw a whole motor pool full of them back in 2004 tho in south korea at camp stanley
  no theyre not
  c h e r o k e e  h  e  r  o  k  e  e
  rusted trash heaps are cheap broncos worth buying are not
fuck they arent cheap
  they are no longer in us military use so search as you would anything else they are nothing special and you could build a much better truck out of a gasser blazer cucvs are a meme for fucking about in rear areas not serious vehicles they were bought for utility use not combat their gm diesels are shit but the single fuel concept necessary for logistics meant no more gassers         op if you dont have 5k why u want a 4x4 money pit with minimal cargo capacity and which sucks to load thats like volunteering to stay poor
  i know what i got no low ballers
  yes but bronco ii/ranger are ancient and those boxes werent very good
  find something that will probably need work done to it and like most old 80s trucks theyre relatively easy to work on just make sure you get a step stool or be prepared to sit on a fender

what job do you refuse to do on your ride    at what point to do throw in the towel and take your heap to a mechanic
motorcycle and valves
  electrical faults i fucking hate chasing electrical faults
  balancing wheels not worth buying a balance machine to take up space for a job that people will charge literally 510 per wheel with tire install     i mount my own tires for off road shit that balance dont matter on     as for any other auto repair job its not difficult if you have the right tools sometimes its a pain due to time consumption etc but unless youre really inept or you earn 100 an hour youre always better off doing it yourself even engine rebuilds are easy if you keep everything clean and make sure you measure religiously
  windshield installation after that one time i broke a new 400 windshield trying to install it   everything else i do myself
only time ive taken my car in is for alignments a water pump and some upper control arms any other suspension and engine work i do myself albeit at my own slow ass pace
  i prefer to work on motorcycles actually i get that the parts tend to be smaller but access is way easier

its getting dark and youve been here a while cars ahead cars behind but nobodys going anywhere any time soon youve been told to stay in the car until they can clear the way ahead but youre starting to feel the cold seep through the glass    youre grateful you thought to put items missing in the back a few days ago but youre not bear grylls what are you going do
equip spare blankets stashed under passenger seat  turn off engine to save fuel/battery  tilt seat back prepare to hunker down until someone pounds on the window when its done  check locks  check windows  check phone is off charger  check deicer etc is still in the glove box  check radio for any news just in case its the apocalypse or ragnarok or something  if its late nap if not doze
  this post made me think how comfy this scenario would actually be well in a strange way   i would  tape off all doorseals and everything that can let air in  carry old newspapers with you and stuff them under the tape to insulate better  insulate all windows and front with additional blankets tie them somehow so they stay in place  have some hobo stove with you so you can light it just beside your car to warm up as a backup    damn im gonna make a winter survival bag for my car just for the luls pic is where i want to be stuck
  you want to be stuck on the tracks in japan in your car    weird
  i camped in my hatchback when i was a teenager put the back seats down and slept in the back    it was comfy as all hell did huge roadtrips got a hotel every few days to shower but otherwise used fast food restaurants and grocery stores    i remember pulling down field access roads next to rural country fields and falling asleep next to swaying corn fields or in the mountains or in the forests    those were some of the best times of my life man    these days though i just dont feel like traveling anymore im still sort of into it but after a few days i want to be back home
  i always keep cliff bars a mylar blanket and a dozen hot hands where my spare tire sits under the hatch floor or in my old cars trunk i also kept a small shovel in the trunk when i drove the fwd landbarge    also i frequently have moving blankets in there
  i have been in that situation twice  both times i was drunk and a passenger  one time in a 330d with webasto just put it on and died from alcohol lad came in his hilux in the morning  second time in a patrol on 44  drank my beer died woke up 300km away
axe  bottle of alcohol  gun  blanket
  winter tires  chains  jump pack  ez pz
  well maybe on one of the roads above i had to post it it was too comfy     sounds like fun also did a roadtrip with my gf 2 times now the second time i fetl the urge to go home way earlier it was a short one and we slept in a minivan with a matress moving stuff from back to front when you want to go to sleep was the most annoying part everything else was nice still wouldnt do it again next year need a break from that
i have an suv ill just go offroadaround whatever nonsense is going on up ahead

  they didnt put a 1000hp 2jz boostmonster in it
  it looks like it would be an ideal alternative to the 370z if it came in at the same price i keep hearing its going to be 60k though which is pretty unbelievable if true you can get the lexus sports car for that

is the jeep compass any good its jeeps best selling vehicle worldwide 
no one here owns a car
  i test drove one power isnt great overall it doeznt seem that great but it doesnt have a cvt so thats a huge plus the awd system is also okay look its not a great vehicle but itlldo better off road than uour average cuckbox imo its overpriced and underpowered though    personally id much have one of the new honda passports coming out in a bit
  honda shill pls go
  ill give you a bump just to enjoy all the inevitable poster pointing out that the compass is a primarily roastie driven extended chassis renegade for people that cant afford a real jeep damn you made me say it    anyway the new passport looks interesting to me its just a more off road variant of the pilot if im understanding things correctly still a cuckover as you kids like to say with your crazy slang but if i can afford it i might actually get one look heres a picture of one doing offroady things

  just look it up took me all of 3 seconds
so for someone who want a 2016 or less older used car what would you recommend note my first any only car was a 2005 mini cooper
  either a corolla or a honda civic     those are coming in off their leases now and if the mileage is low you are pretty much guaranteed they arent beat to shit
  what would you consider to be a low mileage  for me personally id think 50000 miles
  manual honda crz
  not on a 2016     low mileage on a 2016 is 20k   ideally you should be looking for 36k and below on a 3 year old vehicle     closer to 36k just realize they maxed out their miles so make sure you get a dealer warranty it still has some factory on it but play it safe
  over 1k miles per month is high mileage
    i almost forgot dont let them fuck you with dealer maintenance packages     idk what your credit is but if you can afford it try to keep your principle low by starting with a high down payment   you dont want to be paying 46 on a used car loan for a principle over 15k     what is your ideal car payment or will you be paying cash     if you go corolla or honda your repairs will be non existent for at least 3 years depending how you plan to use this car
the used 2019 miatas are starting to trickle onto the market boys get your wallets ready for spring and get one 6k below sticker with only 1k miles and remember mazda is really the only car manufacturer that cares about you
  they look like theyre a lot of fun to drive i just cant justify spending money on such an impractical fun vehicle when i already have a pickup truck for utility / practicality and a motorcycle for fun
trying to get a refreshed version of one of the most popular convertibles in the world for under msrp during spring time when demand is the highest  good luck with that buddy

25k for a brand new car wow    buti can get one of these with turbo and a 6 speed with nearly twice the size power and comfort for the same money
  buying used is smart
  youre why cars are being replaced with crossovers
  why would you ever compare a grand touring car to a roadster
  new s2k that looks like an nsx  ughhhh
  and you look like a teenage girl driving her sweet 16 present
  why would you ever compare two rwd 4 cylinder 2 door cars with similar price points
  wow youre literally the definition of a specsheet benchracing busrider none of those things you listed makes it a worthwhile comparison
  im not going to let you dismiss the comparison of two incredibly similar cars just because of some dumb loosely defined marketing terms its as stupid as the people who protect the sti from comparisons to the focus rs and golf r because its a sedan and theyre hatchbacks theres no legitimate reason the miata cant be compared to cars like the mustang and brz
  unironically buying an ecoboost mustang    kys
  imagine spending more money for a car thats 2000 pounds heavier
  the mx5 and brz are comparable because they are both sports cars albeit with differing body styles the mx5 and the mustang cannot be compared because the mustang is a grand tourer its foolish to compare two cars designed for two different purposes
  wow that comparison isnt even close youre really bad at this
  can you think of a way at all to defend your point of view other than stupid marketing buzzwords  similarities 2 doors rwd manual transmission similar price points  differences its a grand tourer
  whats sad is you dont even understand how retarded you are why dont you just compare the space shuttle to a plane they both have wings a cockpit and landing gear
  one of the most common complaints about the mustang is that the handling feels numb while everyone constantly praises the miata for that and the mustang is more than 1000 pounds heavier but that doesnt matter because they both have 4 wheels and an engine right
  there you go actually using real points of comparison instead of just buzzwords yes the mustang weighs a lot more but it also has a lot more power and passenger/cargo space
  that buzzword already did the comparison anon just had to spell it out for you because youre retarded
  so much this
        its all about     d r i v i n g f e e l  r  i  v  i  n  g
dunno if mazda cares about me but they do make nice cars
  if your argument depends on a buzzword then you dont have an argument
  okay then lets compare a cherokee trackhawk to a mustang then the trackhawk is clearly better because it has more passenger/cargo space although it weighs more  do you see how retarded that comparison is
  comparing two rwd 4 cylinder 27k coupes to each other is the same as comparing one to a awd v8 90k suv  oh wait i think i just got trolled didnt i
  mazda is the only driven centric auto manufacturer in distance outside of luxury brands like porsche and ferrari
  hey they both have 4 wheels and can be optioned with a v8 its practically the same thing  besides who gets a mustang with anything other than a v8 its like driving a ferrari with a v6 its not a proper ferrari
  speaking of small cars saw this in japan and havent been able to figure out what it was or if its any good
  being this autistic
     a type of car is not a buzzword
  marketing terms are buzzwords theres no reason why two cars that are similarly priced and similarly capable designed for similar audiences for similar purposes cant be compared to each other just because the miata doesnt have backseats and a roof doesnt protect it from comparisons to the mustang and brz i dont know how many times i need to say this
  second generation daihatsu copen
  it looks like a sports car for clowns
  turbo  preference  6 speed  they both have a 6 speed  nearly twice the size  comfort  preference again and thats exactly the reason why people want the miata  power  the power to weight in the miata is only about 5 lower than in an ecoboost stang    i can understand why you would prefer a mustang due to your preferences but the miata fits the taste of certain audiences better and you know it
  dude stop youre a fucking retard
  specsheet benchracing    its funny you miata faggots do this all the time to every other car but you retarded cuckboys have a blindspot when it comes to your precious homomobile    neck yourself
  its funny you miata faggots do this all the time to every other car  pretty easy to live in a world full of strawmen
  i bet he feels smart beating them up sad
  whats retarded is miata fangirls  pls dont compare my waifu to this other better faster more fun more comfortable more practical car that costs the same i dont want to have to face the facts
  the day they make a miata fastback is the day i buy one cant do the convertible thing here in new england
  thats what the rf is for
  you realize thats a convertible
fiat cares    they gave you the turbo miata you always wanted anon
  no shit moron just weld the top shut
  more expensive  heavier and thus slower  literally the worst miata ever i think the only reason mazda refuses to make a real coupe is because it would be admitting that convertibles are a shit platform and that would be disrespectful to the older generations mazda seems to be borderline autistic about the heritage of that car even though they dont care about the history of any of their other name plates
  or just leave it closed
  grazie fiat
miatas are fucking gay
  used 2019 miatas  u wot they just started selling them
  oh my fuck they need to build this
  some people buy miatas and realize its not for them maybe its too small or their weather isnt the best for a convertable
  or they get disappointed by how slow it is
  let me explain  a 718 boxter an a miata are similar cars with a big price difference both are handling focused two seat convertible sports cars both have a big emphasis put on light weight and driver involvement first  a mustang and a miata are disimilar cars with similar pricesfor the 4 banger mustang at least one of them is a big heavy 4 seater pony car with the wrong engine a roof and a focus on straight line acceleration rather than cornering the other is a two seater convertible sports car thats light and nimble  do you see the difference do you see why someone looking at a miata wouldnt really care for a mustang
  how do you benchrace with a 180 hp no torque tin can lap times oh wait those are real racing
  do you see the difference  obviously i see the difference i never said there was never a difference of course theyre not exactly the same but to imply the miata should be protected from comparison because of a marketing buzzword or that no one on earth could possibly ever cross shop two rwd manual 2 door cars with similar price points is dumb as all hell  in your post you compare the two cars and draw attention to their individual strengths and weaknesses despite that being the thing youre supposed to be arguing to be impossible
  what im getting at isnt that a mustang isnt a valid option its that most people looking for a car like a mustang are much much much more likely to cross shop a camaro or a challenger than a miata its a fair compairson in the snese that you can get something different for the same amount of money but its not better if you mod the miata a bit which most owners do at least a little itll spank the mustang around a track every time its way lighter and handles better its a better platform to start from if you start modding a ecoboost stang to be quicker youd probably be better off just getting a gt and going from there  in conclusion the important part isnt the marketing buzzword but the actual utility of the car if im using my car to hit the track every weekend and autocross all the time im getting the miata if im daily driving the car and only have one car id get the mustang
  dear journal anons retardation has continued into day two he again insists that roadster and grand touring are only marketing speak only time will tell if he will recognize his delusion and come to grips with reality i will continue to document his mental state for future research and posterity
  and robocop surely
auburn leather now  more hp  rf  dark grey  appearance package  looks amazing through and through  37k new  damn lads looks like ill have to pass for a while
  the important part is the marketing buzzword because it was the foundation of the entire discussion  a mustang and a miata are incomparable because the miata is a roadster was the original point it was never about which was better but that they were comparable they have more similarities than they do differences and just saying theyre incomparable because one is lighter just sounds like an excuse to not have to listen to the miatas shortcomings
  they have more differences than similarities suspension design is completely different ones turbo the others na one has four seats the other has two one has a roof the other one doesnt one weights nearly 1200 pounds less than the other i could keep going the similarities are price and that theyre both sporty rwd manual offered cars
  theyre rwd manual 4 cylinders 2 doors both have soft top and hard top options both are designed to be sporty and fun theyre there same price i could keep going the differences are weight and that ones a roadster
  reading this post it almost sounds like youre comparing the two cars the thing i said could be done but was told repeatedly that it was impossible nay forbidden yet here youve done the very thing what a miracle
  by that logic a wrangler is a good competitor to the mustang and miata hard top and soft top 2 door rwdpart time sporty and fun manual 4 cylinders similar price
  lmao i drive a convertible in canada during the winters stop being a bitch
owned a nc2 miata modded it lightly and loved it  went to school and became tradesman  made fun of all the time because of it  fell for the hp meme ended up trading it in on a 2017 wrx  sold the wrx because its a terrible fat rev hanging car  want nothing more than to get a 2019 rf mx5 with the sport package  tfw 48k in canada   tfw my boss and coworkers will make fun of me    hurr why dont you buy a pickup truck like everyone else and be a good goy

  weighs 3300lbs because muh safety regs
    ive satisfied the small car itch with my suzuki swift gti im rebuilding but i honestly miss my miata alot it was the best performing car ive owned and if the rf gs sport package didnt cost almost 50 fucking grand i would seriously consider it it completely shit all over the wrx in retrospect with the only advantage the wrx had being faster
  the new targa style or is this called something else and specifically this pic makes the car look like and give off porsche vibes  i might just buy one
  just import s660 bruhhhhh  we can dream tho pal
  the new miata needs three things done minimum    lowering springs  rallybacker low ducktail spoiler  front lip    totally changes the look of the car

  now they need to answer mazda with a 2019 version  but  no memeaktiv  makes it less attractive so hopefully the price drops
  the call it the rf retractable fastback
    you can just rip out the motors and wield the top to make it a real coupe     im surprised no one has done this yet
  i dont care if its slower i4 camaro  ecoshit mustang
  dinos were so underrated
  what would the benefit be shave 5lb just hit a treadmill fatty
    the nd rf weighs 100lbs more than the soft top version im sure youd remove far more than 5lbs by deleting all the mechanical bits and pieces     for reference the nd soft top pieces add up to 41lbs
  id on that spoiler legsport ducktail maybe
  not sure but it looks like it
  people selling used ones that quickly it must be more than just the shit reliability
  fucking sex
  they also made it more reliable

  used 2019 cars  its not even 2019  is this what owning a mazda does to your brain
  fucking gorgeous
    one of my soldiers had a miata nobody that actually like driving gave a shit we knew why he got it and buying that was infinitely better than the automatic v6 camaro lt we had with the kn sticker on the back
  wow ok thats cool
  160 vs 350 hp
  182 vs 310 but ok
hi /o/ im looking to buy a second car old reliable and fun and recently came across a local 1996 sc300 with 121k on the original engine and trans for 3k talked to the owner and he said be purchased it nonworking timing tensioner failed but he replaced the tensioner pulley belt and even water/fuel pump filters and alternator     exterior looks nice from pictures ive seen and even the interior looks clean for a 22 year old car would this be a good buy assuming the car doesnt show any major signs during a walk around and test drive also anything to do or test i may not consider when i go take a look at it    i understand around this milage i need to consider replacing mounts bushings and inspect/replace the power steering pump but any other things to consider     thanks frens pic related
  put a huge turbo on it and tell everybody you have an undercover supra
  jfc im actually thrilled to have found one in what seems to be in a well kept unmolested state
if cars look good and drive well they often are good cars
  old reliable and fun  pick two
honda civic
  i drive a 92 and id argue that its the closest you can come to all 3 have a bit of an emergency fund set up for the suspension though the ball joints are integrated with the control arms and if they yank out its like a 700 part to replace mk4 supra arms are a direct fit but the bushings are a little firmer
  thats super helpful information anon how has your 92 treated you overall
  the 96 has the non vvti engine so you dont have to upgrade the internals to turbo it the 97 and 98 with the vvti engines have the weak pistons that you cant turbo so the car runs i would never buy an sc300 or sc400 i had almost 10 years ago
  weak rods since the knowitalls that have no money and common sense will correct me
  good to know this particular one wasnt gimped with weaker internals by the manufacturer even if i dont plan on added a turbo current owner /says/ it runs strong but also seems like hes a homebased mechanic flipping cars that were in need of basic engine repair eh hopefully thats a good thing     this weekend ill see if it starts up idles smooth and shifts when its supposed to any reason you would stay away from an sc or any recommendations under the 7k mark not a miata
  yea take a look at it the steering wheel is from the vvti years its not correct and also black lol makes me think it was in an accident where the airbag deployed     just because they seem extremely difficult to resell if you love it and want to own one get one for whatever reason people dont seem to want them list a fake for sale ad and see how many hits you get over a month     i guess it really depends what you want if you like lexus maybe an 35 to 45k is300 i think theyre going to be around that price for a while if the body is clean and it has some maintenance records maybe a gs400 since its very quick and reliably it also has the buttons to shift the transmission which the gs430 doesnt if you can find a clean one that isnt asking ridicules 6k which is difficult theres a lot of 350z but i really dont trust those on reliability unless its the hr motor which i think only came in 07 and 08 and are 10kish
  they are definitely a niche car i know the posting for this one has been up for over 20 days and thank you for pointing out that steering wheel never would have known myself will have to try and pull history on it before i even go look at it    definitely a fan of lexus and mid 90s japanese cars in general love datsun and infiniti vehicles but i keep my distance from nissan itself after i got fucked on both a new altima and titan xd a few years back both lemons both had to get a lawyer to force corporate to take them back but fuck me i still like the 350z
  that you cant turbo   wew the ge bottom end can handle 350hp but anything over is asking for trouble the a650e auto cant hold anything past 300 either
  sorry meant to reply to 
since were talking about sc300s    is this worth it        itd be 5200  1500 for shipping
  very much so jump on it before i do im serious
  the 300 is the slowest of the soarer/sc line up and the fastest 1j turbo soarer isnt a fast car to begin with but outside of drag/bench racing theyre plenty fast as for handling its excellent for a 2 ton rock which is still pretty great handling theyre stable to the point your gran could correct any oversteer and under steer is something that only happens of you really fuck up they are best enjoyed at 20003000 rpm lazily flowing down a back country road in the sun in the south of france
  i think a lot of the fun i would have with it is in part due to the rwd nature of the vehicle and its handling as far as speed my minivan has a faster 060 by about a second so thats of no importance i am torn between a clean and functioning sc300 to daily and go on winding roads with or buy an ls400 to drive low and slow around town real big fan of the 1uz dad had an ls when i was growing up and it was the first car i drove he taught me how to send it sideways and shred tires in it when i was 15 should get his running again
  my sc is an absolutely amazing daly and i agree that the uz is a great engine the things can safely take 500hp on stock internals personally i think the sc would be the best for slow cruising unless you dont like being noticed and you should defiantly resurrect that ls
only ever seen black and mexicans drives 300 so i probably wouldnt do it
  noplz i gotta wait till next friday at the earliest
  youve got my mercy this time im stuck between that soarer or a pristine celsior from japanese classics
let me see the stanced peugeot 306
disgusting  i literally cant see people who do stances as actual human beings
  stancing shit cars is fine   stancing good cars is a no no
  you could stance the worse car you could think of even a morris marina and id still want to kick your ass and confiscate your car
  objectively wrong  thats like saying smearing shit on a lobster is a nogo but smearing shit on a sandwich is totally fine
  how uh how did they get it down there without fucking up the bumpers
  lets not    sage
  maybe its bagged
  how does it turn
  its already at the dump they used one of those cranes with an electromagnet to put it in a nearby creek they left it there

the slot mag is the ultimate wheel
  how much can it cost to ship a set of c4 corvette wheels to wherever you are

  kinda crazy to me that people still have those og logo stickers
  alright waifusquad just out in a order please treat it well    thank you
  order number 1488
  kek    oh also wanted to say im kinda jelly the persistence to go through college and run a business  my lifes a wreck and im considering going back but im quite certain im too stupid to do what i want nor do i ever really have the willpower for follow through
  you think my life isnt a wreck too   i chugged an entire bottle of sake last night its a hobby for me not a business orders can get delayed during finals my priorities put school above orders
  i still couldnt do either  ive literally done nothing but exist for almost two years
  its taken a lot of work college not my hobby and its worth it for me but really college is fucking dumb go to a trade school or something    also im working on 2 more szs stickers and a potential collab and also another kaichou sticker i didnt know people still wanted stuff of her
  im quite aware college is fucking dumb  i went for two years i was 2 classes from an associates but life  but a bs is pretty much required to do what i want  good luck tho man
i dont get it do you put the sticker under the windshield or over it please respond
thanks waifusquad for bringing back the flavortown slaps been waiting intently
  over      take care of it bro but study its less than 2 weeks till exams for me too fuck this gay shit
  cool refunded you 4 and will be shipped out today
  thanks bro
done and done satori is definitely my favorite out of this set   i might make one or two more 2hu chibis but id rather get back to bigger vectors   these four should be in hand by 12/15
put up the ugly duckling for preorder once again
wicked did you ever send out that california sticker to this order number 4142066561603889  if you remember you sent me the slower traffic keep right on accident when i ordered the california one instead  thanks senpai
  holy shit thank you thank you thank you lc you are fucking amazing buying a bunch later when i get back from work
  now how do i convince the rest of the vendors to bring back their dead stickers that i want
  convince the vendors to come back from the dead first
    why cant /o/ stickers be like /k/ patches
  explain
  /o/ stickers be like /k/ patches  dont those guys have to order a shit ton as a moq stickers you can order 10 and its fine
  shit ton  yeah the more you buy the cheaper it is    i think hes referring to the fact that /k/ sellers generally dont stop selling their designs they keep restocking them
  constant restocking thatd be fucking wicked  none of this limited release because reasons
  yeah unless the vendor is awol they will generally keep restocking popular designs neet still has shit from two years ago being restocked that people like for example
  speaking of /k/ patches do you know who sells that ohio patch pic related   i dont venture enough to /k/ these days to figure it out i went through the pastebin of the sellers couldnt find it i figure im doing something wrong
  woodpatchs
  i know hes got the pvc one isnt there an embroidered version though
  i do not remember sorry
  alright thanks  i saw it on a post your patches picture since it was a bit smaller im not sure if it was indeed embroidered or if it was the woodpatchs pvc one
  what all do you use for your product shots been thinking about buying one of those chink shit 15 light boxes
  limited releases are stupid as fuck but the reality is some stuff sells like shit and theres no reason to keep them in stock
  lamp  cardboard box  white paper
  isnt it much easier for you guys to order smaller quantities plus you do preorders typically
  id assume its not the same for everyone if youre a popular shop that does a lot of business it would most likely be easier to place a larger order knowing youll most likely sell out of it at some point in the near future but its probably safer to place small orders to minimize potential losses in the case of a less popular shop nobody wants to be out money for stock that isnt selling
any good shops that arent shut down selling drive stickers want to go back to my autism from 2011 when i watched it in theaters    hard to imagine its been 7 years
  half the time i want to ask some vendors to just let me have the design so i can pay someone a stupid amount of money to make just a few personal ones
lucky cat stickers please
  its actually surprising how many people have flat rates with only a minimum quantity offset/shwa does everything at a flat rate with only 10 or so as the minimum iirc
  i checked the pastebin for offset and shwa where do i get in contact with those guys
  shwainc on ig or khiemshwainccom
w2c nightshift stickers
  isnt it easier to do smaller quantites  if you order in large quantities you get substantial discounts and it offsets the shipping cost if i buy 20 stickers and pay 8 for shipping thats an extra 40 cents per sticker plus more inventory means less outofstock time which means more sales   if youre certain and i mean 100 certain that you will continue to sell a design for a long time it makes a ton of sense to buy a shit ton of it like ive sold flavortown stickers for almost 2 years now so i buy a ton  preorders allows you to gauge interest and adjust stock accordingly if it sells a ton you buy a ton if it sells like shit you buy exactly how many orders you got  lowering your running costs means increasing profits which if youre from 4chan and arent a big jew means you can pass that down to the customer   by the way apologies to my customers inventory has been weird and ive been caught up in finals ill get as much out the door as i can tomorrow
if anyone wants some hot meme garbage head on over to the site theyre up for preorder
  wwwaimlessgoodscom
  guess not
so many of the original osg shops are closed now   did it become a money loss or are these guys just incapable of running a sticker business properly
im thinking of starting a new shop not just stickers some shirts and other merch as well do i post my wares here
  link to store
  in the paste bin weeb dot world
oh fug i want this komi  not available  reee
find some sticker seller aping existing designs  all they do is take them and add a shit load of awful tattoos
tfw theres still no shops with shit as good as notoris was
if a shop just took then started printing and selling notoris designs would that be a bad thing  would it be any better if they stopped if for notori actually came back from the dead
  it would be bad   if you want to reprint notoris designs just ask him
  do it and sell them to us
lain stickers please
look what came
  cute
is there a vendor or vendors who can sell me some sweet patches to sew onto my jacket
  check the /k/ patch thread
    hmm conflicting opinions    not that im a shop or am going to do it  just always wanted to get in the game have really enjoyed designing stickers and maybe make a bit of side dough in the process also i just really like notoris stickers not to mention quite a few others from other shops that have discontinued stickers  i think as one anon had pointed there seems to be an issue with alot of vendors stopping print on stickers people seem to like and instead like to constantly push new designs i agree but thats my own opinion i dont actually know the analytics on these things
   what he said    just wanted to post one i have  theres even an initial d patch
  i dig it
  didnt load also neet is doing an embroidered initial d i cant wait for that one
  huawei  thats a yikes
  its a matebook x pro which is very nice
  did you cut this yourself
  oh i thought it was just me  and this bastard  made it seem thats what it was  the initial d ones i have arent velcro on the back so i havent yet put them on anything
  kinda on one hand he did say he would give his designs to other vendors before he fucked off which never happened so people are left without a means to buy them    on the other hand they are his designs and osg had an autistic meltdown about someone trying to remake big fat catback
  no i tried that the last time i got stickers but this time i got a diecut which was way way better  plus vinyl vs the horrible paper stickers i had last time from (((red bubble)))     
  also had this other thought  what whoever did it went through the whole design and vector process for their own printing  so itd be a little less copy paste
  cool ks patch
what the fuck
  who
  zetaraes
  oh yeah i forgot it should be back up in an hour judging by what his site says
  i need that bad taste no culture sticker
  if you go by cst then yeah but his site says cdt
  i dont do conversions any more i just let the search engines do them for me but simply searching it says an hour from now
feel like i got away with murder with zetaraes sale considering that stickers are the ink of the vinyl world  12 stickers for 20 bucks

is this the most normie board on the site i was talking about welding an exhaust and power tools earlier today with my boss and i have never felt so fucking dude conversation in my life
  not by a longshot try 
  newfag here but so far i guess so  cars are cool and shit
/o/ is still in its anime hating stage which is something the rest of this website has moved on from boards like /soc/ and /sp/ are still probably more normalfag than /o/ though
  i think its always been but always will be a vocal minority i dont really save smug anime girls but i like stupid giant robots
  well what do you expect yeah /o/ is a very normie board
  while cars are a normietier hobby like sports this board is infested with /r9k/ tier folk so the answer is no
  cars are one of the most expensive hobbies in the world r9k tier people dont earn any money
  /r9k/ people dont earn any money    what they do is they make modest money money that would mark you as almost poor if you had a wife and two kids and then they have neither of those so they can live the life of someone that makes twice as much    this is why the left hates them when hillary is in the middle of a custody battle with tyrone tacoez and drowning in student loan debt eugene the homeschooled eugenicist dylannharris bundy is living it up and probably has a dozen bastard children spread across several poor southeast asian nations ensuring that his autism will continue for all time
  /adv/ is even worse literally an entire board of guys my girlfriend broke up with me how do i kill myself easiest also im most definitely not fourteen years old
cars are an interesting inverse bell curve type scale where knowing nothing about them is normie knowing a little about them is odd knowing enough to be a fanboy of a certain brand is just as normie and then you reach knowing a bunch about old obscure shitboxes and oneyear only trim levels and the dacia sanderos excellence and drop right off the cliff firmly into antinormie territory
  there be no normies in these waters
  this board is infested with /r9k/ tier folk  i think thats an overstatement r9k is a league above what we see on /o/
  /p/ and /g/care also expensive desu with all those accumulated and new /gear/
  people with jobs boards  /k/  /o/  /g/  /p/  /toy/  people without jobs boards  /v/  /a/  /n/
  /mu/ hates anime too but its also the most underage board tho so it makes sense
  i would say the most competent board you see if you ask about bullshit the bullshit you get in reply but if you actually ask a worthwhile question here there will always be some br/o/s to answer it and some memetic replies too so if you know jack about the topic and pick the wrong answer you will end up being fucked
    and /out/ /k/ also hates it but its smashed full of furries and shit
this place is full of incels that derive their identity from their car
  delet
  based and redpilled
  nothing wrong with  cute n o t m r c r u m m y anthro  fluffy animal people
  the most annoying thing about this board in my opinion is that people post social media shit and facebook images and no one bats an eye
  and whats wrong with that exactly
why is literally everyone a female in anime
  that would be /fit/ aka failed normie pit
  they dont actually have to own a car to come here and bitch about women all the time
  i dont know but i wish there were more guys specifically cute boy anime i want something like ichigo mashimaro or mitsuboshi colors but with boys not some gay pandering high school boy show
  negro pls i can count the number of females in initial d on one hand
  everybody likes giant robots
  /ak/ has been a thing for years what are you on about
  nice 4/5 here
  you still havent answered my question      social media is part of life whether you like it or not your 4chan bubble is not exclusive or anything
  it can be apart of your life but dont bring that shit here my main complaint with social media posting is that its underpinned by normalfaggotry which especially after some events from recent years is far too common those kinds of people should be shunned away from not only /o/ but 4chan as a whole if there is to be some semblance of post quality and board culture
  not liking anime comes after the liking some stage
  liking anime
  not quite i came here after being exhausted by /k/ its one of those boards like /fit/ or maybe /wsg/ that lives in the middle turn around the north corner and you will find /b//soc/ and /k/ go to the south corner and /r9k//mu/ and /p/ is it is in my opinion the best board for that
  i work in tech and if even attempt talking about cars as anything other than an appliance i look like a turbo autist
does anyone on /o/ still use paper maps over gps i feel like itd be a good way to keep your brain active while youre driving
  i usually just check some keypoints on the webnet before departure and use gps the last hundred meters if im in doubt
  the supreme hipster
  you cant memorize a few turns gps is infinitly more difficult to use and more error prone
gps to familiarise myself with a route on the first 2 or 3 trips then ditch it thereafter because i now know the way without it
  yep large portion of the state i live in doesnt have coverage and the phone is useless as tits on a bull
  same    only for some very inaccesible places
i use mapquest printouts because im my dead dad from twenty years ago
  i use it only for my own arewethereyetthoughts it shows time and distance remaining as well as for finding optimal refuelpoints on roadtrips using pois for gas stations and how far away they are      computers are more error prone than memory  wut
  use it  gps i mean
  a retarded supreme hipster
  hes right tho i mean like in the sense that gps is always telling you to go some retarded way that takes way too long due to traffic by learning the roads you can find much quicker routes   one way i can do this with the gps my car has is cancel certain major roads on my way somewhere and it will send me along a fairly reasonable route
  it should be getting straight up gps coordinates still tho its different from normal cell coverage
  this nigga knows whats up  just write down the turns and exits you need to take and only pull out gps for the map if you want to reroute    i never use the in 500 feet turn left navigation its completely useless  plus jewgle maps will reroute a portion of people down stupid alternate routes as a way to clear congestion for its other users
  by learning roads    yeah im not talking about roads traveled often im talking about roadtrips and such where one would use a map
  fair call i read that and thought phone/google maps type gps desu
  having any screen in my car scratches some nerve inside me  i rarely use roadmaps usually i just follow the street signs and once i travelled a route i tend to remember it
itt people who dont drive very far a little over ten years ago we took a family road trip to myrtle beach that was when the iphone was a brand new concept and to have an expensive gps was considered a luxury we used mapquest and printed out the directions took us 18 hours of driving to get there    out of curiosity i looked up that trip on google maps and it can be made in 13 hours these days you can be warned about speed traps traffic accidents things in the road all read out loud to you by your phone if youre going anywhere far a gps is invaluable
  detroit  london  buffalo  mississauga  wow i never realized how many shitty cities are all in the same area of north america is there even one nice city in this picture
  i mean like in the sense that gps is always telling you to go some retarded way that takes way too long due to traffic  except modern navigation apps calculate the fastest route using current and expected traffic these apps are also free and when you watch the news channel traffic report half the time they are using the same fucking app
everyone should have a papermap in the car just in case you can get a regional one for like 10
  no they shouldnt phones come with mapping apps and have many good navigation apps to choose from
input address drive  vs  let me stop my car and pull out a map and spend time figuring out where i am instead of using a gps like a normal modern human  i think i know which i prefer and if you need to keep your brain active just play a podcast or something
  gps doesnt work every where especially in the mountains
  i got lost for an entire day because i thought my phone was good enough to get me from fairbanks to la
  google maps does use a real gps function its just less precise than cell data triangulation
  yes gps atrophies the brain and sense of direction varg has a video on it
  varg has a video on it    varg needs to make a video on laxatives so he can wipe that eternally constipated expression off his face
belguim fag here my dad still keeps this massive mapchart book in his glove compartment  now that he learned how to use the gps he doesnt use it that much anymore   but pre 2000 he could find any road in the country in less then 5 minutes with that book and would get there with no problems   i probably could not get there without gps
  same here i drove to cali like this and my gf was freaking out the entire way asking if i knew the way i just kept saying i hope so lol
  what if your phone breaks or runs out of charge what if your charging port stops working redundancy can be a good thing
  pic  going to calgary  ever
  the fuck is wrong with calgary better than winnishit shitronto shitcouver or shitmonton
  calgarians  exhibit a
  nope why would i do that when google maps is free and gives me realtime traffic incident alerts for alternate routes to save me time i also like the time and distance left in your route counter it has
  yeah ive got a regional map and use it on occasion dont really need anything else for usual drives and the really oddball addresses arent in the google maps database either i do think it keeps me sharper than nav system users who appear to be utterly lost every time they lose signal
  cancerous numale kill yourself
  shitskin bramptonite detected
i memorize maps in google before setting off if theres a diversion i start driving by the position of the sun and my male instinct
sometimes i write down the turns i need to take so i can check my route without getting on my phone
  what do you know about london bitch
i only check maps after im 100 sure im lost i drove from brampton on to xenia oh only checking the map to see if i needed to take the ohio turnpike or not and im unfamiliar with both cities
    no it isnt go google how accurate the average phone gps is and compare it to cell tower triangulation ill make it easy 4 u 15ft phone gps 3/4 mile cell triangulation
  whats it like living in a city where everyone is fucking retarded do you notice a difference if you dont then that means youre retarded
  poo in loo pajeet
actually retarded or elaborate bait
  is it really that hard to believe  same shit as flipphones manual transmissions and film cameras  theres a pretty thick line between being a hipster and a luddite
  im not indian or paki or whatever brampton is
  im the other guy who mocked the yycuck  hes talking about brampton ontario you dense motherfucker
  i use my phone  have used the compass in my mirror when there was no phone signal i know the place i want to go is west head west eventually get phone signal back and use it  i am going to buy an aftermarket gps for a planned trip to the up though anybody have any suggestions on something cheap
  i do because fuck google not taking part on their botnet
  is that a tesla  jesus fucking christ i will never buy that jewish shit
lets talk big block and why does nobody look at things like the gm l18 for swaps
  the aftermarket isnt there and it wasnt spectacular in stock form 340 hp from 81 liters the ls1 was doing that in 1997 having to shoehorn a big block into a small car is no easy feat much easier to fit the aforementioned lsx into the same space with less weight and more aftermarket building a low speed torque monster fuck yeah ci is king for almost anything else and there are better choices
  and if you want a low speed torque monster you go diesel so another nail in its coffin
  exactly unless you have something against diesel or live in the arctic and have problems with gelling big blocks have their place but the place is not that big
  what about cheap prices for rv motors ive heard of guys picking up low mile l18s for dirt cheap
  you could probably make a lot more top end power with a cam and playing with the heads keep in mind a motorhome engine is under a lot of stress all of its life so 30k motorhome miles are like 90k miles in a normal truck
  i have heard of them going for really cheap like 500 with 50k cheap from wrecked rigs i was thinking of doing a swap into a 81 camero for under 2k
  do it theyre great engines itll just be more expensive /hp wise if you decide to mod down the road     do it theres a guy in town with a bbc camaro that does well at the races however hes running about the same times as people with ls engines that have about half the money and effort put in compared to a bbc would be nasty in an 81 no doubt about that and loads of fun on the street with access to 450ftlbs at a low rpm
my dad is going to trade his 04 xr6 for a kia cerato    should i trade him my 11 lancer sx for the falcon    its a really nice car and ive never had a i6 rwd car
also what is involved in fitting a turbo besides a intercooler
  pulling out the motor and putting in a turbo barra if you have to ask its too much work for you
  not worth it just get an xr6 turbo
  this    
why are manlets bmw fans
  every 2nd bmw for sale has been crashed 3 times and spotwelded and ziptied together in lithuania they are the auto repair niggers of eastern europe
interesting observation ive also noticed that many bmw drivers are height challenged    i also had a problem fitting into my e46 to the point where i sold the car no matter what seating position i tried barring ultra gangsterlean my hair would rub the headliner maybe they are just made for smaller guys
all faggot ass greeks buy 328is thinking its theyre some hot shit where i live    theyre all under 58
  if you got no personality you cling to the next best thing that you think might give you some personality   in the ende its only pure cringe visited a carmeeting with a group of friends never again was too cringy no matter the brand you could see the all retardation and insecurity in these people only one or two dudes seemed pretty based car culture was a mistake best is to keep it to yourself and not be gay about it
bmw is the goto brand for people having a crisis about being interesting
  mechanic culture is cool but nonmechanics are boring and not being mechanics know nothing useful about cars skip meets and look for real gearheads
  solid advice but i wont search for them specifically im okay with my regular friends
  i got 195cm and somehow fit easily in a e46
  if you are short you automatically have no personality and only are a hate driven cringe midget in the eyes of the superior beautiful courages tall man
    height doesnt fix your ugly face though
  t lanklet
    torso to limb length ratio
  tfw 510 and good looking  stay mad anon
  yep long torso
  510  not a manlet  
  the way your standing mainly how you have your legs bowed so you can plant your feet flat is gay as fuck
  manlet and below average at best
  eat more hungry skelly
whats the ugliest car thats in production right now my vote goes to the toyotota chr what a disgusting piece of shit
its a tie between this the new civic and the new lexuss
the fiat 500 l is like seeing that the hot chick you fancied in school is now a fat single mum
some bmw basically take your pick between the 6series and the x5/6/7
  is this an ugly car really
  why does that have civic taillights
  so do these
  read the op again
the new civic is miserable looking and fwd i dont understand why the type r gets praise
  only that one autist on /o/ praises it i dont think the rest of the world even knows it exists
what were they thinking this doesnt even look good if i squint my eyes so it must be ugly to them too
  spoilertwingo
  3 exhaust pipes
  i really like the look of the new civic coupe if the beltline wasnt so ridiculously high and it wasnt fwd id get one
  do you work in it
me and my wife just saw one of these in this exaxt colour scheme at walmart 15 minutes ago both mentioned that it was ugly as shit
  the front is even worse looking they really went full retard with the prius redesign it used to be acceptable looking too
  the x4 and x6 are hideous along with the mercedes glc/gle and the honda crosstour crossovers are abominations
what went wrong with the japs
  fake vent memery
  its the only good looking toyota right now  fite me
  gt86 ok thats a subaru
nissan juke  merc glc/es  bmw x2 x4 x6  honda insight  toyota prius chr
  taillight looks great at night though
  after the first gen toyota realized that the only reason people buy priuses is to advertise how environmentally responsible they are they dont want a normal looking car thats hybrid they want people to know that its a hybrid from a mile away so the more shockingly ugly they make it the better it sells
  but its not good looking its pretty basic looking its not ugly but its not good looking its the 6/10 girl in school you would fuck but you arent thinking about her when jerking off
  it doesnt even come with awd in the us what a fucking failure
any lexus made in the last 2 years that predator grille was never a winner but they just keep sticking it on everything and making it look worse with each generation
  hyundai kona    but i still think the chr beats it
  centered exhaust  3 pipes   hideous
    i unironically like the chr aside from the bunk visibility in the back
some asian crossover no doubt i cant name an example because i literally cant tell them apart theyre all equally disgusting
  i dont get why people say this at all the senna looks good way better than the shit lamborghini puts out
  would you like an extra toy with your happy meal sir
  only three exhausts doesnt it have four cylinders
  well you can have your opinion and i can have mine i think its a mess
  3 exhaust pipes   sounds like shit
  its ugly in the name of aero
  the prius has cw of 024  pic related has cw of 022
  it only needs one since its a turbo engine and a turbo only has 1 output but they probably use some kind of weird piping for the sake of tuning the exhaust note or some shit
is the lexus isf one of the best value used cars on the market  5 litre na v8 that sounds amazing  extremely reliable compared to german competition  rwd  not as much safety bullshit as a current year car
its a mediocre car but all the lowtest incels that make up /o/ these days will tell you its great because its from the same country as their civic
  hurr youre an incel for not falling for the german car meme
  only if you like pigfat autotragic cruisers that rev up to pathetic 6800 rpm  best value used sports car is pic related
  best value  bmw  lmao
  except they can be had for 20k and less lmao
  the maintenance costs on that car have the potential to spiral exponentially higher than the lexus if any of their relatively common problems occur
  only overthinking virgin faggots believe you can be an incel/born to be a virgin seriously and you say lowtest thats some classic eliot rodger puahate posting right there whats next hurr your wrists are too small you should go on estrogen and become traps no woman will ever respect your virgin wrists when they can find the chad carpals on tinder just be yourself bro and actually try to get laid and stay in your league and like man whats the problem everyone else did it your dad did it whiny faggots    t isf driver
  the only relatively common problem is rod bearings which is a permanent fix for 10002000  if you consider driving the isf hard youll be spending money on repairs and maintenance anyway
  plus 15k of repairs over 2 years of ownership    theres a reason they depreciate like they do
  its because theyre ugly as fuck and not very fun to drive once the hype wears off and if you bought it for status in about 2 years every basic bitch has one and the status is gone
  why has the isf depreciated the same as the e90/92 m3 then
  see  
  if the m3 is not very fun to drive to you then the isf will feel like a camry to you
  quick google search shoes it hasnt but regardless i dont give a fuck about the lexus calling a bmw a performance bargain is misleading at best
  posts a trash german pos   nice try
  i had fun driving camrys even 4cyl 2018s feel great
    isf is like the e90 m3 except 200 lbs heavier   has a slow slushbox instead of the m3s lightning quick dct or 6 speed manual  revs only up to 6800 rpm instead of 8500 like the m3  is softer and more comfort oriented and thus worse handling than the m3  slower than the m3 on straight or track  has way less tuning and aftermarket options than the m3  feels more dated inside than the bmw  and is not likely to turn heads unlike the bmw   if you want a quick sporty car get the isf  if youre a driving enthusiast get the m3
  weebs will hate this post  saved for copy pasta
   on a straight  theres countless videos of isf gaping m3s stock vs stock    
  its a good question i think its isf c63 then m3 that is assuming youre saving for a real car like a 997 turbo
heres an isf with over 300k miles  youll be lucky if a garbage e92 reaches 150k before major repairs
  so youll rather believe random youtube videos instead of instrumented performance tests done by every major automotive publication in the world
  slower than the m3 on straight or track  actually cd tested a 2011 is f to be faster than the m3 around a track
  oh shit nice btfo
  false car and driver set a 30540 at vir with the 2011 isf which is equal with the 2007 e92 m3s vir time  they never tested the updated 2010 m3 or m3 with comp package
  cd  welp  
  updated 2010 m3  my2011 update was literally just interior and taillight refresh      also  needing to spend more money on a sport package just to keep up with a lexus  this doesnt help your case and quite frankly the competition package was mainly a 2500 wheel package that didnt make the car feel noticeably different or faster around a track by any substantial margin over the standard m3 if you wanted your m3 to actually go faster youd have to spend another 3k on the dct  but that would ruin your enthusiast argument wouldnt it if you think about it the end of the e90 series spelt the beginning of nubmw and all just went downhill after that
  2008 models
literally made for rich asians  who suck at driving and desperately want to be seen as cool who definitely arent
  the world needs an affordable and good ecu with 16 injector/spark outputs the isf has both port and direct injection i think some dude tried to run it with just the port injection but blew the engine plus its basically begging for fi     fun fact it has a forged crank forged rods oil cooled pistons titanium intake valves nickelsteel exhaust valves dual vvti and decent spec cams
  what about a track monster with a 7l ls v8 pushing 505hp stock 50/50 weight distribution an aftermarket rivaled only by the civic and a rear hatch that opens into a useable trunk for only 35k usd
  absolutely it is anyone who knows anything about cars will have owned an altezza at some point and this is essentially that with a 5l v8 the perfect car bmwfags will leave you alone as will stancefags and wanna be track day heroes  its the perfect car the gsf looks great too cant wait for that to depreciate to this level in the next few years    and is not likely to turn heads unlike the bmw   if you want a quick sporty car get the isf  if youre a driving enthusiast get the m3    id kill myself before i ever buy a bmw
best motoring compared the two for hattori the m3 was still the best for driving pleasure
  wrong the 2011 isf got major suspension/handling improvements and a real torsen lsd  in 20102011 bmw m3 also got facelifted and received the competition package which improved the handling and performance  in the end the standard 2007 m3 with a 6 speed manual already was quicker or just as quick as the facelifted 2011 isf  updated m3 was even better and quicker on top of being nicer to drive doesnt matter if it has dct or manual its still the far superior drivers car
  m3lexus
theyre amazing if you get a 2012 or newer they had significant suspension revisions that completely changed the game for comfort and handling before that they were kind of wallowy around the track and not very comfy
  buying bmw car  not rolling the dice with the v10  really you might as well get the isf or something else safe
  isf  safe  maybe if you drive it like a grandad even a simple brake job costs a shitton for these
  i hardly hear anybody bring up the is f today in fact the mistake lexus made with the is f was launching it alongside the bmw m3 and the mercedesbenz c63 amg that poor timing made it the true underdog    those two specifically grabbed headlines because it was the first time an m3 was moving to a v8 it had a dualclutch transmission a skyhigh redline and the cclass underwent a vicious transition from the sedate body styles of the earlier 2000s to the mad and angular flavor it still carries today amg stuck a nasty 62liter naturally aspirated v8 under the hood which gave the c63 more power than the is f of course people were going to fawn over them
  you can get an isf for 20k
  t le rddit buzzword man
  now that is pigfat
   the competition package which improved the handling and performance  theres no proof of this even the journos that tested it have the concensus that it didnt change the handling very much if it all the competition package was literally just a wheel package other than that they just lowered the suspension 10mm and recalibrated the electronics package to compensate only because you cant just stance an otherwise greathandling car like the m3 and expect it to drive just as good the competition package was really just another way to jew gullible bmwfags out of more money     as for the standard m3 it only got a refresh to the taillights and interior bmw engineers didnt bother to make it actually go any faster and certainly didnt do any major improvements to the suspension or anywhere else on the standard vehicle because 1 it was already very good and 2 it would make the 2500 competition package and the 3000 dct a harder sell      if you actually wanted to make your m3 faster youd get the dct but again its not much of a pure enthusiast car any more
  citing top gear  using the 2008 models    you seem like somebody who doesnt bother to learn anything unless its disguised as edutainment
  bimmer buttfags btfo
  a brake job is still less expensive than a new v10 engine because hanz can not into crankshaft bearings
  ok i wish the m3 had a v10 though    competition pack only improved the alreadybetterthanlexus bimmer  if you actually wanted to make your m3 faster youd get the dct  i dont see how this matters when the manual m3 was already faster than the lexus  m3 was also cheaper than the isf and the lexus had no lsd until 2011 and the majority of isfs i see on the used market are pre2011   imagine paying m3 money for a heavier car with an open differential
  the japanese prefer the m3  lexus fanbois cant keep defending the isf   
  the manual m3 was already faster than the lexus  only until 2011 cd tested the is f with the lsd and it prove itself faster than the m3 around a track
  testing 2008 models
  fake news  car and driver set a 30540 at vir with the updated 2011 isf which is exactly equal with the 2007 6 speed manual m3s vir time    7 years ago  2011 models
the isf is better due to its reliability but the m3 is more fun to drive
  i mean 2bh throw some coils or new springs/struts on the isf and you can tune handling how you want the is chassis line has always been great even the new is350s are pretty dope  shame there isnt a 3isf lexus has such a core identity of luxury instead of performance that they end up building great things that just get detuned to fit the brand identity     i have a first gen is thats my dd and going down the modified path so i think an isf is the logical next daily driver
  dont forget about the isfs fat weight and the crucial lack of an lsd
  i would get a 2011 with an lsd its not really too heavy  definitely lighter than the equivalent year m3
  definitely lighter than the equivalent year m3  why are lexus guys always oblivious  havent you read any reviews of these cars  isf has always been a fat pig it is nearly a whopping 400 lbs heavier than the equivalent year m3
  slow slushbox  it was still a torque converter auto that wasnt as quick as a dct but it could lockup the converter in all forward gears except first respond quickly to shift inputs change gears very quickly and blip the throttle to rev match on downshifts it might still be an auto but its far from slow or slushy
  i think you have that backwards friendo    2011 isf curb weight 34343715lbs  2011 m3 curb weight 37044145lbs
  isf 3434 lbs  m3 4145 lbs  what the fuck posting made up numbers lmaoo    
  the upload date is the means that the video was when the video was produced on the day    goddamn son did you even watch the video before you linked it they clearly state that they are 2008 models
    i test drove one the refreshed model    it was boring and the interior is extremely dated looking
currently drive a 97 mazda miata and im looking for a good fwd daily i make roughly 600700 a month  pic related what do i get /o/
  fuck man at 700 a month just keep that gay thing and survive
what kind of poverty ass job do you work i made 2 grand a month and barely survive here in canada
  bro just rob people make that money honest work is for honest suckers
make literally no money  i want a different car  no wonder youre broke as shit with no income
  600700 a month  id be upset if i made that a week
buy a 3k civic    t someone who owns a miata and dds a 2008 honda civic lx i got for 3k
you should get a new job      iktfb hang in there youll make it
would you buy this toyota of a bmw m4 or mercedes amg c63
no
no of course not nobody buys a lexus if they wanted a mercedes/bmw they buy a lexus because they wanted a toyota but their credit score is too good
  nip shit
  ok mr700 once you go over 720 wont make and difference best you can do is qualify for 0 from manufacture which is 700 and up  t780 score asian
  id take the lexus because fucking paying for the repair costs associated with the bimmer or merc
those cars dont even compare imagine being this uninformed in the postinternet age
maybe if it still had the v8
my car is more serious than this picture hangs down more but i want the two pieces to meet neatly without anything visible from the outside any ideas
  check the tabs holding it in this should be one of the easiest repairs you ever do
  they are broken off i should have mentioned that my bad
    fill it with some almondcoloured caulking for maximum aesthetic
  a screw
  jb weld screws and nail polish  also maybe some rubber tubing to keep it from rattling
  i was thinking maybe ill put in a rivet or 2
  can jb weld cure in 1020 degrees fahrenheit i dont have a garage to park it in so itd have to cure outside
  theres nothing saying it cant but you might want to leave it alone to cure for a longer time
  a strong permanent bond between parts that might have to come apart later nice
naca ducts  post em
get shot in the fucking head bitch dont come to me with that flag no more
i dont
  did gm really try to sell the turdgen in japan my god
  what an odd advertisement my eyes arent slanted enough for me to make sense of it i guess
repeated bad experiences thats why  people who keep buying american are similar to people who are in abusive relationships but they keep going back because x will change i swear
  yes
      you can buy the current gen camaro there new too
  i wish my dad didnt sell his jeep cherokee
  i dont anon not the older ones at least you had an excellent run until 2008   then again most new cars are garbage regardless of manufacture   its perfectly normal for a boy your age
  why you so mad at that 2d
looking for something with luxury and reliability about 56 years old i live in canada so i need a good winter beater with awd here are some options    audi q3/5 x3/5 rx350 acura rdx mercedes glk would also consider a good german wagon with awd    among those which would be the best if i want the least headaches i have a toyota yaris and an s2000 so im used to things never breaking
  these are all going to be migraines compared to a yaris or s2000 especially because these are mostly driven by non whites just lease a new one
rx 350 without a doubt its comfy but pretty boring but still has plenty of power
he actually buys western cars  kek
what a great thread
    there is a way to have good itasha but this car doesnt nail it

  fwd is bad  old is bad  torque dip that can be fixed by changing one single part is bad  owning a car that makes brainlets think im a fag or i vape is bad  go take the fucking bus already and stop fucking up this board more than it already isnt
  actually you need 2part for frs/brz  header  tune e85 is optional
  the tune is mostly for the ecu so it matches the header so its a very light tune else you just need to change the header and the dip fucks right off
  front engined fwd is so plebian
  if you unironically refuse to buy a car because of /o/ memes you should fucking kill yourself    the fact that someone can be this fucking retarded to single out cars from people who shitpost on an imageboard is incredible
  rebadged bmw  not a good thing
  this post is so true but fuck you
  anything bmw  good    do you even know what plebian means are you also aware that with an fwd layout the only option is engine in the front
  lotus elise is nice  rwd  mr drivetrain  weights less than miata  has more power than miata
  hit something  replace bodyshell  all cars are bad
  you forget  costs a fuckton more than a miata  much smaller aftermarket  the elise is a very good car but lets not act like it doesnt have its cons
  exotic car  toyota engine  all cars are shit
  not wanting glorious rear engine front wheel drive in your shitbox
  british     all cars are bad
  buy front engine rwd car  drive in reverse  you now have a rear engine fwd shitbox
  implying there even exists such a shitbox  rover worked on some projects but never patented the idea which sucks because it would solve the understeer problem of fwd cars problem is youd have to make sure you can fill the hood with stuff as a result but if they couldnt do it in the mr2

  no indicators  way to out yourself as a busrider no one actually uses indicators in the real world
  none of the things youre bitching about stops a car from being good
  no one inside the us that is
  dont know what they do in the us didnt think anyone there could afford bmws
  not legal in us  body work more like buy another elise
    obsessed
  no im saying that its already been thrashed and violated when you have to redline to overtake a camry your car wont last very long
op probally drives his cars stock
  stop fucking up this board more than it already isnt  u wot
  i think your problem op is that youre letting the memes get to you for instance you wouldnt catch me dead in a miata but you cant deny that the roadster has very good potential once its tuned up and ready to rip  i personally recommend finding a beatup shitbox regardless of what it is just has to fit the technical requirements and restoring it into a drift missile drag monster whatever  at least thats what i plan to do after i get an actual house
97 toyota corolla
    nd miata i got one    sure some people say its gay basically only otist on here    in real life though everyone just sees a fun nimble 2 seat convertible get a bunch of random compliments from women and car dudes also women love to ride in it     aside from all that the car itself is alot of fun to drive and toss around the car weighs 24k so it always feels like your going fast as hell i legitimately want to get a second one probably the abarth 124 which is the same car with a turbo engine
  unreliable
  ignores car in picture
  buying a car with warranty in the first place
  240sx literally the greatest fr car ever made

what are some decentish paying jobs that contain a lot of driving alone
transporter
  race car driver car tester car tuner car journalist delivery boy
  learn how to tune cars
medical device sales
bank robbing
    professional tuners hardly ever drive the cars outside of the dyno
  dealership lot techs drive all the cars to the car wash when theyre sold and also deliver cars to other dealerships
  funeral director
  truck driver
drug dealer
lot porter for dealerships ours just kinda hang around 90 of the time trying to look busy but outside of standing around theyre constantly driving to and from the city and also running errands around town
  dealership salesman from what ive heard some dealerships salesmen drive the cars in stock to and from home to promote them etc
have known people that worked as test drivers they would drive at full throttle for 8 hours a day   sounds boring after desu
sleepers
  those are the mose hateful peice of shit cars ive ever worked on or driven theyre so basic and simple and slow af but still break in stupid ways and the owners never want to actually fix them because they only spent 600 on craigslist for it and budgeted as if it would never have a single problem
  i have a 49 willys with a 327 small block swap but its not much to look at i would probably get teased if i posted it
goatest sleeper to ever sleeper
its amazing how much being beat by a late 90s stock buick pisses off ricers
  this 230hp and 280tq plus a few cheap simple mods will bump that up a whole lot
transverse v8
transit ecoboost  nobody suspect a van
  do it for me i love classic cars and v8s
  sleeper
this doesnt count does it
060 in 7 seconds  sleepers    then this is a supercar at under 6 lol
  did you see the op     also mps are sleepers thats the 23l awd turbo version
all these cars apart from the carlton and the merc are sleepers in the sense that they make you fall asleep because theyre so slow lol
inb4 daytona gets posted
  babbys first v6      no more faster than an accord or camry
  tfw thats an elantra not a sonata
  no more fasterer
  my mistake familia not up on my early 2000s gook shitboxes but still 138 hp whopping 10 more than a civic or corolla
  these cars are so shit my friend has one although it is a manual the clutch slips in every gear when you accelerate fast and his front passenger strut is blown so when you push down on it it wobbles so bad
this
  this  new pickups especially chevys have sports car engines theyre just detuned
08 rav4
  theyre not super fast but the v6s were the fastest car in toyotas lineup for a time
  the diesels are quick as shit too they can tow 25k lbs and still do 60 in under 6
  also the fx35 and volvo 850r
  yeah the 53l sure is a sports cars engine you might actually be retarded
  i dont get it i drive an 03 with a 20 its not fast at all just light in what way does it sleep
have an 05 and on the 1 in a million chance this helps someone    if you have weird hesitation shit stall when you hit the gas from a stop revving when you let off the gas on the freeway    check / swap the tps i am a dumbass and couldnt figure this out for a long time and drove me mad
  53 with a set of injectors and10psi  youd never see it coming till it passed you
  have an 03 will keep this in mind thank you
  the 62 in the silverado is pretty damn close to the 62 in the vette and camaro
does this count
  why is that better than the twin turbo straight six id rather have the six they both have a glass tranny though
  yeah id say its fringe but they dont have a massive following anymore
  arent those two tons they just look so awkward with that tall greenhouse
  how quick are those
amg/m/rs wagons plus these are actually fast unlike the shitboxes itt
  yeah but a amg is kinda supposed to be fast
  luxury sport sedan with custom tailored aero kit rims badges etc even the stock ones are assumed to be fast based on price alone  sleeper    do you read or do you not know what a sleeper is
  do you mean base models when saying stock those take more then 10 sec to 60mph do not know how that is close to fast also it is hard for normies to differentiate    often quite hard to see of it is an amg especially when debadged and for normies
  next you are going to call an e55 amg a sleeper
    this so much this previous owner got it up to 380hp this thing shits on most cars but even just going down to a 34 inch supercharger pulley and nothing else will net you a pretty nice power gain for really cheap im looking at upgrading my suspension in the spring
  060 in 7 seconds with the 35l ecoboost
  i mean for a van its quick
  its faster than a subaru brz
  only a retard would call that a sleeper
  again only a fucking mong would call any of those 3 a sleeper
  faster than a brz  smarter than a downie
  he said assumed to be fast based on price by normies    a fucking sleeper is something that doesnt remotely look fast or powerful but will surprise the shit out of you    ie if you see a fucking rs6 avant then you dont think oh i bet thats slow especially not when youll probably hear the fucking sound of it 5 seconds before you see it
  for example this is a sleeper
  us n owners know all about that life
  why did you misspell baby i know its a meme it stupid
  i didnt sage
  honesty stock they werent anything special just a lot of mod potential
  maybe in yurop where people actually know what a lotus carlton is just looks like another old sedan to a burger
this just might be the most soulless piece of shit thing ive ever seen rip gearhead culture it was nice knowin ya
soul is the italian word for slow and unreliable
  no its italian
soulless  you misspelled less slow
  its not dying its just changing the ones that are left dying on the ones that refuse to change with it
  its like youve never looked at the bland ass cars of the 80s and 90s
thats a coupe not a roadster
  as soulles as any modern sports car or supercar
    200000 car  for gearhead culture
  fast as shit  clean minimalist design    why am i supposed to hate this again
  alfa would make perfect cars except for their automatic fetish
  manual is outdated trash
  its a targa
  tsticklet
  only reasonanle poster here
  then dont buy it   there will be manual gas cars and motorcycles available until the end of our lifetimes in some form  car enthusiasm isnt about to go away just because theres a new widely available powertrain with different vroom vroom sounds

  i wanna look cool
  this  why did you move from a gti to a 550 xdrive kids  why not a m2 or m3
why do people here call the golf gti the vw gti they make other gtis lads
  could be more practical   also the 550 f10 is still a v8 i think
  have you stopped using turn signals yet
the n63 is one of the most unreliable engines ever
your new car has a nicer color and wheels  thats the only positive thing i have to say
how you feeling after compensating for small dick

  the mazda3 wins simply because it has a na 25 and traditional automatic transmission if you choose the manual you should youre still getting the most powerful engine the corolla will have a middle ground between the honda and mazda engines the camry also shits on the mazda6 and accord

shares all your data with the chinese
  who else sells electrics in china  they will all do it too instead of pulling out  none of them care about your privacy
post yfw your car listens and probably watches you
    if america was smart theyd send the chinks corrupted data and falsified reports so that when they start using the cars they all catch on fire and explode and burn millions of chinks to death i know its like swatting at bees coming out of a massive hive but every few million still count
  chinas cars already do that though
  fucking lightpole shot still gets me
  optimus nooooooooo
  fords did it too in burgerstan
    yeah but this way theyll just be timebombs they wont need to crash into anything    just imagine if one detonated in the middle of something like webm related all of those cars would explode in succession just like in my vidya
  holy shit that nigga died 3 times what a way to go
  fuckers are too stupid to get out of accident zone    a nation of fucking npcs arent they

whats not to love  pure drivers machines no nannies  fun dune buggyesque vehicles   durable can take large jumps  can switch between rwd and awd  can be made street legal in many states/countries with a simple kit  tons of aftermarket support  growing market overall  raceready stock  fast enough to compete with rally cars on the stages   ive been getting more and more into powersports vehicles and im in love with utvs now anybody here have/want one how fun are they the only issue is that some of them are pretty pricey but theyre not too bad when used especially considering what youre getting
  seriously how does this shit not look fun  
whats not to love  no manual transmission  not a deal breaker but a con when it isnt an option  these things only have 1000cc engines  are the power to weight ratios good
  this has a 5 speed sequential and a 105k rpm 150hp engine
  the yxz has a manual the new talon that got announced last night has paddles and lack of a manual isnt a deal breaker for me cvts are fine but belt slippage/wear is an issue and power to weight is their specialty
  the yxz also has a paddle version
one of these new can cost as much as a good project vehicle while being less capable off road they can go fast but id rather be able to go over rocks and up anything than just go fast off road
ive got a 2014 polaris rzr 1000 turbo i got for graduation its really great ive got the kit so i can drive it around town and i have a dirt track to run it on
my friends grandpa had a kawasaki mule we would raise hell in and even flooded once newer engine made it faster by 10 mph bringing it to 25 mph max god high school was fun times     also i prefer a quad just more control and skill needed plus seems like all sxs owners are douchebags when you go riding on public land like theyre entitled to where they ride because they have something more expensive than a quad       i heard via forums full of boomers that riding on the street fucks up the suspension thats meant for off roading glad you can use yours in town sounds like good mpg all around
those things are cancer for people who dont know how to ride retards dig giant trenches in trials with them by just holding the throttle wide open on hills and slick terrain and endlessly spinning up the tires plus theyre slow as shit and block my way theyre also so wide they take up the whole trail so youre boned if one is coming at you around a blind corner
  i can adjust the suspension stiffness for road driving and i have a set of wheels wrapped in a/t street tires so i think that might solve any issues
  4wheelers with a roll cage  why not get a superior vehicle like a buggie or if you need that lift get a toyota pick up any year
  you know what you never hear about repairs on offroad vehicles i remember doing general maintenance on my old dirt bike and fucking the shit up off cliffs and 30 foot drops and all sorts of abuse all it needed was an oil change    what are modern day offroading vehicles like do they justify their base honda civic price tags
  you definitely gotta pay to play if you drive the shit out of these youre going to break and wear out parts you better learn to fix shit yourself or pay a dealer 200 an hour to do it for you they definitely cost more than a dirtbike to maintain
if you live in the philadelphia area youd know that nov 11th or so was a complete shitshow 3 inches of snow and no plows and everyone in their awd shitbox crossovers just start crashing and sliding all over my manual civic did just fine are people just retarded
  normies unironically think that awd is a replacement/substitute for good winter tires
thats what snow does 3 in in ny and everything was a shitshow too
  snow driving takes skill and most people are fucking brain dead when it comes to driving even here in the great white fucking north people always fuck up everytime we get a major snowfall
cant wait till it snows big and everything shuts down gonna wide open throttle drift myself to youtube fame baby
  but you see i just have generic all seasons i feel like knowing how to minimize wheel spin and using engine braking as much as possible so in a auto selecting 12 instead of d would be tremendously helpful
i think its a combination of technologic safety advancement reliance further removing thought and skill from the process and the fact that driving instruction is a thing you need to pass instead of needing to learn
my friends    they do think this girl in my class once told everyone to turn on our awd before a snowstorm weird that thotties expect technology to save them just like theyre carried by orbiters and thirsty betas they dont understand that driving is a skill and no amount of awd will give you that power of skill awd will not help them their lack of knowledge being their demise darwins theories work well here the ignorant die while the intelligent survive i hope the normies never learn and snow can remain an event for the truly enlightened
  skill is a gap that people need to learn there are many people in this world some innately intelligent some not but it all comes down to the depth induviduals decide themselves to delve into a topic i might be a shit baker who only makes boxed brownies with a little weed but i might be really knowledgeable about cars some other person might be the opposite brownie god and car ignoramus it all depends on the community dont exclude people your goal is to get the normies on board with you teach them about how awd sucks ass dont yell about it who do car companies make their cars for the general populace normies these people buying their cars is how they make money you have to get normies along board with your kinda cars because stuff like the chevy ss doesnt sell and the kia stinger doesnt sell you need to get people on board with the ss with the stinger thats how we get good cars back if you can convince normies that ice is still relevant if you convince them that manual is better on mpg and more reliable and cheaper theyll get on board with you got my cousin on board with manual and he loves his 1991 civic now get them on board with cars and car knowledge and we can grow the car industry bring back soul to automobiles delete crossover hell and bring back the cool cars of the 1920searly 2000s you wont convince someone of your idea being better by being an asshole to them you have to present it as being favorable for them you guys are so autistic this is basic shit im autistic and this is basic shit stop yelling at normies for being dumb and teach them the solution the joke that normies are dumb is worn out by now we need progress not laughing on our worn jokes just to feel the slight dopamine of insulting someone circlejerking that were better of course we are we have the knowledge we wont win by excluding the people without that knowledge educate dont discriminate high edh out
  jesus christs
    i was around lansdale and royersford in a transit connect for work couldnt believe that the pa natives were so terrible didnt get stuck once
half of people say come on motherfucker its just snow speed up you should be going the speed limit fucking idiots driving like grannies because of a little weather
    basically me and i am 100 unashamed to admit it if you cant handle snow get the fuck off the roads
  oh
  mustang in front of me was fishtailing like mad and ripped its bumper off on a truck ahead of me almost shit myself laughing
  your time will come
  i live in nh where you would think people are used to winter driving by now  i rock worn out all seasons in a fwd shitbox that has questionable abs    and yet somehow the people who spin out and crash on the highway every snowstorm are the dudebro lifted trucks
  wide tires are terrible in wet conditions theres a reason winter tire rims are narrower also trucks have poor weight distribution and a high center of gravity
  fucking this retards dont understand physics
  for every pickup in the ditch i see i see 5x more crossovers and fwds with winter tires being over confident is still safer than white knuckling it at 10 the speed limit when its barely wet out
  tl dr  unsubscribe please
  awd or 4wd certainly help get things rolling but you can only stop so fast i suspect the fwd cars and crossovers you see in the ditch are driven by women who dont understand physics
  nothing is as helpful as proper winter tires and not being retarded    seriously buy some blizzacks or xi3s
  almost all people are incredibly stupid
  richmond learns to park
  with that thinking youre going to be the same people you talk about
  how so i left my civic in 2nd3rd the whole time i did just fine if you can let the drivetrain do the braking as much as possible do it reason being that it should be perfectly even braking force vs the calipers which can vary between them all
just got done painting my car what does /o/ think    inb4 dull   im wet sanding in the morning and buffing afterwards
  some kind of lexus in flamboyant nigger lime  congratulations on your wonderful life choices
burbillac  excop charger  laughable mcmansion in the background  hows life 30 y/o upper middle class boomer
  27 and own everything i have but how do you like the color
open door  jambs arent painted  painters face when
tasteless sums up the whole image
lol why is /o/ so salty no one else is posting cars even
  looks shit  should have gone for green pearl or whatever its called
  who is salty in this thread op asked for opinions and hes getting them he also didnt ask for people to post their cars
  yeah that ricer shit doesnt fit the sc
    what cars do you both own
  im the better person because i own more stuff
  im sure itll come out nice but it isnt for me too flamboyant the sc and older lexus were always meant to be reserved in appearance
  looks pretty good your first job  is that the dodge green mean green i dont remember the name newer challenger/chargers have it
    wtf are you even talking about
  how much did it cost you to paint it my shitbox needs a paintjob badly
  sc looks like shit in that fnf ricer eclipse green
  t bus rider      i almost went with a maroon i agree 100 but this is going to have te37s and a bcl wing so i just full sent    first paint i have dipped cars before ill post more in the morning after wetsand
  110ish for tools tape and paint
  not op here but avid shitbox painter a can of rustoleum black and paint thinner from lowes some sandpaper/masking tape and a spray gun from amazon and you should be able to paint a car for less than 200 if its orangepeely just wetsand and buff
  maroon wouldve been nice with some bronze or gunmetal te37s a subtle black lip too but if youre going full out with a wing i think itll look good either way some cars can be ridiculous in a good way
  t 30 y/o consumer boomer
  sounds good anon is it a sc400 or 300   and if 300 manual  thatd be epic
putting a giant gt wing on a fucking sc  guess this is what you do when you cant afford a supra
  wasnt the supra for people who couldnt afford the sc preff
  what does that have to do with you painting your car bile green
  ex police charger painted blue  rattlecan lime green sc  escalade with missing hubcaps  mcmansions  this screams houston to me
  yes    you know nothing g about cars and it shows    its a 400 with a fresh 1uz rebuild going to cd009 swap one of these days
   yeah i figured that guy was wrong as hell the 93 supra turbo retailed 2k less than a 93 sc400
  thats pretty sick i dont love autos but i loved my ls400 wish i could find a nice sc in my area
  you could have spent 1200 dollars and had a real paint job that didnt look like total ass and take you dozens of hours of work and a couple hundred dollars  you live and you learn i guess youll feel much better after its repainted for the second time  unless you laid that paint on thicc there is no amount of sanding and polishing that is going to make that look half decent      the dude painted an ancient undesireable out side of a handfull of weeaboos toyota lime green with rattle cans  hes a fucking moron someone doesnt have to own something you consider good to point that out
  such is life for the semi successful dry wall hanger
  you cannot make enough money to afford to rent a shit hole in niggers ville if youre hanging drywall for a living  hanging drywall is entry level fresh over the border spic work if youre finishing drywall you can afford to live but not that lavishly
for the life of me i cant figure out how to get a shine on my paint it looks flat everytime i do it
  what if he doesnt have the cash to pay someone else whats wrong with manning it up and doing your own work  also a 1200 paint job from who maaco   not sure how you thatd be better most shops that do bodywork/paint have 50100 hourly rate
op it looks fine and if you are happy with it then you do you       you seem like that stancefag from the other thread trying to pass his shitbox as art
  i think maybe youre putting in too much hardener   but just a cheap ultra gloss should cover that fine
  oh shit my bad i meant budding septic tank cleaning entrepreneur
  nah im using acryllic based paint not 2 pack
  what paint did you use    would cheap car paint give a better result than rustoleum id be willing to pay a bit more for a far better result
  you sound salty bus rider man
  looks good man ignore the fags
  yes though rustoleum isnt like unbearable   shermanwilliams has an automotive department in a lot of cities their inhouse brand of paint is very affordable and ive had excellent luck with   they can usually make whatever color you ask for metallics and single stage too       as long as op sprayed 3 coats wetsanding with some 1000 should turn out fine
  if you have those cars and that house you should be able to come up with the measly sum to get it painted and i didnt say to get the body work done somewhere if you dont have the tools space and mind to spray it hvlp then its pointless to paint it yourself its a giant waste of money that will destroy the value of the vehicle    im all for people doing things themselves i paint panels for my self but i dont have a big enough garage to shoot an entire car so i dont if im getting a car painted i send it off to maaco which are all independent shops they all just fly the same banner and buy the same products your maaco may not hire competent painters    buy once cry once applies here ive had enough experience to know this
  i used krylon neon green rattle cans with metallic dust to make it insta dry
  i could easily afford a 3 stage full paint job well into 5k but whats the fun in that this is a hobby go day dream somewhere else fag
  if i can tell in this photo that its a mess that dried before it hit the panel hes going to have to start with 400 work his way all the way up to 3000 then cut and polish for even a small glimmer of hope of it looking decent which if he didnt lay it on heavy enough will just burn right through the paint thats going to take upwards of 40 man hours to correct by hand and thats assuming hes competent based on the paint job i doubt he is  also his solvent suspended paint isnt up to the task of being exposed to the elements the adhesion will fail and the acidity of the rain and the chemicals on the road will absolutely trash it hell have adhesion problems within the first year
  so rather than spending 100 on a cheap hvlp gun and 300 on some single stage you spent 150 on rattle cans and ruined the car  nice hobby
  based      btfod
  seething
   only spent 40 on paint     tyler    itt  people with opinions and 15 year old that have zero experience
  oh nice theres a sherwin williams near me would i be able to paint it outside in 40 weather or would i have to wait until spring/set up a booth thanks for the advice by the way    damn that looks really good for a rattlecan job
    its not 1993 anymore sorry
  no even cold weather hardners and ratios are only good down to 50degree but youre best off painting at around 80 degrees  the colder it is when you paint even if youre using the correct material the more likely you are to get solvent pop  i personally like ppg but thats just from me having the most experience shooting it      youre an idiot
  uhhh ive done it before and it did not turn out super well usually the paint turns out rougher   if you can paint in a garage or car cover with some space heaters that should help  just purchase some drop plastic from sherman williams and drape it around the car cover or on the stuff in your shop   you can find more info about this in guides online
                same fag but also    not posting your own car and/or own work    jesus fucking bus riding christ you have to be 15 if op is happy with the color and your not happy with the color that ones thing thats an opinion but talking shit on how he gets his work done on what looks to be just a secondary car is just fucking sad without posting any any of your own work talk is fucking cheap kiddo fucking nu/o/ is garbage to an extreme old /o/ was just autistic thank god i have a real job and dont have to fucking take out a 24 interest loan because i cant afford a 2k 91 rusted miata fucking kys and do something real with your life     tldr    show proffs that ur not a bus riding fag

  kek u still can do nothing but talk haha hope it happy with the options of one day your grandma dying and you get her 1994 buick or riding the bus
  a lot of those are me because we were having a conversation    i also dont need to show my work because im not making any extraordinary claims  ops job is objectively bad i dont even care about his abysmal taste and color choice  he did a bad job with bad materials    talking shit on how he gets his work done on what looks to be just a secondary car  i dont do shitty work on my secondary cars aka nondds  i try not to do shitty work on any of my vehicles  and yes i will call him out on doing things improperly to the point where it would have been better if he had just left it alone    what i own what i do who i am how much money i have those are all irrelevant to this conversation  i could be 15 i could have 12 i could own nothing and i could be frosty none of that would matter what i am saying is comparative to an absolute its objective op did a shitty job and is doing mental gymnastics to defend himself against criticism when he came here for criticism

  also  reddit spacing
  to hurt someones feelings or offend someone you have to actually say something that applies to them that theyre not delusional about  throwing a drag net might prove successful in some areas youre on /o/ there are a million catch all you could throw to try to hurt our feelings but youre so new you dont even know what they are youre trying to use the same garbage you use everywhere else and its just plain wrong    curious what kind of car you drive m88 id guess youre bretty insecure about it
  thats not reddit spacing those are paragraphs those are complete ideas being separated by a blank line    this is reddit spacing    where every line has a blank line inbetween    just because some people format their writing more than your average spic    doesnt mean theyre le reddit spacing    reddit is for browns gays and gen z shit skins
  well considering im op you can see what im driving kek also   tydr  just the last part    your still doing it
  primary colours    how very boring
  iq 85 confirmed
  thats not a primary color m8  inb4 rgb
looks like shit op
it was fun everyone ill post more while im wet sanding and buffing tomorrow
is that what dads money looks like
  yeah the colors a bit too much something that would look nice on a civic not so much the lexus you got there a darker colour or a brilliant pearlescent white would have worked better    does anyone know what the code for the blue lexus uses on the lc500 is iirc its an optional colour at extra charge it looks absolutely amazing shoulda got that op
  o god op did you do that on purpose
  no this is what your tax money looks like
  are you trying to turn your car into a pepe meme

why does every 4th person in colorado drive this car
snow
muh 4wd reliability   its one giant circlejerk about how they are real outdoorsy people etc
  women cant drive armadas denalis excursions hummers f250s or anything for that matter
  because its cheap its a real awd and its a good car
  i test drove one of these last year it was actually pretty nice for what it was i went with a truck instead because of the things i carry but i would consider the crosstrek for a vehicle for the wife when she wants a new one
bought car in september  dealer said title will be mailed to my address  dealer said registration will be mailed to my address  its november now    registration arrived today with the title number but still no title in the mail     should i keep waiting is this unusually long pa resident
did you buy it outright or are you financing it pa is a lienholder holding state which means the lienholder holds the title until its paid off
  oh okay that makes sense yeah its financed thanks so much i was worried
fun fact  not a single janny on this board has a drivers license one is a furry and another one is from /co/ and has a diaper fetish
fuck niggers and fuck jannies
  another one is from /co/ and has a diaper fetish  do you have their contact information by chance
im not even surprised lol
  he does it for free  he does it for freeeee  his name is janny  and he does it for free
  that explains why moderation is fucking garbage then
jannies are fucking cuckolds
if the jannies did their jobs i wouldnt hate them   nsfw shitposting that plagues the board is allowed to stay for several hours   get instantly banned for a get post
  this  fuck joos too
  make that 2
fuck jannies they are fucking killing the boards by deleting actual on topic shit and closing their eyes on whatever please them or dont do shit at all on some board sad blokes
youre saving up right /o/
glorified bmw that looks like shit too  eat shit toyota kike
  sure   but not for that
that things fucking ugly dude     post a pic of the rear
toyotas and hondas are visually repulsive and are for people who view cars as a to b appliances buying an expensive sports car from these brands does not make sense because no one will be impressed by your utterly hideous overpriced peoplemover
ftl bruh
yes
    keep hating on the supragang pal
60k a year salary  i could technically afford it but financially itd be a moronic decision
  for a supra  fuck yeah  a 2019 one  oh hell no it would take more than i make in two years to buy one id be fucking insane to do that because id be saving until im in my early 40s or paying off a loan until sometime in my late 40s and neither of those sound like fun    ill just shoot for my early 80s supra for now maybe if i can get a better job ill try though
  hell yeah im buying it cash
  why would anyone get this over a m2
  implying that /o/ can afford a new car that isnt a mirage
  it looks like its disgusted
a z4 in a brz bodykit  uhh nah
front bumper has a beak and wannabe 458 winglets inside a bmw lower grill a mishmash  windows do not follow contour of roofline at all entire thing looks disjointed double bubble roof only exacerbates visual discontinuity  overly bulbous fender arches that extend into hoodline that someone probably thought would be a cool call out to a silhouette racer but coupled with the beak makes it look like the car is trying to hold in a sneeze  thin spoke wheels on such a chunky design dont go with any other design cue other than a lazy way to visually tie the car to the gt86    this thing is a fucking mess
  because it comes with a stick shift
  i saw one recently in munich  but im really not interested in new cars
nope just put a lot of cash into my old shitbox
  ill buy a mk4 supra and call it good new one can suck my bleeding butthole
    its a big upgrade from the last one
    i enjoy the melted soapbox look
  i enjoy whatever that hideous thing is
  if i wanted a bmw id just buy a bmw
  toyotas and hondas what
looks italian
  so does the m2 dumbass and in fact its not even confirmed yet if the new supra will have a manual
im a massive whore of a toyota fanboy but no
yes supragang
    buying new cars  just the initial write off from buying the car is going to be a bigger loss than what my current car cost
i just want an sfr  ill preorder one the day its announced provided they can get it to around 20k aud
  i enjoy the veiny thrombosed dick look
  i highly doubt that the m2 comes with a stickshift considering that its a modern bmw but ill look into it
  fag
  yeah im saving up but not for that thing   what a fucking downgrade from the original concept
  it only takes 5 seconds to google it you dumb lazy cocksucker
  he said hed look into it anon
  oui
smol
  only comes in auto  the definition of wasted potential
ill stick with my better in every category rx8
sorry but ive just gotta vent for a minute so i graduated from a prestigious uni with a bba almost 3 years ago my dad owned two mercedes benz dealerships and he passed down the one with lower sales volume to me when i graduated im 25 now and i always figured by this age i would be making at least a quarter mil annually unfortunately i only made just shy of 190k last year ive set commission caps for our sales representatives and the technicians are already being paid as low as tangibly possible so theres really no further cost cutting i can do to divert funds to my salary i hate that im giving up 32hours of my life per week for a middling salary i literally cant even afford to drive the cars i sell when i first started the job back in 2015 i bought a 2012 mercedes c350 but it kept breaking down on me and thus wasnt viable as a daily driver at this point i had to replace it with a preowned 2016 lincoln navigator in addition to my 2009 pontiac g8 which i have as a soft core performance vehicle its humiliating i feel pathetic here i am living off the scraps of my customers pulling up in an american luxury car to my own mercedes benz dealership i just feel pathetic as a mercedes benz dealer i should be driving a gclass no problem to make matters worse a friend of mine from college is making more than me he double majored in finance and economics and is making over 220k annually as a corporate investment banker he was always intelligent so i expected hed do well but not as well as me he just didnt carry himself well you know yet here i am being outpaced by this slouchy pos im just so incredibly frustrated like literally pulling my hair out every time i think about it
  the way the camo disguises all the weird shapes makes it look fucking amazing its a shame really
  unfortunately i only made just shy of 190k last year ive set commission caps for our sales representatives and the technicians are already being paid as low as tangibly possible so theres really no further cost cutting i can do to divert funds to my salary i hate that im giving up 32hours of my life per week for a middling salary  this some new pasta you sound awful
flying roof  why  that black line on the roof  why  the whole of front nose  why
  why did they stray so far away from the ft1     how did they fuck up the proportions so badly on the a90
  well it has paddles but yeah im waiting for it to come out in manual  hopefully it sells like cake so alpine gets more funding to get the best tranny
  why save up when you can finance it

how can these parts be so much cheaper  its actually cheaper for me to buy new control arms than to buy new name brand ball joints  are these parts just garbage  how can they sell a pair of control arms for 65 bucks
  china
amazon subsidizes to lower cost of expensive parts with their profits
    limited markup i was a tech at a napa autopro and fucking hell some stuff at napa is marked up crazy i did a vw oilpan and alternator at home for someone napa wanted 450 for the oilpan and a few hundred for a reman alternator i got the same oilpan for 70 on rockauto and a brand new alternator on amazon for 180
  i got an estimate from a goodyear repair facility to do ball joints  tie rods and a cv axle and it was almost 2 fucking grand  the parts if i go with amazon are going to be about 200 bucks  what the fuck
    the autopro i worked at was 160 cad an hour labour and my boss marked up parts from napa if he tossed in all the bs like an alignment from changing tie rods etc it would come out to probably 2k for all that stuff its a ripoff lol
  why are you upset about saving 1800
the markup on the parts at most stores and specially the dealership and shop is outrageous i used to be autozone commercial and we had our purchase price pennies our sell to the repair shop price dollars and their sell to the customer price hundreds when you consider a lot of stuff is cores remanned by people in china for 5 cents a day the profits grow its a little cheaper for the customer to come buy at the store directly but autozone still makes a huge profit and yes we sold parts to the dealership all the time so buying it from toyota or whatever youre getting duralast then mark up the labor 10x and your in business im currently a technician now and it goes something like this   get work order for front end overhaul   like 400 dollars in parts at shop cost for everything and 3 hours of labor at my pay of 1450  total actual price 44350 for shop plus tax   customer invoice 1400 parts 3 hours labor at 190 an hour   customer estimate 1970  total profit 152650
  the labor is much more expensive than the parts
  i am worried the no name parts will be of poor quality
  most oem parts are just rebranded chinesium
  even on american cars
  more so on american cars
  i dont mind paying labor but the jack you so hard on the parts  those places are not putting in any better of parts than the chinesers and they want 5 times as much or often way more
  how can these parts be so much cheaper  amazon and ebay do not guarantee the authenticity of the parts they are sales platforms connecting sellers with buyers thats why parts that were rejected or outoftolerance specs by the original chinese factory might be reprocessed and sold by a different seller on amazon
  99 of repair shops are run by shiesty slimeballs what else is new
  this cant be true  is it  i dont think even they could afford to do that for long
  costco is building a 200 million dollar chicken factory just to sell chicken at a loss it happens all the time
i paid a place to repair my fuel pump on a ranger for 150 and they wwanted 150 for the fuel pump so i got one at autozone for 75 and had them put it in    it failed 3 months later and they had charged me 150 to replace it again becuase it wasnt a part from their source and autozone parts suck and break
  most products sold via the amazon are not purchased by amazon as their own inventory stock many 3rd party companies are the ones that purchase inventory and have amazon as the customer aggregator and shipping fulfillment center thus the low prices for the same item can vary a great deal at amazon and thats why you often see multiple vendors of the same thing    if its purchased by amazon and resold by amazon then it should say by amazon in the description
  then it should say by amazon in the description  are those parts higher quality
  this at my shop markup was 150 fucking ridiculous rack and pinions regularly sold for 700
  this is the issue with bringing your own parts it saves money but the shops know this so they take away the warranty if you try it claiming its never installation error but the part you brought them
  shouldve bought it at oreillys
  lots of places will not even let you bring parts at all
  amazon has been selling shit at break even or a loss for 20 years the only truly profitable part of their business is aws
  this is exactly why i stopped taking my car to the stealership for repairs and started learning to wrench on my own
re dealership prices i work parts at a stealership in ausfailia the markup on genuine parts is not usually that high around 3040 on average this is a pretty standard margin across a lot of retail sectors so dont get butthurt and goes lower on higher priced parts the problem here is i buy it off a warehouse in my city who marks it up they bought it off a warehouse somewhere else in the country who marked it up they bought it off the distributor into australia who marked it up do you see where this is going this is the official channel so yes the manufacturer js to blame but im not making 200 on parts if i need a cheap part i just get one from a euro parts mob that buys it straight from the factory i can get genuine water pumps for like a 3rd of the cost of going through the brand    tldr too many links in the chain dealerships at least here dont make that much off you    oh then theres the additives experience which is 99 pure profit and 99 a total scam but thats service department
so the cheapo japo parts are as good as any others
  only has to happen till they crush the competition
  not sure if this thread is bait there are few auto parts makers out there a lot of factory stuff is the same shit sold at oreillys or online there are some parts makers who legit use shit material and shit welds making the part useless but any big manufacturer likely supplies oem and aftermarket shit we have found oem logos withouth the name on tons of oreillys/auto zone stuff think like the ford circle but it doesnt say ford yet or the nissan logo but it doesnt say nissan yet its all the same chink shit
  i dont think even they could afford to do that for long  literally how they built their empire my dude
  190 hr  what retard is paying 190/hr for labor 85100 is normal in most shops because shops and tools arent free people gotta make money
  what retard is paying 190/hr for labor    anybody that buys something german
  then theres the additives experience which is 99 pure profit and 99 a total scam but thats service department  what do you mean can you please elaborate on this
  what retard is paying 190/hr for labor  the chevrolet stealership here charges 80/hr for the simplest things but most things cost 120/hr if its under the hood my oil pan replacement was at 120/hr should i have contested it that would require a court case if i fail to win i have to pay the stealership court costs and all employee costs needed to attend the court due to the service contract having those imdemnify terms its a family owned chevrolet stealership usually family owned businesses are the greediest
  what is that photo
  nogs in sa with military equipment
  only if you buy cheap ass part brands like moog or ac delco  bosh or denso are still good shit
  we have found oem logos withouth the name on tons of oreillys/auto zone stuff think like the ford circle but it doesnt say ford yet or the nissan logo but it doesnt say nissan yet its all the same chink shit  its like the chinese set up their equipment to counterfeit whatever parts they want many copycat factories spring up with manufacturing equipment and facilities duplicating what the partner factory has its why china is eager to have these partnerships with western companies after the official factory is set up its pretty easy to ignore contracts and create copycat factories to enhance profit cheaper metals and raw materials can be used or shortcuts and instead of rejecting out of tolerance parts for recycling those are sold to third party buyers who then put them up on ebay or amazon marketplace services
  injector clean throttle body clean dpf clean ac service etc if a service advisor ever calls you and says the tech noticed carbon buildup in the x its a scam and tell them to fuck off
  1450 an hour for wrenching  customer cost 190/he    what the fuck most shops ive gone to have charged 80100 an hour and the tech got at least 30 of it depending on seniority
  cheap ass part brands like moog or ac delco  b but i thought those were the good brands
  bosch  good shit  they do make the best paper weights also ftfy
    how the fuck are you going to contest a labor rate dont like it gtfo
i buy about 45000 worth of car parts on amazon every year havent really had any problems with anything ive gotten had a dud ball joint once but that was it
    i work at a shop that specializes in german cars we do mercedes bmw porsche were also right near the beach in southern california so cost of living drives the price up not justifying just telling you how it is were cheaper than the dealership by a bit though so we get a lot of traffic im just an uncertified apprentice thats why i get 1450 my boss gets 59 dollars an hour and thats after taking 1450 out of his to pay me his bitch
  do you do a lot of suspension work  have you used dlz or prime choice auto   how about mechapro 
  do he say money pit machines  thats what i would say all the time if i was a mercedes mech
bump
would it be possible to build an entire car out of parts ordered on amazon  just bit by bit until you have the whole thing
  would it be possible to build an entire car out of parts ordered on amazon  you have to obtain the chassis part with the valid vin which has not been submitted for salvage thus the make and model of the car you choose to build is limited by that part
  supposedly a supply clerk did that in wwii with a willys jeep
  good parts are forged   cheap parts are stamped   now you know
  what did he mean by this
  for you
  probably but it would be very expensive parts cost more bit by bit not to mention you have to pay for shipping    best bet is to buy a car that is mostly there the most expensive parts are the little parts that add up bolt here bolt there nut here nut there
  i hear ya i priced out a set of kmc district 20s and tires for my daily came out to 1600 for shits i checked amazon assembled same everything for 1100 the difference is so extreme
is power stop a good oem replacement
  good parts are forged  cheap parts are stamped  the word forged for chinese products is allowed to be used with cast parts that are hit once by a stamping press this singular forging strike technically qualifies the export market part in china to be forged as a result the definition strength of forged is pretty weak when it comes to chinesemade forged parts
  wjat the fuck is forged
  moog suspension components are top tier for nip cars at least
  as in forged metal versus cast metal
  forged and cast are the same thing
  amazon has been selling shit at break even or a loss for 20 years  then itll get even worse when their workers get together to make protests in one amazon warehouse center about 20 football fields in size they hired a lot of immigrant muslims amazon has work quantity targets for their employees for their work shift the muslims take prayer breaks which ended up lowering their productivity compared to people whose work shifts didnt have prayer breaks they claimed amazon was discriminatory
  it means that they stole an idea and reproduced it very common in china
  most days can have a lot of sitting on the clock time in a slow region so your average is lower than the billable plus the overhead of the shop works out to be a not super profitable business youd make more money getting a decent restaurant franchise or real estate license i buy sell manage and maintain rental houses now and make over twice what i used to  t former owner operator
  cast is molten metal pour into a mold forging is hammering it into a mold
  forged means fake like a signature
  so some people itt say they are good and others say bad  this planet sucks
  its not like china has print shops that would dare to print us bank notes would such money be considered to be cast or forged
  damn chinos  trump will fix em
  how can these parts be so much cheaper  go to alibaba for lower prices    youll find companies there advertising original oem products the products are stated to be official or genuine even genuine rota wheel rims are sold there
  genuine  rota    i am full from all the bait
  i dont get it
  i dont get it  elitists only like the 1000 msrp or higherpriced rims thus they attack affordable rota as being trash     rota makes rims that are used by track racers and rims that are also used by everyday car drivers they are not resellers but manufacture their rims out of raw materials they inspect the raw metal billets before use because you cant risk your company reputation on suppliers using bait and switch quality tactics    rota doesnt distribute via alibaba so all those chinese pirate good sellers and chinese pirated goods distribution companies advertising there are lying when they say it is genuine rota rota actually publishes the list of official distributors on their website
  so its a knock off of a knock off  diabolical
  rota is the chinese pirate good seller
  rota is the chinese pirate good seller  no rota is a phillipines company it is not chinese although multiple chinese companies make knockoff copies of rota wheels       official rota distributors are listed at the rota website contact the rota distributor in your area to get a list of authorized resellers if you prefer local service and local warranty with your wheels    list of official rota distributors      rota tests its rims and also has its own metal laboratory for studying the raw material alloys it gets they perform various tests on rims and also examine the metal grain from each batch they also test a rim from each batch to destruction to verify the manufacturing process and machinery continues to create wheels with the expected durability    how rota rims are made      even rotas home market gets counterfeits      rotas generic warning about counterfeits  
  found the rota employee
  forged and cast are the same thing  no    picture shows a chinese made knockoff copy its never a pretty sight to see crystalline aluminum cracks straight across like glass instead of tearing or bending a bit its like it was a poured casting and then released with no real forging
  simpler answer the original dies still have that manufacturer stamp on it this doesnt account for metallurgy or whether the dies are worn out or copies of the originals
  if its chinese its the same chinese garbage you get at autozone or whatever     amazon has tons of oem parts though for cheap
  they make all their money from prime memberships and aws they lose money on almost everything they sell
  t domingo de la cruz rota employee
  are they messican company
  are they messican company  visit their website to see their history on how the company was created from a partnership between an italian company and a philippines company    
  italian company and a philippines company  this is how mexicans are formed
  are moogs good or no
  its just by amazon    the benefit of that is youre putting your trust in a huge company rather than steve at business x
  i run a small shop and i order so many parts off amazon now i used to buy a lot off rockauto but amazon is just so fucking cheap and ships so fast and arent dicks about returns like rockauto i just got a front driveshaft for a 2008 g37x for 100 fucking dollars 100 fucking dollars the salvage yards all wanted 200 for a fucking used one
  amazon is just so fucking cheap and ships so fast   just got a front driveshaft for a 2008 g37x for 100 fucking dollars    small business owner alexa i want to order a 2008 g37x automobile driveshaft for 100 fucking dollars    alexa please confirm your amazon prime order of 2008 g37x automobile drive shaft four 100 fucking dollars    sbo confirm    alexa thank you anon your order is being processed the item is in stock via amazon prime it will arrive tuesday afternoon     tuesday afternoon arrives     sbo why is this box only 59 centimeters long he runs a metric shop    sbo tears open the packing invoice and reads the blurb from the chinese seller thank you for purchasing the 2008 anniversary edition of the dragon dildo model g37x i can be conveniently mounted on an extension shaft or you can mount it on a silicon pad and sit on it while on a drive in your automobile it comes with four lubrication methods and a universal joint mount should a shaft be used instead of a suction cup
parts shopping on amazon is not easy at all and they have many many miscatagorized part numbers
  because reasons i ended up doing the driveshaft 2 hours away from home in a fucking gravel lot at no more than 37f i should keep trying my luck would much rather fuck myself in the ass with a lead painted g37x dildo than do that again
  did the parts were any good
  driveshaft installed fine and ive had no complaints since atleast i couldnt find anything that looked wrong or chinky upon close inspection    pic related the old driveshaft was fucked cant see in pic behing but it gouged the shit out of the side of the block and wasnt actually connected anymore made a hell of a noise and almost locked the wheels up when taking a turn hence why i ended up doing it there
  china uses shit metal alloys made from recycled pop cans and scrap metal you throw in the recycling can   literally look it up     that crap is ust that cheap crap
  they dont have too look at all the local stores in your town that have closed
  that has not been true in years
  i think amazon makes money through volume not much mark up the same brand and part number of wheel bearing for my buddies truck was 100 cheaper from amazon than the cheapest locally
  100 bucks for a wheel bearing
prime bump
100 apiece for moog 2014 mustang front lower control arms   im tempted to buy them somethings off with my car and i just want new fucking components tie rods  front lower lcas come at me
amazon parts are made by childrens
  sexy children
  anon pls aside from the whole aws amazon operates on a net profit of less than 2 of their revenue its quite literally economies of scale 2 is really fucking low
  99 of repair shops are run by shiesty slimeballs  they cant resist the temptation of how easy it is to scam or steal from the customer and get away with it and the punishments are small and very rare
  amazon operates on a net profit  net profit is a deceptive thing thats because the personal profits of the investors are charged as expenses to the company the employees also get nice wages and significant benefits and 401k matching and that is also charged as expenses thats why many companies are profitable even if they lose money every year with a negative net profit
    thats why its important to go to multiple shops for quotes beforehand and research the average cost of what the repair should be     but so many shops do bullshit like    100/hour labor thats always rounded up  parts markup over 100 of original msrp of part  shop supplies and other bs fees  not bothering to clean things up properly after the job skimping out on cheap shit like tape looming and locktite    and then if you need to file a warranty they make sure something else needs to be fixed as well thats nonunwarrantable thats why they always offer free inspections    and they get away with a lot of price gouging because normie customers like their shuttle services / coffee in the front office and dont want any confrontation    i worked front desk for a independent shop for 6 months and quit after finding something else on one of my last days there it nearly killed me hearing my scumbag boss lie to an old lady in a 2012 corolla with 40k on it telling her that her car is unsafe to carry her grandchildren in because it needed an engine transmission and brake flush all new fluids including differential all new filters and front brakes for a grand total of 1200 which she reluctantly purchased over 3 different credit cards
  cheap gook labor and no labor laws
  most control arms/suspension components cost like 45 cents to produce markup is the most egregious form of jew trickery
  holy fuck that makes me angry as fucking fuck
    i had a fuel pump fail and i bought the cheapest fuel injection pump on amazon for 13 worked like a charm
  should be good for a few weeks
  theres just more competition so prices go down
    already been 6 months even if it blows its a 45 minute job to swap in another 13 part
  dis it have a warrantee
  holy fuck that makes me angry as fucking fuck  a sense of impunity creates corruption  so the next time you see corruption be sure to at least anonymously try to quash it report it or anonymously cast light on it with yelp reviews
  i always do shit like that but i never am able to see such raw examples as what you just described
  i never am able to see such raw examples as what you just described  lots of people dont see any real problems with the society around them it may be they never walk outside of their garden that societys infrastructure has created     how many people driving to tukwila costco never noticed that little alcove park years ago before weed was legalized that was one place to pick up some hard drugs from the mexicans that waited there for day laborer work offers from home depot next door    i am not the poster of any previous corruption posts in this thread but i remember with bitterness about being the witness in a court case against a rich man both the judge and prosecutor were on the defendant rich mans side judges and prosecutors go after rich people but some people are able to offer long term bribes worth more than money the rich man got off despite having evidence and witness against him the case was delayed by the defense during that delay time they tried to intimidate me they also tried to attack my reputation someone was also sent to my home to check around i was just a witness someone there by serendipity to see the crime    its a dirty world out there if you havent experienced the dirt feel grateful for naivity
  made by children  sounds like china where anyone and everyone that can make money goes for the gold
  cheap gook labor and no labor laws  unlike the usa chinese governments are able to own commercial forprofit businesses that of course makes chinese politicians family and cronies rich and powerful so its to be expected the chinese politicians will selectively enforce laws that dont interfere with their personal family and crony wealth
chinese companies arent subject to the usa epa or eu community pollution requirements thats a big savings they also dont have the usa osha laws to follow thats why fire exits on upper floors might simply lead to an outdoor balcony as there is no stairway or ladder down        local governments owns forprofit businesses  sounds like guaranteed corruption in law enforcement must suck if a company competes against the government owned company and the competitor exists in the same municipality heck maybe even that govt company copied all the design secrets        how can these parts be so much cheaper  companies can be owned by governments and even by the chinese army thus generals in the chicom army do run companies as a result there is prisoner labor used in the governmentowned companies quality labor is guaranteed because of punishment if the prisoner slacks off or sabotages the product quality to make it perform badly    no one cares if copying and corruption makes for cheaper products at ebay and amazon
  prisoner labor  this in not a real factor  prison labor does not add up to even 1 percent of production  the japs are just harder workers and smarter that americans are  the chinkey iq average is 106  this is not a big deal till you look at what happens to the bell curve  they have 100 times more geniuses that we have
  the chinkey iq average is 106  they dont have latinos and blacks in their averages but no one can mention iq in the usa because the antidiscrimination activists start screaming bloody murder and accusations at you if you mention anything about iq genetics or ethnic statistics     neighborhood anticrime advocates at city council meetings dont come back more than a few times because the activists watch and key the cars if they show up again by shaping the selection of those who speak out the activists have been winning city support of neighborhood watch programs are all but shut down now at request of antidiscrimination activists
  with all the minorities  usa average is under 100  without them we are just over 100  the asians balance out the poc in the numbers  asians are smarter than whites  jews are smarter than asians
  so you were lucky you had the rare replacement part with you at the time of failure    genuine serendipity award
what about ocb2 wireless
  bluetooth ones seem more reliable than wifi ones
  autoparts stores are stupid expensive i usually buy everything online or at home depot/walmart
  its why american cars quality have increased over the last decade we dont make them anymore
  they dont pay any taxes
  how can they sell a pair of control arms for 65 bucks  counterfeit parts modeled on the original oem parts are always going to be cheaper the makers never spent any rd or testing costs and china doesnt have the benefit plans and pensions for the employees as in the usa or europe
  plus too they are better at manufacturing than we are
  lol sure
  you sure about that chang
  i think the key to owning a car is to be able to do as many minor repairs as you can because people are jews
  forged and cast are the same thing    dont reproduce if you posted that unironically you should have known the difference in grade school
  think that guy was trying to defend the chinese parts being cast by saying forged and cast are the same thing it seems to be the same poster that keeps on saying china is better and smarter
  this idea  jr get the lunchbox
  imagine being the poor sob who had to get the body out of the frame
  ha someone actually made one of those
    actually china is actively trying to reduce pollution and reaffirmed its commitment to the 2015 paris agreement    for the communist party this has become a serious matter of prestige
  you should have known the difference in grade school  jesus  what nightmare blue collar school did you go to
  yeah but they dont have to do anything per the paris agreement   t read the agreement  
  lots of places will not even let you bring parts at all  same here state law requires auto service centers to have a minimum warranty on repair work that means even if the shop forces you to sign a contract of as is the as is is severed from the contract even if the terms say the contract is nonseverable    because a minimum warranty is required the shops refuse to perform service with your parts because they are forced to provide a warranty not just on their service but on the part regardless you see if their service is faulty they have to provide warranty service if the part you supplied is faulty they still have to provide warranty service and supply another part in place of the faulty one  some people can launder their faulty parts this way for a good one
  what nightmare blue collar school did you go to  the saddest thing is that chinas greed in low priced counterfeits caused the migration of so many manufacturing jobs out of the usa those blue collar jobs were held by many blacks and hispanics so china is the real source of much of the economic problems minorities have china offset a lot of the positive efforts activists and the government tried to do to pull blacks and hispanics up into higher prosperity china shoved the blacks down a lot
i just replaced my bros honda pilot driver side lower control arm got the control arm assembly on rockauto for 97 shipped part works great holding up so far
  mind you a local repair shop quoted around 400 to do it where i did it that cheap same shit same parts
i ordered a sideview mirror of rockauto and the fucking glass is warped and of course i didnt notice til after i had installed it
i need some help bros my key fob buttons stopped working a while ago and i opened up the thing and two little prongs plus the batteries fell out does anybody have an idea or way to fix this i can always use a key but having a remote would be nice
  you shouldnt have opened it up if you dont know shit about it now go to your stealership to get it fixed
solder them back on durp
  i dont even have a fucking soldering iron man
  well then get a soldering iron what do you want from me
they dont even need soldered op you fucking dunce set them in the black plastic half of the fob in those two circles with each one of them having two teeth touching that metal strip between the two circles then set the batteries on them and put it back together theyre just springs/connectors

what would you say are the national characteristics of cars from each country
big fat and eats everythingyou already know what country that is
  mexico has cars
  can go around bends but breaks every halfmile
  they steal them from the us
  heres a breakdown of which countries have the most popular brands in the uk based on the number of cars on the road  most popular brands in the uk    what an utterly worthless statistic
  i mainly used it because it had the names of all the countries that created cars
  bump
  arent you supposed to be filming a show hammond
  us cars large loud brute force doesnt give a shit what you think about it  japanese cars unoriginal copy of the west in concept brilliant in execution  german cars overengineer everything and fuck everything else  swedish cars have a good niche of being like german cars but for people with self respet  british cars for people who wear tweed jackets  italian cars i just want to put it out there that i still fuck  korean cars going to be what japanese cars were in the 90s  australian cars rip
  romanian cars shitboxes with decent overall specs at half the price to buy half the price to own than any other car in the same class paint may or may not suck
  more like  us cars large loud all bark and no bite outside its home  japanese cars admire the west so much they tend to btfo them whenever they reinvent their stuff  german cars efficiently boring with a few sparks here and there of madness  swedish cars as niche as the scandinavian countries themselves  british cars from a respectable powerhouse to making barely functional stuff to selling almost all of its manufacturers they truly are a reflection of the uk  italian cars literally have a soul easily noticed and can be really fucking good but better fucking pray they are in a good mood else theyre going to be insufferable  korean cars literally fucking copycats arent even trying to improve stuff  australian cars lol

i have a question /o/ in the state of ohio do you need your drivers license or just a photo id to get tags for your car  pic unrelated
to add to this the dmv website for this wasnt very clear on the matter
  you need a drivers license to legally drive a car just use that
at least should be faster than 716 that camaro recorded in the ring
nice thumbnail
m4 gts is basically the same concept as the viper acr for the same price  701 vs 728 on bmws home turf and you cant even remove the splitter for daily driving  embarrassing
  as a bmw fan im really disappointed by this
  or maybe it wont be who fucking cares all ring times are invalid as a form of definitive objective comparison    at least not until official times are sanctioned by an independent governing body
  bmw fanboy detected
  hes not wrong though different drivers driving on different days in different conditions is the worst way possible to compare performance capacity
  but bmws time is too slow for that excuse
  no it isnt find times set by the same driver on the same day and then call it slow no niggerring time will ever count for shit
  this is what a rational adult would say but benchracing will never stop
  camaro 716  m4 gts 727  different drivers but both were good enough to be appointed as a timeattack driver 10 seconds difference is just too big for drivers to cover
  what part of same driver on the same day went over your head
  stop defending bmw both drivers were good enough to do time attack so whether it is the same driver or not doesnt matter much temperature affects but 10 seconds are too big for the same driver and the same day to cover     this amg gtr did 704 on the semi wet no chance for m4 gts no need to consider the same driver and the same day its obvious even for idiots
  m4 gts is a tarted up luxury people mover which starts at 35k with 6 cylinders  viper is a dedicated 2 seater supercar with a v10  same concept lmao
  when will amg make affordable sports cars like bmw   if you want an amg car that is faster than 65k bmws you need to spend over 150k for the gtr lmao  
  im not defending bmw im just saying different drivers on different days isnt a valid way to compare cars at all personally id even go so far as to say they should have the same tires because something like cup 2 vs pss4 alone is more than enough to make it 10 seconds on the burgerking although i dont know off the top of my head which tires each car is using in stock form
          i dont think drivers and temperature are the reason the reason is a car itself
  bmw doesnt make one of the fastest cars like amg gtr gt2rs gt3rs viper acr lamborghini huracan performanteand so on
  bmw doesnt make unobtanium 200k supercars  why should i give a shit mercedesamg offers literally zero noteworthy models in the affordable price rance from 50k120k
  excuse you very much
  so what im asking is not about price its simply about fast car on tracks when gtr loses to porsche or lambo gtr fanboys say gtr is much cheaper im like so price doesnt matter just your favorite car is slow
  fwd with overstressed 4 cylinder that is slower than the 20000 cheaper m140i    how do you know which my favourite car is   i dont care for the overpriced m4 gts but its still a different category car its supposed to compete with a c63 r or c63 black series but amg hasnt released a track version of the current gen c63
  price doesnt matter  this is the bench racerest thing you could possibly say i guess price doesnt matter to someone who cant even afford a car at all
  fwd  well memed mlad well memed indeed
  fwd biased electric haldex awd with a transverse engine that behaves like fwd on any corner
  fwd biased electric haldex awd  or in short just awd
  price doesnt matter when talking about the fastest cars most people cant afford the fastest cars but they are crazy about those cars amg gtr is like 150000 and gt2rs is twice that but nobody talks about price difference when comparing their performances
  haldex awd cant be called awd  its too garbage
  in that case how come amg still cant beat the 1983 bmw march 832 62619 time   amg gtr pro competes with gt3 rs in terms of price and performance
  sounds like you just called it awd twice though all the wheels are driven regardless of your arbitrary standards for what constitutes real awd
  its fwd 90 of the time
  its not street legal factory stock embarrassing
  amg gtr pro competes with gt3 rs in terms of price and performance  gt3rs is just better than amg gtr pro thats all i wont excuse like bmw fanboys
  its awd when it needs to be every wheel gets exactly as much power as it needs exactly when it needs it
  doesnt matter when talking about the fastest cars  your favourite car is slow
  say whatever street legal factory stock bmw cant compete with the fastest cars as long as its come from factory and people can buy it and drive it on roads prices dont matter when you start bringing street illegal cars someone starts bringing f1 cars
  street legal factory stock  like the camo wrapped preproduction test mule amg in the video not factory legal
  factory legal  i obviously meant factory stock
  amg gtr pro soon be in the market many of the ring records are done by preproduction cars that will eventually in the market
  at the end of the day they are both 130k strippedout 2seat hardcore track cars with big wings and coilovers and semislick tires
  track cars  even the hardcore m cars arent really track cars they can be used effectively on track but theyre still fast gt cars first and foremost not comparable to a viper at all

tfw sedans are dying for clumsier less fun more polluting crossovers  tfw roads are shit  tfw traffic is getting worse every year    whats the point its like all the fun is being sucked out of being on the road
buy a truck  rip hektik skidz on empty logging roads  off road and stuff  
traffic was never fun and people who care about fun arent driving crossovers
is there a car in the united states that nobody wants to buy
  get a bike
  civic type r
drive at night
  are you going to keep posting this market shill
tfw hooning past endless trucks and crossovers in my miata with a few simple mods    its a good feeling knowing you can pass someone at 65mph around a hairpin turn and still be well within the grip limit of your tires
  whats your point  sports cars are a niche  population only increases  people only become more concerned with perceived safety in general  governments will nanny  etc etc    get over it
  miatafags thinking they could pass anyone
  not turboing your shitbox miata  never gonna make it
  
  wow thanks anon now /o/ can move on and get back to informed engine configuration discussion
   sedans are dying for clumsier less fun more polluting crossovers    most of those crossovers have the same engine as the sedan model most cars are engine bay modular for whatever package level most car manufactures only have like three set engines for package level for all models but no crossover is going to have a bigger engine than a sedan
  hurf durf ima inject more fuel into my engine than can be burned during the combustion cycle to show those dumb ricers who  gets passed effortlessly by a faggot hair dresser car with a leaf blower strapped to it    bbutbbut muh torks
  saab pontiac scion saturn plymouth oldsmobile hummer amc delorean studebaker
  hummer  car    you fuckup
  more polluting  actually no they make less emissions every year they make a new car
  yeah go race a brotruck and see what happens    
  if only  every fucking thread is angry autists about crossovers  who cares
  but that same engine is hauling more weight meaning it has to work harder and thus use more fuel
i cannot put into works how much i love mercedes w140s    too bad im a eurofag so keeping this 22 tonne 10 mpg monster running would be a pain what do you think about this car
  man you are like the worst automotive journalist ever
wasnt it first unreliable s class
tell me more about said car why do you like it so much it looks like a generic im uppermidclass and have a very typical family with a bright future ahead of them90s kind of car to me
  looks like a taxi to me
  why do you like it so much  because it makes him look like a eurotrash gangster
    i love the simplicity size build quality for me personally its everything a s class should be the last dictator mercedes now its more of an armenian drug dealer car but still      well it had some electronical problems like many luxury 90s cars but build quality was still somewhat decent
my dads got this old ass pontiac fiero gt i think a 1985 model i dont know shit about cars but it really seems like it could run again and it looks pretty nice for its age idk if i should even bother though you cant even drive the thing in the rain and its the most fucking boomer car ive ever seen  if i ever sell it ill post the listing here i figure some of you are god damn boomers and are already salivating over the idea of that sweet plastic exterior and also interior you guys think its worth it to fix
  do it  the fiero was an amazing platform being rwd with the engine back and bodyonframe structure even better if its the gt because it actually has the decent engine out of the bunch its a really really good car op and some an/o/s are probably ready to knife each other over a clean model right now its also peak aesthetic and with prices going up you cant go wrong with putting one back on the road  most boomer car ever  nah its too new to be a boomer car twenty years too new in fact
  oh dang a car that /an/ actually likes i didnt know there were any now i can act like a fucking king around here eat shit losers im gonna post pics with timestamps and ur all gonna jerk me off haha
  welp garage is snowed in guess i cant anonymously act cool anymore
  no fiero is worth fixing garbage cars
imagine letting 4channel influence you this much why do you want approval no one gives a fuck this time spent here could have been time spent wrenching
  why cant you drive it in the rain
  rwd concern
  only a complete brainlet would be concerned about driving rwd in the rain    and what should we fix instead yet another fucking 50s landbarge keeping it completely stock as well
  go outside faggot boy  no one cares
  hahaha what  if you drive it like an idiot im sure the rain will let you spin out slightly more easily but youd have to drive like an absolute maniac just make sure youve got nonshit tires and avoid taking huge puddles at high speeds  ive got an mr car too and its less likely to break traction in the wet than an fr one since youve got more weight over the driven wheels pic related
85  gut the suspension and get aftermarket components that arent just a backwards nova  put on some modern tires on some wider wheels but not so wide that they rub  put a manual in it if it doesnt have one    once thats all settled if you want more power consider taking a 3800sc and the 6speed from a g6 and shoving them in i think theres a guide on the fiero forums its a lot harder than the previous stuff thoughso be prepared to pay a shop if you arent down to wrench often and dont know what youre doing
  anon he said he wants to flip the car fix it up and sell it hes not into the fiero
  literally false boomerlore
  oh i just read the first lines    what a fag
  yeah most people just never drove in the rain up until the 80s when fwd cars became more of the norm jesus fucking christ
          hey i just said rwd concern i didnt say it was shit  which it still is  awd is only good drivetrain you seething zoomers
  thats more because radial tires were absolute dogshit back then any car was much much less safe than modern cars    if youre not a complete idiot while driving and use modern tires you have nothing to worry about unless youre hooning
  sorry i misunderstood your post
  you
  i daily drove a fiero through the winter in canada and mine made 300 horsepower youll be fine m8
how is a fiero the most boomer car youve ever seen sell it to someone whos not a complete dipshit
  awd is almost a marketing gimmick
fiero is based car i own 3       is right except aftermarket is kind of dying off right now a few big web stores recently closed down im working on a suspension swap on my 87 and some adapter plates etc are starting to be hard to find     something i wish someone told me when i got my first one   if you just wanna have some fun clean up that 85 if you want to start a project and eventually be fast get a 88
 me  didnt realize youre trying to flip it  go kill yourself
ls swap that bish
why the fuck were speedometers on 70s cars so tiny how were you supposed to know how fast you were going
didnt matter back then cause cops werent a racket
why the fuck were speedometers on 70s cars so tiny  picks one example  1970 impala spans half the fucking dash  also steering wheels back then were fuckhueg so they were easy to see anyway
  yeah the one you posted is the standard 70s speedometer most people think of
  cars were close to topping out at 55 most probably couldnt 70 because they didnt have over drive and had 300 ratioed rear ends     so it wasnt like you were going anywhere fast
  because they were standard gm was on the top of the game back then and most of their cars had horizontal speedometers until the 80s lest we mention fords and their horizontal speedometers its no wonder that they would be the standard speedometers of the time
  based bait
1971 giulia  small  burgers btfo
    didnt matter back then cause cops werent a racket    why do you think convoy and bj and the bear even exist
needing a speedometer to know how fast youre going
  convoys helped increase gas mileage but were illegal because they caused deadly and messy wrecks obviously there was some cop slang but police mostly were around to prevent reckless driving not pull you over for a 5mph difference
  because 40 years ago peoples vision was better were in the glasses age now and its going to get worse i dont know whats behind it but look at any photo of people in the 70s 60s 50s etc maybe a couple people out of dozens wore glasses now its every second person think about it man
  didnt realize everyone drove a humvee
    convoys existed because of the unfair action against motorists due to the federal speed limit truckers used to targeted a lot since their careers depended on speed
  youre right it couldnt be that more people are getting eye exams these days
  test
  thats pretty normal looking   did i get trolled

  real trouble is making sure all the maintenance crew has vacated the spinney whirly parts  nah lock on/lock off method during shut downs is pretty fool proof maintenance crew tagging/locking is pretty heavily policed too theres not really any way for misplaced people to end up where they shouldnt end up unless theyre making an active effort to become a danger to themselves
  i wish meat works had the same policy  every three hours they have a break and clean up crew moves in  but the meat hook conveyor just slows down instead of stopping  kind of a hassle as the central gutters and grills get slippery but people are expected to move quickly

retarded techfags coming onto /o/ to shill teslas and other uninspiring electric monstrosities  have no interest in any other cars
  this you have to have a perfunctory idea of automotive concepts or history or mechanic ability or some combination thereof otherwise youre just another clueless normie who thinks hes getting a good deal from the dealership when in fact his asshole is large enough park that new shiny electric car in at night because of the reaming he just got
that hurt to watch
  retarded techfags coming onto /o/ to shill teslas and other uninspiring electric monstrosities  i doubt these are shills theyre just guys shitposting because electric car posts always get people seething so theyre guaranteed yous
electrical engineer  still hurt to watch  where is my caterham/lotus ev i can modify and maintain in my garage with a multimeter soldering kit and laptop

ok massholes i got a question about window tint i have an suv and i want to tint the rear to 25 but tint the front to legal 35 so do inspection stations really check rear suv windows
tint only applies to the front 2 windows
  nice  i was wondering if mass even checks ive seen 15 front windows all over the place i know ri is strict on it they even set up cameras to catch that
  why it looks good as long as its 3200lbs or lower id buy it
  youre fucking baiting
  best hope that they make a touge variant this gen or else pay the heavy gtx fee
  trust me they will milk this one
  literally perfect
  bestlooking 911 since the 964 2bh
why is the nose so fucking big when there is no engine in it why is the rear end so tall the 997 was reasonably small and light only 6 years ago what the fuck happened
  dislike those pillars but the only way i could imagine improving them involves lowering the rear wheel bulge and making it more sudden  also fuck the tiny windshield like holy shit      trunk space retard theres an engine in the back  what the fuck happened  federal safety requirements
    instead of admitting that rear engine is retarded they steadily increased the size of the car around the engine so that itd be closer to the center
  the rear is actually lower than the 991 believe it or not its because they moved components to the side which is why the fender flares are bigger the front is higher thanks to good old pedestrian safety laws
  muh safety
  the nose is an extension of the drivers penis
why dont you have an electric car /o/
because i havent been sponsored one by nissan
because i ride motorcycles
  i dont even have a regular car
because i live in buttfuck nowhere and my state doesnt have a single charger within 30 miles of me if i could afford it as a commuter id do it but theres nowhere to fucking charge unless you own a tesla
  because my region doesnt have a single charger yet it has enough green to suck up a ferraris emissions and because i need to go somewhere other than metropolitan hellholes
because garages are quite rare where i live so vehicles are outside evs and hybrids regularly have this issue where the connector freezes stuck to the car  that and i ride a motorcycle fuck traffic
  that dude has got to be the most boring least charismatic person on youtube
  a paid shill that i suspect is also likely a homosexual his channel has the least amount of technical engineering explanations and the maximum amount of surface knowledge on a subject zero personality also
  lets see    hes smarter than you  hes richer than you  hes taller than you  he slays way more pussy than you incel
  because i have a working penis and testosteron and a build gym body
  i live in the middle of no where i need decent range to do anything
  being poor my apartment does have outlets at each parking spot though
  this nigga confuses me    looks 45 and 17 at the same time  looks like hes wearing a wig however he has grey hairs  also clearing balding and trying to hide it
  they cant make it the 80 miles a day i do for work
because i like to use electricity to zap niggers with my taser
  i mean he isnt there on youtube to be flamboyant and all over the place just to teach retards how compression works hes there just to lecture
  simply because i cant justify buying one right now if my car malfunctioned bad enough to not be worth repairing i would buy a used electric
i am poor but even if i wasnt i would net buy one in their current state for the ecology fags my 20 year old shitbox with lpg conversion is greener than any commercially available ev and it will always be that way
im all for ev but im waiting for this sexy piece of ass   300 mile range superchargeesque charging capability 600hp awd
because i dont have the money for it and infrastructure here is lacking
  came here to say the same thing      smarter than you  i dont think i have ever learned anything from any of his videos because theyre so dumbed down and use these terrible analogies and explanations he speaks like an autistic version of my 7th grade science teacher  richer than you  probably i have terrible spending habits  taller than you  how tall is dude lanklet fuck feels good not being a manlet or a tall goody looking twig  slays way more pussy  i doubt it what kind of pussy does he get anyway nasty gamer girls who got touched by their uncles
  poor
  because evs are for econofags
too expensive and the imiev suck
  because 5 superchargers in all of canada
  horseshit    the bolt and leaf can do that with range to spare
  is the range anxiety making him go grey
  wrong the mathematical chef
  he has been going grey all his life
  because im not gay
  because theyre expensive
  because i can drive 3 times further on my petrol car nigga
  he met scotty have you    
because i dont want to pay a higher cost to use a vehicle with batteries that are made from rare chemicals and materials
  saabkyle exists
because there isnt an electric truck that performs as good as a 20 year old clapped out dodge ram with a cummins in it    and there never will be one    ever
 if it didnt come that way from the factory then its bad    this guy is not an engineer
  1 most of the time when im driving im driving longer distances that would give me range anxiety  2 im gay but i aint that gay     seriously though if i lived in la id get one but they just dont suit my needs as is
  yeah he tells people not the mod their cars because it can affect reliability but then he wanted to put a super charger on a high compression engine and expect it to be reliable
any ev worth buying is supercar expensive and none of the reasonably priced evs have good range speed and comfort only exception is the vaporware 35k model 3
  because they all look stupid take the fit ev for example the regular fit sport looks fine but the fit ev looks like neo when his mouth got closed over
compares prices of an econobox ev to the price of an average car including noneconoboxes    t b h
  because of the environmental damage they cause
  the least amount of technical engineering explanations and the maximum amount of surface knowledge on a subject  are you expecting him to teach advanced engineering for every topic a basic understanding of things is not a bad lesson to throw out for free viewing
because i studied physics and dont fall for bullshit
    yeah i like that channel but the nissan i bought this year will be the last one i ever buy
  because im not a grey haired stick figure amerimutt
  because i like my road trips
  saabkyle is a good channel run by an honorable chap ee is pure reddit
    isnt it funny when an electric car still uses a 12v lead acid battery for stuff
i really like this but i dont know why its probably not very efficient i cant justify buying it and its pretentious too what do you think /o/
too much overhang to be a serious offroader  wheelbase too long to be a serious offroader  bed too short to be useful    its a compromise vehicle for someone who wants to do everything
  to be honest the dimensions and bed sizes of other midsize crew cab trucks arent much different and chrysler llc havent had a midsize competitor in seven years its just that you wouldnt expect it from a wrangler
  yes but a midsize crew cab pickup is a compromise vehicle from the beginning
the crewcab is on par with other midsize crewcabs for both bed size and offroadability a single cab would be really cool though the crew cab is fucking ugly
it looks awkward to me it seems like it should have a bed that length or maybe slightly longer attached to a regular cab and a much shorter bed for the crew cab    something about the look kinda reminds me of a subaru baja but without the goofy charm
  toyota did it better
if you like it buy it fuck what anyone else thinks
  chrysler llc havent had a midsize competitor in seven years its just that you wouldnt expect it from a wrangler  right if it was just about reentering that segment id have expected a new dakota before this
  people dont remember the dakota fondly though it was boring and had a spotty reliability record and a lot of midsize truck buyers are about the lifestyle really thats why the tacoma sells so well despite being the most expensive in the segment iirc they dont care about cheap mexican landscaper trucks
  they can always change the nameplate if theres baggage with the dakota name i wouldnt be surprised if they did that anyway just because its now ram and not dodge last i read they were looking at ram 1200     what i meant more was that if this was just meant as an answer to the colorado/ranger/taco itd be a more conventional pickup    a wrangler pickup is a worthy lifestyle vehicle too but i see it as a different target market one that wouldnt be as concerned with say a certain amount bed length or nominal load capacity
  too long of a cab and smol bed is lame a single cab like the 50s model would look better  saw one yesterday at the la auto show
    having to drop the tailgate to fit a bike
2/3 the bed is behind the rear axle
  soooooo like a normal midsize truck pretty sure you have to even on a 7 bed ranger
    well its easier to lift the bike in with the tailgate down    the difference is being able to get it up again
    the dakota was the only midsize with a v8 though     the dakota also suffered no more reliability issues than the ram
    protect the cargo  not the passengers    fucking lel
  delete the back row and bring the bed up closer and it would look better doing so you can move the rear axle closer to the rear edge of the bed
    my 65 bed fits a 500 scrambler just fine
  front track wider than the rear  thin frame  65/35 weight distribution
    delete the back row and bring the bed up closer and it would look better   look better    you need to get your priorities straight son you faggots are the reason why a 1000 lbs payload is considered acceptable in a truck because it looks good    doing so you can move the rear axle closer to the rear edge of the bed    you can do that no matter how many doors it has
    fixed it
   track wider than the rear    a true problem     frame    not compared to the paper machet frame you have on a half ton     weight distribution    when empty yes but you dont want 50/50 distribution in a truck when you are going to add 1/2 its weight again into the back like it is designed for then you would end up with 33/66 distribution
    fucking good job man
  kinda sad fiat couldnt figure this out given the wrangler design lends itself to this layout so much better than the limo thing they went with
  phat nut im not a huge chrysler fan but i would definetly buy that
was the original commanche based off of the wrangler
im ashamed to like it
  man that is so much better
    it was a cherokee pickup
  nut
can i get it in a 2 door i swear to fuck if i cant i am never going to buy another jeep
  4door only
  why what the fuck is the problem with them pushing the 4 door models so hard a wrangler with more than 2 doors just looks fucking weird
  thats so much better looks more like the original gladiator concept this new jeep truck is such a huuuuuge disappointment after all these years of waiting  all we got is basically a wrangler with a bed   it sucks
  check 2005 gladiator concept it was fantastic
  4 door sells waaaayyyy more than the 2 door i expect a 2 door version later but right now theyre testing the waters once this thing is making them money theyll make a 2 door
  yeah but unfortunately this landcruiser truck is not available in usa 
  i would wait till theyve been on the market and we get a few trustworthy reviews pulling 7600lbs for a truck that size is a lot of weight to tow ive done it before and its not fun that tail end hangs over quit a bit i can already see people putting new back ends on it
  i dont understand why the people like 4 door jeeps they look like shit hold the same number of people as a 2dr cost more i see no positives personally then again i havent liked a jeep since the yj so maybe im living in the past
    americunts wont pay the 60k asking price for one of these turds when it only comes with a na v6 engine and cant tow jack shit they can spend half the money and get a fatass v8 in their f150    this is such a boutique/niche product it wont last long then theyll become an autistic collectors item like the prowler     screen cap this shit because its based and redpilled and you faggots know it
  think about how many graduateage thots buy the base 4door 2wd vs how many guys buy the 2door offroadspec women dont really look at a car they look at the idea of a car if you asked them why they bought the 4 door they would ask you what you meant theres only one kind of jeep right
    wranglers are officially the new chick wagon faggots have actually taken the miata away from women and made it exclusively for gaysbut the wrangler belongs 100 to women men just went back to buying trucks and suvs like 4runners
  jeep is a status symbol and social experience now thats what attracts woman weather they know it or not the jeep wave is a big part of its success
is there a car in the united states that nobody wants to buy
  this it gives them something with which to advertise themselves and overtly identify     it satisfies the need to show the world theyre a tough girl who doesnt need a man and also that theyre fun so country boys wont think theyre fucking dykes for driving a fat slow heavy piece of shit suv    generally women who drive jeeps or trucks are insufferable thots
  as someone who is a toyotafag and owns a gen 1 4runner new 4runners are cuckmobiles
    why is that exactly theyre still a bof rwdbiased 4wd vehicle with a dedicated transfer case and a naturally aspirated 40l engine     theyre the least cucked of any suv currently sold in north america obviously theyre not going to be identical to one from 25 years ago
  just because its the least shit doesnt make it good
  it comes with a manual and handbrake would make a great drift truck
  same i know its shit but the inner kid in me really likes it almost reminds of pic related unpractical but really fucking cool to a 10 year old
      from the fca media site  jeep wrangler buyers are approximately 75 percent male and 25 percent female  approximately 60 percent have college degrees more than half of wrangler unlimited 4door buyers have children while less than 30 percent of wrangler 2door buyers do   median household income is 95000 for wrangler buyers and 110000 for wrangler unlimited buyers    basically 4door wrangler buyers are mostly men who have kids and 2door ones are men without
  moron
    looks like ass in person    needs a 2 door version badly
  buyer isnt necessarily driver id guess that a lot of those dudes buying the 4doors are giving them to their daughters
  why are the back doors shaped as if the fender was right behind it
  cost
  oh look an elitist nice
  because theyre the same doors off the regular version
  elitist  makes valid points    are your feelings hurt he btfo of your new jeep unlimited
  elitism intensifies
  fuck yeah access cab    thats the only way id ever end up with one is if it had the long bed and access cab cant fit sportbikes in a short bed
  i would buy this
big enough to bring all your fiat/chrysler mechanics and all their tools in the bed
    they would sell so many of these if that was the layout
  id buy this the companies dont seem to think two door trucks sell anymore sadly
  current 4runners  not glorified minivans
these have been testing where i live not sure why as fca has no ties in my city cool to see rolling around though taken friday evening
  its a disappointment like all modern trucks and suvs the excess of safety shit and luxury doodads make it absolute shit     this     much better
  have you seen 4door wrangler sales lately
  why are you complaining about things that all the competition has too fca offers a much more options than the competition    whine about overhang  theres the wrangler unlimited   whine about wheelbase  theres the wrangler  whine about the bed  ram power wagon
  this looks like shit how are you guys liking this
  my neighbor has one all blacked out and it looks pretty cool desu
  there was nothing wrong with the h2    
is it a bad idea to take out a bank loan for a 2500 shitbox     i need a car like right now but id rather get honeydicked on a 2500 loan than assraped by a dealer on a new 18000 car
  buy a 300 shitbox from craigslist once you get into the loan meme you think if 2500 why not 3000 and then you think why not 4000 and then you think 4500 wont hurt and boom you get ass raped for 34
  is it a bad idea to take out a bank loan for a 2500 shitbox    no do it and enjoy the better credit
  300 shitbox    wwhere
  craigslist youll probably find a clapped out cavalier for 3500
  one that isnt running scrap prices are aroud that     op just do it but be sure to pay it off in a year or when tax time rolls around
  hahaha thats like half a paycheck dude haha just like save your money lol
no man for that low money you should be using cash  if you dont have the cash for it you dont have the cash to fix the engine because the po redlined at every light  my advice go lease a cheap car like a versa for a year or two   do 0 down and the lowest rate you can get  then when you stop spending your money on vidya you can buy an actual car
  i dont spend my money on vidya i am just cheap and hate digging into my savings
  the 300 dollar shitbox is a meme take a loan on a certified nissan versa or something itll be a miserable experience but at least youll be able to drive around in a reasonable reliable vehicle with parts thatre cheaper than bananas bonus if its a manual too i rode shotgun in a manual versa and its a hoot to thrash around because it has such dumpy fucking proportions going 30mph around a corner feels like a near death experience
  then just use your savings fag because that loan will make that 2500 shitbox a 5000 shitbox in the end
  you know theres a whole range of cars between 2500 and 18k right anyway i personally wouldnt finance anything that cheap but if you have an equivalent of liquid funds you can borrow against that and youll get a better interest rate because your bank knows you have the money to pay it off should you fall behind on it  youll have to get a personal credit loan anyway instead of a car loan because nobody will finance a 2500 beater because it wouldnt be worth repossessing if you defaulted
  nissan  reliable
one rule of them is never take a loan for a project/beater you will regret it later ive bought enough a cheap used car before on craigslist that i though would be perfectly fine and the rear main tranny seal blew out on the way home if you cant buy it now with cash just wait
  bought miata  its really good condition except for a few small things  fix them all up all easy stuff  rear main seal starts to drip oil when parked a month later    fuck
  unironically facebook marketplace os great for finding sub 1000 cars
    you know my painlucky you actually made it home though the sinking feeling as i was on my way home and knew what was happening sucked to say the least
1800 grand marquis
may i direct you to /n/      actually could someone else i dont know how to make that link thing
dont fall for the loan meme i did and it set me on a bad pattern of behavior what makes it worse is that you dont think about the interest when factoring in prices for stuff best advice would be to save up and take the bus till you can afford a decent beater like an old toyota or something
  fuck off newfag
  your just dumb
  fuck off newfag if you dont even know how to link youre so obviously new it hurts
kek ive been driving a 2002 impala for 6 months paid 100 for it and spent about 400 in parts should get a few trouble free years out of it before the rust kills it    before that i drove a 200 civic for 6 years and put over 250k on it    car debt is for suckas
      i paid 300 for a honda civic in southern california and drove it home an hour away deals exist it helps to really make the seller feel like theyre selling a barely salvageable piece of shit and take cash he was asking 900 when i messaged him
  this just take out the loan and pay it off in like 2 months credit score goes up

posting this during actual graveyard shift  no picture of my bike on my laptop    just imagine that green and black klr in the snow or something    why does my rear brake wear out so quick i mean i use it a ton but i just rebuilt the caliper with a new piston seals put a braided brake line semi metallic pads and flushed the whole system worked great for a while and could easily lock the tire on pavement but now its super squishy and weak and also gives a slightly uneven pulsating feeling when i push it down hard is my rotor warped or some shit     also my suspension feels like crap on the street like its too stiff possibly linkage or bearings pretty sure the stock springs are really weak and shouldnt feel stiff or hard on little bumps or potholes
  1227 in the noon  graveyard shift  lmao
havent rode a bike since i was 10 on a 125cc dirt bike  getting my licence in 3 months   no idea about bikes or what to buy  wat do

whos the smooth brain that didnt link the new thread in the old
  probably the same smoothbrane that uses duckduckgo
  probably the same smoothbrain that didnt include the map
  wr 125    thanks heres one for you too
whats wrong with the map link
  one autist broke the link because he doesnt like the map and then this other retard who keeps making new threads without linking them in the old one doesnt fix it
            so wich anon shud i email next 2 see if ther ded    colombian anon already confirmed for rip
removed fairings  lowered suspension fork  tried to saw into the big rivets holding the ignition so i can unscrew them but no space for the saw  could drill out the rivets holding the lower ignition cover but no idea if that would help anything  tomorrow ill use a metal file on the rivets and try to unscrew them if that is successful i kinda worry that the ignition still wont come out due to the steering lock is still engaged  stealing my own bike is hard pls likesubscribe
  i guess most people just dont check their throwaway emails all that often
  not forwarding mail from your throwaway accs  are you dense
  connecting your throwaway accounts  are you not paranoid
  m8 theres no point living in denial the poor chap has expired hes no more lets just pay our respects and move on to the next anon

  all these people on the map not replying hmm almost as though they dont care about it nah that couldnt possibly be it
  ive seen more female looking crossdressers
  one person hasnt replied  all these people on the map not replying  yet again map hating anon creates his own version of reality
  iom arai    very nice
  this   and ktm nigger is so slow with adding people to the map that some might not even post on dbt anymore
  how slow is he  i sent an email for riga at 1612 gmt2 lets see how long it take to pop up on map     also why arent there decent choice of shitbikes in europe such as is in thirld world countries like asia or america    sometimes i just dream of getting a buttcheap honda cb250 or knockoff suzuki gn125 to putter around during hot summer days when i dont want to get all fucking do the dakar in full gear
  we go through a permanent 6 month cycle of nothing happening some one tries to remove the map that trigs the map autist he updates the map goto 1
  took me almost a month after sending him another email and replying to him twice in the thread to check his emails
  i dont know about you but theres plenty of shit chinese bikes around in the uk lots of 125s and old jap bikes for cheap too maybe its a latvia problem    i think ktm dude was away studying for a year so there was zero activity for ages which is why the never gets updated meme came about he posted about updating it a couple of days ago though youll likely be added soon
there are people that live in nc that didnt show up at july sam

  ree dont buy something i dont like
is it true the z800e is a good starting bike a guy of the kawa dealer here in italy wanted to sell me one used mint condition but orange / 6200 euros should i bite
  how is my bike embarrassing  inb4 because shitzuki    how can you judge my attitude by a picture
z800e too much for 1st bike unless you ridden motocross type bikes
  with that bike get some enduro friends  yours are probably tourers / higway riders and the chilly winds get to you fast at those speed    but drifting around sandy fire road and muscling against logs and mud warms you up real fast even around 0c
  this is what dual sports fags consider fun  lmao
  i would love to ride in the vast nothingness of murica or somewhere similar there is nothing like that here im riding street 90 of the time

be canadian  pass multiple choice test  pass skills test  get pulled over riding at night  cop tells me i cant ride at night  show him on my license it says i can ride from 5am to 12pm midnight  he shows me on my license it says i cant ride from sundown to sunset  which one is it
  from sundown to sunset  what did he mean by this
  non flush turn signals  stock rear fender tail fin  perfect  no
  12pm is midday i would assume that any limitation would be based on time as that is easier to enforce the exception would be for a vehicle lacking headlights where it can only be driven/ridden when lighting levels are adequate but that would be subject to the officers judgement
  be canadian  have no rights  so this this is the power of democratic socialism whoa

  scorpion makes good exhausts for cheap if you leave the baffles in the longer canned ones they are the same loudness as the akra
  do i count

  no you dont  you can get a replacement key from the manufacturer  the code is hidden on the back of the handlebar for stem for many bikes  my kawasaki ninja also had the code on a metal tag with the extra key  i put the code tag in my gun safe    i saw a video on it a few days ago i cant seem to find anymore
    this most likely isnt the same bike you have but hes explaining it well  
  bmw psychologist and researcher bernt spiegel has found that nonmotorcyclists and novice motorcyclists usually share the fatalistic attitude described by thompson insofar as they think that high speed motorcycling is like a game of chicken or russian roulette where the rider tests his courage to see how close he can come to the edge or specifically the limit of traction while braking or cornering without having any idea how close he is to exceeding that limit and crashing   psychologist  fucking kek  bmw autists btfo
is leaning back and forth illegal  like from the yellow line to the white line by the sidewalk back and forth  i enjoy it but i understand sometimes it might look like im swerving right into oncoming traffic to others  i also like the way the engine feels vibrating against my groin
  it can be considered to be dangerous riding
i wish my parents werent retarded with money when i was a kid  the average person spends 200 a month on lottery tickets  my parents would spend that every month on gambling
  lottery tickets is gambling
  you can get these so cheap too  200 for a 49cc  i saw a woman at a grocery store buying an electric car for her kids for nearly 500  i pulled out my phone and showed her a video of a pocket bike  i hope she returned it  poor kids
  i know but the 200 average thing is from american lottery statistics  my parents would buy all kinds of tickets raffles scratch and sniff and of course visit casino once a month to get rid of any extra money that we couldnt have because they needed
this girl biting her lip so hard  she has a crush
    when youre on two wheels the diapers drop
  i didnt know lorenzo was such a manlet
  you have to take off your shoes/boots to remove your overpants which is not always a possibility

if you didnt have a pw50 as a kid your childhood was shit this thing was given to me when i was 6 20 years later she still runs hopefully my kids will want to ride it too when theyre old enough
  holy fuck i thought stuff like that only happens in tom cruise movies
  my problem isnt the missing key i have all 3 of them  2 of which have never been used to i cross out a worn key the ignition is jammed cant even turn it into parkposition    blind bolt  i see learned a new word today ty  my plan was to file/ cut off the sides of the bolt since the bolts apparently are loctited all the way up and i cant use a blowtorch with all wiringharnesses still in place i took this video as reference since its a yamaha too 
  kids can get seriously injured on one of those people should start riding in their 30s enough time to still get good and enough time to have lived enough of life
  yuros
  people should start riding in their 30s  no early age is better for skill    i would have loved being able to ride way earlier but sadly i didnt have the funds and legal method to do that until i was 19
  its not like children have dreams or aspirations they contribute nothing and basically are pets to their parents so if they die nothing of value is lost if they dont die but instead are permanently injured you just put it out of its misery like a wounded horse who gives a fuck about kids they have no personality or character they barely have a conscious theyre disposable npcs
  the average person spends 200 a month on lottery tickets  bullshit
  children are our future and the greatest asset to humanity  every child out there has a possibility to be the next president or cure cancer etc if you burn out hope then what do we have to live for

  the average american spends about 22304 per year on lottery tickets loan marketplace lendedu found in a report that calculated its average by dividing the 2016 lottery revenue by the us population 3257 millionoct 25 2018  bought mega millions tickets heres what you could have made if you invested instead
  kirin is like a japanese electric mylittle pony you gay faggot
  i am not having them vaccinated  while his whole area gets wiped out from some virus so only the strong survive    
  eh it gets a fluid change once in a blue moon but i dont do much else to it still runs its fine

are wheelies bad for my engine specifically power wheelies as i often end up high revving and going over the red line    should i focus on 2nd gear clutch wheelies or even shifting up gears when thinking about longevity of my engine    soon im going to buy a stunt bike but in the mean time i enjoy thrashing my main bike
  scum
  read this  
  is your bike an sv  then yes  in fact suzukis in general have troubles unless theyre k series gixxers  in general its stress not much different than a hard launch with additional bump if you cant land
    the fuck is a k series gsxr
  depends on how often you adjust your valveschain nd change oil
  ive read it before im not sure how im going to overcome this red line problem i accidentally hold my wheelies too long and run out of gearing    i come down softly at least but thats just because i have control over the bike    i guess my question really should be how do i power wheelie and do the least amount of harm to my bike
   just change the gear you can hear when the engine is close to the redline    post2000 gixxers i suppose
  what did you faggots create two threads for stay in your contaimnemt area faggots
  fair
  some idiot just made a new one too early

  automatics are for the paraplegic and elderly  anyone else who drive one is either a retard or a spoiled amerifat
  automatic  spoiled    sometimes your guys poorness is funny but its starting to get depressing
  im also an amerimutt
  i like having a big dumb console shifter in autos with sport mode its pretty satisfying to send the shifter down into sport with a clunk and when youre done push it back into drive for economy shifting it really doesnt feel right to do that kind of act with a dial the dial should only be twisted at a dead stop like switching between 4x4 modes    buttons are okay but its still a weird process to go through when trying to do tasks like parallel parking that require some sort of forwardreverse maneuvering
  i want a hard long lever not a giant sized granny nipple
  my job has a fleet of nothing but ram trucks and and some fords and all of them have this shift i gotta say that this is the most effeminate shit ever the fucking thing already jammed when it was trying to auto shift back to park after the battery died
what car is this video was taken in 1970 or 1971 i think looks like a chevy badge
ford falcon
  kinda looks like a 2 door zd fairlane or similar
  i check it out falcolns have a single round headlamp on each side this car looks like it had split headlamps on both sides
  could be a gto maybe
its either a ford falcon or a 60s fury iii
  1982 vw golf
most likely a fairlaine actually not falcon
  i think thats it fairlaine gt
  definately a fairlaine
thanks br/o/s came across one of my parents home 8mm movies and saw that car in the back so i was curious
  looks like a 1966 fairlane 2dr sedan coupes had the hardtop roof like 
for the souped up top range engine and awd but not all the options
got drivers licence with almost perfect score one month ago  chill driving peaceful state of mind  didnt drive until today  went by 2 orange lights  stalled before a roundabout  drove agressively for some reason  kind of was a danger to myself and others    1 month without driving and i already lost a huge amount of confidence and skill  what are some tips for new drivers that you absolutely recommend any tips to keep a serene state of mind
  you are literally the kind of cunt who can only have half an hour for lunch because if you take an hour you need to be retrained   get the snip you utter fucking npc
  always make sure your waifu is riding with you that way youll always keep her safe be driving defensively
  what are your driving tips for an npc buddy
  there are none you fucks dont drive you commute   the fucking front facing radars on cars now do a better job of risk mitigation than you do  i bet you dont even dip your headlights until after youve come round the bend and blinded the oncoming driver for two seconds i despise you with every fibre of my being
  well i can see youre projecting a little bit there  still advice is advice   tip the headlights before the bend makes sense i can work with that  injecting it in my matrix of decisions right now
heres an idea     chill
the best tip is pay attention to driving while driving dont think about your work or home or your phone take it seriously and not as just some intermediary event that happens between two key events
060 in 11 freaking seconds  handles like shit  interior is worse than my nc miata  looks weird  slowwwwwww    i mean its cheap there are few ones that sell for under 10k but i just dont get the reason why people would buy this if they can just by a used e30 m3 a used fiat or na miata
  freaking  fucking the word youre looking for is fucking
cause to most people a car is an appliance to get from point a to point b
  e30 m3 a used fiat or na miata    because those are beat to fuck shitboxes this thing is a miserable piece of shit but its reliable and will get you to work and back with little or no maintenance
    theyre like 10k new you want some commuter to run into the ground there it is    also next to nobody knows the evo engine is nearly boltin on mirage
  if they think like that then just buy a new civic or corolla something that is cheap and good for 25k ish
  but the new civic and corolla are the cars for that kind of choice or should i say commuter choice
  and ignorance
  10k vs 20k    you can lease and finance or lease one of these and insure it for less than the insurance alone on a new civic
  are you a fucking retard  the type of person buying this isnt a car enthusiast who would drive a fucking m3 bmw or an old mx5    breh why dont they spend like 15 thousand dollars more  do you hear yourself
  why cant people just save a few thousand bucks to afford the new hondas or corollas its only 1015 grand difference not a 30 grand one
  because this does everything a corolla or civic does why get a corolla or civic when a truck is a couple grand more
  you realise for the people buying a mirage 10k is probably a lot to them right or are you that much of a mouthbreathing fuckhead
id buy one if it was a budget hot hatch like the swift gti was back in the day it only weighs like 2200lbs they could just give it the 20 engine out of the base lancer or that turbo one out of the new dogshit eclipse crossover and it would fly
  its a 90s shitbox with 10s safety its practical reliable cheap to fix fast enough for city and sips less fuel than some hybrids
its a car that zips in thailand can build and has for quite a while mitsubishi motors fired all their engineers so they just decided to sell it in the us because they had nothing else to introduce
  11 seconds  pretty fast for an a segment desu most are 137144 seconds
those shitboxes are everywhere in sea
  i see these and the non hatch versions with fartcans shitty sound desu
  its a euro city car that some retard tried to sell to western gluttons    recommending buying a fiat makes you as stupid as whoever gave the go ahead for this thing
  that is almost as fast as hybrid lexus ct200h it does 060mph in 10s
  manual  lightweight  beats riding the bus  turbo kit and you could probably get the same 060 as the slowbaru  ultimate /o/ mobile
  my mom drives one of these and its fine all she does is go to work about 6km away 90 of time alone always in slow moving traffic she only needs to carry her laptop bag and random folders and binders with documents
i test drove one a couple months ago its honestly pretty easy to overtake people on the highway if you really need to it was leaps and bounds better than the shitty spark that i rented last year
  this i dd a 15 mirage its comfy as an older civic and gets about as much mpg as you can get out of an ice without expensive bullshit like cvt and hybrid stuff
  what if they only have 12k  and still want something new  and dont give a shit how it drives
  do you likeeven understand how money works    ill bet mommy and daddy paid for whatever youre driving
  because sometimes some cars are literally just an appliance that gets you to work and back  its got to start every time you turn the key servicing is cheap running costs are extremely low and itll probably spend most of its life idling in stopstart city traffic    these are all things that basically an old as balls german car are fucking terrible at  no one will steal a mirage
  why does this car even exist  its for people with bad credit who make horrible life decisions   hmmm im broke as shit but i want to spend 12000 on a car   should i buy a brand new shitbox thatll be worth 4000 in 5 years  or should i buy a cheaper car that wont depreciate as fast and save my money for more sensible things    49 of people are dumber than the average person think about it
  buy a 3k shitbox  tranny fails the next week  4000 repair bill and no vehicle for a week  lose job  wind up on welfare  get shitbox repod  take the bus    yeah that 100 a month for a lease is sure stupid

high quality thread
at what anon     i can think of a lot of things gm beats ford at but theyre not positive things
  yes the company that repeatedly goes bankrupt vs the one that doesnt
those trucks are shit the trannys blow more then a cheap street faggot fuck you op
  american brands
  cant go bankrupt when you make a killing on spare parts
my 73 ran like a dream every day until it fell off a smokey mountain bought this 83 c30 but havent even seen it in person yet love everything about gm and ford dodge/ram is all hot garbage besides 2nd gen 59
  i miss my old 98 silverayedoh
      1998 gmc sierra 1500  my transmission fucking went last night
96 k1500 wheels and tires come tomorrow tranny blows up the day after that
x brand vs x brand  everyone has 40 year old shitbuckets and has never been in either of the brands recent vehicles  the exeption to this rule are richfags and theyre both gunna try to defend spending 3040k on a truck
  had a 2000 ford f350 73 4x4 dually drove it for three years until i wrecked it was an outstanding truck that did everything i asked of it those same three years i drove and rode in a 2016 17 and 18 f250 they were our crew trucks at precision fuckers would die if you let of the gas while going up a really steep hill that was really the only problem besides the radio fucking up my uncle my foreman got a new chevy 3/4 ton all those same years only complaint with those was the 4x4 was fucking garbage got stuck everywhere his personal ride is 91 59 its a beast like all 59s but eats up fuel injectors just bought my 83 c30 because i wanted an older square body dually and i have a 73 at home to drop in it every truck has its ups and downs some more than others
    to add im in wv right now and our current truck is the 2019 f250 beat the dog shit out of it for the past 4 months and not a single problem has come up and i mean really beat the shit out of em
only the 4l60 were shit trans 4l80 were really good i was a tech and worked on fleet express/silverado all day long worst the 992006 gen had usually was the odd waterpump/trans cooler lines and fuel pump if you run the fuel too low always even then 4l60/4l80e are balls easy to rebuild and one of the best automatics to learn to rebuild    my dad left me his 2000 60 3/4 ton when he died 250000km oilfield truck and all its needed in the last decade was a thermostat drive it maybe once every 2 weeks and it still goes you want shit buy a ford
  if youre blowing up a 700r4 that fast youve gotta look at your driving habits
  4l60e
  dude the fuck my 97 c1500 had a dent in the exact same place did they come off the lot like that
  
  same thing just electronically controlled      huh thats kinda curious just a coincidence or maybe the door is soft right there
  3040k   i wish trucks were that cheap
  damn chequed its probably a mixture of a soft spot and the perfect height and angle to hit something like pole

i dunno my ranger has served me ungodly well for the 15 years ive been driving it

just bought my first car from the lot down the road didnt want anything fancy but i needed something to get me to college and for ubereats deliveries i make on the side    this should be fine right 2006 sebring convertible 140k miles 2200
  27 hope it holds together for a while for you they were pretty shit engines
these things were trash
  you poor bastard godspeed
if i were to make a list of the 10 worst vehicles sold in the last 20 years the sebring would definitely be on it next time ask first honestly best thing you can do is turn right around and sell it dont drive it at all just get rid of it asap even if youre out a few hundred itll be the best thing you can do financially because otherwise i can see you putting hundreds or thousands of dollars in repairs into it in the near future just for it to end up at the junkyard
based
you couldve done worse the engine is the main concern those things were not very reliable at all and weve all heard the horror stories in your situation i wouldve recommended something a bit more wellknown and reliable next time around if you want something decent go for a lexus or a toyota for someone in your situation theres a reason those servings are all around craigslist for just triple digit  good luck to you take good care of it and you might be surprised never know
  girls will love it make sure you have the top down and have taylor swift blasting which is what theyll want to listen to theyll probably just hope right in
cringe
  theres a reason 3k civics are shilled you stupid fucking faggot
shouldve bought a 1k ranger
  its a 27 bro rip flip it and get something else it will explode 140k on those is about their life limit best bet is to run a quart of atf in your oil for a bit to desludge it even that may not save you
i dont think you could do worse if you tried
this thread in one image
        are these really that bad everything was fine on the test drive only had one old granny owner who kept up on maintenance
  did i do good  no
  it should be fine as long as you continue keeping up on maintenance and treat it well the treating it well part is lost on many of the people here who then wonder why their car is a piece of shit
  just an fyi for future car purchases buy from the owner fuck car lots you almost definately could have got a better deal on a better car if buying off of craigslist got my shitbox for 500 bucks with 150k 2002 sentra isnt a looker but minus that mechanically its great minus an exhaust leak but i live in a county without emissions
  youre gonna want to change oil at a minimum of 3500 miles anything above that and youve got issues luckily through the years they made minor tweaks to the 27 so the one you have is marginally better than say a 1999 stay on top of oil changes and you can probably get 170180k out of it assuming the car has been meticulously maintained throughout its life
  implying anyone is jelly of a convertible sebring

  there are plenty of cars out there that just want to self destruct no matter how well they are treated sebring is one of them

  post with bread on hood

  i know    old underpowered and i would have to pay 200 extra if i wanted to import one as an eco tax    better than being a cuck westerner with a country full of immigrants

not as bad as this
imagine having to live in france
  ahh the average french youth participating in peacful protesting
  how does this make you feel /o/  lets import more immigrants from violent countries
  how does this make you feel /o/  reminds me of the arson cars in sweden the immigrants became angry and arsoned a whole bunch of cars outside the hospital area

fwd economy shitbox  nothing of value was lost
mid life crisis divorced dads buy new mustangs and camaros tryin to flex without realizing real men are more impressed by a 90s/00s shitbox that was tuned by an autist in his parents garage    when will they learn
  why would someone buy an inflatable raft for a beetle
  because they love it very much and wish it no harm
this is what poorfags actually believe
  are you implying that the beetle can float
i dont like a single car from the 2010s  older cars will always look better to me
dad cars in my area are audis and bmws that just make you roll your eyes
  same here but replace bmw with mercedes
  my friend wanted to go look at audis together when we were hanging out once and when we got inside the dealer there was a line at the counter that was basically google search results for mid life crisis
  yeah not sure about mustangs and camaros i mean thats a bad life decision but i do sometimes wonder how many of you actually buy into the /o/ meme of civics miatas and so on    theres nothing wrong with getting under the hood and loving cars but buy what you love and what you can afford
  thats funny here in spain the kids driving bmws are usually silverspoon kids on their 20s and cunts in general specially when it comes to 2nd hand bmws

so now that japan is copying america and issuing license plates with unique backgrounds for each prefecture how long will it be before the jdmfags start using them
  fuck some of those are really fucking kin/o/ the standard issue american license plate cant compete to be honest

  dont they still have the province codes on the second blue band
  i wish i could have a dinosaur license plate
  mexico did it first
  the gumna license plate looks beautiful love the blue and orange
i really need to work on my kanji  i cant read any of these
  its optional and 90 of people dont remind the guys in charge of the paperwork to specify the year of registration as well as the province

the new porsche 911 has fake exhaust tips  what do i think about it    
  sure thats not the new beetle
  autistic german throws shade all over this new shitbox vag 911  i love it
  this german isnt pronouncing the e at the end of porsche at all let alone in the anooying way cultured people do    time stamp 505 to check it
  pronunciation depends on region of germany i think even then if e were pronounced it would be more eh than uh and very understated even then porschuhh is better than pooooorschhhh
  fick dich porsche
  oh shit is that eins hoch sechs
  german literally not pronouncing the e at all  it depends on where in germany you are  americans are still retarded though  and even though americans pronounce it literally how this german does  its better than they stress the e sound as a hard a  even though a german would only do a soft trailing e sound      what nonsense
    so much retardation but for some reason it keeps on going   german literally not pronouncing the e at all  this must be one of the oldest memes around        t german from near stuttgart
  its like this world wide how do you not what dialects are        this video covers a lot
i dont understand how these things arent considered girly cars it looks like such a gay feminine car to me like a beetle and all the other stereotype girl cars
  its for men who dont have to compensate for their low t with the angriest looking car they can buy
  because before the 996 they killed you if you didnt know what you were doing
  what is a gay car
  thatd be porsche
  thats not how t works if youre low t you dont compensate for it by acting high t the low t makes you unable to act that way and you act more girly and prefer girly things    low t makes you want more cute and less violent
  they still can do all that weight over the back axle still makes for some interesting moments
  ah back when you could die driving fancy cars these days you can only do that if you disable all the safety features my grandma can drive a fucking ferrari these days god damn it
  the new porsche 911 has fake exhaust tips  cars have for years look at the lp640 and aventador its call styling something you autistic idiots would understand if you could afford to upgrade your early 90s shit box with exposed muffler
  my car has a hidden muffler and no fake shit on the back because it was made by straights
  porsche have been doing them properly up until now if you cant burn your shin on the exhaust tips the car is for posers    something i hope will be fixed in the 1 revision
  i doubt it since itll burn the bumper  if you cant burn your shin on the exhaust tips the car is for posers  i guess the viper wins at that lol
  have burnt my shins on a cayman in the summer when ive been wearing shorts before damm pipes in the middle of the trunk
  watch ops video you literal retard i bet you live in boeblingen and like to finger your own butthole
its ok because it actually has 4 exhausts they are just being modest
  those are fake too autistic krauts are sneaky like that
  at least theyre not as stupid as chevy who put the exhausts out the front bumper
  then they better have an option where the exhaust tips are the real fucking thing
  why do this
anyone have that picture with the dude who crashed on a touge with an initial d manga in the back 
i literally fucking googled real life initial d crash and it was the fourth result like shit dont you niggers know how to use a search engine type in key words not fucking sentences

i need to replace the dimmer switch in my 1995 pontiac bonneville i found the switch itself at autozone but not a single junkyard within an hour of me has the replacement connector hell i cant even find it on ebay   as you can see by the pictures the connector is fucked is there any way around this or any solutions /o/ knows of that can help me out i read one guy just connected the wires directly to his switch and put epoxy down around them i dont know if this exactly would be ideal but if it is something that works then i suppose i can do it
  not mine but this is what a dead one and a good one look like side by side if this helps at all
  i would look into why it shorted out in the first place before anything
  get a new connector from the junkyard
  i checked every junkyard around me and all of them dont have what i need    the 1995 bonneville had a recall about 20 years ago for this exact issue the switch itself is bad and causes this like i said autozone has the new dimmer switch and ill have it tomorrow so that isnt an issue
call out an autoelectrician they can probably come up with a work around
maybe if the component was sourced by gmc from another manufacturer you can trace the original maker for a spare or was it used on a more recent model that still stocks spares
16 pin electrical connector   perhaps you can use another similar part with some modification again an autoelectrician might have a bucket of them in his van
jump out the connector and wirenut it together
  find an oem part number for it and look it up on rockauto they have tons of acdelco connectors like that
how do you manage to work on your cars with such fat hands   ps someone out there in the world sells replacement connectors and google probably knows who they are
  thisll sound silly but call a dealer and ask my dad was trying to get a specific part that only the manufacturer had for his 99 gmc and they actually were able to get it
  this you never know what the dealers have hidden in some warhouse
  find someone selling parts for this car on ebay message the seller asking if they have the vehicle and if you could buy this specific connector i was thinking of doing the same for some odd and end interior components for my car some of them seem reasonable      this is another alternative
  i call bs 95 of gm is the same connectors any car/truck should have it   take a phone picture and count the wires bring it with do the wires 1 x 1 f buying a harness for 50 from the stealer rock auto maybe

  this is the kind of thing i think about when /o/ bitches about the golf r you dont pay the insane premium for the shitty haldex awd you pay it for the knowledge that the car was made in germany instead of fucking mongolia or wherever
  buy a korean car made by niggers in america  fixed
buy civic assembled in canada  constantly needs parts replaced and clear coat is peeling
so i wanna go full meme on these  i currently own an st185  next year im importing a 205  but i kinda wanna get a camry alltrac and throw a 3sgte in it just to have a fun little sleeper  thoughts
sounds good
july 1 2009    the day everything went wrong
  such a stupid program in hindsight     the big 3 who needed the handout from us citizens via tax dollars and our fucking wallets buying their unimaginative trash they copied off the japanese and euros didnt give as good of deals as toyota    i think i saw a stat somewhere seeing the most common car being bought with that program was the toyota corolla     not exactly bad for my local economy since they build them near here but still so fucking stupid
    lol omg here it is         only american cars on the list were ford which didnt even need the fucking handout after axing mercury and volvo
    reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  i think i saw a stat somewhere seeing the most common car being bought with that program was the toyota corolla    it was toyota honda and nissan all benefited from the program far more than any us auto manufacturerwhich were the companies the program was started to benefit    add to that the dip in sales that occured in the month after c4c essentially wiped out all the sales gains made during the program     in the end all it succeeded in doing was wiping out a huge chunk of the cheap used car inventory all at once giving rise to buy here pay here dealerships and rice tax on you see today on old civics and corollas
  i bet the whole thing was a giant leverage by the dealer union and kelly blue book to destroy the fucking used car market    this is the only developed country i know where you cant buy a functioning car from 1999 that isnt beat to hell for 1500    now we do get cheaper insurance than euros but fuck me i cant believe what they are asking for even 2005 crown vics with 190k miles
  not far from the truth     before c4c people would buy a cheap shitbox ride it for a couple years till it diedbecause it wouldnt be worth anything to sell or tradethen they bought another cheap shitbox lather rinse repeat     this worked great for tons of people especially those with challenged credit but ok cash flow but was obviously shitty for new car dealerships especially ford/gm/fca    the big three honestly thought that if they could woo these customers into buying a new productwith the type of incentive c4c was offering on old shitboxes theyd get hooked ditch their cheap used car buying ways and start trading for something new every few years     predictably the people that did choose to cross over all went and bought japanese so theyd have a car that would last 20 years as opposed to buying the terrible shit on offer from the big 3    by wiping out so much used car inventory at once predatory bhph dealerships were able to inflate the prices on remaining cars to basically whatever they wanted and new car dealerships were thrown full force into the subprime lending market to accommodate the customers that the used market could no longer support
  lpg if im not mistaken the line they had in 09 were the hastily reimagine european japanese clones like the aveo and 200     do you think had a program like that happened in 2011 or even as late as 12 before the suv armageddon it would have had the desired result for us automakers     from my pov at that point in time their freshly imagined lines were only half baked and still couldnt compete with the japanese and koreans specifically in sedans and other affordable options     the whole thing is a massive business study we covered a lot in college but when i really think about it beyond screwing us all out of cheap cars had it really wanted to reinvigorate the american market it should have waited until they atleast had put proper r and d into new cars     i had more confidence in american automakers in 2012 than i did in 09 and now if i was the suv type ford would be my first choice
it will happen again  and normies will love it
  lets seeso in 2009 the car lineups would have been like this    ford   facelifted gen 2 focus  gen 1 fusion  1st year of the gen 5 taurus  crown vic    chevy  gen 1 aveo  cobalt   gen 9 impala  gen 7 malibu    dodge  gen 1 avenger  gen 1 of the modern charger  the caliber  the nitro    chrysler  pt cruiser  gen 1 300  sebring      honda  accord  civic  fit  element    toyota  avalon  camry  corolla  matrix  prius  yaris    nissan  altima  cube  maxima  sentra  versa    accord vs pt cruiser  civic vs aveo  element vs nitro    easy to see why people didnt buy american
   this is why i like my mercedes lol insurance being the same i got a 10x better car for less than a decent shape accord of the same vintage an accord of the same price would have the same cosmetic problems considering where i live    realistically with cost to own fuel and etc the mercedes is going to cost a little more at the end of the day but would you rather have an s class or an accord when the difference is minute and you do the repairs yourself    then when considering whats out there at a reasonable price range that id be willing to sign my life away for ehhhno    ill stick to used clunkers albeit high end clunkers
  i really want a second car like a crown vic     i have a brand new gti but need a second car to lay the miles on and well winter     problem is a clean one is 5k now i could pay that but fuck me thats like 5 months savings
  its really ridiculous out there man god forbid you want a full size 4x4 yeah bro let me hand over 10k for your 1991 ford diesel that needs cab corners and rockets welded in    boomer tax on muscle cars  boyracer tax on small imports  and brotax on 4x4 trucks    high end benzes can be had cheap but i guess you have to be masochistic to want to take on the challenge of keeping a higher mileage one going seems the engine will run forever on mine but everything connected to it will deteriorate lol
  yeah i cant and wont wrench on a car    i work long hours in a cube and i love cars but not enough to know how they work let alone fix them myself    older mercs are the best used car deal though i love seeing s600s going for the same as a fucking focus
  ferd had a solid lineup at least
  i was just gonna mention lmao in my general area there was a w220 like mine but an s600 in immaculate condition    for 6500    or you could have a used camry your choice lmao    i hear you about not wanting to repair the car yourself or knowing how its just the way it is and thats why the mercedes is so depreciated they are going to kill you if you take it to the dealer for repairs so people just get the fuck rid of them when theyre old    a crown vic would be a great second car you wont be in the shop for much more than oil changes with a bulletproof platform like that leagues above a fucking accord depending on who you ask i guess lol
  what mate that generation focus fusion and taurus were all trash vic is the only not trash car in the lineup but people arent going to buy that over a corolla or civic
  what if they made a cash 4 clunkers but you got to trade in politicians instead
  they just didnt like the look of it or having a big car honestly preferred them for city driving felt like i was in a tank and people couldnt intimidate me no wonder why taxi companies loved em
  they are tanks and people do get out of the way because they know its a tank as well    love me a big car god damn
  literally a holocaust for cars
wait what happened
  older cars that could not pass state emissions or lemons could be donated to a cash back program     most of the cars could still be driven in their condition and sold for greater than the program offered the money paid for their donated cars were not enough to technically buy a new or good car most people that participated ended up having a car that was in essence a less value than their donated car the gap of the new and used car market grew wider cars that were not a high value became inflated while new car sales were increased for lower valued economy models the cars most likely a candidate for cash 4 clunkers back then are now named as survivors      tldr the consumers in the car market lost while a new shift in the automobile market began its degradation of build quality
  eurotard here    what was this cash4clunkers about you basically turned in your old car and got a discount when buying a new car    doesnt really sound so bad
  damn even cars underwent a genocide
  its not bad for the consumers that made use of it if you look at the top 10 tradedins most of the vehicles were piles of shit probably rotting in the driveway of some relative that didnt drive it and just passed it to someone else that was looking to buy a new car they wanted anyways which wasnt a newer version of the american broken down pile of shit they hated    it did nothing positive using the countrys money to please some people that were going to buy a car anyway
  same as the abwrackprämie brudi
atleast the environment has been saved
  before c4c people would buy a cheap shitbox ride it for a couple years till it diedbecause it wouldnt be worth anything to sell or tradethen they bought another cheap shitbox lather rinse repeat  you can still do that if you are willing not to buy japanese by cheap i assume you mean less than 2000 and working and passing local safety inspection
  cash for clunkers was based on mpg not ability to pass emissions or safety inspection you then got a 4000or so government backed credit on the purchase of a new car that would get better mpg    the old car then had the oil drained and silicate poured into the crankcase then was run till the engine destroyed itself car was then sent to the scrapyard    there are some videos of engines running for minutes up to 10 with nothing but the silicate fluid in the crankcase one video had a bmw 530 that just didnt want to die its worth a watch if you like that kind of morbid stuff
  it was toyota honda and nissan all benefited from the program far more than any us auto manufacturerwhich were the companies the program was started to benefit  the sale of any car goes towards the gdp  as does the finance that most people need to buy a new car  it was not about helping your local auto industry but about bumping up your gdp  most western countries gdp is floated on debt and second hand cars do not bring in the dollars like a brand new one
  we have something like this in italy called bonus rottamazione they first introduced it in 1998 and it wiped off 80 of 90s and 80s cars on the road people wrongfully think that newer equals better and safer to this day i havent met one person who hasnt regretted scrapping their old car  because of retards you cant find spares for the fiesta mk3 anymore junkyard guy straightup called it prehistoric  its the 1992my  fucking normalfags
  someone scrapped their db7  21 scrapped 4wd eagles  50 c4 corvettes  mfw
  nobody fucking scrapped a fucking db7 you absolute mong there is literally no way anyone who had possession of a db7 thought it was only worth 4000 and there is no way a dealership wouldnt have taken advantage of someone trying to bring on in to resell it and make a massive profit there were a lot of errors in the database
  got a lot of trash off the roads it was a success in my book
i have a leak in the middle of my car on the exhaust that makes the car smell horrible and a completely severed pipe 10 inches up from the muffler i want to fix both things and just got quoted 300 for it is that a rip off
  blame alan blinder for coming up with this
  that was the worst part they had to destroy the engine and then crush the entire vehicle and send it to the scrap yard it was illegal to salvage the usable body panels transmissions or anything which also hurt consumers who wanted / needed a used or rebuilt part for those vehicles
  you can save a lot of money wrenching if you have some basic tools thats the biggest motivating factor for me
  such a fucking waste    this is what a retard looks like everyone
    this and also there were plenty of stories of people who traded in cars like 3000gt vr4s and supra turbos and those cars quietly disappeared off the lots in the middle of the night
get bailed out  outsource your shit to china anyway    let them fail
  not only that i had this 1988 oldsmobile cutalss ciera great car btw virtually indestructible and would have loved to melt it down for a new car the problem was that the program stipulated that you had to prove that it had been insured for a particular length of time and i never paid car insurance fucking bitchass obama sold it later for the same amount i paid after driving it for 5 years
  i never paid car insurance    fuck you
  suck my dick you bitchass faggot im not paying twice my cars value every year to some kike casino every single policy has uniinsured motorist coverage if you want insurance go ahead but dont force me to buy something i dont need i drove with no insurance for 5 years and literally nothing happened
  you are literally why i have to pay for uninsured motorist insurance
  sucks for you why dont you juust stop paying have you ever even filed a claim
  every single policy has uniinsured motorist coverage    no they dont its an optional coverage optional but one that you better fucking get because of douches like you      not him but yes yes i have got rear ended a couple of years ago on the freeway in dallas the idiot tried to zip across 5 lanes of stop and go traffic while going 60mph to hit his exit he clipped my truck bounced off and slammed into the car in the lane next to me they both went and slammed into the wall and took out a pickup truck full of mexicans and concrete working tools on the way that one jackass totaled 4 vehicles
  if i stop paying and i get pulled over ill get a bigger fine lose my license and then lose my job     in that order
  and here he is the faggot that ruined everybodys day
cash for clunkers ruined the used car market in one fell swoop
  just keep driving thats how they do it in metro detroit
  looks pretty punchable
  what car was his
  the eclipse in      he came from a couple lanes to my left and clipped my truck the blue dodge then bounced off and hit the blue car hard right in the drivers side door they both went and slammed into the wall right in front of the mexicans in the chevy and the chevy ended up crunching into rear end of the blue car that poor guy wasnt doing too good
  ouch
  yeah luckily it was just a glancing blow on my truck it didnt even knock my coffee cup out of the cupholder still rekt the bed of my truck and jammed it into the cab a little on the passenger side causing enough damage to total the vehicle out  /    i feel bad for the guy in the blue car though he left in an ambulance at least he was conscious and didnt seem too injured that kid in the eclipse shouldve been beaten down and left on the side of the freeway after the cops had finished taking everyones statements
talking about fucked prices for used cars ive been looking for a used ranger for some time now they are either old as fuck with high mileage or anything near the end of the last gen 20082011 gets listed for 10k the base model was only 18k towards the end of the run and thats what many people have i doubt they paid full price either
its a fairly sought after dependable vehicle thats been out of production for 8 years of course theyre gonna be pricey also small pickups in general seem to hold their value very well compared to their full sized siblings for some reason
  its the cheapest choice the pricing for tacomas or frontiers is even worse
  you can probably buy a similar year model  mileage full sized pickup for less thats what i would do
  are they as reliable the 4 cylinder ranger are supposedly bulletproof
  probably more so because the ranger has used the same basic design since it started production in 83
  ford f150 with the 46l v8 is good stay away from the newer 54l triton v8    dodge 57l hemi v8 is good dont touch the 47l hemi its trash    chevy 53l vortec engine is good    i dont know about any of the v6 offerings for 1/2 ton trucks
  are you the guy with 20s on his rusty clapped merc
  i worked a side hustle at a salvage yard during the c4c program all the cars that came in had their engines seized except for one an rx7 of all things still ran it ran like crap but it ran
  legally to qualify for cash for clunkers the vehicle had to be in drive able condition so youre either lying or your employer was committing multiple felonies
  was it dealers or the salvage yards that had to seize the engines
  hmm i honestly dont know it mightve been the dealers which is why almost all the vehicles you received had seized engines already all i know is they had to drive the car onto the lot for it to qualify they couldnt just trailer a pile of scrap up there that wouldnt even turn over
  we need cash for clunkers 20 i got cars to trade in fuck poor people
  if your car is so valueless its worth trading into cash for clunkers you are the poorfag
  lol most of the shitboxes traded in under c4c wasnt worth what they got he said cars anyway
  cars  multiplying by 0 does not increase the value no matter how many times you do it
  every car has value as scrap at the least so 0 isnt really possible c4c tradein value was 3500 at the minimum and went up to 4500
  hello friend
    the most retarded thing was the requirement for the cars not being too shitty to prevent people from turning in literal scrap for money and having the engines destroyed    so many good cars and engines were lost green my ass
  it wasnt just about being green it was about getting cars on the road that were compliant with new safety regulations
   an rx7 of all things still ran it ran like crap but it ran  when you apex seals are so far gone its impossible to seize  like sickle cell saving you from malaria
my dad traded in his 98 expedition that was falling apart with 250k miles on it for whatever the max cfc payment was i forget the expedition was probably worth only 500 for scrap because it had so much shit that needed fixing and we got like 4500 towards a 2009 highlander i was 16 at the time and i learned to drive on the ford and the power steering mustve been out or something because i had to put my whole body just to turn that tank
  it was illegal to salvage the usable body panels transmissions or anything which also hurt consumers who wanted / needed a used or rebuilt part for those vehicles    wrong i worked a used car lot and went to many salvage auctions with owner and his bros i also read the cfc rules we bartered for parts from salvage yards and i got to loot many cfc hulks before they went to the shredder the body panels not the actual hull/cab with vin were fair game as was anything not destroyed by silicate transmissions were perfectly legal to harvest along with axles transfer cases and any external engine accessories such as pumps alternators etc doors interiors glass electrical accessories etc were fair game rolling chassis could not be sold but everything nonsilicated attached to same could be and usually was raped   silicate was poured into the crankcase directly leaving fuel system parts unharmed    there are millions of vehicles so the impact of a few desirables wasnt shit in the real world more crash every day while a few vehicles poorfags fap to seem impressive to the simple the vehicle population was and is enormous     2009 might as well be 1809 its over
  they are gutless and today they are older than dirt mechanic here i buy used full size fords and chevys plentiful used parts huge aftermarket
  the salvage yard didnt silicate the engines the dealers did then the dealers auctioned off the vehicles salvage yards bought them at copart and other dealer auctions like charity cars they were cheap salvage yard food
  but fuck me i cant believe what they are asking for even  fucking this  the used market is so fucked where i am  cant find a decent older unit which is what i like to drive and going newer than i want to say late 2000s2010 is so fucked people want 20k for their clapped out half ton with over 200k kms on it i just had some bitch wipe out my 2004 jeep grand cherokee which was a nice unit went to a local used auto dealer to look at a 2007 tacoma rusty  few dents in it and 200k on it  the guy tells me 18k i laughed
  inb4 c4c2 gets initiated by the next presidency to eradicate the last pre2000s ice cars
  2009 might as well be 1809 its over  what did he mean by that
  yup     i still dont regret buying it
  power to you brother i hate the fucking insurance companies
  im not mad a t them as theyre just trying to earn a buck by providing a valuable service what i dont like is it being made illegal to drive without it especially when the insurance costs more than the value of my car per 6 month term ive been driving for almost 20 years and never had an accident or filed a claim
  i agree completely except im definitely mad at the insurance companies too they tend to total cars over minor accidents plus theyll hike your rates for using the service you already pay for rates are even more insane if you live in a city like detroit from horror stories ive heard costs something like 3 to 4x the price if you live in the city which is understandable considering the heightened risk to the vehicle but when mandated by the state it makes it hard to get ahead for people in super low income so everybody in surrounding metro areas definitely need to pay extra too for uninsured/underinsured coverage
  i think thats more of a problem with us companies in europe they have no right to total the car
someone traded in a maserati biturbo and they couldnt kill it because it wouldnt start
  not sure the newer models are any better desu
  blinder was born to a jewish family6 in brooklyn new york    they cant keep getting away with it
  michigan car insurance is completely fucked no matter where you are
  mpg was the quinsetial marketing tactic mid 2000 20mpg combined should have been the acceptable average back then now we have cars in which thier mpg never improved for power as they got heavier now its about safety or power as a selling point
  oy vey the goyim know
  at least he is hanging his head in shame
  was he uninsured

/ccg/  classic cars general    most wonderful time of the year edition    in the last episode     cutlass bought a new shitheap   coastie still never listens   sc has a gold tooth  dracs rolls is still broke    cars are considered classic at 25 years old but a vehicle really needs that certain something to be classic  everybody has their own taste but some tastes are wrong if you arent sure if your car is classic or not its not  american european japanese or whatever  however your honda miata doesnt count as a classic yet 80s hondas are better suited for their own generals as well everything else is fair game  post your classic your work on it your hackery and get advice  any and all discussion about classics welcome but may not necessarily generate responses dont get butthurt  period correct performance  cosmetics  metal  plastic  classic shitbox  modern shitbox  its required to use rtv ignore the haters  jbweld can fix almost anything  if you see rust there is probably more  rust and bodywork are by far the most difficult thing to repair  electrical work is second most difficult unless you stop reading forum posts and buy a multimeter  youre never actually going to finish that engine swap stop pretending  do not buy a classic and plan to pay somebody to work on it you need to be able to do 90 or greater of the work or you will go broke  you will inevitably spend twice your budget unless you have years of experience under your belt if all the salty old hands agree its probably true  no one cares about your mpg
  everything ive done to the firebird has been 5k all the things needed to make the swap to work totaled about 3k
this is what im thinking about buying next summer
all the things needed to make the swap to work totaled about 3k  mine was about the same 2600 you didnt change the cam and springs in yours right and its a 60e interesting trade off if my memory is correct  cam and springs but th350  4l60e but stock cam and springs
    oh fuck
  what is the art style in ops pic ive always really liked it
  3k after you sold off the doner truck    saw this and ive gotta be missing something  7778 nose  warped beyond crazy  1800    i also found a nose at the junkyard but they were crazy wanting 800 for it especially being cracked and felt really rough i was thinking maybe 100 since id have to redo the entire thing
  fuck forgot pic
  endura parts are expensive retard youd be better off just buying the fucking car you want in the first place
  retard  what did he mean by this
  1970s gm advertisements all used that style for years no idea its actual name though     i still dont have a nose after 2 years they are hard to find and expensive
  nice at least i have a place to start looking
  found the artist   
shes been out causing trouble this afternoon
  ok but what is different for this nose compared to a regular one      i found several on ebay are you looking for an all original never damaged or something im ok with remade fiberglass nose
sorry about leaving yall hanging with the new thread i forgot that when im at my parents house it basically locks me out because of ip range i was able to sneak in one post then it locked me out not even going into airplane mode fixed it     anyway im back at summit right now the carb they gave me last night has a fucked up choke and bent linkage fucking bullshit hopefully third times the charm    i put a gauge on my fuel pump and its pushing exactly 7 psi i have a pressure regulator to put on if needed i want to try it without first and see if it will be fine at 7 if for some reason it overpowers the floats and dumps fuel because of too much pressure that wont damage anything will it i dont think it will but just want to make sure
    i have a better one in my garage
      absolutely disgusting
  yea stock 53 is plenty of power and its a daily so its nice getting that mpg boost from the overdrive i get about 20 mpg combined    3k isnt alot considering its an investment in reliability an efficiency
  buy donor truck with 63k miles  after fees 2800  sell 2400 in parts  thats 400 for engine trans and all the wiring and computer  300 for headers plus 120 to weld in 4 o2 sensors and 2 cats that came from the truck  400 for fbody oil pan and pickup tube  550 for overkill radiator  about 300 for all the various fuel fittings  200 for mounts  180 for intake  75 for programming  150 for drive shaft shortening  miscellaneous stuff here and there
  hows it going crow anon
    the shit i find on craigslist
  all caps  boomers man
car has all drum brakes  but also a huge power booster  when pulling out of house its easily to accidentally lock front brakes  later when driving  sometimes braking works just fine  sometimes though i can push the pedal all the way through brake boost with barely any effect  pushing a little harder makes it stop but makes it easy to lock one of the rear wheels  perfectly fine again the next time i drive    is this the ordinary brake fade that old car ads would say is eliminated by the disc brake option or is there some other problem i should be looking for
ive got a 77 camaro right now bought it from an old guy that had it sitting in his barn  blew the 350 up and put a stock low compression 305 with a massive cam in its place  ive done everything i can to get the thing running good and it runs horrible super anemic and smokes like crazy  i really just want to sell the car and make some cash off it  but i cant decide if i just wanna put a new cam in the old 305 or respray the car and put a rebuilt 350 in it    what do you think classic br/o/s
  drums are self energizing hence the shitty feel    id inspect the brakes by removing the drums and consider replacing the soft hoses which can deteriorate internally because any car with all drums is older than most people flushing fresh fluid through the system will help it live longer i expect the old fluid looks like black coffee or snot or milky if moisture got to it
  massive cams are a common noob error spray it install a crate motor its not worth diy any more and i enjoy building engines and go drive it  do not install a race motor unless its a real race car they suck on the street
  cant spend a bunch of money on a crate motor if i just wanna sell it ive got 3 spare 350s  and yeah i agree race motors arent fun to daily
  henlo fren
  so you put in a fucked 305 at this point probably cut your losses by the time you get a proper engine and paint job on it youll be way too into the red best bet is probably fix the 305 either way its a late 2nd gen camaro which arent worth nearly as much
  no i got it with the 305 in it wish it wasnt in there trust me
  i should probably check the fluid soon ive never done so in the 6 months ive had the car since it was the bolted on style of master cylinder lid instead of the stiff clamp
  sounds like multiple things could be bad brake hoses go bad over time especially if it sits for years mechanical brake parts could be intermittently locked up and/or wheel cylinders leaking when wheel cylinders leak and brake fluid gets on the friction material it can cause the wheels to immediately lock up like that i second the vote for a brake system rebuild take it apart see whats bad if its been sitting for a long time or if the vehicle is old and brake parts of unknown quality/age/wear/origin i always do new master cylinder wheel cylinders hoses if old and shitty/no brake operation shoes/pads hardware kit and flush lines if the power booster is working dont worry about it
  cont accidentally send too early  i paid 2500 for the car  the old man blew up the race motor that was in it a shoved that cam in the 305 it has now  its got a 700r4 and disc brake 10 bolt in it now  i ended up selling my last 1976 camaro for around 8000 but it was just a plain jane 2 barrel 350 car   of course it was a lot nicer
  roastie giving advice to anyone    do not take advice from coastie at this point hes more than proven his incompetence and inability to make good decisions
  sounds like leaky brake cylinders and gummed up components you can rebuild drum brakes pretty cheap but be prepared to run new line in case
  ah ok thanks anon
  anon what have you done i may be incompetent at most stuff engine related but im all too familiar with the 2nd gen camaro market brake systems and painting
  awesome thanks
just hit up oreilly autozone and hf to check out some of the tools i need valve spring compressor was literally the exact same thing at all 3 same with harmonic balancer puller and piston ring compressor so i got those all at hf the oreilly 3 stone cylinder hone looked a lot nicer from oreilly so im probably picking that up tomorrow lastly autozone has the cylinder ridge reamer as a free loaner for 25 buck deposit but orielly has it as a brand new purchase for 39 is this something i should trust as a loaner its advertised as tungsten carbide permanently sharp blades but idk if i wanna take the chance fucking my cylinders at the same time 40 dollar purchase that can be avoided and had for free is also tempting   oh one more thing engine lift plate do i need it i have the lever for my hoist so idk i also want to try to put the engine back in with the heads and intake manifold already sealed bolted and torqued to spec so i cant be using intake bolts or head bolts as the mounting points for the hoist should i use a water pump bolt or something
  coastie telling someone to cut their losses
  if youre comfortable with the idea of a computer in your classic you can install a chevy 53 its a bolt in 300 hp engine that will wake it up
  i always bolted my engine harness into into the heads ive done this many times with aluminum heads and no ill effects it saves a few bucks
  where in the heads bud the head to block bolt holes or like outside on the accessory bolt holes
  lm7 i dont know if ive told you this before but i admire the work you did to your bird you did a bang up job on that entire swap
  yeah i dont have a problem with ls stuff i tune a lot of newer cars but for the money id rather build a bbc my last ls swap ended up being about the same as the 454 ive got now    im just trying to make the car the most appealing for resale spending the least time/money on it  so its a lot less effort to just swap the cam to a driver cam and sell it for 3500  than it would be to try and swap the motor and respray for 
  the outside ones like on the face of the head
  your circular logic amazes me you use it whenever someone calls you out on your bullshit its not about what ive done because im not a beginner larping as a seasoned mechanic like you are im not giving advice to anyone you should do the same
  i can hear that image vibrating
  sorry if im being a retard but im still confused the inside face like the intake manifold bolt holes the outside ones exhaust manifold holes or front and back accessory bolt holes cuz ideally id have the intake manifold already on and torque when i put it back in
anyone here use oils with a high zddp content im thinking of getting an f150 with a 300 cu inline six next week
  its actually not that bad
  that file name  someone near me has that as their license plate their car is whited out but im not sure if they realize the full connotation of what they did
  thats just my online name  i use an im service to send pics from my phone on to my pc and the im saves it like that  but i feel like if thats their plate and the cars all white they knew what they were doing
  i usually just use a zddp additive  finding oil with zddp already in it is kinda hard
for some reason the gear on my camshaft that turns the distributor sheared off  half of the teeth are just stripped right out  the gear on the dist is completely fine though as is the oil pump and shaft  everything else appears fine  how does this even happen
  front and back accessory holes
  ah well i would think snowman would be probable cause to get pulled over is all im saying       are you running a high volume or high pressure oil pump
  nope its all stock
  fuck  even i didnt think that  stop doing so much coke man
  i give advice where i know about stuff i also seek it here like anyone else i may like to do things that others dont approve of here but ive still done enough wrenching
  you guys didnt get the coke reference lmao   if i ever fall on hard luck i push the white shit on the streets like a salt truck     lack of lube was your oil good when it happened new cam or new distributor sometimes the teeth arent the correct type for the drive gear hardness or brittleness couldve happened if you cooked your camshaft recently
whats everyone think of a 1972 comet or 1969 acadian beaumont they both turned up for sale locally
  i didnt know this was an option but it seems obvious in hind sight thank you
i didnt know uber let their drivers ride motorcycles now my wife said she was going to get her nails done i was suprised when a black guy pulled up on a motorcycle and she said that was her uber he had a helmet for her so i guess its fine
well boys here it is my 72 luxury lemans it has serface rust all overdented to shit a hole in the door no interior the drivetrain is separate and the paint has burned off     its perfect and im excited
every single person in this thread is a boomer
  hole
  thats a strange spot for rust
  weight reduction
  it looks like someone took a pickaxe to it     its seen better days but for 1250 i think it wasnt a bad deal im going to build the 400 into a 455 and put a muncie in it along with a position read end im going to keep the stripped interior and just try and put in a bench seat and some gadges ill be using it to commute to work at a gettho highschool so i think its perfect for the job
  gt37 4 speed that my dad got from the same guy its in much better shape with no rust or dents only problem is telling terrible spray job his plan is to put in a 71 455 ho engine and restore the body to what it looked like stock
  the oil was good  the distributor is somewhat newish i guess  i think i replaced it about 10 months ago with a summit hei
  i appreciate the compliment its nice to have a place on /o/ where my experience is valued and i have to thank you for being there to help me with the various questions i had with the f150     youre not going to get much flipping classics unless you get the car for nothing and it happens to be in good shape
  damn lol i know high school kids are shit but youre going to some drastic measures
  that wheel turn  is it supposed to be doing that    wouldnt suprise me one bit if it was accident damage    i know lemans arent very popular so will you be able to find dash parts
  are you trolling coastie or do you actually believe that was an urber    or is this even coastie or just a larper
r8 h8  
  its a diverse high school that boast a 1 white attendance     the car needs some work as i said the drivetrain is getting a complete overall and we are going to make our own wiring harness for it and put in a plastic plate with some gauges instead of a dash and stripping power steering and power breaks to try and keep it as light as possible we are also planning to hook up a nitrous kit as we go we are probably going to come up with more things to fix and change but we havent even started the striping yet so our grand plans are just budding  our goal is a 125 second 1981 age correct street car and the hole in the door is here for good    pic is of what it would have looked like in 72
  larper
  who the fuck do you think you are
  im dirty dan
  no youre pinhead im dirty dan
  pls respond
  i know nothing about trucks sorry friend
  you retard
  mfw that would easily go for 10k cad up here in ontario  id buy that immediately the rebuilt trans may be questionable though
  negro camo i see its briliant
  ghettoflauge        coastie develops schizophrenia
live pd dracula has an outstanding warrant edition     also none of those are the real coastie seeing as how he posts as coastival now
          
          i want  all these barges  i have  no space to park them
  shhhh dont tell them
  i didnt do it    driving while black
  post pics of distributor gears    im gonna bet the distributor gear mesh with the cam was not right for some reason most of the time with factory parts it works without issue but sometimes the distributor gear is too high or too low and shims are needed to correct the chances of that happening on aftermarket parts is quite a bit higher     now that i think about it though the description could also include gear damage from incompatible materials like steel gear on iron cam
alright guys new carb is pouring fuel out the overflow i have a 5 psi regulator on it why is it doing that can it do that if the bowl level is not adjusted properly
  by overflow you mean the bowl vent  try adjusting the float level first  
    oh wait heres the actual procedure  
  yes i believe its the bowl vent too high of a level shouldnt cause it to dump out that should it
  if its so far out of adjustment that its wide open all the time then yeah thats the path of least resistance
  i got it adjusted down to the proper level in the primary and its still shooting out of the vent the secondary bowl will not adjust properly anytime i make an adjustment the level just goes up no matter which way i go     im going to fucking kill somebody at holley everything on the car is right i have a stock mechanical fuel pump with a 5 psi regulator and a good filter how the hell do i get three bad carbs in a row
79 camaro guy trys to go from grease monkey to legitimate
everywhere im reading says bad needle and seat or float ive found multiple different posts exactly like mine all with the same one of two results bad needle and seat or float    
i keep finding ugly surprises in my javelin    found out why the speedometer doesnt work and its not because of a missing cable or not completely due to a missing cable    i pulled the speedometer housing out which looked strange to me considering the trans is essentially a torqueflite 727 with a bolt pattern on the bellhousing to fit amc motors i mean it was already stupid enough the retaining clamp was missing replace with a ziptie around the remnants of the old cable    as it turns out there is no gear on the end of the pinion for the trans to turn whats more this particular year of trans 1974 had a unique housing and cable assembly as well as drive gear i suppose i can go to mother mopars tried and true housing and gear along with cable but i have no idea whether the speedo will be anywhere close to right thats before figuring out what tooth count i think i need for this trans and rear gear ratio dont know that either    getting the correct parts is out of the question for both the drive gear and the speedo cable    amc used the chrysler housing before 74 and after 1974 literally tried this faggotry for one year for god knows what reason    i suppose if thats my biggest issue right now thats not bad in the scale of things took a better look around the underside of the car its very solid aside from some mild floor repair on the drivers side trunk
  the fuck
  the cops finally caught ol dracula for that outstanding warrant
  fuck you and your sideways pictures
  you are in no way qualified to give advice on anything here advising anon to rebuild a 305 is just frosting on the cake for all the shit you screw up i would respect you more if you actually listened to the good advice here and got your car sorted out as of now youre the perfect example of what not to do
    this is correct dubs confirm
  i said to just fix it not rebuild he shouldnt sink any more money into it but youll always get more for a working car
  coasties trademark circular logic at work
  you dont need to be giving advice on the overall plan for someones project when yours is a failed abortion trying to do nose swaps because you yet again ignored advice and bought the wrong car
    whats wrong with a 73 nose swap on a 7778 trans am    oh thats right its retarded
  so let me understand your logic you think anon should put in the effort ant money to engine swap and paint a late model camaro so spending a bunch of money on a vehicle that has a pretty low resale vs spending just enough to to unfuck his engine which i assume he knows how to do thus cutting cost even more and just selling the car      so because i like the idea of doing a different nose and tail combo my car is a failed abortion and my word is meaningless i know ive come on here to ask questions and that i commit the sin of taking my car to a shop more often than those here but its not like im telling people to do retarded ass shit its my car and ill do as i please with it which just happens to trigger some of yall    10/10 bait though yall got me to get pissed at a basket weaving forum cause of some business riders
  bus riders      79 so really nothing of value is lost since people here are adamant about it being the ugliest nose
    i still feel thats a bad idea either you have to explain to people that ask its a 79 or be a poser and pretend its a different year because you bought a car with a style you didnt like
  cant into basic crankcase venting  cant into basic fuel tank venting  cant into basic radiator pressurizing    wow guys its amazing what putting the right parts on car will do     yeah no fucking shit you dumbass   holy shit youre ficking retarded your car is a pile of shit because you cant do or understand a lot of basic shit just because you understand a few things doesnt mean you know enough to be giving advice of any kind i remember the giant debacle when you bought your current car everyone told you not to because it was a pile and the front end is ugly now you want to nose swap it and make it more of an abomination  guys im just being different   no youre being fucking retarded      it needs to go in the sticky do not take advice from coastie because clearly he wont accept that hes not at the level to be giving advice
  just the same as those who do a 7778 swap and im bit hiding the fact that its a 79 because i love the rear end
there are just too many incidents at this point to count them all up youre clearly a beginner still and thats fine just take your ego back a notch and accept it
    i dont care for people that do that either but at least its closer in model year and design
  clearly youre making shit up because i never came here about it before i bought it
  i never claimed i was an expert i wasnt claiming that anon should buy specific parts or anything i just dont think a late 2nd gen camaro is worth putting money in something that many here have agreed on
  im surprised the amount of hate the 2nd gen is getting i think theyre going up more now than they have been in the past few years  i recently attended an auction in dallas where there were several late 2nd gens in fact there were only rubber bumper cars there  if i recall correctly the cheapest one went for 15k
what up my dudes reminder chevy is ass
alright guys i really need some help from the carb gurus it would be much appreciated    i pulled the main bowl off nothing is wrong with the needle valve and seat or the float its all working properly i havent put it back on yet to see if its still pushing fuel out the vent but i didnt find anything wrong float was installed properly and the needle valve and seat are sealing i checked by blowing on it by mouth phrasing i have a stock mechanical pump with a 5 psi regulator two filters a washable reusable glass filter and a porous metal filter on the carb one at each bowl i dropped and cleaned the tank last week got a lot of crap out theres some residual coming up the line every now and then but i have two filters to catch it i havent found any debris inside the bowl whatsoever    the only thing i can think at this point is a fracture in the case or bowl somewhere or a sunk float but im able to adjust the bowl level and confirm with the sight glass i read about the fracture on a searched forum post not sure how likely that would be to get two bad carbs like that
    i kno wat i got
  based
  could the regulator be bad out of the box
  reminds me of the challenger that had been through the cali fires with all the sheet metal warped and somebody was asking 60k for
  i doubt it but i can put my gauge on it the pump is only putting out 7 psi anyway i measured it
  actually not a terrible value considering the mopar tax id modern hemi swap that in a heartbeat
  thats actually a fairy reasonable price
      to each their own i suppose me personally i wouldnt go past about 7k if that assuming all the parts are there aside from drivetrain    then again i never cared for the 7274 the grille is ugly to me fucking insane how expensive chrysler cars are nowadays even the abodies are starting to climb into fuckyou territory
  theres a mid 60s thunderbird in the same situation
  cant post pics right now because its parked out in the woods an hour away  i checked the part listing on summit again to make sure the distributor gear is the right material  it says the gear is iron so i assume thats supposed to mean its cast but there are some worrying posts in the review section  someone said that the gear looked like it might actually be steel and asked summit to confirm the material  summit replied by stating that a steel gear will work fine with a cast iron camshaft  ill have to double check it next time im out there to work on it but i think summit might have fucked up my camshaft
  coastie you suck you just do
  found it the description is just boomer delusion    
  nothing some turtle wax want take care of
  good god those wheels nothing some turtle wax wont take care of inner guys werent touched the interior is fucking charcoal and the paint is toast this reeks of boomer
  honestly i was like thats not too bad  but then i got to the interior pic  ill give you a crisp 100 bill and a firm handshake
  what year if its newer enough to have a roller cam theres noi point in using zddp additives or oil that has more zddp
engine hoist fully assembled its surprisingly compact when folded up which is nice since u know im a guest in this driveway and all i was checking out my combustion chambers and they actually look like there gonna be the 64cc ones i know you cant just eyeball shit like that but 70 cc heads are usually a lot more open and wide these are almost perfectly round
  chevy alone made more cars on any given year then all chryslers brands combined its simply supply and demand
on hold with summit techline right now its still dumping fuel going to kill
  i would ask the manufacturer directly instead  dont trust summits tech support they dont know shit
  have you scrubbed out the fuel inlet
bondo is fucken gaye
    im starting to think that fine debris is getting past the filters and clogging the needle and seat our next step is going to be to purge the lines put in a paper filter to catch absolutely everything and run it off a clean 5 gallon gas can i can see our clear filter catching stuff but small stuff may be getting past it i got the floats adjusted properly and its still spitting it out the vent so thats a project for another day im done for today
  the first carb i put on it ran in 5 second spurts until it sucked up old fuel and debris then i pulled the tank out and cleaned it and put it back in the it started spraying fuel out of the vent were still getting some debris caught in the filter so i think we need to try cleaning out both bowls the line and running it with a better filter off of a clean source this is the second carb thats doing it so im thinking were getting debris i checked the needle/seat and float on this carb and its all good this is the last thing it could be
  are you a canuck
welp didnt get the motor out but its literally just on by the two motor mounts and trans crossmember next weekend shes coming off
  no 
harbor freight 301 piece set puttin in work
  perfectly fits inside your cuck shed
  oh snap i just realized i have the exact same set bought it in 2011 when i started most of it still works although its split up between all my different tool kits at this point just for home use it wont stand up to daily professional use
  yea i dont use it for work but its nice because it folds up and stashes in that little molded box with everything labeled for ease of use and that way i can leave my tools at work
  i just love old steel toolboxes to use the harbor freight eggcrate stuff its a totally impractical preference i know someone stole my favourite toolbox recently though i wouldnt have missed it as much if it was just a cookie cutter hft piece
  love old steel toolboxes to use  too much to use
whats the fattest tire you can fit on your average rim i know its a very broad question
  if you have 3 spare 350s just toss one of those in there
  im working on a 78 camaro now any tips you can give me
  yes hello i am 79sc kameros replace  it is imperative that you throw the biggest blower on it that you possibly can
  youre gonna have to ask something a bit more specific than that
  anything in particular im by no means a master or anything but if i can help ill be happy to
      i use this backspace will play big role in if rim and tire will touch frame most classic rwd 68in wide wheel youll be ok with 3545 if going reallywide you want more negative offset so closer to 335
im sure its a judge clone but it was still really pretty nice suprise to see at lunch havent seen this one at any of the local car showes ive been to and i thought i knew every classic in this town
since its a slow night ill post another from today dad in law climbing in my engine bay to loosen the heat shield for the motor harness i apologize for the screen shot the og photo was 425mb and resizing and cropping made it 52 for some wierd reason
busy with edsel
  lmao replace me    looking great drac i wish i was your neighbor
  well im planning on getting spacers for the rear so im not so much worried about hitting more concerned with the tire sealing to the rim i guess kind of the opposite of stance fags stretching their tires obviously not to that extreme
  that would be an improvement    the wife and i spent part of the day cleaning off the overspray im teaching her to sand the runs in the paint and do the tedious things i dont want to do myself
    cant tell if kit car or retarded owner
well gentleman an important decision was made today this will no longer be a compliant vehicle since im pulling off the heads and pulling the whole motor and trans and fuel delivery system and smog items and all that trash and its getting put back together with brodix iron killer 200cc runner 70cc combustion chamber aluminum heads and a comp cams extreme energy blower cam and lifters with my existing rollers and forged flat top pistons and pushrods and new 040 piston rings after i crosshatch the bores thats a lot of shit to break in all at once and i dont want to take any chances with driveability tuning issues from my antiquated emissions system fucking up my break in the car needs to start the first time and then rev to 2k for 20 minutes and im not gonna do that on all brand new gear with my suspect quadrajet mechanical fuel pump and all the smog shit everythings getting bypassed blocked off and deleted new heads dont have exhaust crossover and so ill just put a blocker plate on intake manifold at the egr air pump getting deleted completely and all lines capped off and efe getting stuck open since its welded into my exhaust but stuck open is like its not thereall that im keeping is pcv for obvious reasons the blowers also getting a broader belt and over driving the pulley suspension and steering mods are going on first while i have room then the rebuilt motor and finally the efi kit to manage the engine
thoughts on pic interior looks complete and not terrible other than a cracked dash despite the modern seat transplant      wise man     my neighbors ride is looking worse than my rattle can camaro  rustoleum paint job nothing wrong with that  runs all over the place  tiger stripes  painted all the chrome  he painted over what used to be a pretty cool though very mexican paint job that had been destroyed with rust
  cant wait to see this beast uncucked how much power do you think itll be putting out
  so in other words youll have what 16 months to either escape that hellhole or to find an emissions guy that realizes the exhaust coming out of it is way cleaner than what it would be had you kept the original emissions equipment
  based and redpilled      wew lad looks like your days in cuckifornia are numbered now
    its not due for smog until like march or may of 2020 so i got a little ways to go to figure it out worse case scenario i can just dummy up everything on it non functionally i guess but ill be gone by then ideally    i actually did some resesrch on combos for blown motors and super chevy ran these heads with that cam on a dyno with stock cast internals and dished pistons and got 400ftlbs basically from off idle to 6000rpm which is nice they had like 751 static compression pre blower and they peaked at 451 ftlbs im bored a little bigger and have flat tops so ill have slightly more compression and should make a little more thump out of it but i might select thicker head gaskets just to be safe and lower the compression a little
  you might want to invest into some subframe connectors as well if my camaros na motor was torquey enough to twist the body i cant imagine yours wouldnt be worse    also   posted at midnight  sold by 6am  calling bs
    you dont need to be buying something else to fuck up anyways
coastie is the perfect candidate for a foxbody mustang
  shame theyre ugly as sin
want to buy car from 1970s  no garage or space to build one    good idea or bad idea
  if you buy a driver that doesnt leak water inside youre fine i had several while living in an apartment granted doing big jobs are next to impossible but you make do
  agreed fairmonts are much sexier
hello friends im back with a t/a update i got all my parts for the munice hopefully this winter ill get the rest of the sheet metal to patch this cunt back together       unrelated i have a problem with my new dd plz no hate my 2ss is making a racket basically in every gear around 1k4k at low speeds theres the metallic rattle happening in the transmission area i have the typical irs clunk if i dont release the clutch right but this sounds like that however its a continuous rattle seems to get louder with rpm however i cant hear it when revving in neutral so it only happens when the motor is under load and when its warmed up
  it only has 20k miles on it so i dunno what the problem is if anyone has experience with tremec or late model style transmissions id appreciate it
locals selling fox stangs  thinking anything related to foxes is worth 10k    i love foxes but holy fuck i hate boomers
    why would you ever waste money on a new car i bet you could have gotten a nice 06 gto for what your paying the bank to have that pos
    did you check all your fluids
    sounds like its time to use that warranty
  does your garage double as a basement that looks so fucking comfy
  i like the 5th gen camaros sue me       yup first thing i checked its for sure not the motor since its only heard when the tranny is in gear plus you can feel the shifter shake to the rattle      sounds like it fully expecting the its a performance car they make weird noises     yup half the basement is the garage weve got so much shit in it that im a little cramped but thatll change after we insulate our barn so my dad can move his wood shop out there and the second bay will be for my trans am and the primary for my camaro hes got the covered carport for his truck so all our cars stay rain free aside from my mas equinox that sits under the deck
      that was a little harsh i dont want to make it sound like a sob story but my grandpa who i was very close to always said he wanted one of the new camaros when they came out i like them too so i bought one kinda to remember him by i guess anyway i paid for it outright so only thing im paying is insurance that is cheaper than the truck i traded in for it
  i wouldnt say thats confrontational different anon from the one you replied to    i have full plans of tracking my grandfathers old nova throughout my adult life and making enough cash to buy it from whoever owns it someday even if it means overpaying the things we do for the ones we love know no budget sometimes    pic related was an ss bright red not the exact car in pic but you get the idea
  good luck man novas are cool as hell im hoping to hold on to my camaro and my t/a to give to my grandkids someday
  godspeed tanon    glad you can experience more than horsepower with your car
  rev up those warrantys
  welcome to tremec transmissions let me introduce you to my friend normal operation is it a t56 or a lower grade i had a t5 i believe in my 2004 mustang and it was ungodly loud i always thought it was once clutch dump away from grenading but a ford master transmission specialist told me it was noisy i have a t56 in my corvette but it sits on the rear axle so if its noisy i dont great it much       most underrated post in this thread
  told me it was normal
  pic related    hell if she grenades she grenades   already did some hard pulls with it so if it hasnt broken yet then it might be something ill have to live with like lux said about his t56    its a tr6060 ive read online about them being noisy before it bought it but it seems a little excessive if its above board ill put a louder exhaust on it to drown out the noise is your vette a manual or auto
picked up some wall art for my dad planning to mount some lights hang it in his shop and try not to get tetanus
  fucking kill me for got pic
  if someone kills you dibs on the corpse im using the carpool lane again
off topic but does anyone know where a fuel pump relay is on 2008 honda civic
  i feel like you have a corpse already
how much trouble and work for manual swapping an eddie bauer bronco
  idk shit about it bit id imagine not terribly hard since its just an suv f150 fabing the tunnel shortening the drive shaft should be the only custom work maybe running into a problem with the firewall if it wasnt a copy and paste from the trucks
  i think very few broncos of that gen came with manual surely parts would be available the custom work scares me
    the foureyes though
  well it was the t5 in my mustang was really noisy the noise was called gear rollover i dont remember all the details but it had to do with the way the gears were lined up on the shafts i think it was done in such a way that they were able to less bearings or they didnt have to use end caps or something im not exactly sure but it was noisy as hell sounded kind of the bad differential in this video   but not quite that bad and god forbid you accidentally drop the clutch too early at a stop and you get that throttle surge that manual transmission cars do sometimes it sounded the gear shafts were about to depart the case housing     now the t56 in my corvette is pretty quiet however its sitting on the rear axle and has a giant torque tube between the driver seat and it so even if it was noisy it wouldnt be quite as bad    also everyone should watch that video i linked the end is fantastic
  fuck me i tend to skip words quite a bit
  i love my quiet smooth auto trans
  and i love my streetfighter breaking my neck on both upshifts and downshifts     any of u guys buy a engine stand from harbor freight or can recommend a good budget one hold an assembled 350 reviews for the hf cheapest one are almost 50/50 good bad
  if youre not a canuck then why have i seen you make a joke post with your car on the vancouver region on craigslist
  it looks good until you open up the picture and see all the paint runs   looks way better than before at least
  ya know you can find carb legal 195cc aluminum heads right trick flow and air flow research do
  you could get a bronco with a manual transmission buy a donor vehicle
  loving autos   makes sense that your gay
where my fox bois at  havent posted here in a long time
  also looking for the guy who used to have a neon blue capri here on /o/ u still around my dood
  thats where our mwr gets everything we havent had anything bad with our engine stands
  dis one
  ywn own a 4 door fairmont
is it bad that i really want this i dont want to deal with the stupid expensive maintenance cost and poor reliability of a mercedes or bmw dont want to deal with constant repairs of a alfa lexus sports cars are pretty underwhelming to drive acura really doesnt wow me and infiniti makes nothing but inreliable turds
  i want this or a stinger gt looks like a solid car if only it was a little cheaper
  is it bad that i really want the car of the year winner  what do you think pal
  the stinger gt is actually one of the best four door cars released in a long time it has the fit and finish of a bmw or mercedes whole is really engaging to drive like the brz/86 its definitely worth checking out
  i almost pulled the trigger on a ceramic silver 18 stinger gt2 last week but someone beat me to it the dealer was selling it for 40k before taxes going to wait for another good deal to pop up
  weighs as much as a mustang  costs more than a mustang premium  auto only  100hp less  i just dont get it are backdoors really so important
  shut the fuck up nobody is crossshopping 2door muscle cars and 4door performance sedans     whines about auto only and lack of power yet the manual mustang gt is slower than the stinger gt at the drag strip
  i have a mustang gt right now but also want a fast daily driver and i want the awd version because i get a fair amount of snow/rain where i live
  no manual mustang gt is slower than any hyundai unless youre a retard that cant shift for shit stinger does like a 132 on a good day and the awd is even slower if you cant do at least 129 in a mustang then yeah maybe you really do need the auto
            hello koreashills hows the weather in seoul today
  mustang interiors are plasticy garbage compare to the stinger if i were driving 2000 miles across the country id take the kia with awd a sunroof and comfy napa leather over a cramped mustang with a stick shift any day
  theres people with just intakes running 12s in stingers add a small 3psi boost tune and running low/mid 12s do some research kid
  stingers get 129s or less quarter miles in all the major car reviews mustangs will only get their best acceleration times if you go for the 10speed auto with the manual a stinger will outrun you every time    
  you can get one down into the 11s with a stage 1 tune     
  i bought a 40k luxury sedan so i can do sick mawdz on it and go to the drag strip  or you can do the same mods to the mustang and then itll still be faster
      fantastic value and only affordable superluxury class vehicle fraction of the price of bentley or rolls royce but interior and ride is fine like silk
  ive been following that page for a few months now theyre doing awesome stuff with their stingers they have a rwd and awd that they tune
  intake and tune are sick mods now  and i can keep my mustang and have a fun/fast daily driver i can taste your salt through the screen poor boi
    and awd sunroof build quality    you know the good stuff
reminder that the kia stinger is legitimately shilled here and you can buy plenty of other cars for the same price or less and get way better performance
  will you make it with all the issues they have fuel pumps failing in so many why because they spent all the money on design and forgot the rest
  source
  and awd  which makes it heavier and slower   sunroof  which makes it heavier and slower  whether or not its nice is up to personal preference but dont act like its faster when it in no way is it just seems like a waste of money when if all you want is a nice car you can probably get all the same features in any other car why get a performance luxury sedan that isnt that luxurious and doesnt perform that well jeff bezos over here wants to act like hes so rich but if that were true then it would be smarter to get a nice car thats properly nice and a fast car thats properly fast the stinger and g70 are compromise cars for family dads who need to take their wives and kids to shit but still want to be able to have fun ie mashing the gas pedal on the highway
  the awd model weighs roughl 200lbs more than the rwd model big whoop and will launch with traction every time
  which makes it heavier and slower    why is this myth still a thing with proper torque vectoring modern awd performance cars are much quicker off the like than a rwd equivalent and keep the car balanced in turns thats why you see 550hp jaguar ftypes outrun challenger hellcats awd gets more grip every time
  the stinger and g70 are compromise cars for family dads who need to take their wives and kids to shit but still want to be able to have fun ie mashing the gas pedal on the highway    so cars for adults ok
  the awd stinger is literally slower than the rwd one youll get a better 60 but its slower to 60mph and in the quarter mile its slower because it weighs more and makes less whp people learned the same thing with the ms3 and ms6
  im only seeing one guy complaining on a stinger forum about a bad fuel pump on a stinger 20l and that should be entirely covered by the warranty
  awd is only faster once you have enough power to overwhelm the driven wheels and the mere 365bhp isnt enough to make that a problem
    after nursing my migraine from reading your post punctuation is a good thing i will now reply to it     i was merely responding to the back doors comment you cannot get awd or a sunroof on a mustang different strokes when you think about it one vehicle is a tiny on the inside loud pony car the other is a complete package taught gt car    a couple hundred pounds be damned im taking the roomier more comfortable gt car
i bought a g80 instead i like the more spacious interior but both the stronger and g70 are quite good
  stinger
  you cannot get awd or a sunroof on a mustang  and thats a good thing  im taking the slower more expensive gt car  whatever floats your goat buddy not my money youre wasting
  i drive a new hyundai but if this were my choice id want the lexus a hyundai will not be as problemfree a hyundai will not fetch a whole lot on a resale a hyundai will have interior rattles within the first few thousand miles    i also like that the current lexus is is rather small compared to all of its competition people that complain about cars in general becoming bigger and bigger always turn out to be the same people shitting on a car for being the smallest in its class nonsense
  how in the name of all that is holy did a fucking chrysler 300 pull off a 12700
    he fell for the reliability meme and buys a car designed by germans
  there was a kfc at the finish line
  wrx is a fucking dinosaur at this point    370z still even exists    camarstang are plastic tupperware tier inside    vw golf will bust its timing belt and/or plastic water pump every 10k miles    focus st doesnt exist anymore    those are the main cars from that list that you can get for around the same price of the stinger not even a hyundai shill but come on people the stinger is an alright car and we want manufacturers to keep producing new vehicles that arent suvs or hypercars
  vw golf will bust its timing belt and/or plastic water pump every 10k miles    nice meme fag but thats not even close to true stay mad that your gookmobile got beat by a german econobox at half the price
  im not going to incentivize hyundai to continue making cars if the stinger and g70 are the best they can do
  wrx is a fucking dinosaur at this point  still outdoes the stinger gt for less  370z still even exists  yes and still outdoes the stinger gt for less  camarstang are plastic tupperware tier inside  sure but were comparing it to korean shit  vw golf will bust its timing belt and/or plastic water pump every 10k miles  citation needed  focus st doesnt exist anymore  sure so the stinger gt is outperformed by a dead car  not even a hyundai shill  lol
  dude im not even a hyundai shill but the stinger gt is literally the greatest car ever made and everything else sucks in comparison and everyone needs to go buy a new one or theyre not real car enthusiasts or theyre just jealous poorfags
  i dont want to deal with the stupid expensive maintenance cost and poor reliability of a mercedes or bmw    so lease it
    cringe
the korean butthurt in this thread is astounding this must be how our grandparents felt about toyota in the 60s
is it bad i really want this not even shilling i have 2 mbs
  because despite the memes the chrysler is eternally based and dabs on the korean gookshit effortlessly     the gooks even copied the 300s styling literally every genesis car is a copy of the front end of the 300 even copying its badge
  no the g90 update is fucking noice
  i want to have faith in the koreans to make at least a decent car but between the actual shilling and constant antishill shitposting im not sure where they sit anymore
  unknown driver  ur a faget
  korean cars are even more soulless than nip ones and several times more rickety
  like luster of pearl geuleohji anhda
anyone with clutch experience here i got my engine rebuilt at dealer and had clutch changed while that work was being done dealer wants to charge 1k in parts for clutch so instead i get a exedy clutch kit and instead of using the supplied tob i bought an oem from dealer as well as a new flywheel when i picked the car up i noticed it still had a creaking sound at the end of the pedal when letting off the clutch it made this same sound before replacing clutch which is why i had it replaced service manager tells me he thinks my aftermarket clutch is this problem and suggests a teardown offering that it will be covered if it was a lubrication issue but if its my clutch i pay out of pocket i told him i didnt like the idead and we talk back and forth a few times where he insists he had his best master tech working on it so lubrication probably isnt the issue that bothered me because i contacted exedy and they claim there should be no clutch sound whatsoever and blames dealer for lack of lubrication manager gives in and offers to tear it down free and this was the findings i didnt talk to advisor i just got an email with invoice ill be picking car up tomorrow i cant tell if theres still an issue or if it was solved it seems to suggest lubricating something else why the fuck wasnt everything lubricated if so if not i gotta insist they go back into it right theyve done alot of work for me i bring two of my cars to their dealer for service
their statement is saying that the condition was corrected by lubricating the contact points on the clutch fork and smoothing out the guide that the release bearing slides back and forth on located inside the transmission bell housing   this makes sense it was most likely the lubrication on the fork that corrected the noise   they repeated the same statement from the beginning at the end i dont know why but it doesnt look like its a further recommendation  realistically you should just talk to the service advisor instead of asking random people on the internet
  im gonna ask him when i pick it up in a few hours just wanted to ask a few things before i show up did you notice how it brings up clutch control linkage that wasnt brought up before judging from findings do you think there was a misalignment could that have caused premature wear with clutch should any of those items have been replaced
  my mistake ignore clutch control linkage in this post
  jeez how hoes a master tec forgot to lubricate and clean all that
        it probably wasnt an alignment issue there are dowel pins that fit the transmission to the engine block correctly if theyre in place its tough to misalign anything and still have the transmission sit all the way against the engine   as far as a possible cause for the wear on what theyre calling the guide in my experience this is usually caused by wear on the clutch pressure plate and what is basically uneven pressure from the diaphragm springs if this is the case it most likely would have been caused by the old clutch not the new one with the clutch installed all of the diaphragm springs should be even where the throwout bearing presses against them if they end up uneven or a portion becomes weaker than the rest the throwout bearing can end up slightly off center or crooked while releasing the clutch and can contact the guide its really just a sleeve protruding from the bellhousing over part of the transmission input shaft when everything is working right the throwout bearing doesnt really contact it
  thanks any questions in particular i should ask or if the clutch feels fine i should just let it go
    just get your clarification from the service advisor and make sure you have a full understanding of what was done from there go out and check the clutch operation before you leave and make sure there arent any further issues
will motorsport ever surpass the most popular faggot sports of today football/basketball    what needs to happen
esports are more popular grandpa
  will motorsport ever surpass the most popular faggot sports of today football/basketball  no
  nah nigga half of the earth watches soccer world cup and champions league you thought   i was talking about american rugby fuck outta here
  porque ese
  you mean the whole earth minus usa canada and finland      i would also like to quote the great author ernest hemingwaymotorsport bull fighting and mountaneering are sports everything else is games
no it never has and never will      lol your typical nfl game draws more viewers than any motorsports in the us though      this
  will motorsport ever surpass the most popular faggot sports of today football/basketball  no    what needs to happen  colleges need to get together and form their own collegiate motorsport league offering the athletes a full tuition this proposed league would need to become mainstream enough to generate enough cash flow for itself and the schools this in turn would need to incentivize hs all over the country to start their own motorsports programs
  why would you want it to the average car guy is insufferable as is now imagine more dudebroness
      real sports are a display of physical prowess and athleticism and they satisfy certain cultural needs    1 they allow rich white men to buy and sell blacks based on their physical abilities    2 they keep the most physically capable and dangerous blacks employed and lawful relatively speaking without this they would be untold menaces raping and murdering thousands of innocents    3 the viewing of these sports can be done by tens of thousands in a single arena without missing any of the action  motorsport cannot do this you have a trackside seat and then have to wait 5 minutes for the cars to come by again    4 profits are maximized because the cost of the actual sport is much lower the most expensive thing is usually the salary of the players    5 most people have little interest in cars theyre seen as appliances so professional races are somewhat boring to them    6 women like watching muscular men beat on each other it encourages them to procreate which helps sustain the human race watching motorsports would only encourage fertile women to breed with machines which is generally unsuccessful
  who is this hot tamale
    just a thot
  the most popular sport in the world is soccer part of its popularity stems from the fact that all you need is something to kick and some reasonably open ground motorsports will never achieve that level of accessibility for the average poorfag    however on a global scale i question whether racing hasnt actually overtaken american football basketball is more global so that might still be on top
  esports are cancer     theres nothing glorious about a neckbeard or dude who hasnt reached puberty yet sitting on their asses playing a video game
  jealous over the fact that they make more money playing vidya than you ever will
    where is the money even coming from tho
  streams patreon and tournaments
  motorsport is for rich fags every rich fag can get himself a racing license and buy himself a seat in a series of his choice manufacturers like ferrari mclaren porsche  co hold specific events for rich customers on race tracks where they can obtain a license and put them in contact with teams so that the rich fag can sponsor the team and buy himself a seat   there is also insane elitism among any racing sport i dont know why these people are so smug when all of their races have zero audience all of this makes racing super unappealing for people cause its simply not a sport at all and success can be bought
  this  you ether get lucky if your dad loves you enough and makes you race cart at the age of 5 or you just get rich buy a fast car and do a bunch of track days
  even if daddy buys you a kart its still expensive as fuck
  and sponsors
and why exactly would you want to make motorsports more popular so that its even more populated by retards and so that we can use up even more resources
  yeah but if youre good you can get sponsors
  theres like only 34 publically accessible tracks in my country
  there are people at the pro level with championship wins that cant get sponsors marketing results is whats important not race results    look at danica patrick she really didnt win shit in nascar but she won a lot of popularity and still getting that godaddy money
  because she is a girl duh
  says  football/basketball  pretends he was talking about soccer  clearly was talking about both niggerballs    nice photoshop lol 2017 was the biggest at a total viewership of 60 million for the finals   to put that in perspective the final world cup match was viewed by 562 million people with a 700 million peak over 1 billion including public viewership the superbowl was viewed by 111 million people shit motogp average 101 million views a race   i dont watch that shit and lol is pretty impressive with those numbers but it doesnt touch the big guys yet
  it takes more than having boobs to be marketable
  yeah you have to be thin too
  maybe 30 years ago
  its not about boobs its about how well the stronk independent woman taking on the patriarchy thing sells these days
  no because the jews cant squeeze as much money out of it high barrier to entry means casuals cant into it and the inherent nature of racing means you cant run ads every 2 minutes

how can i improve this to get more attention
  put truck nuts on it
train horn  can also be used for epic pranks
  there appears to be missing some light bars on the bumper and roof of this vehicle   also  if you set the engine a little less lean increase rpms and add an ignition tingy in the exhaust youll have a cinder spewing warmachine   this in its current state really is small time but theres potential my small penised friend
  it doesnt have stacks it needs more lift also the 2 lightbars but citroen beat me to the exact layout    maybe swap the a/ts for all seasons to it give some more of that i dont actually have a reason for lift look

  you need lights under the truck flashing ones the truck is the wrong color it should be glow in the dark green i mean literally glow in the dark it needs a fog horn a big one with no off switch it needs a pair of spot lights in the bed aimed at the sky so everyone will know you are coming at night even if they are deaf
  its gap moe
needs to be dragging an obama effigy around behind it
the exhaust needs to be aimed to the right at car window level

its called being normal in a world of degenerate autists
  everything we design is a little like us thats what bias is we find other humans beautiful because of their symmetry and lack of distortions so we make cars beautiful by making them symmetrical and reducing distortions in our mathematical expectationswhy a smooth aerodynamic curve looks more appealing than a jagged sporadic line  so it only makes sense we design the cars shape in relative to our preconceived notions     tldr its normal fucktard

go to dealer from something unrelated  take a minute to check out new cars  this thing literally cost 108k  jesus christ when will this bubble pop
we can only hope any day now
come on bruh just take out a 96 month loan with 0 down
  the m3 cs should be a 5060k car at best the prices i saw were fucking insane i have 0 interest in bmw so i didnt realize how bad it got but holy shit a god damn gtr is 10k cheaper and faster wtf bmw
    too many wealthy clueless chinks who will simply pay any price that bmw come up with    they dont know the difference but simply want brand prestige
  it wont the middle class is dead at the very least the 40k90k sports car market has at least one of every kind of car you could want
  as long as were talking sports sedans nothing comes close to the m3 cs  you can always get the standard m3 for like 65k new
  i consider myself a libcuck but holy shit this went to go get my shitbox recall fixed at the dealership and when i was picking her up nothing but families of gooks speaking broken english with armfulls of merch from the gift shop which i didnt even know was a thing
buy an m2
  oh look its shitposter
  better give him attention  thanks

  where did it go so wrong lads
  i swear your vocabulary is synonymous to reading buzzfeed comments

it has finally come on what the fuck do i do    tire pressure is fine 2009 honda fit it doesnt say what sensor is bad do i get them all changed
  have you tried resetting it  read the owner manual dumb ass
  took me like two seconds to google this    dchparamushondacom/howtoresethondatpms
  those instructions cant be done on my car also it doesnt have the low pressure warning it has the tpms warning meaning one of the sensors is bad or the control box
  follow the reset procedure also check your spare tire psi thats a wonderful diagnostic assfuck at times    you may need new sensors they dont last forever and nigh 11 years sounds about right for their service life    if you dont risk voiding some warranty see if theres a tech school or even a hs that offers auto tech classes nearby and see if you can get them to fix it for you  itll be cheaper and youll be helping some lads learn hell it might even be a wack tax write off talk to an accountant
  op is an accountant   and there is no reset for a system fault
this comes up when tpms sensor hasnt sent signal for like a full week you probably have a sensor with a dead battery order a set off ebay for 40 and get them to install and calibrate next time you get tires    the only thing this affects is the low air warning and disables you from turning off traction control
  take it to a damn shop then if it bothers you so much take it to a local mom and pop shop because honda will charge you a kidney and a lung to even look at it

they were the standard until wwii then they shifted the engines forward as they got smaller why
shut up
  so the car could be smaller
because its cheaper to make fwd cars and 99 of people dont drive cars for the performance or know what over or understeer is
  but the car would be up to 2 shorter if the front doesnt stick out excessively far
  more legroom without a bigger car      thats crumple zone
  have you even seen a modern engine bay they keep trying to make the hood shorter while keeping the wheelbase short for handling by the time the rads in the engine bay is completely full if they shifted the engine back it would either decrease passenger volume or increase the length of the car making it heavier and shittier
  most large gt cars and roadster like the mercedes sls and amg gt are fmr its a solid drivetrain layout for performance cars but completely unnecessary and waste in a world where fwd sedans with transaxels and awd crossovers are king
what wrong with women
need attention a camera and a lawsuit fix that behavior
  for real anon they are insane sometimes
the same thing that is wrong with men emotion that overrules logic
  they dont have any friends to form a support group so they become clingy as fuck and act like its the end of the world when their relationship is over
  oh i see that makes perfect sense god help us all
  they were never taught that while keys that can open many locks are master keys locks that can be opened by any old key are just shitty locks
  they dont want to be my gf

your thoughts on the jaguar ipace
i dont understand it and i dont really care enough to try
why did they make it look like a citroën shitbox
whatever doug says i believe
  i for electric
  looks like a fat lifted car  suv    an electric ftype thatll blow the doors off a tesla would be cooler
anyone that builds legitimate competitors to tesla with massproduced build quality is ok in my book i hope this car sells well and proves that tesla isnt unbeatable for the sake of competition
  an electric ftype thatll blow the doors off a tesla would be cooler    damn shame they bottled out of making the cx75     notwithstanding the ipace will outsell it 100000 / 1
  notwithstanding the ipace will outsell it 100000 / 1    oh no doubt i suspect that in the next 2050 years if things keep going the way they are anything that isnt a light duty truck f150 etc or cuckover will be an expensive rarity in america
  god i fucking hate this make the trunk shite for no reason looks trend its a fucking suv it does not need nor deserve a fastback that doesnt even make it look any better
  thinks thats a looks trend
every car in the world in terms of acceleration and in the track
  yeah
duh
    i just want to feel good for buying a type r even though im asking such nonsense really wanted a porsche 911 turbo s but i wasnt born with a golden spoon in my mouth
  nah my type r would beat it that thing is underpowered compared to my fk8s 300 rampaging horsepower
  youd get shot for being a time traveling faggot
  but itll give you a good race for sure at 208 horses for 59
  i wonder if people in the 50s would love the fk8s look
  no hate mate you did great i rate eight out of eight
  have you seen the retarded shit people in the 50s thought cars would look like in the 2000s theyd probably be disappointed
  until something breaks and you cant replace it
  probably just based on tire tech alone    that said i wonder how common unleaded gas was at pumps back then
there was plenty of cars in the 50s that would have rekt your peice of shit type r in a light to light race for sure    type r has been a joke since the 2000s
  lol there wouldnt have been a single 50s car that could do shit against the type r even a fucking si would dominate just about everything
  would you shoot the white devils and then come back to the future as a starving nigger
  not for long the fuel and oil available at the time would kill the car pretty quickly leaded fuel would destroy the catalytic converters and likely cause clogging in the exhaust it may also contaminate the o2 and a/f sensors the oil was so crappy that the turbo probably wouldnt last long and the engine would wear extremely quickly  bring a fuel and oil supply if you find a time machine  but hey why bring a civic why not at least bring a car that looks decent      thats a 50s car in the 60s and gassers are more awesomely sketchy than they are awesomely fast
fastest 50s green hell nurburgring time was stirling moss in a vanwall running a 9092 in 1958    im not sure what the layout change has been on the ring since then but the type r ran a 743 so theres a considerable difference there even for racecars
  shut up faggot no that stupid fugly truck wont do shit to my type r think again insecure truck fag no car in the 50s can beat my fk8
  well if op bought his own stock type r it wouldnt be able to do a lap in under 8 minutes you have to take out the stereo system and the backseats get a tire upgrade and tune the engine for more power to get under 8 minutes
  thats more 70s street machine style tbqh basically ricers in american cars of the time imitating gassers of the 60s actual gassers got down
  and that is an extremely high end altered example in the 50s they would be like 16 second cars lol
the car wouldnt even run with 50s gas most cars were low compression flatheads
  this truck would rape your type r all day you cant be serious
  takes 30 seconds to spool  runs a high 14 second pass  impressive
  millenial historian     that 10 second car with a set of todays drag slicks would probably be in the high 8s    stay mad bus rider
  a fucking caster wheel
  what does an altered in the late 60s have to do with cars in the 50s    lol you dumb as fuck
  are you implying american auto technology changed a lot from 1950 to 1960    protip it didnt
  what the fuck does a car that came out in 1955 and built for racing in 1966 have to do with 1950 and 1960    lol u dum that car is running faster than what top level rail cars were running in 1959
  no it wouldnt the type r is almost three seconds faster to 60 and would handle way better in the corners hell you can spank a db5 in an accord
  oh my bad some top level cars were just dipping into 9s at the time    981 was enough to win the nhra nationals in 59 lol in 1969 they were running 6s and funny cars were running over 200 mph and goddamn super stock cars were running 10s and 11s
  the layout was different
    he said late 60s in which case yes it most definitely did    1950 inline 6 engines inline 8 engines ford flathead v8 splash oiling and babbitts still in use king pin front suspension no ball joints solid front axles on trucks and still some cars horrid bias ply tires shitty torque tube style drive shafts pivoting with the rear axle disturbingly thin very flexible frames 2piece windshields are still around manual everything column shift manual 3speed is the norm powerglide 2 speed automatic is brand fucking new    1965 ohv v8s everywhere power output increasing every year all engines have a pump driven oiling system short/long arm front suspension ball joints have been common for 10 years some frames at least similar in design to modern truck frame designs x frames have come and gone universal joints radial tires disc brakes are now available vacuum brake boosters available on most models 4 speed floor shift manual transmissions 3 speed automatics are now common brake systems have more than 1 hydraulic circuit power windows and power door locks are available seat belts are standard equipment
  radial tires didnt take off in the us until the 70s i still dont get it since euro cars were already using them in the 50s
  in the 60s they had the predecessor to the radial which they called polyglas it has byas belt still but the compound and construction of the tires greatly benefitted traction
  nani
  literally everything you mentioned that became standard in 60s american cars have nothing to do with making a fast drag car a 55 chevy that was built in the 60s is literally just a 55 with a worked engine     big ported heads single fat cam plenty of fuel big fat tires thats it vacuum brake boosters and universal joints dont make a fast drag car    millenial historians strike again and miss the point but tell me more about power windows
  plus op would have to be a pro driver which he obviously isnt being that hes on 4chan
    the post i replied to wasnt about modifications you boomer fag it was about automotive technology  tell me more about building a race car and using a torque tube rear end instead of a driveshaft with universal joints
  why do you keep posting notperiod correct pieces and acting like they have anything to do with what youre talking about that 55 i posted is not even close to a 55 with a worked engine not even body or frame is the same as stock    stock class cars in the 60s didnt run big fat tires as the rules didnt allow them and even the biggest tires back then would be considered a small tire todaytalk about a big ol poser
should i buy a new typer civic or old nsx which is a better long term investment
  you should buy a type n
imagine if 50s boomers had cars of today back then i wonder what cars would look like now
posturing because you can beat 75 year old cars  shitty diggy
060 mph 52 sec  quarter mile 136 sec  1047 mph    youd be untouched until 1962 this would beat you in acceleration 1/4 mile time but be 02 second behind in 060 cobra would be beating you to 60 a few years later    old tires are shit so you likely wouldnt have much of an issue on tracks
yeah but time machines arent real so youre just buying a car that is subpar by todays shitty standards
  youd probably be able to beat most things in a 10th gen si
probably but it still looks disgusting and everyone should laugh at you because you bought it
  gen x would still hate because they would prefer to work on their cars than on some little ungrateful shit made by an accident
  are you actually trying to argue about time travel scenarios
friend of mine and his gf just got hit by a semi in her prius they both walked away fine thanks toyota
  why should i thank toyota for letting those dumb fucks live
congrats on your friend living anon but convince him not to buy another prius
    thanks semi for taking a prius off the road
prius owner  he may have survived but he was always dead inside
    her prius    he has a mildly lifted truck like a man
desu i want to buy a prius just so i can save that gas money and spend it on parts for my rx8
  her
  mildly lifted truck  like a man  op why did you have to lie about your more masculine bf and you getting in a crash in your prius  post boipussi
  tell him to get a personal injury lawyer and he will have tesla money
thank you based acura    you did your job old friend rip
  either the semi driver was retarded or on drugs or your friends were
  i dont know the whole story yet but yeah i would not at all be surprised if the gf did something stupid as shit to make them get run into or if that they were both on something
    saw this for sale in my city and it made me wonder    when storing a vehicle for 27 years without driving it to keep it in the best shape possible what does one do with the fluids in the car does keeping fuel coolant power steering fluid in cause issues overtime    i was also wondering about bushings etc does a car that sat for 27 years develop issues even if it hasnt been driven and stored in a heated covered space how preserved are vehicles like this actually    i have no plans to buy it i just thought it was an incredible thing to see and was curious about what the procedure behind time capsuling a vehicle is
the car needs to be driven a little bit every few weeks at least tires and bearings and everything else will get flat spots and be fucked
calgary    no way a mad leb hasnt broken into it at least once

do u know the model that bradley cooper was drivin in his new film star is born i mean the big black suv pls help
  gm yukon
of the top of my head it would be the tesla model 3
the new z4/supra and the gtr
  dont forget the z06
  dodge daytona
baste
  vw golf 20 tdi
  nonsense chart with meaningless figures made up by liberals
theres is only one true rascal around these parts
  everytime is see one of those model 3 all i can think of is that it looks a lot like one of these
  gtr and ford gt
  dodge daytona 
mustang gt/ m3 threads from 201115 have never been surpassed for butthurt
anything thats new and from kia/hyundai especially the stinger gt
any bmw  toyobaru  wrx  civic type r  any korean car  gtr  corvette  any tesla  basically any car you can think of except the twingo
  ohh yea
  anything from subaru really
  any vag cars they always trigger the vaghaters here
newfag here uhm im just trying to figure out what kind of muffler this is and if its stock or not 2000 mitsubishi eclipse also im a retard and put fluid film in places i shouldnt have i was thinking of putting something else there to change the sound this kinda looked nice    
  
      not sure how many riders browse outside of /dbt/ but everyone should watch this
  holy shit that second one    it wasnt even just his working of the clutchgearstick he nearly crashed it into the curb just leaving and that fucking steering looked like he had arthritis or something    more like fucking gore than cringe
    now for todays special guest  its the lefts favourite flavour of the month shitskin comedian to grace us with his witty pajeet stylings and thirdworld observations  woah  white people are different from brown people  hahahahahahahahahahaha  good one   hasan
  you should start vandalizing/destroying the tesla charging stations in your area    or do something like put caulking on the charging plug so it ruins the electricucks vehicle
    this is the driving equivalent of using the mona lisa as a cum rag
  how the fuck you low slide a bike going straight
  whats your problem dude
  you can hear the fucking car cry at 120 and im not talking about the tire spin i mean listen to the engine
  theres a video of him driving the same car 1 year later and hes still driving the exact same way how can you drive the same manual transmission car and still not get it how stupid can you be
  the real cringe here is that people made 15 minute videos of themselves doing other shit with the promise of 2 seconds of action how much of an attention whore can people nowdays be if i could i would destroy the internet it has outlived its usefulness and is now breeding a world of whores who would sell their souls for a minute of internet attention
  the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
  the 2nd one  oh no not this shit again not even gm shit deserves that
  its guys like the dude in the first one is why truly raw supercars dont exist anymore some fuckin chris harris knockoff
  fuck me he even leaves the cart in the middle of the parking lot
  suicide doors  two shopping carts of food  casual butt press the 200k cars trunk  come on that much food would be difficult to fit into a 20k sedan
  could be wrong but i think he fucked up revmatching the downshift and locked the rear tire
  he shifts like brian fucking oconner
  dose that guy ever stop talking bad acting too
  first video i cant see his hands either bad revmatch or he hit a patch of black ice    in the second video it took me a second watch but he wasnt paying attention when the corner came up and he hit brakes too hard among other things    what bothers me more is his complete lack of self awareness his complete lack of concern for how serious the situations his in are its like watching a kid play with a loaded gun
there was another thread talking about cash for clunkers so heres a few brutal murders      
  shit man
does anybody know what this part is called it seems to be seaping oil very slowly and ive noticed some collecting around the outside spark plug 4 theres a hose connecting to it to the oil fill up point a hose connecting to the air intake and another looks like its connected to the wire harness could be wrong im bad at part names anyway it looks easy enough to take apart but does anybody know what its called in case i need to replace it
made in usa   it works as intended
  you got me sooo good especially since my car is italian and built in mexico    anybody with car knowledge
  i see a number of parts there maybe u could idk draw a fuckin to what it is u r talking about    to be this fuckin vague man
  something for crank case ventilation like some sort of oil catch and return looks to be make and model specific
  wild guess its the pcv valve thats leaking google is your friend
  i can only imagine that the seeping oil could be the fact that its not connected with a hose clamp and its just on by pure grip if anything it could be a pcv valve
  i think youre right heres a circle of the exact part i was talking about
  and yeah i suspected that as well i believe that was replaced by a mechanic after i had an issue with oil in this exact spark plug that im noticing oil collect around was considering replacing with a metal hose clamp though i felt my finger under the area where the plastic clamp is and didnt notice oil i think oil may even been seeping from the very bottom of this part heres another pic from under neathe upon this picture the leak def seems to be coming from the bottom i guess ill take this apart after work and check it out
your motor is toast my dude time for the scrapyard
  its the pcv for your engine
  my car runs just fine just minor oil seapage no more shit posts please bus riders contain yourselves to the are women mechanics memes threads trying to talk cars here
    thanks guys this is what i needed to know
  damn pcvs look that that
do you volunteer with your local community speed watch keeping the streets orderly and safe
id just pull me plates and go do a fat skid past these cunts if they did that shit here
i think i would actually do this  give tickets to all the people i dont like and power trip as much as i want to  get to pretend its for the good of society  pat down stacy in front of chad    i kind of get why people want to be cops
  absolutely not that is the most stupidest thing after a neighborhood watch both of those things are better to be left to professionals
  last time someone tried to pull this shit i threw an open piss bottle out the window at them fuck these cunts they aint no police
yeah i only report nonwhites tho
holy shit i hate white people
white people are da best
  i live in america so no i dont want to get shot
  if you have time to burn driving by them repeatedly at a minimum speed limit multiple times with people backed up behind you gets them bothered
  ive told myself if i ever see these cunts im making it mandatory of me to either a fucking punch it and blow by them exceeding the limit by at least 20 mph or b do a fat donut or powerslide right next to them depends on the situation really
  they cant actually give out fines
the ladies usually bring free cake and hot coffee which is great volunteering also landed me a summer job after they vouched for my integrity      they aint no police  that is true but we can report modified exhausts tinted windows and reckless drivers to the police theyre getting a routing traffic stop later then   police are supportive of us
routine
  oi you got a loicense for that radar gun
bootlicker targets me with a low intensity laser weapon violating the nap so i return fire inkind by illuminating him with my an/ped1 and calling in low level gun run on his position
  what do they actually do then
  report suspects to the police so they can perform routine stops
oh boy lets tattle tale on speeders while our teen girls are being gang raped by filth
  fukkin baste
  feel like theyre maintaining ordah while their country degenerates into a worse version of the us without the freedoms needed to reset itself without 2/3s of the military staging a coup
let me guess britain
  looks that way britain hasnt been worth a shit since they ran benny hill off the air
  you people need to be shot asap
  modified exhausts arent illegal
  theyre fucking annoying at 2 am
  some dude did this with a hairdryer and people still slowed down kek
  theyre still not illegal at 2 am
  statist bootlickers like this should be shot without mercy   civil disobedience is the mark of a free society i consider it my civic duty to break the speed limit on the open road and make (((illegal))) modifications to my car
  speed limits are for your own safety retard
  that is true but we can report modified exhausts tinted windows and reckless drivers to the police  thats great and all but proofs of that offence
  ill let the constable make that determination dont worry already got your plates
  the police will find something 
    im so glad i live in a country where people like you cant do shit  also any attempts to are going to be quickly called racist
  living in a country where enforcing the law equals racism
  beats living somewhere bootlickers can actually affect your daily life
  fpbp
  (((safety)))   fuck you bloomberg ill do what i want
drastically changing the flow of traffic at random spots  safe and orderly    are you fucking retarded stick your thumb in a faucet hole and see how orderly the water is you daft cunt
  i feel like running over them does that count
  local community speed watch  the absolute state of the anglosphere
  flow of traffic  yeah all those 10 cars per hour that drive around the neighborhood
  participation comes in many forms anon
  speeders do not bug me as much as the folks that creep by and scope out the neighborhood you know what i mean   they cruise along at 5mph or whatever ill take a speeder over a creep
whats the best car you can buy for 1500 in your area
  please tell me that isnt going to be a demolition derby car
  sadly i think it was 
i tried and already gave up
hey not bad im sure theres something terribly wrong with it
  define best like most fun or least likely to be a pos cause i can find a fair amount of boringbutreasonable options for that kinda money
  idk man something weird cool unique or just a good deal
  its pretty much a race car so theres always something wrong with it
  well this guy is selling a notitle omni turbo for 1200 but everything about this ad screams red flag    if he put that much work into it but still never bothered to title it and now hes selling it for chump change that means its junk      heres a weirdly pristine dodge dynasty alaska is strange like that      how about a 2nd gen taurus wagon
  first one is weird af it might be worth it to a collector though idk them that well    the second is dope as hell super clean grandma ride lol       nice wagon high mileage but them things run forever from what ive seen
  the omni glh turbo is definitely an obscure collectors car its got a weird backstory involving carol shelby and lee iacocca to the right buyer that would be a valuable car  sometimes im tempted to get my dealer/broker license and see if i could make any money flipping the obscure shit that crops up in alaska on a semiregular basis the biggest hurdle to profitability is the cost of getting these things back down to the 48 though
that i would actually buy a 1986 300e
not really on topic but i wanted to post this abomination
  
  christ  im going to be sick
how about    a 3000 gt 220 hp isnt bad      or a 68 plymouth valiant      or for you initial d fans      an 83 tbird in good shape      baja bugs      jeep gladiator      stuff out here in california just doesnt rustlike this 75 f100    
  meth not even once
this listing title  kek gotta love women
you guys use other sites like letgo and offerup ive seen a few great deals there
  i dont but im the alaskafag and nobody up here uses those sites/apps if im not looking on craigslist im looking on the local community facebook group
petrol and diesel cars registered before 2000 and 2006 respectively will be restricted while hybrid vehicles will be allowed to enter the area and park for a maximum of two hours reports the verge however residents living in the controlled areas will not be affected by the ban petrol and diesel taxis will continued to be allowed in the area until 2022 electric cars which produce no emissions driven by nonresidents will also be allowed to freely enter the area        your time is over /o/
considering even hybrids are restricted its more about reducing traffic than pollution most european cities werent built with the automobile in mind

is bmw m3 e30 the toyota ae86 of europe most european drifters seem pretty fond of it  
  the toyota ae86 is the toyota ae86 of europe
  implying there were any notable quantities of ae86 in europe ever
  e30 m3 is basically cars perfected for its year
does it pass the smog test
  european drifters are fond of any old bmw  bmw is the best value for money in europe
  the e30 is better than the 86 in literally every way
  they are popular in bongistan and ireland because of rallying
  maybe not the m3 per se but definitely any e30/e36 gen 3 series
  mk2 escort
  ive been to bongistan and ireland several times and i never saw one    best value for money  you mean best power for money because theyre supposedly pretty unreliable
  as in its an underpowered car thats overhyped and overpriced yes
  muh horsepower  e30 was pretty fast for the time silly
  nah the m3 is on a different league    the e36 318ti is the actual ae86 of europe  lightweight small hatchback  manual  inline 4  rwd  outdated rear suspension makes it prone to sliding
  no it wasnt i have an 86 944 turbo with more horsepower that i got for 1/10th the price of an m3 and that was a fucking entry level porsche
  is the foxbody equivalent to these for america
  bmw must be really overpriced where you live  youre from the americas right
  you can still get a normal e30 for 5k here but m3s cost way more because theyre overhyped
  unlucky from what i could gather so far euro vintage cars are extremelly overpriced in usa and a fraction of the price here in europe
  mint m3 e30s are just expensive here in germany as in the us
  how many e30 m3s did you see
  in my town 2 or 3
  you mean best power for money  no i mean the best all round package and bmw reliability is better than the average european car manufacturer
   4  yes as if a v4 would be necessary at the size of 4 cylinders in fact without looking it up i dont think there has ever been an v4 engine
  wrong
look  me senpai i can do the mountain pass too
  bmw reliability is better than the average european car manufacturer  this is absolutelly wrong bmw is ranked amongst the worst in realiability worst than most french companies that americans love to hate
  comparing a 16 shitbox with 114hp  with a 25 inline 6 with 238hp  almost the same weight  e30 m3 is not that common at all    ae86 is a meme machine  just like the delorean  without that chinese cartoon no one would bat an eye on the ae86
  how many do you see in your country theyre not a common sight anywhere
  that is literally false  the older bmws you see in racing and drift events are much more reliable than any of their rwd counterparts hence theyre so extremely popular among various motorsport types and even in regular track days
  theres a bunch of old bmws in my region people almost exclusively buy 2nd hand only rich kids buy 1st hand cars or rich boomers       this is the second year in a row that bmw  has come bottom of hte reliability rankings in 2017 bmw drivers reported 198 problems per 100 cars
  the e30 3series yes the e30 m3 no
  reported problems   is that the same source which claims alfa romeo is the most reliable car brand in europe while there is a massive lawsuit for alfa going on in the us because the new giulia has proven to be a hilariously unreliable shitheap  look up tuv reports which actually reports how many problems a car has developed in 111 years you can see that bmws are doing just fine  and even if bmws were the most unreliable cars in the world they would still be hard to beat in terms of priceperformance
    the ae86 wishes it had the legacy the m3 does        no it wasnt    it was in fact pretty fast for its time in fact it was the fastest and if you think horsepower determines what car is faster you should stick to benchracing
  tuv reports    lol isnt tuv german
why do so many people with aspergers like cars trains and anime    cars in particular
  theres no such thing as assburberz
why do so many normal people like traveling getting stds and being broke
  lots and lots of numbers and technical details to read and get acquire knowledge of t certified assburgers
  dont lump me in with train guys theyre weird dont see me standing around taking pictures and recording every single detail about cars i like and looking forward to when i can see it again
assburgers  a developmental disorder affecting ability to effectively socialize and communicate  autism  a serious developmental disorder that impairs the ability to communicate and interact  so is the difference between these too just serious level and interaction because they both seem to be a developmental issue concerning communication
  assburg isnt even used professionally anymore its all autism now
      oy voy aspergers was nazi stop using it goyim
  assburgers was a term to describe someone with a mild enough form that they could still lead a normal life    autism was used for the real vegetables    but now as  said its all just classed as autism
i think its a curiosity about complex machinery and they like watching the mechanical motion of the movement of cars and trains then as you get closer you see more detail in the bogies etc which is interesting to look at
  this is true
  car guys do do this though
  based
  you forgot minute info/stats about professional atheletes and media celebrities good argument tho
  i like working on my car because  i can do it solo i prefer tasks that i can do on my own  im ocd and i can work at my own pace which is meticulous at best  i get to figure out exactly why mechanical things work the way they do

  he fell asleep at the wheel on the way to az veered across the median and got tboned by a semi
  so he died who took the pic
they lost their dick tips because of that you insensitive prick
how did that happen
  huffing hand sanitizer
  farting in the car
i really loved this car it was so much fun to drive i had a great time with it  final doug score 29/100  wtf
  literally who  some youtube faggot that no one should waste their time watching im assuming stop rewarding shit youtubers
  because dug is fucking stupid and i think the only reason he gets so many views is because he reviews really high end cars
  dougs system actually makes sense you shouldnt view numbers as everything only a veyron will get a 10 in speed only a lotus will get a 10 in handling only a rolls will get a 10 in comfort therefore a lot of fun cars actually will score poorly overall
dougs videos blow ass if you havent figured it out already
  you have to actually watch the video to get his opinion on the car the number at the end has a context to it
  go away doug
  the whole point is that the review and the doug score seem totally disconnected from each other hell say a bunch of really positive stuff about the car in the review but then give it a really low score that doesnt match what he said at all
  did you bother to look at the actual categories instead of just a raw total like a moron an atom would be a blast to drive but score terribly in everything other than the performance categories
what is best auto reality show and why is it jdm legends
never hoid of it

the lfa is more of a succesor to the toyota supra then the new a90 supra will be
nobody cares both about the lfa and the new supra    t someone who loves the lfa
naturally aspirated overpriced carbon clapbox with no aftermarket support whos most noteworthy feature is it sounds funny  its the antithesis of the supra
  half million dollar limited production na v10 supercar not particularly known for tuning  successor to the supra  a thread died for this
its nothing like any of the supras at least the a90 is
  because its just a bmw with body work done to it
lc 500 plus i6tt would be exactly a modern supra
  it doesnt have to be from toyota to be like the supra there are american cars closer to the supra than the lfa is
  this is the real modern supra  highly potent 30l twin turbo i6  6 speed manual  same curb weight
  the obesity of this thing never ceases to amaze me its like a japanese plussize idol
  a thread died for this    the first thread in the archive is about boomers in midlife crisis     this thread is de facto 10x better
  is it literally about that or was it just people talking about how cars were better back in the days
    see for yourself 
more of a successor to the supra  no it isnt you little tard    the 2000gt was specifically cited as the inspiration for the lexus lfa both in its style of conception and its performance aims
  didnt someone lsor the equivalent of swap one of these way way back in the 60s man that was before ls swapping jap cars was even a thing
  the lfa is much more expensive than the 2000gt  the 2000gt was 7000 in 1967 which is 53000 adjusted for inflation   the lfa was 375000
  the supra was a mass production gt car with a very common n/a base model how is a gorillion dollar supercar with a v10 comparable
  pic related was 8000 when new it was in the same market as the 2000gt    the ferrari 599 gtb fiorano was 385000 when new it was in the same market as the lexus lfa
  completely wrong   the list price on a daytona was 19000
  these old as original list price/specs pages give me a boner got any more specifically for vettes of a similar era
    thats a succesor to the sc not a supra
  can the stock bottom end take retard amount of boost like the supra
    shame about its looks and exhaust sound though
  list price for a new nart spyder in 1967 was 144006  
  car  driver  thats a fully optioned car from a later era    read   eddie was the recipient of the eighth nart spider in march of 1968 for a pricememories and reports varybelieved to be somewhere between 8000 and 14500
  nobody cares about the lfa    how long have u been deaf anon
  how long have you been blind anon    do you see lfa threads often do you see people talking about lfas online people dont care because of its price and its specs
  this is an earlier car and its basic list price is 14500
  this is the same sheet for the nart  its illegible but clearly 5 digits
cars that typically wouldnt be used as rally cars being used as rally cars
never actually made it out of the prototype phase saw one at tokyo megaweb last may looks so fucking cool live
  fucking bodykit where
  does dirt hillclimb count
  unf toyota needs to try again     pic related is close enough no
  never ever
  more z31s
  definitely more z31s  
  i find this a little interesting because wasnt lexus still pretty much sold only in the us back then
    jdm spec as the altezza and some places like europe got the is200 jdm spec was a bit better since it came with the option of a 3sge engine and almost all 6spd manual trans lexus is300 were all 2jzge mostly with auto trans
look at this happy motherfucker
  aye
  that looks fuggin sex
based twongi
this one was really good won the targa florio a couple of times
no clue if this is rally or hillclimb but its fucking hectic
    that looks fucking evil
baja is a rally right    i guess its not out of the ordinary for a truck to compete there but rally as a whole doesnt see a lot of trucks someday i want to race at baja
  both the s30 and s130 have rally heritage not unusual that they used the z31 fuck it posting zs
rallying a convertible
  911s have been used for everything even nascar
  thats a hill climb car m80
  when the fuck did they use porsches in nascar
  50s and 60s back when stock car meant a car from a dealership
  looks like an aussie or nz targa road rallye to me apparently they got something similar to the eu variant lexus badges 2000cc inline six optional manny tranny
  literally made just for rally
excuse me james  there is hard left turn in 200 bong units
  i was looking for that picture thx
  lol that picture is straight off my instagram account z31_z31_z31
  its a good ig page thanks for sharing all those sweet pics
  np i havent posted in awhile ill have to start posting again
push in clutch  foot isnt off the gas completely   7000 rpm
go for that glorious 3 to d shift  its actually already in d  slam it into neutral  shitbox revs intensify
be wage fag  tired as fuck on my commute home  only push the clutch a quarter of the way   try to shift into first from a stop  rnnnnnnh  oh shit sorry car
getting on the interstate  miss 5th  put it in gear and the whole car jerks
clutch is nearing the end   shifter needs rebuild  poor so cant fix it right now  driving isnt as enjoyable anymore
dont have car
driving all the guys from work out to lunch  back out of my parking spot  put it in first  immediately lurch to a complete stall  turns out i accidentally put it in 3rd  this never fucking happens when im alone only when i have people in the car
downshifting from 5th  clutch in and blip throttle  accidentally put into 6th  not a big deal
  same anon
  tfw exact opposite  i dont fucking understand
  foot slips off clutch
  learn to drive jackass
starting from a stop on bike  gotta go fast  bang through first clutch let off gas mash foot up  grab a fist full of throttle  in neutral  tfw redlining while decelerating in traffic
be amerifat at drive thru  forgot i didnt put car in neutral  move my foot off the clutch because its too much effort  stall car  qt employee laughs at me
get on bus  homeless herbert is jerking off on the back seats again  sit down next to toothless tony  shaneequa waddles over to me starts touching my leg while her 5 niglets climb over the seats  this is my stop  but anon the bus has no doors  mfw
  how did you get on the bus if it has no doors
  have driven stick fairly well a couple handful of times a year or so ago  florida so everything is flat  few weeks ago friend belittles me for not knowing how to drive stick  tell him im fairly decent at it  gives me shit and tell him ill prove it  oh shit the car is parked on an incline and have to back out  sudden fear of car rolling into the wall because that this is so close  try my best but stall out   gives me more shit and talks about it for another week    i cant do anything right can i
  eew
not to shitpost or anything but seriously why would anyone want a manual transmission now a days im getting my co worker to teach me how to drive stick soon so i get see more options in the used car market since manuals are so much cheaper since no one really wants them should i really go down this path
  if you dont enjoy driving manual youll really hate it especially in traffic the only reason to get one is because you think its fun really
  i enjoy driving a manual because its much more engaging  reving the engine high and slamming gears is way more fun than just holding your foot on the gas  that being said manual is obviously more work and leaves room for user error  it all depends on who you are and how you drive
    so if i want to get from point a to point b it really isnt all that optimal
  first day of driving a manual
  honestly no  theres nothing wrong with not knowing how to drive manual  though i would say even if youre just a little curious to try it out you may end up liking it
  drive stick a few times  hasnt touched it in years  gets scared at the thought of an incline  nah bruh im pretty good at stick
  better mpg and performance if your price range is old shit box generally more reliability easier to repair yourself and usually cheaper because people dont want/cant drive them
n to d  gearbox completely syncs in
is there a car that can be bought for less than  500
  this is the worst especially when you have a loud bike and cringe at the thought of nearby bike fags knowing exactly how you fucked up
  get on boat  not a speck of light is showing  so the danger must be growing  are the fires of hell glowing  is the grizzly reaper mowing  yes the danger must be growing   for the rowers keep on rowing   and they are certainly not showing  any signs that they are slowing  ahhhh  mfw

  i was decent then im sure i can get it down again after a couple tries
redpill me on the vw golf city    what makes them so much cheaper than regular golfs are they shitboxes
sadly miata is not an option ive eyed nas and nbs on and off for months finally commited to no because i would rather not die at 18 maybe in my 20s    i want to spend 35k looking for something agile and fun around corners doesnt necessarily have to be fast reliability is a big thing for me too currently interested in    7th  8th gen civics    1st and 2nd gen mazda3s    9th and 10th corollas  scion tc    the 5th gen prelude    i feel like i cant really go wrong with any of these leaning towards the lude or a civic si please share your preferences with me
  volvo s40/60 with the t5 engines from 00 to 08
  ill add the ford zx2 or a 03 or newer toyota celica
  not reliable and basically impossible to find in florida    maybe the celica
  just stay away from the oil burning early 1zzfe celicas i believe they fixed the issue in the late model 2003 engines
  depending on the price the fwd mercury cougar might be worth looking at
e36
  finally commited to no because i would rather not die at 18 maybe in my 20s      why would you die in a miata
20069422  i had a porsche 944 for a while and it handled well and was pretty reliable parts were expensive and it had pretty shitty acceleration it had 90k miles for 3500 and almost no rust
  looking for something agile and fun around corners  any car that isnt a fucking fire truck will turn the same way around a street corner when youre delivering pizzas youll get bored real fast    if you have a place to work in 5k could get you a nice 80s rwd pos like a malibu you could swap a 53 ls into
  first gen impreza
  inability to deal with the fresh
  unreliable ive tried mechanicing on an e30 but failed miserably
  you have also failed as a man you brought shame on this board to /n/ you go
  this car gives me a weird boner and im not sure why
  seconding zx2 light handles nice easy to mod and you dont have to pay meme prices for a good turnkey runner since everybody wants a civic or a focus  you can also swap an svt focus motor in fairly easily but itll take some electrical jiggery to get the ecu to run the vvt
  the mazda 3 is a good choice if you can find one that isnt rusted to shit otherwise just go for a 3k civic and spend 2k on some simple mods
 im having a hard time finding decent first gens at all let alone for under 5k
  u mad
3k civic

what happened to all the trips james and rr3 guy are the only ones who still trip
peak /ovg/
whats everyones favorite tripfag drama
  the old class of ovg got bored with the thread james and rr3 guy dont post all that often either
  kiras beta orbiters
  the reality is that /ovg/ was never large enough to be selfsustaining it relied on one or two people being consistently invested in order to keep coming up with new racing series and trying to get people involved but when those people inevitably get burnt out everything else goes with them
  /ovg/ needs a strong leader  someone like sj
  some of them are still here
  someone being a leader doesnt actually make things run well its specifically that one obsessive autist that spends hours making sure everything works as intended week after week  plus theres just the fact that /ovg/ started off as a place for a few people to shitpost and have fun and then tried to turn into something more than that despite not having the numbers to make that happen
  that one obsessive autist that spends hours making sure everything works as intended week after week  but that was sj at least until the shadow government seized control
i just learned you can turn awd to rwd if you mess with the differential settings experiments here we go
  sj ran a server for two weeks the second week it crashed on everybody because it turns out he had a potato pc from 20052006 so someone more competent bought an rfactor server and configured it properly    sj then spent the next year in the thread going full schizo about muh shadow government stealing his rfactor league from him when it was nobodys league to begin with and they just wanted to race without the hosts pc kicking half the lobby
  how much better will it be than actual rwd
hey anons what am i doing wrong with the windows in ac it seems gimp keeps saving the dds file smaller than what it should be    my window file gets smashed to 165 x 45 it should be exporting at 2048 x 1024 but it isnt
    same thing that killed /ovg/ killed eir as well appealing to shitters    when ovg was super active most of the guys organizing events and attending each week were of the hardcore crowd as in they gave enough of a fuck to practice and git gud     well there came a time where we basically let anyone browsing /o/ for 5 min come in and shit up the race yeah ovg was never a serious league but the people who built up ovg into what it was eventually got tired of dealing with literal retards in the races     at the same time stuff like srs for ac got popular so these people had options to race elsewhere ovg was sort of a way to get away from simdads who got pissy over meme liveries and inappropriate jokes but now you can avoid simdads altogether with these apps
  i just learned that you can run full rear bias and no front locking    took you long enough innit
  elitists shit up the whole place and chase everyone else away  its the shitters fault
  if we chased the shitters away why are you fags crashing a million times in 10 corners and losing to the ai
what 4chan memes did james spout on iracing in 2012
  the worst kind
assetto corsa more like pajjetto corsa
  the elitists are the ones organizing races and maintaining google docs  the elitists are the ones putting together mods and carpacks  the elitists are the ones renting servers  the elitists are doing bop checks so one car isnt overpowered as fuck  the eltists are the ones compiling skinpacks before each event  the elitists are cracking games so your broke ass can play for free    if they put in all this work and in return they get a bunch of backmarkers shitting up the race with retarded wrecks because hurr durr i just downlode game 2 hours ago im to poor to buy a wheel look at my anime car lul guys who gave a fuck like von  kraid arent gonna stick around forever
  von and kraid are busy irl
  but you arent doing any of those things
  and we were busy back then too but a lot of guys still made time for ovg because the racing was for the most part pretty good    people start prioritizing differently when something they look forward to all week routinely ends in a fucking mess
20074764  yeah whatever you say buddy
    why so steamy tonight maple monster
  let me redefine elitist
how to convince my shitter friend to play without stability control in assetto corsa
  pretty sure the word dedicated is what youre looking to use i dont think elitists would do anything for community if they thought they were shitters
friend wants to try some shitty facebook miata turbo mod  load up assetto corsa server  oh man this is impossible to control without stability aid  disconnects without saying anything
  tell them that catching slides is the single most satisfying thing you can do in a racing game
  ok then lets call them dedicated     point still stands you wait all week for an event and some shitters ruin it over and over again youre not gonna want to be an organizer forever
  theres also the fact that nobodys going to want to be an organizer forever im sure that shitty drivers didnt help but burnout when doing something for months or years is both common and reasonable
  for the record im not disagreeing with you i get that people who just drive like shit and generally dont care how other racers feel can ruin and even turn away dedicated players    either way i should be practicing for next saturdays event instead of shit posting here
r i c a r d o    is here to tell you to stop arguing about dumb shit and have fun with racing games preferably in wec junior using the simulator ricardofactor2
  but racing games arent fun
  gas yourself
  von and kraid are busy irl  this man speaks the truth
  can someone recognize these cars
fuck off cuck
  searched that a3dr line in the filename turned out to be a particular modder his portfolio included the cars in question  very tough stuff
if yall wanna see turnleft season 3 gimme a shell yeah
  sure but dont forget to put it on a silly time so no one will show up
  i was a shitter but at least i pulled over and let the front runners go through without hassle we all gotta start somewhere
what are some chill sims to just drive around real roads like i do in assetto corsa for pc
  assetto is really the only realistic game where you can cruise/roleplay everything else is made purely for children who want to crash boogattis or simdads who only like gt3 on spa
  has anyone tried the nfs packs in racedepartment are they any good    i feel like thats the niche that will keep assetto corsa alive while only the tryhards go to competizione
  you can cruise/roleplay  everything else is made purely for children  
just look at this beauty
  just play on servers that dont allow it
  sim vegan
  as long as he plays with authentic assists i dont see the problem
  stability aid is a onoff thing you enable or disable it for all cars  the authenthic assists are abs and tc
  best bench
  good to see some test drive unlimited screenshots
  wasnt some anon here working on porting aquatica like three years ago
  theres no trannies in that image
      
  james why does your game run like crap in vr also the hud elements are projected too damn close and you have to look at them almost cross eyed   you should learn from ac
what assetto corsa dlcs does /ovg/ recommend
  all of them on sale
  all of them
  presumably you could get a better pc runs well on mine and i dont have the hud on
  games should run acceptably on mid range hardware yet its awfully choppy even on minimum settings
  i cant get ricardofactor 2 to run that well in vr  do i upgrade my gfx card just for wecjr or what
  we had 3 already
the races should just have a referee who deals with idiots
  glad you volunteered yourself as the tard wrangler
is this a good rim
  i heard it was ok but it only works with low lock cars like f1 cars or dtms/gt3 for road or rallying its useless
  theres usually 12 cars added per update that i get just to slap a low effort livery on  theres not much stuff to trip about aside from replying to someone mentioning me    and ive completed gt2 leagues endurance and special events and i dont feel like maxing tests shop events and rally so no more webm spamming for now
  that didnt go so well when cosmo whiting did it
  if you have more than 100 incidents in a race youre banned  looking forward to wecjr round 2 being exclusively ai
  how do people even manage to get such high numbers are they just ignoring corners entirely  people are racking them at a rate of one every ten seconds or more
  this  i dot get the no shitters allowed mentality in simracing  the only way i got better at anything competitive was by getting my ass beat then figuring out how to get better
  putting wheels on the grass/off track is an incident    lime rock is very narrow and touring cars specificially understeer a lot    if you showed up for the race you would know its a lot of fun and you will enjoy it    sign up
  the problem with shitters is that they usually fuck things up for other people its okay to be slow as long as you let other people get past but its really not that funny when some tard crashes into you for the tenth time
  those are wreckers not shitters
  also im pretty sure the fuck off kerbs created incidents just by going near them
  a wrecker wrecks you intentionally  a shitter wrecks you because he cant drive for shit and locks his brakes in a braking zone cant gauge distance or just spins his car for some mystery reason
  people stopped tripping and are still here because they realised that only attention seeking retards use tripcodes
          take a time to ding dong diddly read this 
  this
was busy recently couldnt join pcars2 races at first  series died before i got ready  rf2 popped up missed first race because im retarded  most likely wont be able to join this saturday  please dont die until 15th i swear ill be a good boy and ill be joining a lot and stuff
  you better join
  this will be the last ovg thread
reminder that assoluto racing is an asset flip game and the devs tricked everyone including car manufacturers who actually gave licenses to them to believe they made everything from ground up
  the absolute state of yuroposters    james doesnt even drive a red car
  the previous thread was the last ovg thread this is ogc now
  who
  can you do some for other tripfags
  there are none left
  who
  von is here do vonmoltke exposed
  starking organized everything but never raced himself and was discovered to have flown halfway across the world to fuck valrys  valrys was a mentally ill man dressing as a girl  leoda was a mentally ill man dressing as a girl  paltalla was a furry who spent 400 on a painting of his fursonas wife posed in front of a bugatti  cosmo was a neet that told everyone he was going to work in monster jam but never did  james was an elitist prick  von often organized races that nobody asked for and oversaturated ovg with useless shit like turnleft  sj probably just had schizophrenia so he gets a pass  because racecars brother raced proper sprint cars but he would instead sit at home and watch anime  kira was a discord roastie that sat in her own room and amassed a group of beta orbiters
    hi james
  this is the other reason why people left ovg von literally didnt do anything to piss anyone off and people want this motherfucker exposed
  trips dressing up as traps is mentally ill  but the actual mentally ill trip gets a pass
  someone in the last thread said they wrote ones for other trips and i want to read them
  how dare they talk smack about my favorite trip (((
  things like bottoming out cause incidents on liveracers as well so however many times your car contacts the ground going through turn 5 for example
  wow yeah ovg is dying so lets just shit on people who actually contributed to the thread     thatll surely encourage people to come on our discord to make friends and invest time into posting and racing with each other the fact that anything they say will be morphed and used against them to make fun of them publicly in the thread
  its the mumble elite they want to kill ovg to save ovg please join the discord and be a part of the resistance
join wecjr and settle all this shitposting on track
reminder if you dont enjoy ovg drama you have shit taste
  implying somebodys personal life affected ovg in any way  starking did literally nothing wrong  valrys did nothing wrong  leoda did nothing wrong  palatalla did nothing wrong  cosmo did nothing wrong  james is a bit of a prick for no reason and needs to chill out  if you didnt like vons series nobody forced you to participate  sj had crippling assburgers so its not really his fault  racecar did nothing wrong  kira literally didnt do anything at all her beta orbiters did that to themselves
                    what the fuck are you all talking about trips
  its what happens when you take an weed
being honest i never recall shitters being much of an issue everybody wrecked at one point or another these series were never supposed to be serious    i feel like most of the ogs left because they either got busy with real life or they got sick of everyone shitting on them for no reason the only reason i stopped putting series on was i got bust with college and work and everyone shitting on everything sucked the motivation out     is mostly spot on none of these things would even be an issue if you all didnt spam the thread with them incessantly
  did what to themselves
  tfw never trip but stopped coming around  i guess i ghosted away senpai
still mad that the new 650s spider cant be driven topdown  i mean whats the fucking point when we already have the coupe
  an weed  an weed  god dammit im a stoner myself and you sir are completely insufferable
  became beta orbiters kira never came in the mumble and said hey ill fuck you if you give me attention so if she had a group of creeps orbiting her thats their own faults and not hers
  the dudes that organized the gt6 stuff were pretty lit too   i remember couple of the the guys gave me tips  and we fucked with race 07 for like a minute too around the same time period
    kira  trip  you mean trap
why does jimmy sound like hes about to throw up every time he plays in vr
  yes pls
  y no dirt turnleft
  thats what the cuck googles do
the december update introduces some important changes to force feedback in forza 7 the new force feedback is a full physically based system utilizing forza motorsport 7s suspension kinematics and tire modeling to send tire loads to the steering wheel it produces a more intuitive feel with more accurate align torque and a solid feeling of connection to the road    importantly for wheel users this new wheel update completely replaces the old system which means players tuning values from before december will be reset wheel users will need to tune from scratch to take advantage of this new and improved system    new free car pic felated
  not for me james not for me
  thats a big lad
  all of these improvements to probably not put them in the next forza game i love turn 10
  thats because simracers are too chickenshit to actually get used to vr and only care about using it for racing so they never let themselves get accustomed to using vr for more than 15 minutes hotlapping and wonder why theyre always motion sick when driving out of pit lane    ive been turned around before which is unpleasant as shit but i havent had a game past the first week of owning a headset to make me feel ill
  unironically watching jimmy b
  pray4kraid mx5 memorial trophy when
  unironically watching the jimmer the shed nigger
  whats your setup sporky cpu gpu and headset and what level of detail do you run the trees look a bit shit in that screenshot
  weve already done a season 3 though feel free to host a season 4 disappear after 2/3 races and leave the series to someone else to host like all the times before
i still wake up sweating after steamy kira dreams
  that map was on some lousy spa i found on the workshop but i generally keep everything on medium for rfactor 2 and most other vr titles i use a vive headet with room scale so i use the setup for more than just racing titles i use an amd 480 8gb with an fx8350 so depending on the title i can get it working straight out of the box without much problems pavlov elite h3vr or i have to deal with optimizing a buggy game skyrim fallout 4 first
  how does pc2 run on that toaster
  paying all this money only to run a 6 year old game on medium graphics  vr shills will defend this
  being poor  poorfags will defend this
  i dont immediately rush out and buy a shiny new gadget but rather wait to see if its everything the press and fanboys has made it out to be before parting with a couple hundred dollars  this obviously means im a poorfag    its called being a good consumer you absolute mongoloid
  is there a website where i can check ac laptimes
  trusting the press and fanboys  anon
  youre not going to get anything radically better for a few hundred dollars for at least the next five years
  how does pc2 run on that toaster  never tried dont give a shit about pc2 i probably wouldnt even play it even if it was free id rather play one light source gt3 edition over it       shills will defend this  spending 300 on a racing wheel only to be a total shitter for an hour once a week and ruin everyone elses fun because you cant race properly  simracers will defend this       dont immediately rush out and buy a shiny new gadget but rather wait to see if its everything the press and fanboys has made it out to be before parting with a couple hundred dollars  waiting for 6 years is running out to immediately buy a shiny new gadget      rather wait to see if its everything the press and fanboys has made it out to be  trusting the press and fanboys in the first place
  never tried dont give a shit about pc2 i probably wouldnt even play it even if it was free  you looking to get your ass whooped son
  never tried dont give a shit about pc2 i probably wouldnt even play it even if it was free  based as fuck sj is my hero     james
it has now been five years almost to the day since ovgt3 started    sj serious question why are you still around these parts     i have never in all my time on the internet seen someone have so much genuine disdain towards one type of game genre yet repeatedly and almost masochistically subject themselves to it as if they are in a trance they cannot break that is what this is  a trance    the first year it was funny the third year it was kind of concerning you are now on year five some of the anons/trips you once fought with now have nothing to do with ovg or visit once in a blue moon to shitpost others are married or even have kids     and yet you are still here and while we are all still here still shitposting and racing with each other to some extent the disdain which you display is extremely questionable you seem to get upset at anything to do with auto racing the time needed to practice and git gud the skill level of the faster ovg players the games themselves though i will agree with you on that point in which many are objectively shit and outdated     why though there are many many communities in which you can play your beloved arma 3 many many communities in which you can mess around with skyrim and yet you continue to visit this holeinthewall for racing games on 4chan games that you have admitted you didnt actually enjoy and only played because you happened to come upon this thread one day and hold nothing but bitterness towards them    why no reasonable person would force themselves to play games they dont like and a community they didnt get along with for half of a decade
  pytboj
  sure same question as     no rational personal forces themselves to play games they dont enjoy for half a decade continuing to visit obscure communities for those games on a regular basis
  never tried dont give a shit about pc2 i probably wouldnt even play it even if it was free  based and redpilled
the chad spork vrready juct  the virgin austin mommy i feel sick ogonoski
    nice samefagging sj just because a person doesnt want to waste money on meme tech doesnt mean theyre automatically a poorfag
  ive got a few minutes and you obviously want this so lets do this like 2014 then shall we    i have never in all my time on the internet seen someone have so much genuine disdain towards one type of game genre  you seem to act like i absolutely hate racing games and dont actually play racing games     yet repeatedly and almost masochistically subject themselves to it as if they are in a trance they cannot break  ill touch on this later on    the first year it was funny the third year it was kind of concerning you are now on year five some of the anons/trips you once fought with now have nothing to do with ovg or visit once in a blue moon to shitpost  some of the trips i fought with yes but not all in fact there were and are a few trips i enjoyed racing with and do in fact miss racing with the problem nowadays is the intertwine of simracing with racing games when you have simracing taking over all racing discussion it becomes hard to talk about racing titles that arent project cars assetto corsa or rfactor    and yet you are still here and while we are all still here still shitposting and racing with each other to some extent  youre only partially right here the last simrace i took part in publicly was the yas marina and goldenport gt3 race last year but decided to give up after being accused of cheating at yas and then dumped at goldenport  i mean shit like whiplash was pretty fun though however for one post about whiplash you might have 500 posts about the big three simracing games    the time needed to practice and git gud  i havent complained about this since i got expelled from college in 2016    the skill level of the faster ovg players  if anything it was the other way around i put in the practice time for the morgan gt3 and it worked really well but instead i get told im running a speedhack that was when i gave up on simracing and went just for basic racing    1/2
  1/2  ive missed you
    the games themselves though i will agree with you on that point in which many are objectively shit and outdated   we talked about this way back in 2015 all of the big simracers are fundamentally flawed somehow  assetto corsa has no night mode without jerry rigging the game even if it does have the biggest modding scene  rfactor great but extremely old and shitty ffb when most people already moved on to ac  rfactor 2 started with an asinine 85 price tag losing any momentum to ac    why though there are many many communities in which you can play your beloved arma 3 many many communities in which you can mess around with skyrim and yet you continue to visit this holeinthewall for racing games on 4chan  you act like i can only play one genre of games and nothing else yes i have multiple generals now that do shit on /vg/ its just for some reason you believe i can only stick to one general only    and a community they didnt get along with for half of a decade  im not exactly sure how many posts you think i make in the thread at this point just because someone might check a thread once every 3 months doesnt mean theyre obsessively lurking it i dont know much of anything after gt3 besides infighting over series a la 2015 and some shitposting about kogay on what im assuming is cracked rfactor 2 however just because i still post here maybe a handful of times in the past year means im still obsessed with it even though i have other places with much bigger priorities than a general eating itself alive over stupid shit like equipment  funny how when shit goes wrong its somehow me fucking it up instead of the few dumbass trips sitting on closed chat channels all day you dearingly call mumble shadow government or /ogc/ discord despite the real /ogc/ thread being dead since april 2017 nobody seems to notice my posts except when everything goes sideways like the last turn of magnificent park    2/2
  good old prctier ramblings thats what nuovg needed
playing on a single monitor taught me some really bad habits like staring at the bit of road directly in front of me and not seeing the greater whole   im still struggling to unlearn that months after getting vr
  the problem nowadays is the intertwine of simracing with racing games when you have simracing taking over all racing discussion it becomes hard to talk about racing titles that arent project cars assetto corsa or rfactor    okay so you joined ovg when it was pretty sim heavy     why instead of continuing to subject yourself to this did you not just ask hey are there any bigger groups that play the more normie games because the answer is 1 yes and 2 a lot of them     i put in the practice time for the morgan gt3 and it worked really well but instead i get told im running a speedhack that was when i gave up on simracing and went just for basic racing    so you had two bad races and then parked the bus because of minor banter thats kinda pathetic desu
tfw no /ovg/ league thats not in a sim or tied to (((xbox live)))
  feel free to make it happen hosting series is open to everyone with an internet connection  also wecjr touring cars are playable with a fucking keyboard so join the series
  what exactly were you expecting were playing sims here
  did you not just ask hey are there any bigger groups that play the more normie games because the answer is 1 yes and 2 a lot of them  look at the attempts to move the thread from /o/ to /vg/ for instance by other anons even when trying to casualize the general it didnt work and it inevitably returned to majority simracing discussion with a slice of arcade games here and there in addition name a casual racing game thread on any imageboard and not just some reddit or discord group      so you had two bad races and then parked the bus because of minor banter thats kinda pathetic desu  not really  yas  i decided to show up to this race as an anon with a completely different car than my usual red mercedes gt3 and instead in a blue morgan gt3 yas as a race went fine if a bit uneventful the issue is after the race everyone got so pissy at the fact i decided to spend time learning the morgan and a basic yas setup that they later turned on anticheat to make sure i wasnt speedhacking theres no banter about that its butthurt that they lost  goldenport  so getting dumped in a corner intentional or not is also just minor banter too if this was 2015 you would be wanting whoever wrecked your race booted out as was the case during the latency tap during laguna seca 2015 that got me a season ban for intentional unsafe driving in a kangaroo court ran by the mumble
  so getting dumped in a corner intentional or not is also just minor banter too  it totally is banter now we add ai to get dumped into corners and its the best thing since unsliced bread
  i mean shit like whiplash was pretty fun though however for one post about whiplash you might have 500 posts about the big three simracing games  there is only one solution more whiplash
  even when trying to casualize the general it didnt work and it inevitably returned to majority simracing discussion with a slice of arcade games here and there    so you went to a mens league soccer game while they were in the middle of their yearly tournament and then complained there wasnt enough talk about baseball    they later turned on anticheat to make sure i wasnt speedhacking    if youre not speedhacking this is a literal nonissue    if this was 2015 you would be wanting whoever wrecked your race booted out as was the case during the latency tap during laguna seca 2015 that got me a season ban for intentional unsafe driving in a kangaroo court ran by the mumble    on track incidents are always contextual good on you for putting the effort to practice in later years but if in 2015 youre known as someone who doesnt give a shit and can barely keep control of the car and youre wrecking out people who actually did put in the time to race of course youll get the boot
/ovgrs2/ when
  when valrys comes back to save us from this tyranny
  i dont care about tyranny i just wanna drive slow trash cars again
  wec junior has got you covered    race 2 is coming up and sign ups are always open
  the slow trash cars arent slow or trashy enough
  whats the fucking point  padding out the car list so they can sell us shit like the pista after the pass ends
  whats slow and trash to you
  is a renault clio slow enough for you
    so you went to a mens league soccer game while they were in the middle of their yearly tournament and then complained there wasnt enough talk about baseball  more like going to a minor league baseball stadium and wondering when the amateur league game is its still baseball but its not as serious baseball and some actually do have less serious events    if youre not speedhacking this is a literal nonissue  and i cleared the check so it is a non issue what it does though is fuck up at least 4 other peoples races due to file mismatches and give them an easy excuse for being beaten by a guy that shows up to one race a year    good on you for putting the effort to practice in later years but if in 2015 youre known as someone who doesnt give a shit and can barely keep control of the car and youre wrecking out people who actually did put in the time to race of course youll get the boot  true but this also happened to you too remember mid ohio
  if it has more than 150 horsepower its too good
/teamsj/
  ovg was always a weird hodgepodge of sim and arcade discussion    that being said once season was in session and the group was mostly consisting of 20somethings that were pretty big motorsports fans that should have been your cue to maybe look for a different group if you werent as into it as they were    instead you basically got mad that 4chan didnt cater to your personal tastes and then frustrated yourself trying to fit in with them when there were tons of alternatives available    whats funny is that you claim to like the nonserious games so much and thats fine but when you tried to start your own rival coalition what game did you use yep thats right rfactor the very game you didnt like and wanted people to talk less about
  i mean shit like whiplash was pretty fun though however for one post about whiplash you might have 500 posts about the big three simracing games  pls organize whiplash series
james going full bpd gf
    but when you tried to start your own rival coalition  it was never a rival coalition it was a place to talk about racing games while in exile it was a much more casual and laid back than the overly serious simracing environment that 4chan had    what game did you use yep thats right rfactor  because rfactor was fun at the time as it was somewhat obsolescent but not obsolete and fit well for organizing people to play on keep in mind my rfactor content really started around summer of 2015 and then again in 2017 when there was a lot more time to play rfactor than in the middle of a rigorous college curriculum like i had tried to do during ovgt3 s1 that is where i spent a lot of time driving alone or with ai instead of playing multiplayer to learn the setups and handling of the cars and generally still play solo races to this day    the very game you didnt like and wanted people to talk less about  keep in mind during this time of /ovg/ you had the switch over from rfactor to gsce and ac of which gsce was just a paid extension of rfactor like race 07 and ac was and still is one light source the biggest key difference in it though was that our rfactor discussion was a lot more laid back compared to /ovg/s discussion as i mentioned above if someone wrecked there wasnt an entire thread of people screaming at each other and webming every single little scrape it was just a group of guys racing and having fun the overly serious result of 2017 ogctcc is what killed the general and usurped the discord from my control into the merrymens control

i like cars
  me too
who are you cheering on /o/    the list is here 
  le waifu meme  yeah i come here exclusively to white knight some richfag roastie racing cars
  you dont want a rich waifu who can outdrive you
  rich wifu who can outdrive you  ahaa all the better to see her cum and cry for more of my big fat cock inside her squirting sperm and inpregenating her
how long until some transwhatever gets into the league and stomps those girls
racefu thread
  kek    is there anything women can do better than men they even got beaten at a beauty contest ffs
  they can fuck better then men they can make babies better then men they can be better mothers then men
remember when female race car drivers were actually good based on their own abilities grit and determination not because of equal opportunities
  literally all of this is false    virgin detected
  wrong right because thats fucking human mechanics and wrong
  thats just one example and i personaly feel that it was a fixed race
  audi paid all the other teams and drivers to let her win
      lyn st james had a very respectable career in sports cars
  girl racers have their own league  cant wait to watch the crashes should be better than nascar
  theyre from a different generation those women are more manly than any guy born in the last 20 yrs
  im not a burger so please dont ridicule me for this stulid question  arent women allowed to participate in nascar anyway
  i know i was just giving another example of a woman that did well and given a chance based on her talent    honestly i think katherine legge has quite a bit of talent as far as modern day drivers
    yes there just havent been many that have actually come up through the ranks based on talent    i think johanna long was a decent driver she just never got a chance in anything other than low tier equipment before the team folded
  women are allowed to compete in most normal sports leagues the nfl as another example there are womenspecific sports leagues though because women cant compete with men at the highest level
  so if men and women are allowed to participate in an event that is not about physical strength why make a womenonly series
  what does nascar have to do with this thread theres nothing stopping women from participating in any racing afaik there are hardly even any americans competing in this click the damn link      there are quite a few nowadays too even danica patrick did pretty well in indycar despite the lackluster nascar career
  but motorsports is different from other sports since physical strength isnt what wins races
  because muh gender imbalance in motorsports the whole point of this is to inspire girls to get into racing something that is generally considered a mans sport
keep in mind that there is a fair amount of women who dont like this    
  i think it is kind of depressing to say  we know you are not as good as others so we made up a league of bad drivers for you to compete with you will never win anything real
  youre retarded and missing the point there are champions in this race who have beat men on the track every racer in this has competed against men
  if they can beat men what is the point of making it women only
  holy fuck you are retarded do i have to keep repeating myself read the fucking article and the thread
  why do they need to compete with men men are not women its like saying a pro basketball player needs to win at the pga tour or something
  this post makes 0 sense
  i just did that and it still makes no sense  since physical strength doesnt win races men dont have an advantage and there is no reason to segregate  hell if anything women have an advantage by having a lower weight on average
  goddamn youre still missing the point lol it makes sense youre just stupid apparently you dont know shit about racing in general since pretty much every racing league has a minimum weight    you fucking mong its to encourage more women to get into motorsports not a hurr durr this league only for women cuz they cant race men
  men are inately better at hunting due to their prehistpric role in the herd which creates the aggresion and the focus that can be attained from it
  if they can compete with men why make a special womens only league  im pretty sure a woman winning there will get less publicity that a woman winning the real thing
  how many people on that list have you heard of there are women on there that have won championships against men
women  ever
  women  ever
  women  ever
  women  ever
  as usual men do it better
  is that horse semen she is drinking
  so what is the point then  either they are able to compete with men and a womens series is pointless or they cant conpete and need their own classes
incel the thread    youre all sad lonley people who are going to die alone 
  goddamn youre still fucking stupid im done repeating myself
  implying youre not a degenerate whore    id bet youd fuck your own throat with my rod ive been with creeps like you
  like i give a fuck
this thread
  yes anon everything you see on the internet is real there is no way its a joke
  defending women online wont stop you from being an incel buddy boyo
  too bad danica is literally just another roastie who sold her body to american commercialism

 who are you cheering on /o/    the body shop guys getting all that sweet sweet overtime
  inpregenating
  yeah try to drive a f1 and come back to me any regular bloke would be exhausted in no time from the constant gs taken
even in truck racing series the woman are manly
  brazil  yea ill go on a limb here and say she used to be a he
  used to be
    maybe who knows
  fuck better than men  virgin detected i wish i was gay
    she is a horse so thats ok
  i thought women handled gforce better than men do
  she posted nude i can tell you that shes 100 woman
  not sure i often sustain 3 g with no issues for about 20 minutes straight in a g103 acro  maximum i pulled was about 6 g a little more than allowed but it can handle that  i seriously doubt formula 1 cars reaches anywhere near 6 g
  waifu who can outdrive you  hahaha ok then why do they have their own league
  literally barbra palvin
    any source pls
  the thing is you can do 6gs but can you do it for an entire race f1s pull around 35gs and there is quite a few turns on a course
  actually most serial killers are from single mothers and most kids with issues are from a house with no father mothers are the worst men can be better moms than moms can all the facts are there  fuck better  no men do most of the work and it takes nothing to get a man off men have to be good at sex to get a woman off   make babies better than men  men in a lab can make better babies than women with less risk of disease and death
  did pretty well in indy  8 years  one win  7 podium  literally not good stats if she was a man she probably wouldnt even have a fucking ride in nascar or indy but lmao female so she got eight years with shit results
    most serial killers are from single mothers  most single parents are mothers     get a man off  i dont want man to get me off    men in a lab can make babies  men need a lab to make babies
  you are making no sense  get more women to race against men  by starting a womens only league where their talent cant be properly compared to the men  its because women cant beat men with any consistency there will be occasional wins there will be occasional podiums but women generally arent going to beat top tier men in any sport women literally cant race men top tier women can beat mid tier men sometimes thats the best they can hope for outside fluke wins due to circumstance like danicas only win was when several leaders had fuel conservation issues

i used to race against one of these girls in karting and there are pictures of her looking to the right at the start while shes turning left into the first corner
      clic the red button
  this
  first corner pileups happen in racing but everything about that endurocross start is embarassing
    better mothers     you know the vast majority of child abuse is committed by women not that the media will let you know about it also the majority of that abuse is toward male children its a massive metoo movement waiting to happen
  this guy gets it
  i seriously doubt formula 1 cars reaches anywhere near 6 g  they do now  f1 drivers also lose about 10kg per race    
tfw youre so equal that you need your own league to prepare you for racing against men instead of just rising up the ranks in the normal leagues like all the men do
  to be fair anon by todays standards its near impossible to as you say rise through up ranks do to all the race politics in most series these days had a buddy who raced sprint cars as many do before moving up to other forms of stock car racing or even indy although karting is more popular for that he was pretty good well received in the community but could catch a break not to mention the money put into it as a privateer the top dogs dont want pushed out by new kids on the block regardless of winning or losing theyll do whatever it takes to make it as expensive and hard as possible for entry into a series its become a more who you know not what you know kind of thing i never cared for it but i assume thats one of the major reasons everyone hates f1 so much and that thread was just active if not still up about it
if /o/ was about to go about doing up a 1995 bmw 740i with 140k miles flat battery little bit of rust and overheating issues    how would /o/ do it
i wouldnt do it in the first place
im not doing it up for financial gain ive never done anything like this before and am able to get a good price on it and its a model i like and could be a new hobby    the guy says he thinks overheating issue is with the thermostat but that could be bs idk
  if the price is more than a hundy do a 360 and moonwalk away
  i wouldnt take it to a bmw dealership but i would take it to my guy and throw money at him until its perfect    t dads had 5 of them in 10 years bmw dealership is run by retarded garbageeating cuntholes
      could you explain more about why please
  i wouldnt go near a moneypit like that
  what sort of stuff can i expect to have to replace or get done
  a lot of the electronics at some point gearbox might one day implode without any previous warning various seals in the engine bay will decide to fuck off various sensors will shit the bed and cause a headache if its the m60 40 and hasnt regularly been serviced just dont touch it if its the m62 you might be lucky but everything connected to the engine will still potentially make you cry at night    if you want specific details i can dig up old garage papers regarding the e38s weve had but needless to say its not going to be kind to your bank account if you really want to keep it    most recent problem we had was the yaw speed rate sensor which is under the passenger seat here in bongland idk if they swap them around for lhd  rhd deciding to keep the dsc light on on the dash we replaced it  cleared codes and still had the light various testings later and we determined the fucking wire between that sensor and the ecu is fucked which would be a small fortune to replace and not even guarantee to solve the problem so our mechanic took the bulb out because fuck that little cunt light and fuck the government saying its not roadworthy because of a niggering little fucking sensor that has no effect on the rest of the car reee etc
  for a start make sure its an l
  dads had 5 of them in 10 years    op does this not explain why not to get it
  will cost 2000 per year to keep running
  start by accepting that youve made a huge mistake because these things are absolute trash
i hope youre stocked up on oil stabilizer and are good with a wrench
every electronic can and will start acting fucky particularly the dashboard also cheap plastic very brittle if left in the sun do you know where yours is from
  overheating issues means the cooling system needs to be totally redone the engine will literally blow up or could already have warped internals because of it
  did someone die on that seat what the fuck
  its a possibility
im going to be buying a new 2018 honda crv exl awd the salesman offered to reduce the price 30342 before fees and taxes by 1000 is that a fair price should i ask for a larger discount before we pull the trigger ive never bought a new car before so im not sure what to be doing    this is a repost because the picture i used in the last one wasnt a crv
  not a great deal not a complete rip off but not a bargain not by a long shot i can tell you that im pretty excited about the new passport though
  should i be pushing for a lower price if so how much is reasonable     he did the whole go argue the price with the manager bit but i assume thats always bullshit
why did you delete your other thread
  just remember he doesnt get paid if he doesnt sell the car so you can play with making offers and not get called a lowballer like a craigslist brainlet
  i used a picture that wasnt a crv like a retard    sorry if you replied in the last one while it was up
also should i try to negotiate anything else other than just the price
  why buy such an ugly and soulless car
  because op is guaranteed to be a braindead npc but hell reply and try to unsuccessfully prove otherwise
  braindead npcs need vehicles too im just trying to figure out the best deal for my choice
dont buy a crv the engine has a problem with gas leaking into the oil
  ive read about that from what ive looked into its a rare issue that is completely covered under warrantee if it does happen apparently they narrowed it down to happening due to short trips in very cold weather
  did you leave your number with them  if so let them call you in a day or two and make an offer also go read the dealership stories thread currently up
  yeah i left my number my plan was to wait a couple days and then ask for a further 500 off
  calling someone else a braindead npc while using a meme of a meme that recycled old memes  thats some next level npcing right there
never walk into a dealership without internet pricing this is what a i quoted my customer that walked out with our last awd exl this is in texas tho
  you upsold a car by 5k  msrp impressive    i mean if a car is above msrp at a dealership  thats a huge red flag about it
  no haggle more cuz it is honda cheap car try 25k
  wouldnt they just tell me to fuck off at that price
  probably desu and are you getting the hybrid
  so what find another willing to bend over you
  i sing think the 2018 crv comes in a hybrid surprisingly the mpg is still comparable to a hybrid rav4      if they were to give me an extra 500 off on top of the grand they already offered i think id be comfortable with that im just making sure im not getting completely ripped off
  have you actually properly test driven it i know people who like these and theyre truly horrible vehicles 30k gets you a nice truck that gets you similar mileage
other things to look out for   (((interest rate)))  (((extended warranty)))  (((floor mats)))  (((early loan payoff fee)))  (((service package)))  (((paint protection)))
is the kelly blue book fair price amount to be trusted
  no as its owned by stealerships    same with truecar
check out cargurus but realize those prices are still just the dealerships advertised prices and you can usually haggle from there
  if you want a good deal just tell them you want your out the door price to be the sticker price    usually means you get around 34k off    most dealerships will be willing to do so
  do this op    if the msrp is 31k say you will pay 31k with all taxes tags options processing fees and freight / everything included    its an easy way to not get fucked on a car
    thats a great idea     i do currently have the offer all things included under the msrp but not the selling price the msrp is 31345 the selling price is 30342 and the current offer with taxes and fees included is 31131 so i should say that ill pay 30342 after all fees and taxes
    legit
  invoice price isnt the same as msrp
  what is invoice price and why do they show it
here bro price includes tint nitro wheel locks and paint protection
  your tax might be a different since im in texas
my dad would request manufacturers invoice or something from the dealer and not pay much more than that they were pissed when he drove off the lot
  do they have any rebates if they have a 1000 rebate then they are discounting nothing you want to request the invoice for the vehicle and offer to pay a few hundred over that then they should throw the rebates in as well
  no rebates unless youre in the military or currently in college who can afford a new vehicle in college anyway       thank you for that so that is what you paid for it with this additions you paid a total of 31517
  they were lying they had 1000 dealer cash but that expires today
  i dont know what dealer cash is
  new incentives will be out tomorrow in place of the ones that expired check them out on hondas website tomorrow beware a dealership that wont even tell you about their own sales 
  no dont listen to this bus rider  just use truecar and buy it get the approval from union bank first and tell dealership to beat it easy
  false monthly rebates are given out by manufacturers dealership will be deep shit try to fuck around with rebates

ugly as fuck but its a good civic
need a new econoshitbox bros     civic hatch or corolla hatch
coupe is nice but the r is an abomination

  ugly as fuck but its a good civic  ops pic with the updated bumpers fake vents removed actually looks really good imo that coup is sleek
  i would go civic hatchback if you must get something new in that price range
any foreign car made after 2010 is maximum cringe

  cant compete with the new corollas and mazda3s not in aesthetics anyway
  lets see that front    angry fish
    its probably a great car mechanically speaking     but theres no escaping the objectively hideous looks from every angle

  ok whats this then
    not gay
    the new civic is years ahead design wise it will be unappreciated now although prices will skyrocket in 10 years its so sexy if i could cream inside an exhaust pipe this would be it

civic has and will always be the best ecobox all other cars are memes
  current mazda 3 hatchback/sedan is sexiest desu no competition
except for the cvt and the trashy rs design yes it is a good civic mazda 3 is better tough
its so huge and the hatch looked liked an after taught other than those its a good car
  i think it looks awful but i figured it might be the kind of design to look good in a decade
  except the coupe nor sedan never had fake vents besides the si the redesign is worse over them
  definitely cringe i just dont think i can get behind this new styling everything seems to have now that weird angry crossover style
    i hate that 5th door look new sedans have    audi the iphone of car world started that shit and now everyone is copying it
  coupe doesnt look half bad
save 5k and get a sentra all cars in this class are throwaways so go cheap
  take the swift or mazda 2
if the coupe was a lift back it would be the best car

  this civics are the worst looking both interior and exterior in that segment the fuck were they thinking

  too bad the coupe is strictly worse than the 4door and its just for looks
cringe
  burgers will say its good    anyone whos driven a real hot hatch will tell you that its way too fucking long
  civic hatch sport  its a lot of fun
  seriously i only buy coupes that are 3k dollar fun boxes to fuck around with anything i intend to daily or use a lot is gonna have 4 doors    there is nothing worse than pulling up to a sidewalk to pick a friend up only for them to have to walk all the way around to get in
  isnt the coupe lighter and a shorter wheel base overall a smaller car    my 8th gen accord coupe is alot shorter than an accord sedan and is about the same size as the current civic sedan

  mazda
  why
honestly i kind of like how they look however the 15 l turbo and cvt turn me off from them because it donest seem that reliable past 100k miles    looking at the configurator and the wikipedia page it looks like the base model sedan has a k20 which is pretty nice unfortunately youre still stuck with a cvt unless you get a stick    if i were to get one i would want the hatchback with the n/a k20 and a regular 6 speed automatic or a stick in white if they toned down on the fake vents it would be a plus

hey /o/    i am considering buying this car as my second car as my 2000 golf recently was totaled after is threw a rod and i got a 2000 insurance check    is this alright    
if you reeeaally want it go ahead    but something tells me its got a hidden problem
anyone else go on bringatrailer to find clean examples of shitboxes i came across this gem today    also post some clean shitboxes you have cam across wether it be online or in person
mfw
          fuuugggg  drop that an inch or 2 lower
should i feel bad for being the only car on the road that was made in 90s 
yes because your car is too new
what the fuck kind of rich prick cesspit do you live in
  80s masterrace reporting in
  nah lots of cult cars were made in the 90s
no  here on /o/ we run in the 90s/
  even poor people have cars from the last two decades  dude the 90s are further back than you think
  the last two   oh god
  90s  motherfucker i dailied shit from the 60s until about six months ago and im only upgrading to the 80s because it was the only thing that met what i wanted    its not the age of the car but the person driving it fuck the normies and their good new cars
i still think of the 90s as recent in my head for some reason    i still think of anything after 2000 as super recent despite that being 18 years ago    why am i like this
  its not the age of the car but the person driving it    except when that drunk shit plows into you airbags and other crash tech have changed a lot since the 60s
  because youre a zoomer now
  you are now that guy that used to still wear leisure suits in the late 90s
  tfw your car is from this decade  tfw you bought it with good boy points  thanks dad    why are you asking if you should feel bad obviously youre already feeling like a poor fag or you wouldnt have made the thread    if you attach meaning to how old you car is then a newer one will probably make you happier    no one should feel anything they either do or dont but its not like theres a default option
    daily 70s checking in
  fix or repair daily
  i had the same realization recently when i was car shopping i thought that 2007 vehicles were quite new but theyre just as old as my 2001 was when i got it in 2012 as for why 2000s stuff seems recent i would guess at least for me that its because most of the stuff i still do is from the 2000s i never did social media and music and movies died in the late 2000s so theres this whole decade that i barely participated in so while time has passed it doesnt feel like it so much because im still doing the same shit i did 15 years ago
  wait another 20years and you wont feel like that anymore  cars from the 90s are todays poorest mans cars    in 20 years all the shit will be gone  only the good ones survive that long
  fuck i think the same but never could describe this feeling i feel like 90s are still relevant when in fact its 2025 years old
  this
i have a 2001 full size sedan and it feels small on the roads because it doesnt have a xbox huge front grille
  not being proud of not being an npc who cant keep a 90s car running and needs a brand new car to feel safe
its a badge of honor op a badge of honor
  youre missing the sticky thumbtack friend
only  90s cars are still everywhere give it another 10 years then youll be an outlier
  hahaha
  based and redpilled
mfw 8 air bags and no exhaust on daily shitbox
  its not the age of the car but the person driving it  thats bullshit and you know it go set the burgerkingring record in an unmodified car from the 60s then you fucking boomer

  imagine being so much of a pleb that you actually want to drive an audi tt in a videogame full of hypercars
  rekt
  please fuck off into oblivion
  i want to drive a crown vic in a videogame full of hypercars when i first played gran turismo i skip over those millions of boring skyrines and rx7s to drive a 98 ford taurus sho and a ram 1500 very mundane cars can sometimes be the most fun
  he didnt play gran turismo with a 1978 mitsubishi mirage all the way through
  i completely agree with you racing games have a problem where you can usually just save up money to buy some hypercar and then just use that for the entirety of the game i like racing shitboxes against shitboxes you learn to really love the car youre driving more
  clearly has never played gran turismo    yeah that starlet do good in the rwd club races
enzo
  2d trees and grass
  tfw i thought it was a fourth gen eclipse and found it was audi trash
  is this on pc
  what else would it be you retard
not taking the fastest racing line
  t triggered console nigger
  alright im saving up for a ps4 pro because i just got a 4k tv with hdr10 on black friday i hear gran turismo sport is the most beautiful racing game ever and i remember feeling the same way about gran turismo in general on ps3/2/1 but now i keep hearing about forza and i am just curious if i should buy an xbox instead   i cant buy two gaming consoles or my gf will say no if i ask her to marry me next year
  horizon is on pc 3 is cracked 4 has keys you can buy for 40
  xbox is pointless get a ps4 or upgrade your pc every good xbox game is on pc anyway
  true but sony is censoring games because  muh children   so fuck them just get a pc or nintendo
  forzas been going down the tubes since the switch to xbox one removal of features and cars left and right and adding dumb new shit no one wants
hey /o/ i recently got a gti with the intention of flipping it but instead decided to keep for myself  let me see your vws
  nice golfe  i recently got a 2009 polo no pictures though   its also a 3 cylinder

fortnite has singlehandedly ruined gaming
can you play as a female particularly in a cat costume
exactly how id picture an rs200 owner
    you know they put those in just because of fortnite and whats worse is that 99 of fortnite players are casual who will say video games are dumb when they grow up
  its sad that a call of duty game from 11 years ago had the greatest unlock system in all of gaming modern games are complete trash
  which call of doodie ive only played bo2
  hot pursuit 2
  the og modern warfare if you liked a gun you used it as you use it you rack up kills the more kills you get the more skins you unlock if you wanted a cool skin all you had to do was be good none of this fucking microtransaction jewish trickery
  fuckgin lol
  hp2 had a goat unlock system with the nfs points and campaign tree      mw2 had a better unlock system imo the original game required too much focus on single weapons
  i fucking miss fm4 biggest shitbox/affordable car selection great track selection qualityoflife features like car gifting free upgrade parts public custom mp lobbies where did it all go so wrong
  emotes existed before fortnite
  you know how i know youre under 18
    i think black ops 1 was the best since you had to grind for money to buy the guns
theres only one emote page i know
  implying tf2 has had anywhere near the same level of mainstream success as fortnite    theyre the same game but valve botched console release and missed all the money spending normies as a result
  when you get random eventd and get a rare emote  flexin on them plebs ge  good times
  tf2 would have been fuckin cancer if it had multiplat success because more normies would have played it
  you know you can still play fm4 right online is still up
  forza has been around since the days of the original xbox and if the franchise wants to stay alive they need to market the game to the new generation yeah its obviously painfully out of place even in a racing game but at least now i can dab on shitters that cant into racing lines
my corolla is having some issues its an auto and im thinking about getting a new car what do you think about chevrolet ss for my next car to try and not flip i had a 91 integra before the mustang
  you sound like you just cant handle rear wheel drive fagget
i handled your mom in the back of my prior mpv
  for the same amount of money as the ss you can get the infinately more comfortable ctsv which also has z06 supercharger and comes in could and wagon styles
  how do you flip a tank
  if you choose one car over another because its more comfortable you might be a soiy boy
  take that 10 ladder out of your anus and stop lying its very pathetic
  before and after i farmed it i was totally fine but the car wasnt thats why im driving the corolla
  massive shitboxes  can you aim for something made after 2011 whats your budget
  yeah im kinda broke so like 5 grand ill be spending like 2k anyway on fixing the corolla trans so ill put it towards another car or i could just fix it i would like a gas milage between the corolla and the mustang even if i could afford it i i have a love hate thing for how really new cars drive and the onions in me is saying comfortability between them too i did love how the 91 integra with a billion miles on it was always trying to kill me even though i never got to wrap it around a tree before i sold it
  camera photo of multiple pictures in separate windows on a mac with fucking a fucking sticky notes program for captions  im fucking dying
  then i took a picture of it and posted the epitome of elegant
  fuck off massochist you can pry my land barges from my cold dead hands
  how about selling the shitbox and getting a 2010 civic/corolla or something my dude
  yeah i think youre right ill do they still have hand crank windows
x is better than y because it is more fun  how do you incels even define more fun i often see jap commuter boxes posted on here which supposedly are more fun to drive to the anime convention than a bmw m series
  fun is subjective but objectively rwd cars are more fun than fwd and there is nothing anyone can do about it
everyone knows fun is just a buzzword you use when you cant think of any real reasons why something is good
  t brz owner mad she gets regularly walked by civic sis
  t mustang owner who got btfod by a civic on the twisties before spinning out into a guardrail
    are you by any chance insecure because you bought a civic
  t civic owner who got btfod by an evo on the twisties before understeering into a guardrail
  well i have more fun driving around in my civic hitting vtec and laughing at all the bmws in the dealership garage waiting to be fixed up    85 fun 100 of the time is better than 95 fun 30 of the time
  you can look up videos on youtube of real world examples that debunk the nonsense most of the fags here constantly spout fun is their cope
      why are civic owners always this insecure  bbetter than chads bmw just havent gotten around to modding it yet
                    seeth harder 
op makes no sense tbh  bluepilled incels are the ones who buy flashy cars because they think theyll get some pussy  unfortunately they didnt realise theres no car for your face
  easy one  because they drive a civic  their life is basically 40  understeering and getting btfod by chads bmw and 70  defending their poor purchase on an online imageboard
  60   im fucking retarded
  ugly  shit car    hella mad
rev up your engines
  doesnt believe in evolution
his hair has almost receded to a mullet
  and ring that bell
toyota was never really good at making sports cars
    is this guy legit or is he just another hysterical old man with cheap fixes
  no fuck u and ur celica old man    celicas suck
the 1000 cuts in his videos make me sick
  indeed they had to cheat a lot
  if evolution is real then why are the newer evos so shit  checkmate athiests
revvin
  with his cat postin im starting to think hes a furry
dont buy a mercedes/bmw theyre a money pit  weak point is the automatic transmission  nissan was only good pre renault partnership  nothing wrong with it if you only use it as a weekend toy  dealer level scan tool  get a mechanic like me to check it out
gajillion jumpcuts  no thanks would rather watch that other shill chris
  muh toyota  god i fucking hate this cringy boomer fuck so much
i used to think he was exaggerating for comedy but he is just a senile old fool
  what brought you to think he isnt exaggerating legit question im watching his stuff for the meme answers and the interesting stuff he points out      the fast bite size 5minute format keeps it bearable for the average viewer
    interesting stuff as in problems i did not think about that could crop up not the boomer answers also dont tell /pol/ about his sons wife choices
  nothing you quoted here is wrong or in bad faith
  about his sons wife choices    wat
  iirc his son has an asian wife  /pol/ would go nuclear if they heard this
  when did he say this
    literal character assassination attempt he even did a video explaining evolution where he admitted he is only human and not an expert on the matter
tfw own a mid 90s celica and actually like it   fucking boomers ruining everything
  is scotty a trump supporter
  interesting stuff he points out    all his videos are some variant on european cars being unreliable toyota being amazing and automatic transmissions being trash
  whats the problem here
  replace toyota with kia or hyundai and youve got /o/ in a nutshell so whats the issue

  this is all true
  hahahhaha  fucking zoomer you made me laugh with that
  well theres the car wash thing for example his toyota and his wifes lexus dominate that episode too but i havent really had the blessing to have car wash effects pointed out on a practical example the amount of paint fading really surprised me made me stop using the need to have the bottom of the car spray cleaned as an excuse i got myself a cheap pressure washer instead and use that to clean the underbody i only use gentle streams of water and a soft sponge to wash the body now
will the lcd meme die anytime soon    was something wrong with the physical dials
theres nothing wrong with digital displays the problem is where they put it gluing a tablet to the dash just looks bad
  give me that digital dash
  my guess is faster to put together/cheaper somehow makes me a bit sad to see lcd dials a screen actively fucks with night vision even if its displaying black
  will the lcd meme die anytime soon  i hope so oled screens looks way better
  
    gross its like the hydrodipped carbon fiber level of tacky and fake
  tacky and fake    its a production touchscreen from the 80s you brainlet
  yeah but it looks like shit  hence the comparison
  a better comparison would be an afro it was the shit back in the day but looking back at it it was just shit fake carbon was never peak fashion
  oled screens looks way better  enjoy your burnin
  wouldnt be a particularly large issue with a car actually given proper software
  as long as the climate controls and volume/tuning have physical dials i dont see a problem with it other than the fact that its a stupid glued on tablet
wipes out your dash and your entire ability to drive car  nothin personal kid
  right because no lcd panels ever have this problem or anything
can anyone here think of an alternative to touchscreens id rather have a touchscreen that 80 different buttons
  all cars build after like 1980 wont be able to drive at that point
  its very useful for the map so you dont have to waste your phones battery on long trips
  lcds dont have burn in
  dials and sliders
  they still suffer from image persistence
  which car had the little knob in the centre console for controlling shit on the information screen thats the proper way to do it dont have to reach anywhere just put your arm on the armrest and play with your knob
    fucking yes  also question would it be worth it to hunt this down and install it in my dedra
  bmw first experienced it a while back and now have terminal cancer you had to navigate menus to change where the air comes out of the dash thankfully the 3 series i picked up has a sane climate system
  mazda does it too since like 2014 touchscreen doesnt even register touches when the vehicle is in motion gotta use the center console dial
    89 reatta  i remember wanting one of these when i was a kid
  those are the worst it is essentially the same as navigating far too many menus with just up or down
  and thats precisely why taillights are so bright now that you have to block them with your hand if youre stopped behind a normiebox
  these cost two bucks literally anywhere
  do you know how hard it is to find an mp3 player thats not touchscreen based youre fucked youre totally fucked no new car will ever come with physical buttons again one day theyll make a car that doesnt come with anything just a usb port where you plug in your 9 phone and it runs a botnet closedsource app to control your shit
om606 redpill me on this engine
  it can burn 100 biodiesel unlike modern diesels that are stuck at 20 or worse if you know a deep frying business who give you free oil its a good choice
inferior to cummins
  if youre talking the na version its legitimately gutless and doesnt make within a week of the 135hp it claims
its a g o d m a c h i n e reliabilitywise and the mpgs are glorious but its not a fun engine in any way slow as fuck
  its a g o d m a c h i n e reliabilitywise  the vast majority of diesels built in the same time period are
  i can tell you have no experience with french cars
  ive got one in my driveway right now dw10 20 at 320k and other than belts the engines never been touched
  come back when its at 500k and ill admit youre right
  yeah nah im comfy making more power with better fuel economy in a car worth peanuts i dont really give a flying fuck what your opinion is i was informing you of the state of late 90s early 2000s diesels diesel reliability issues followed on the heels of vnt turbos cooled egr and cat/dpf filters
  tfw recent diesel engine but removed the dpf and egr  tfw all the added power of having a recent engine the amazing fuel economy and almostoldschool reliability
  french of any time period is shit lmao my gf got a 2018 peugeot 108 yesterday as a business lease car and with 2 km on the clock it the traction control light came on and stayed on its back at the dealer now lmao french electronics not even once
  e9x 30d
  its good if you either  1 want to spend a lot of money and do a crazy 500 hp build because its probably the best diesel engine for that purpose  or  2 want a cheap extremely slow diesel that will run for a few million km reliably    if you want moderate amount of power without spending too much youd probably be better off with the bmw m57 theyre already mounted in a much better handling car than any mercedes and have 200 hp stock
  20d pls no bully its even the dreaded n47 but its a newer model so the timing chain shouldnt fuck itself works really really well for a 2 liter id love a 330d but theres not that many where i live and i got mine for a really really good price and its in tip top condition
  i wont bully but the e9x and e6x 30/35ds are getting so fucking cheap in europe nowadays of course if you have to pay displacement tax thats less interesting keep the cooling in mind as some 20ds want to burst into flames theres a reason toyota uses bmw diesels in the auris avensis and verso in yuropistan theyre pretty good
  yeah mine is going in for a blower motor recall next week i live in iceland so it never really gets hot here and i dont really drive it too hard so im not that worried now that i actually checked i cant find a single e9x 330d for sale in the entire country and i dont think there are any 335ds there was one f30 330d and the price tag on that one was around 55000 i paid around 15k for mine which is very cheap the cheapest 2010 320ds i could find except for this one were all 25k  yes cars here are taxed to shit
is there anything more reliable than a camry
  accords
  a corolla
palio fire 10
  old landcruiser
depends on the year some years accords are more reliable    one older gen of camry had some expensive timing chain problems that hit every single one of them at like 150k cant remember if i4 or v6 though coworker drives a v6 that sounds like its going to mcfucken kill itself with piston slap and maybe has timing issues later 7th and 8th gen accords imo are more reliable than camry of that era
  is there anything more reliable than a camry    an fca vehicle breaking down
  newer accords arent even close
sure any pre95 mercedes
  mechanical fuel injection  reliable  pick one
    hasnt heard about the diesels  the fuel injected ones typically generated problems past 400k kms the 2 ive had at 350k had no issues    get a load of this guy d
  the 2 ive had at 350k had no issues  ill take things that never happened for 500 alex    ive worked on a cosworth 190e and a i6 version  thers a fuck ton of bullshit that will break on those cars  ever take a gander at the rear irs  or check a wiring schematic of all the power seat bullshit  or the fucking heated mirrors
    didnt have power seats mirror heaters worked on all 3 of em i had one diesel tho with 554k kms they all started up fine even in 28c weather    surely my selection is small compared to the amount of them running and registered in my country today but generally the diesels at least have been regarded as immortal    thers a fuck ton of bullshit that will break on those cars    of course but they dont cost an arm and a leg to fix    the vehicle inspection statistics in my country also clearly paint mercedes above all other vehicles in how far you can drive them this is common knowledge
  i would bet that a car with mechanical fuel injection would still be running in 50 years while efi cars will have electrical problems and not work only issue is some rubber parts in the fuel distributor
  isnt that an avalon
ford ranger
  is that the same rust bucket 4000 s class shitting up other toyota threads
  2100 you chicken nugget scoon
  you must have just bought it recently and are trying to show it off    its garbage my corolla probably feels better to drive
  my corolla probably feels better to drive     aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahhshshhhaaaaaaaa    i bet you really beleive that too you delusional fuck    oh my gosh you made my day your corolla felt like wet shit the day it rolled off the assembly line
  these had a major recall that required the entire engine to be replaced optimas are rental cars and theres a reason you can get a 2015 for 8k would not recommend
  funny i love my corolla more than my dads town car honestly and i know his 2003 town car feels much better to drive than your rust bucket
  his town car is definately of a softer ride and more comfy over a long trip     the benz is a smooth yet firm ride the air suspension soaks in bumps but the car still feels planted and doesnt roll much     the town car is a perfect road trip car for the united states your ass wont get tired after 6 hours on the road at 70mph    the benz was built for the autobahn your ass will get tired after a few hours but when youre flying down the highway at 135mph you get there a lot quicker    your corolla feels like dog shit compared to both the lincoln or the benz it feels precisely how it was made to feel like a body with wheels that gets you from a to b as efficiently as possible    ive driven a lot of cars in my day my friend including multiples of all the ones weve talked about so far
    no it isnt i sold the rust bucket in picture for 1200 a year ago

  yes a 90s camry
  true of my buddys 4cyl 2004
  ive always liked these tls for sale locally that is immaculate   whats to hate here
  your ass wont get tired after 6 hours on the road at 70mph  youve never been in a town car they rock your ass to sleep theyre too smooth
  a bus pass or bicycle would be infinitely more reliable
  thats literally what he said you imbicile
  bro chevy had a priceless c1 corvette race car with kjet mechanical fuel injection  they needed the kjet to be rebuilt and setup  took them 2 years to find anyone who actually knew how to work on it  if your kjet dies ur fucked and will be forced to setup megasquirt ex
  nani the fuck
  of course but they dont cost an arm and a leg to fix  lol
24l 4cyl in the camries from a few years back like to burn oil so id say yeah there are cars that are more reliable than a camry    that said the new ones look pretty good and the reviews say they drive alright too
an accord    t toyota fangoy    that was a typo but im leaving it in
  okay honda shill i can do that too     thonda shill
  kek no toyota is life but im not gonna pretend an accord is less reliable    civics however are shit compared to rollas
  your gf saying no to oral after a hard days work without a shower first
  only the celica always get the standard transmission but if you have to get an auto get a toyota cvt

  prius
  nope camrys are reportedly the least expensive car almost every year since 1990something to own and maintain cheaper to own and operate than a corolla funny enough
i would say a old 4runner i have a 1996 thats close to 312k but that might be a personal bias
  love camrys new ones look sexy get one
  knock on wood my 84 nissan with efi still runs perfectly lol
whats /o/ opinions on the workshop  i repect most of this guys opinions and he seems intelligent to me
forgot his page  
what are the best youtube channels for automotive crap what would you recommend for wrenching reviews racing etc    pic unrelated
i would drive the hell out of that
  goonzquad is pretty cool
life od does some weird shit with cars and pretty entertaining most of the time
  fun fact it came in 28th in the 1979 imsa nurburgring race onstreet legal tires too and first in its class not bad for a malaise era american car    also recommending nicksgarage for mopar boomer magic
  donut is just car stuff thats entertaining
  except the magic whip nigger
  out of 30
  doug
cleetus mcfarland for racing and for a little bit of wrenching
  120 i believe car 1 was 25th and car 2 was 43rd  
mrfloodedsilverado is pretty based and still lowkey
  quirks  features
vinwiki their stories are great
  chris harris has tons of great stuff  
  adam lz and hooligan
roadkill is always entertaining and there old episodes are still free
i want to do youtube stuff with cars although i just want to be a small comfy channel any tips i have a few videos up
semitechnical but fun builds  mighty car mods    supertechnical weird builds  the skid factory     spotlighting the craziest and best builds   thehoonigans     reviews to pass the time  doug     drag racing shenanigans   cleetus     stories although their latest baby driver on was shit   vinwiki     noncarrelated entertaining and informative mechanical teardowns   ave
not on mention of bad obsession motorsport shame on all of you
  this
more skids
nicksgarage  savagegeese  vinwiki
        superchagred ls in a g35 never fails to keep me entertained
  even the mtod stuff is feeling kind of dead their last few episodes have been pretty weak and with them featuring dulcich and tony in more episodes it kind of feels like the show has peaked and is kind of winding down
the fellas network  dannydc2  backyard built  shiftinglanes  eetzi productions dead channel
  onion lives in a trailer outside of a garage in lake stevens washington    what a faggot
  im like 40 min away is the whole haggard shit broke up
  youtube  just kill yourself cuck
  wtf i hate youtube now
  my fucking boys
    i forgot amesies automotive corner thats a decent one
chrisfix for tutorials doug for the quirks saabkyle04 is based too also a great youtuber is gingium he does everything himself even furniture for his camp bus unlike most epic car youtubers from la that leave their cars in the hands of shops
tommyfyeah for those dank oem builds and legit parts that make sense plus some track time and other shenanigans thrown in him ricermiata and cleetus macfarland are pretty much the only people i watch anymore
sloppy mechanics   budget turbo junkyard ls builds in shitboxes  puts shit like this into the 10s no problem  1076whp on a 250k mile 60 motor with a stock bottom end  tons of info on how to build a car and how to tune it  uploads his tunes for people to use  big money guys hate him because he reuses headgaskets and stock headbolts             
  are you me
hoonigan but unironically
    came to post this    hes the hero we do not deserve
  he brought hotrodding back to the people
when you find a channel with less than 1000 subs that has a ton of content on their budget project dragcar  is there anything more comfy
jafromobile  if you dont learn something from him youre worthless
  link to vids then we can give suggestions
in no particular order      tommyfyeah  thehoonigans  superspeedersrob  vinwiki   motortrend specifically roadkill  noriyaro  adam lz post nicole  1320video  mighty car mods
project farm is pretty cool guy tests all sorts of stuff as fuel or crankcase oil in small engines and also does side by side comparison tests of all sorts of stuff like threadlocker penetrating oils electrical tapes reciprocating saw blades etc not specifically vehicle related but definitely related to wrenching
  this cleetus is god tier im suprised he doesnt get mentioned on here more
coldwarmotors comfy as fuck and top tier canadian bants
  1320
zip ties and bias plies if you wanna cry laughing and see a canuck hillabilly abuse old fords and swear   
  yeah especially his spinner video
  project binky is fucking sick    i like aging wheels a lot hes doesnt know much so u just does stuff but hes really funny
  he sucks because he compares everything to supercar standards and he spends way too much time dawdling over interior bullshit
    unironically jafromobile is the best car youtuber
i get the feeling some of the donut guys browse /o/
  heres my channel    as of now im just going through restoring my car and sometimes doing car related things or videotaping when i see the same car
  their videos are padded too much sometimes i watched one of their many replacing engine oil with x videos and they spend way too much time on fucking around rather than testing it    scotty kilmer is good if you want purist daily driver advice for car longevity    vin wiki is great if you like stories about cars and their drivers especially if youre into exotic cars    chrisfix doesnt post often but has interesting video tutorials on doing auto work if youre new to things    donut media has a fuckton of content thats pretty well made lil bit of everything    gearheads autofab is a really small channel but they do lots of vlog style content on tuning and shit
roads untraveled  nicks garage  rebel mechanics/revtap industries    
    repairs  south main auto  he loves it when you leave a message asking for advice
gears and gasoline
i like regular car reviews i find them mostly entertaining
aging wheels is good also if i had money i would like to make a car review series similar to his
  im unironically watched him since he first spun off of 1320 really enjoy watching him wrench and learn to tune and all the progress he puts into various projects
  you know they do to many people work there for at least 2 of them not to lurk at least occasionally not kikowa but i feel like hert might
  i agree hes not great its an obvious failed attempt to branch out to other ethnic groups
eduardo smok for spanish south american countries is consistent for the average user car review needs
  all are shit besides savagegeese and doug
car bros
  trast taste
  you need a better camera and cleaner edits do more about your car but youre not an autist on cam so thats a plus
  ditto boostedboiz good too
  love this guy
jay lenos garage is really good for shedding light of cars that normally wouldnt be seen in some private collection plus jay is a great boomer historian    oldcarmemories if you enjoy listening to boomerlore and specsheets over a 2005 youtube slideshow background

thinking of rebuilding these flat tops from a 260z does anyone have some experience working on them id like to know if theres anything special that i should know before getting started

  yeah some mozz sticks breh
  which grille are you running if i may ask ive been trying to replace my old grille but going through nasioc and lgt says that gts run with the tall grille and no jdm grilles for the legacy/lancaster fit without play
  bro you gotta stop with that meme the reliability of the mk7 is on par with every other manufacturer    yes the 90s and early 2000s were rough
  i had a golf for years never had a single issue wheres this meme come from
    friend of mine owned a tdi golf and it had many issues im sure the non diesel golfs are better but i dont think i could spend the bux since they are 3040k for a golf r in aus
  tdi golf    what year the mk7 generation 2015 here has been fine     obviously they dont do diesels here anymore
  mk6 i believe
    thanks its very comfy 02 wrx seats with seat heaters installed is a huge improvement     its a japanese market 96/97 gtb grille its kind of in between the us short grille 9596 and tall grille 9799 height wise it does expose a bit of the bumper cover that would normally be covered by the tall grille but its not so short that it creates a gap there is a little bit of play up and down but its not obvious unless you grab it and shake it with your hand and it doesnt vibrate with the car idling or anything if it bothers you enough you could ziptie the bottom grille mounts to the headlights where the clips are supposed to go the gap doesnt really bother me especially since you cant really see it from normal standing height
  looks comfy what year is she
  nice headgasket
  awesome ill look into ita    and side note im assuming that the rfrb grille will be very similar to the gtb grille size
  2001 5speed base model with the a/c option engine is making lifter noise and shitty saskatchewan salt will rust it eventually but i love it
  sedan  you couldnt be more gay tbqh
i really never thought id be so attached to something but 2500 in repairs later here i am with 224000 miles  dont marry the first bith you fuck is what my bro told me
  more doors more whores
  hatchbacks are 5 door you chawbacon
  yup an rfrb grille is the same height as the l7 grille rarer and more expensive too     north america didnt get a hatchback corolla that gen
  north america didnt get a hatchback corolla that gen  keked again lol

2010 stick shift legacy for 5 grand    did i do good /o/
  nah
  you did pretty well as long as it doesnt have hidden issues that said base legacies are underwhelming but still good cars and the manual ones get better awd systems than the autos    pic related  not all subaru awd systems are equal
  4wdawd
  yeah totally because 90degree turns in your drivetrain is what you want
  and pic related gotta love those extra shafts that subaru awd doesnt need but locking 4wd does right
  im buying one of these in like 5 years cant justify 15kish on ones now but they look great
  you can get new ones for 1819k jsyk
    tldr   4wd best
fleet
  nah its a 2018    kek its still basically a focus m8
  fuck me that looks good in grey

my joy and pride
  im overly proud off my cadillac its not worth much but it runs and drives great and its mine i got it for free after sitting for 2 years outside with no front end ive put a lot of work into it fixing the body and all the other shit wrong with it i got everything working again air suspension parking sensors heated washer fluid heated wheelcooled seats the burnt out leds and some other stuff was broken even before the po crashed it
  1 no you didnt you lying git  2 if you did you are insane  3 no you didnt
  i certainly did i took pictures of fucking everything too  i got the car for free im only paying parts cost so it makes sense about 1300 in and its close to perfect
  repairing led taillight
well done then i guess
  the god damn water pumphousing that took me 89ish hours to replace
    and the new bumper in prep before paint dont sand shit inside kids im still finding red dust today      thanks for calling me a liar tho i know its not a conventional project car but ill use any excuse to post project pics
  the car after sitting a long ass time i think the plants were attracted to the grille front end doesnt look that bad in pic but the bottom of the bumper and fogs are ripped off and the rest is cracked up and barely held on with zipties
    i dont have many pics of my volvo only my mr2 which doesnt move
  nice they are much better looking than the golf gti and lighter
  it doesnt look too bad there
  yeah it really didnt look that bad until i ripped all the plants out of it bumper was never painted and was still in gelcoat is cracked straight down the center and the plastic and foam supports and brackets underneath shattered and fell out so it was barely held on it just collapsed into a pile once i pulled it off the car     the drivers headlight was there but got filled with water and killed itself and the hid ballast  the grille is aftermarket solid aluminum welded together so it didnt get a scratch but had to come off to untangle all the vines
sadly only a 16
fugg it
  wtf did you do you nigger
  nice one anon as someone about to soon buy one can you share your experience of ownership  any faults i should look out for
  polk city
  tint windows  shiiiit nigga that car is long gone now it was a good dd though
  sure engine is about the only thing people talk about when it comes to faults pre03 cars have oil control rings that can fuck up and make the car burn oil which in turn fucks up the precats which in turn fucks up the engine so people remove precats which are only needed for california anyway and only do a job when the main cat is cold and live with the oil consumption    mine is an 00 model and doesnt seem to use any oil precats are removed and replaced with a generic aftermarket header anyway  so the biggest thing to ask the owner about is how much oil it uses it shouldnt be any at all    get a manual one smt boxes are pretty good but really complicated and expensive to fix if they go bad the standard manual drivetrain is pretty solid    also make sure the convertible top is watertight and that it seals well against the side windows same goes for the hardtop if so equipped
  buying a ford car   i dunno friend theyre really downsizing and focusing no pun intendedon like two cars the focus is not one of those
  oops was for 
    should perhaps add that its such a fun car to drive it really is a blast not a car for highway roadtrips boring and low gearing but absolutely shines in the twisties its also the best winter car ive ever driven i like it better than awd/4wd ones  its an impractical car its got a small frunk which is pretty sizeable when you remove the spare and some small storage behind the rear seats under the top with the top up or hardtop on you can also place some stuff behind your head on the parcel shelf or the folded top respectively
  thanks anon  would a the post03 car be a better choice to try and find if it eliminates the precat fault you mention
  yes i know the storage space is an issue ha  its between this and an mx5 i am leaning towards this
  my german made 17 r had a trans mount bolt fall out luckily i heard it during the drive and pulled over retraced the street where i heard it and found a 21mm bolt perfectly intact limped it home kept it below 2k rpm and put it in the air sure enough dogbone mount bolt    cmon veedub
who can spot the place where the deer hit  also this was taken yesterday when it just suddenly started shaking and i had to stop  was all okay until i heard a hiss and now it fugged  wat do
  only made it better anon

  speedst
  i was considering an 18 cuz i really wanted the se with plaid seats but i realized i couldnt get nav fender audio or the adjustable dampers so i bought a barely used r for nearly the same cost
  baahahahah what a hunk of shit
when your panzer would eat most of the thread for breakfast
  not before that rust eats your panzer lol

inb4 nigger car
  yours is pretty niggered up those arent necessarily nigger cars tho
  im trying to replace the walmart plastic grille and the wheels with stock ones but they are like half the cost of the car
  junkyard m8 i got a set of alloys for 100 grilles are like 20
  they wanted 130 for the grille and 600 for the wheels here
  dont know what it is but it looks fuckin sick
  one of my local junkyards is like this  they always have the best cars too  fucking cunts
  at a pick n pull that sounds like prices from a junkyard that pulls it for you
  yeah they are assholes they charge 10 just to go out and look on the lot
  mine charges 3 sounds like you need to find a better junkyard see if theres an lkq near you
  youre fucking autistic
this but its got 17 rims
  still faster and comfier than most of /o/s cars
  id buy one if fiat didnt have such a bad reputation for reliability
  holy fuck an aro explain
  you know its 80 an nd miata built by mazda in the same factory as the miata and the 14l multiair is considered one of the most reliable engines on earth right
  real shit    i wouldnt doubt the rest of the car but a tiny engine with 20 pounds of boost going through it made by italians doesnt sound like a good combination
  what this guy said      same engine thats been in the fiat 500/500 abarth for years my man
  same engine thats been in the fiat 500/500 abarth for years my man  thats not exactly confidence inspiring
  keep riding the bus faggot
  fuck ford for not selling a 3 door in the us

post em soapy
  i unironically want a focus rs over anything else and i know very little about cars ive never even seen one outside of the dealership
  needs some body work but that comes after we get it running all thats left is figure out how to make the 1200cc injectors fit underneath the stock intake manifold a bit of wiring and she should fire up
  where did the 4th door go it doesnt make any sense
lovey sleeper
cost less than a months rent
  forgot pic
  hell yeah
dumb slow kraut coming through
  not fahren macht frei    missed opportunity right here
  rs5
  naa not that cool only a s5 still the 42l v8 i steered away from the rs because i wanted a manual and the rs is more to maintain
  you cant deny you tried to make it look like a bmw either way it looks cool good job
base model best model    does have taxi package and vario steering tho    also tow ball delete star shave facelift mirrors and the plate has been shrinked and relocated since then
still needs a bit of love tho
  the hatchback is the 3rd door you dumb motherfucker
  the hatchback is classed as a door because you can access the cabin from it a coupe with a sedan style trunk lid that doesnt allow access to the cabin would be a 2 door fuckwit
  desda di gazzo ddddddddd
      oof so puurt

not enough yellow around here
  liverpool
gonna sell this little thing this month  ill either get the rs cup version of this car or a megane rs maybe a 595 but im really suspicious of fca then again its not like renault is known for their amazing quality either
  after warranty expires ill be all over it
  fuck you i love it
  abarth is a meme man if you are gonna dd on that is a huge no just for for a veloster n or a fist
  how is the fist so far
  that is some clean ass culdesac my nigga
  abarth is a meme  ayy lmao  also have an 595 on the way we will see how memey it is
  looks clean man
  its still a fucking rs man
  you cant have one anon there were only 1000 of them for sale in na in 2018
  dunno man i feel like if there is a person who the 595 would be ideal for it is me i dont really expect too much comfort or practicality from my car   that said the veloster n is nice but they still have too much depreciation ahead of them to be worth it and the fist just doesnt really appeal to me i dont like the design
i keep coming back to this thread to check on my car
old photo need to take a new one soon
  i think they are an almost perfect daily drive fast enough to entertain and practical enough to use as a grocery getter etc  the only issue is that some dickhead in the factory decided to use mustang head gaskets in a load causing them to potentially need new engines still ill take one in stealth grey please
  octavia ii gen  comfy  19 tdi or 16
  19
  i would guess that its a 16 as it has the pepperpot alloys the 19 had pic related fitted
  i agree minus 1 more complaint daily comfort is compromised imo the factory suspension is stiff as hell the seat bottoms have a goofy angle too and the seats are bolstered way too aggressively for an american market otherwise u r spot on

  you mean on normal street tires
wow they released it  oh wait
  why is tesla shills team works so hard on /o/    do they really think 80 people on /o/ would buy a new car or even a new electric car    pic related is /o/ wet dream
waiting list for 6 years  delivers with 2 inch panel gaps
be american  do 060 in 19 seconds  get shot by the police    sounds fun
  weird its almost as if its just shit posting or something huh
  1100 kph or 060mph is such a normie stat for psuedo enthusiasts    its only one step above people who quote the uber faggy motortrend figure eight as a meaningful metric
  found the brz owner
  oh that wouldnt be boring to drive at all
  you seem like the kind of retard that would still lose to the 6 year old in your metaphor
  well yes and no peugeot wins 0100 kph easily but this monster made another 16s on pikes peak     do you know the weight
  that shit is slow  theres another company using solid fuel that can hit 060 in under 1
its fast    its the only way you can justify the car because everything else will either fall of or break dont forge the giant panel gaps
  holy shit where was that image taken
ill reserve judgement until i hear how good it is to drive very few people should care about 060 or 0100 times if its that fast and a joy to drive then theyll really be on to a winner    for example i drove a mercedes c63 around scotland and that was a fucking terrible car because its too powerful/electronic i would have had a much better time in an alfa 4c
    no door handles    driver enters and exits vehicle via bluetooth teleportation
  be european  cant do 060 times because the bus driver hates you  cry and ree at americans for their cheap powerful cars
  i think you should reserve judgement until the first production example is sold to a customer  how patient are you
  0100 in 185 secs  where were you when based slavs btfotesla

fender exit exhaust  guy pulls up with his window down
im tired of the shitbox lifestyle i want to get something decent to replace my current daily driver but i have no idea what would be a good option heres the criteria     used but not more than 10 years old   comfy soft suspension leather seats   4 doors and room to seat 4 comfortably   hatchback or sedan with large trunk   budget of about 15k can go over if its worth it but not more than 20k   reliable   cheap parts readily available   not an suv or truck    pic somewhat related if i didnt mind looking like someones grandpa i would just buy a lincoln towncar would getting something like a used lexus sedan be a good idea
  3k civic hatchback with some junkyard leather seats     used but not more than 10 years old  yep   comfy soft suspension leather seats  yep   4 doors and room to seat 4 comfortably  yep   hatchback or sedan with large trunk  yep   budget of about 15k can go over if its worth it but not more than 20k  should be around 5k for a more recent model and the seat cost   reliable  yep   cheap parts readily available  yep   not an suv or truck  yep
2008 toyota avalon
  crown vic lx
  newest model ls 400 series you can afford
  buick lacrosse comfy roomy rides nice and its gm so parts are practically free
  anon i was so close to saying late model towncar  then i saw budget of 15k    for that money you can get a mks v6 not ecomeme i got mine 6 months ago at 125 out the door from a dealer ended up stalking the old owner from the navigation guy was an older dude who traded the mks in to that dodge dealer after his wife died for a challenger was the first owner of my car kept maintenance etc it was 10/10 condition      hella advise you to look into getting a mks with the v6 that engine is in the police cars mustangs and almost all lincolns of that era as well as some bigger fords bulletproof engine shit doesnt break easy to maintain fucking air filter was 15 lmao oil filter came to 7  and its fuckhueg too super soft if you get one with the ultimate pack the thx audio is pretty good too  i got a 2010 at 125k with dealer tax and mines awd if you dont want awd and are in a cheaper state for cars fuck midwest desu you should be definitely going lwoer than that mine had 90k when i got it now were almost at 98k
go for the towncar its literal only purpose is to be comfy
  lx is harder to find used when they discontinued them after 2007 grand marquis was made to 2011 and those typically are loaded up with all the luxury options
obligatory  08 6mt
i got a crown vic lx back around 2014 it was from 2006 had about 40k miles on it and cost around 8k at that time chances are the prices have gone down since then great car easy to work on and pleasant to drive theyre also flexfuel so you can feed it ethanol memefuel every few tanks for a bit of variety
buy a german shitbox
  i am currently driving a 2005 lexus ls430 it had 32000 miles on it when i bought it it was kept in a garage and all the maintenance was done on time i bought it for 14000 i love it chicks love the heated and air conditioned seats during the summer and i can fit all my friends in it everyone thinks i am super rich and it cracks me up because my friends paid more for their shitboxes then i did     so i would look into getting a lexus they are so comfortable to drive and they are extremely well made
  maybe an 0611 cadillac dts theyre cheap af because the older northstars had such a bad reputation by the last generation they had solved the main issues you can easily find a nice one for under 5k and they were mostly old people cars so were usually well taken care of     they have a lot of features for the price range theres more options this is just base model  air suspension  cooled front seats  heated steering wheel and frontrear seats remote start that heats/cools the seats automatically before you get in  auto lights and wipers  parking sensors front and rear  hids  great stereo with auxin  center console converts into center seat for bench with its own seatbelt  heated washer fluidamazing for clearing snow and ice  integrated bluetooth calling on 08ups
  heated washer fluidamazing for clearing snow and ice  sounds also amazing for cracking your cold windshield
  bus rider detected     when youre warming the car up you use the defroster to warm the windsheld    when going down the road at 60mph often the the snow will pack down under the wipers and sometimes even freeze up you see the heated fluid is then used to melt that ice while driving    literal mongoloids
  sounds also amazing for cracking your cold windshield  actually the most retarded thing ive ever heard
  which would be the ls460 very good deals right now you see them for 11k for the first year with 110k miles in 2010 they changed things on the ls460 id look for the 2010 sport version
buick park avenue ultra
  lexus ls460  46l dohc v8 vvti 380hp  smooth as fuck rides like a cloud   comfy as fuck too  toyota reliability   can be gotten for under 15k
  i had a very similar budget of 13k at the beginning of this year and i considered doing something like you buying an older car thats loaded with features with reasonable milage then i came to the conclusion i couldnt justify spending over 10 thousand dollars on an old ass car thats going to get rusty and start breaking down while i still owe money on it    i hope that car is trouble free for you some of those lincolns are actually nice
the marketing team for lexus was set up in 1986 3 years prior to the sale of the first car in 1989  why is this company even discussed on here they have no history and were designed by a marketing department
because it just werks  t reliable and comfy in my gs430
cause its still a fucking car you janny fucker
  reliable  comfy  luxurious  can actually swap manual trans in  great platforms  overall brand with a rock solid reputation  let me guess op youre the kind of guy who shills chrysler because its american right
even if you just want to call them toyotas their highend cars are pretty nice
  my favorite brand is mazda
  lexus is a brand made by toyota  really i had no idea dude
  y
  mechanically sound but they at least try to innovate sometimes or come up with a new design
  lol retard
their history is top trim toyota sedans and suvs
  get a load of this dumbass
  there is no better daily driver look at the is350 it is reliable luxurious and can smoke any daily car including the 350z hr thats why
i think they are over hyped by amercians on food stamps who have never had a luxury car they use a heap of parts from the camry and the dashboard has this hard plastic look to it compared to german cars or jag ive never owned a lexus but had a mercedes its just what ive observed from pictures
  go away todd
  because they make the best cars dumbass
  they have no history  lexus is just toyota flexing crown to burgers
so 2011 nissan altima s 109k miles for 5400 bumper cover thing got ripped off and replaced with minor damage to adjacent quarter panel driver side floor carpet all fucked up unknown history or 2009 chevy impala 158k miles 3450 a couple of cigarettes burns on seats otherwise immaculate interior all in all with a known history    so what do
  inb4 the sticky    ive read it literally dozens of times if i werent in bumfuck nowhere with no job no credit 11k in student loans and less than 10k to my name    i just need one of these to last 35 years while i get my shitty neet life back in order
  the impala will last better than the altima though youll need to keep an eye out for both oil and transmission leaks because they seem to be a common issue
  even though the impala has like 160k miles on it and the altima only 109k what shits out on the altimas more
  what shits out on the altimas more  what doesnt its a post2000 nissan product the cvt is prone to failure unless its a manual and the engine is prone to issues as well to say nothing of the electrical system if the nissan was the same price as the impala then maybe the impala will also be cheaper to work on if necessary it may need more work due to being higher mileage but the lower purchase price and generally lower cost to work on it will more than cover that
thats just too much money for either of those cars if you have to choose take the impala  2003 is the last safe year to get a nissan and theyre still needy and sketchy history doesnt help
  what kind of work would a high mileage impala need beyond the regular stuff
  what would be reasonable for the impala what sort of mileage do similar year imapalas die at
   2011 nissan altima s 109k miles for 5400    sure thats not 540 because i wouldnt even pay that
cvt transmissions are shit  ur lucky to get 100k out of one  avoid any cvt regardless of mileage    look for a civic corolla or yaris
  potentially a transmission replacement within the next 30k miles which shouldnt run more than 23k from a decent shop the engine should be good for a while    they generally die anywhere from 150k to 300k depending on maintenance while nissan cvts usually shit the bed around 80k120k and the engines dont last much longer neither car is worth much more than 2000 especially not a nissan thats about to need 68k worth of transmission work
  yaris  those arent shit
  both of those are waaaaayyy too much op  seriously like several thousand too much    post your local craigslist
  prices in my area area totally fucked desu
if youre poor you shouldnt be doing a comparison between a midsize sedan and a fullsize sedan otherwise you are going to keep yourself poor    look at compacts ie civic
  the ones not built in mexico are good shit boxes  there was 23 years of the mexico ones  i dont remember what years
spoiled rich kid youtube star buys a shitty lambo out of all cars in one of his videos   not a modded mk4 supra  mfw

  thats all i do
  have you ever considered not taking plainly obvious bait
so he bought an italian exotic to impress people rather than some beaners fucked up toyota shitbox  good for him id probably had done the same
spoiled rich kid buys an overpriced 90s shitbox for street cred
be you  just starting to transition from anime to real hobbies  start getting into cars  oh obviously i likea da japanese ones  latch on to the first big jdm car you can think of  seethe at everyone who has different tastes    whats it like being 18    also because i know you dont own a car or one thats remotely fun you should just buy a miata and focus on yourself instead of shitty youtube personalities
  muh hurr durr popular car bad  ftfy
what will cars look like 200 year from now
big aluminum soap bars with no windows driving will be illegal
  wow the future is bleak indeed
  eventually they will be throttled back like jetskis performance will be standard and those of us will screw it up for the rest of you   cant wait
    implying there will be cars 200 years from now
  yep they might look a lot like this baka
  we have two potential futures    one where we do realize that control over stuff is more important than stuffs control over us even at the sacrifice of safety    in the one wherein we realize safety isnt as important as living a genuine fucking life we see things like autonomous driving only used for long trips sports cars and real fucking cars still exist along with many other goods that are a potential safety problem but people enjoy  we drive them  we wrench on them  maybe there are shitloads of suvs and most of them are automatic but you can still do what you will    in the bad one  travel is either rendered completely autonomous and nobody travels outside of designated areas aside from construction workers adding to the grid of places we can go in our self driving robocars or somehow rendered pointless because of some matrix level bs nobody has cars they are illegal just like in those scifi threads ive seen on here    neither is a future i want to see but number one is the only one i wouldnt immediately off myself in
  like a mix between a british tourist bus that one with two floors and a crossover
  99 autonomous electric vehicles  1 tracktoys  there is a good chance of some company still selling supersevens with an updated drivetrain at that point
  nissan is still making the 370z and gtr
  caterham still makes the super seven and lotus still builds the elise series 30  meanwhile tesla still makes the model s p300d r ludicrous performance rocketship mode doing 0100 in 18 seconds and 100200 in 16 seconds
  as long as i can still own a super 7 jpe and drive around to stop broken ai cars all will be good
  underrated show anon
  head lights and tail lights in the year 2218
  car not gonna be made for another 200 years  tyrone already thinking up ways to steal it
make your prediction on what the next meme car is going to be personally i think its going to be the pontiac vibe/toyota matrix
    the matrix isnt weird enough to be a meme car its just a hatchback corolla
  plus its actually pretty well liked by normotrons  my pick is hyundai veloster its the korean pacer
celica gts
  turbo mopars as a whole
2016 camaro all manual camaro come with an lsd even the 4 banger    aside the neon they are rare as fuck unless you count fiats
  their time has come and gone already they were a thing in the late 90s and early to mid 00s as extremely cheap fast cars for trashing around the tracks hooning and 700hp drag builds before they all rusted to shit and were scrapped in the cash4clunkers programs
  nissan cube
  every single craigslist ive looked at has a few rough daytonas along with an assortment of lebarons and ptgts a few even have glhs and shelby chargers
some other ideas include l67 gm sedans and late 90s / early 2000s swedish cars such as the 93 and 95 aero and the v70 and s70 t5
fj cruiser
whats the fastest most dangerous car ever made
400mph on solid wheels on a slippery surface
  probably the viper or some tvr
1994 toyota tercel
    pretty much anything made by turbonique
tvr speed 12
ruf yellowbird or the porsche 930
  those are tame    
  how did they turn a tacoma into that
my 1992 miata
  a few overnight parts from japan    
  tesla won this battle
  the tacos next to this mural are fkng bomb
    you arent wrong
holy shit cant believe the mr2 wasnt number 1 or 2 or 3
  probably some ancient retardedly fast hard to control lightweight tin can zero safety homologation car
  700mph on the same surface desu the slipperyness would make it safer at those speeds
  fucking tvr is a good one the cerbera or whatever its called is a fuckg death machine
  they are pretty dangerous and pretty quick but in the grand scope of fast and dangerous not that much
unlimted turbo era f1 cars with manual transmissions    1500hp at the wheels  1100lbs with driver
  wheel driven is way less safe than something powered by air moving out of the back
  guess thats a good point thanks satan
tvr cerbera speed 12
  its not really a tacoma anymore its a tube chassis with a tacoma inspired body shell on it
what about the lsx willys        wobbly suspension  no roof or roll cage  upped to 1000 hp since
shelby made 2 cobras with dual superchargers 800hp    he gave one to bill cosby who did a sketch on it might be able to find it on youtube if they havent censored it
fast  270mph  dangerous  killed bernd rosemeyer on a record run
  close the earlier tuscan speed 12 was less restricted amd much more dangerous     nobody was brave enough to bring it to its theoretical top speed of 250 mph in 1998    the cerbera was their attempt at selling stock after the rules changed making the tuscan too wild for gt/endurance/whatever else making the original homogenation cars pointless to sell
  w112bhg
  kek is that a 90s mustang ford though plastic was weight saving those are slow
  it weighed a fucking ton   literally a thousand kgs  something like 8 litre v12  no easily available dyno capable of measuring the cars output tvr werent a big company and mc laren sure as fuck werent giving them theirs  eventually work it out at over 800bhp  naturally   fucking   aspirated   although at speed it was argued that enough air was channeled through the gaping front to make it a defacto forcedinduction car boosting power to over a thousand  everyone else starts bitching   rules change  tvr decide fuck it well just mass produce the car instead   its decided that the car is simply too dangerous to be sold to the public   they try again in a few years with   still too dangerous   tvr stop caring and focus on speed six  1998 the beginning of the great british cuckening
  both car and article look like they are straight from the mid 60s  how do you stay so vintage america
snek  n  e  k
magnesium frames ftw
  add a twincharged engine and non fuel cell tanks placed under the front seats for maximum combustion      rosemeyer deliberatly went out when was so much wind that everyone else told him not to

  my dream car right now is a factory five type 65 kit car with a 400hp 50l coyote engine in it

mercedesbenz clr was not particularly safe to drive though fortunately the safety shell was decent
  yup
  you know these weight the same and can make just as much power yet have no downforce right thats a lot more scary then some purpose built race car with a silky smooth v12          the dildo shape is aerodynamic same reason why planes are still the same shape 100 years later
  ford pinto
    13b is popular swap for samurai must be even worse
  enough air was channeled through the gaping front to make it a defacto forcedinduction car  holy shit
  the clio v6 ph1 pic related was probably one of the most dangerous production cars ever made for various reasons the ph2 was safer also rarer
  ramair its been a thing since god knows when
  does renault think they can just release a complete mad man car like that once every 10 years and everything is forgiven
yellowshitbird
  whats there to forgive in the first place renault have been making the best hot hatches in europe for the past 10/20 years performance wise they make cheap and somewhat reliable daily cars i really dont get the hatred towards renault desu
    i wrote t b h not fucking desu wtf
  newfag  somewhat reliable  not according to any mechanic i know
  ive been here for a while last time i checked that didnt happen  not according to any mechanic i know  creating your personal opinion based on what a couple of faggots say
80s f1  group c  tvr speed 12  ruf yellowbird  koenigsegg ccxr  viper rt10  mr2 turbo  other pussy mobiles
  i believe most modern cars have intakes designed to create mild supercharging effect
  considering that i prefer wrenching myself and most people who wrench as work tell me that they never want to a see a french car in their garage again yes
  sure m8 renault is one of the best selling brands in europe for being unreliable pieces of shit i guess youre right
  and that is with or without france included  most of renaults hereeastern europe are fleet cars mostly vans and some personal cars because they are cheap to buy in bulk and you have to write them off after 23 years anyway  maybe they hold together for those 2 or 3 years but they are poor long term investments   yes i will take the opinion of people who have dealt with all sorts of cars including the pieces of shit that were the soviet productions over some anonymous guy on korean webweaving forum who most likely is a baguette
  here in western europe you see a lot of renaults all over the place a lot are fleet cars but most are personal cars they are know for being cheap to buy fix and maintain therefore for being good daily drivers   i also know a lot of mechanics as most of them bash german cars much more than they do french cars especially modern ones  im not french i hate france especially in the state its in now
  mechanics bash new cars period  in western europe you might walk into a showroom and buy a cheap car  over here   cheap to buy fix and maintain  means second hand 90s or 2000s car   renaults have little market share here and dacia seems to become more and more prevalent as the cheap fleet car
  yes
  yeah here it means the same my country is poor look im not saying youre not right i dont know what happens in your country im just describing what i see around here also i have 2 clios one from 93 diesel rock fucking solid and one from 05  petrol mechanically reliable some build quality issues with plastics and electronics nothing too serious   mechanics bash new cars yes i agree but german car manufacturing has been dropping the ball lately
i think this guy deserves a nomination for that prize
  it will be while before perception of manufacturers is adjusted 90s german vags are the go to car but i assume they will soon be displaced by 2000s japanese cars french cars just arent in demand here but that might change with the crossover craze as nissan ones are currently flying off the dealerships which are basically renaults
  driving anywhere above 100mph makes you extremely unsafe from any kind of accident youll instantly die from any whiplash things flying inside or the car hitting something else after the impact

ywn own drive and be driven around in a brand new rolls royce  should i just fucking end it lads this looks so comfy this is woodencabininthewinter levels of comfy
  dont forget the ostrich leather
  everything about this machine is so fucking beautiful  tfw ywn
  end me now lads
  i have been driven around in a rolls royce theyre heavy very heavy im not calling them bad but you can feel the weight in every turn and stop i dont want one
that dial    nice
does not look comfy  looks like my waspish grandmothers sitting room where you werent allowed to eat or drink or touch anything
  this  aesthetic in any way  looks like some mansory garbage
  fit for a kang
  every time i look at a rr interior its like i just stepped in to a whole new world of things to take me straight out of the driving experience  this is a nigger car
  a rr isnt a drivers car you sperg  its incredibly heavy and meant mostly for getting driven around  nobody who wants the driving experience thinks hm might just buy a fucking rolls royce because it feels so incredibly involving
my fiesta has a better interior lmao
  id never want to drive one because theyre heavy the size of a truck and boring i can barely stay awake in shitboxes and normal cars let alone a cloud on wheels a chauffeur might be nice
you are not supposed to drive them yourself you fucking savages
  the coupes are designed to be self driven
  dude youre not supposed to drive it lmao
  it was designed to be driven by a professional not the owner of the car
  how do i become a professional rollsroyce driver
  rollsroyce white glove program
  well i got to sit in a rr so theres that but youre right i probably would never ever get to drive one

is it normal using the choke to get the full power of the bike  when i open it all the way the bike has a lot more power is the carburator bad regulated or is this normal
  can suzuki be stopped
  shitzuki is king
  its not normal at all
  how do i act normal my barely repressed rage may be due to a chronic lack of a gf
  the king of perversion
  op you poor schmock you used the wrong url for the map here is the correct one please dont make such silly mistakes    
  get these the foam tips on them are as good as any earplugs theyre made for musicians to be able to hear their backing without being blasted by speakers loud enough to deafen a stadium
  just be yourself
  my dudd thats the wrong map link d    heres the right one 3  
whats the best manlet 250400cc dual sport for in the dirt
  yeah right at least i have tinder     if only 10 of you are normal then about three of you guys should be acceptable
    girls love the lone wolf biker thing so make sure to go on longwinded and intense rants about how every day you drift further from humanity and go on midinght full speed runs just to feel close to death because its the only emotion you can feel that isnt rage or sadness gets them wetter than a wet thing
  so what tell them the exact truth about my life and numb emotions
really want a sportbike  every road around me is full of slow turns almost hairpins potholes traffic and gravel  only track within a reasonable distance is too expensive
  so what could it be
  is gone with the blastwave still around i havent checked that site in about 10 years
  gets them wetter than a wet thing
  confirmed a best
    pulling out the choke makes the air fuel mixture richer that could increase power but that would mean that its running too lean with the choke in the mix should be right for when the air temperature is normal and then when the weather gets cold you use the choke to make it richer
  get one anyways youll be having no more fun on a slowbike
  your bike is running too lean i dont know what carb you use but you might want to insall a different size jet and screw around a little on those screws
when holding a wheelie am i aiming to hold the throttle in place or constantly be adjusting it
  if youre at the balance point then youll probably be adjusting it but only by small amounts to maintain balance or hold it steady and use the rear brake for control instead    if youre not then youll have to keep rolling on throttle
  yeah im definitely at the balancing point because i find i have to keep releasing the throttle and reengaging it    one interesting thing you said is to control it with the back break thats something i have never done and dont know how to do i only use the back break in emergencies
  should i adjust the carb or leave it like that
  first thing would be to strip it and give it a good cleaning i imagine make sure nothing is blocked up
  yeah im definitely at the balancing point because i find i have to keep releasing the throttle and reengaging it  sounds like you just need more fine control of the throttle once you get it up there
  alright thank you baby ill make you proud
whats the best yellow litre super sport    i only buy yellow bikes
  tl1000r    bonus points is youll die
  it may require small changes but you shouldnt constantly be chugging the throttle open and snapping it closed i see that a lot with people wheelieing dirt bikes on the street
guys how many horsepower is a gorillion
  more than you can afford pal
  well that aint sayin much
  yeah its a subtle movement i think im doing it correctly i only asked because when i held a really long one today i had an issue with the steering being a tad wobbly left and right and i was thinking it might be because i was pumping the throttle too much    or it could be my worn steering bearings that i need to replace    or the wet road hard to know cause ive got too many problems lol
  how would the steering head bearings make a difference when youre on the back wheel only how would a wet road make you wobble side to side
  i dont know but stranger things have happened i thought my steering was fucked for the longest time until i replaced my tyre and all my problems went away    as for the back tyre the road has gutters so its sloped down left i was thinking maybe i was slipping down and correcting myself due to the lack of traction in the road
  you do realise that every wheelie you do is making your steering bearings worse right
  once you get the front end up there really isnt much acceleration involved with wheelies wet road traction isnt that low and shouldnt affect you once youre already at balance point
  well worth it
  only if youre shit at setting it down
  yes theyre easy to replace who cares      so what might have been the cause of wobbly steering
vroom vroom vroooom motha fuckin vrooooooooom    anyone else know this feel
  who
  you just have to learn to balance on 1 wheel
  o
  easy just ride one one for a mile or two
  like pastry
  he landed pretty good considering
  had both the m6 pros and the shure se215 both with mic the m6 were fine if you didnt take them outdoors much but they driver enclosure fell apart on me within a year not sure how my guess is the a clip broke or the adhesive stopped working they also sounded really tinny not a bad thing but definitely fatiguing     the shures have been much better in pretty every way parts have been common too just get replacement oem tips and chinese cables every year had these for almost 3 years
does anyone have any experience with ktech suspension dont want to spend 2500 on ohlins for my street ride
why do people spend hundreds of dollars on a intercom setup when same can be achieved using android smartphone
  battery life call quality and range you cant have all three using a smart phone if i use bluetooth between two phones the call constantly drops even between pillion and rider if i use wifi or regular calling the quality and range is good but the battery life isnt so great depending on where you are you might not even have cell signal but this only my experience with android apps and regular calling     an intercom system will let you listen to music and group call in a very non intrusive low maintenance kind of way it just works
  i had my se215 for 5 years they just broke on me a few weeks ago and i bought a different set of headphones that were a lot more expensive they are no where near as good as the shures were im going to buy another pair just for the bike
hey neckbeards just got my first sportbike and im beginning to turn into a chad i have become more attractive taller an gained significant muscle mass in the first week i even picked up 3 different girls for rides already and banged out one of them    meanwhile youre sitting on your cafe racers and dirtbikes jerking each other off why dont you all just accept sportbikes for what they are peak motorcycling performance sorrynotsorry
  youre sitting on your cafe racers and dirtbikes jerking each other off  i have a cafe racer and im gay so thats a good thing bby
  tfw no thicc latina motogf
  wanting to date a fatty  id take the bike over her
    how do people hold wheelies this long  skip to 340
  learn that balance point  thats literally it its the same thing as balancing on two wheels but harder to learn
  ive done wheelies longer than you just did in that video but i inevitably seem to run out of gearing    i understand the balancing point stuff i guess i need more practise cause those starboys wheelies amaze me
tfw cant even wheelie a bicycle  should i just kill myself
  baird you cant fucking wheelie shut up
  i had a good teacher when i got my 600cc my friends older brother came up on his gsxr1000 and made me practise power wheelies and didnt leave until i figured it out or destroyed my bike whichever came first    you need a good teacher too
i miss my car karaoke whats the solution besides driving my car earbuds arent the same are those fancy bluetooth gadgets you put in your helmet worth it
  put your tongue in my anus      ive had two senas theyre great  in canal earbuds are better for music quality at highway speeds though
  i honestly want to learn to stunt with wheelies stoppies drifting etc but i dont want to wreck my bike  im tempted to put on some frame sliders but ive heard you can fuck up your frame by landing on them
  my cardo is loud and clear enough to use with earplugs
  but i inevitably seem to run out of gearing  that means youre chasing them you dont need to accelerate to maintain a wheelie  im not saying i dont but thats how it works
  ive heard you can fuck up your frame by landing on them  depends on the bike  get a crashed 600 and use that
decided to buy new summer gloves today
  post a webm of you jumping your bike too dork
  k
  
    not him and i dont wanna sound like a cunt but damn dude i do bigger jumps on my pushbike lol
  two words  supermoto
its my birthday     im 26    my daughter is 17 days old
  strip down carby check no vacuum lines are torn or missing check rubber intake manifold isnt cracked check the oring behind the manifold at the cylinder head have your valve clearances checked if its two stroke check main seals you have too much air entering after the carb pulling the choke on while hot should make the bike run like shit and stall
  mfw i do midnight high speed runs when im too filled with rage and sadness to sleep  mfw i dont tell anyone because im to ashamed of my angsty sadboi ways that i cringe at the thought    its a lonely life when youre trapped inside your own head lads
  i wish i didnt tell anyone i fucking hate my big mouth
  happy birthday man  get a sidecar for wholesome family memories
so its gonna rain this week im still 6 months into riding and i have places to be  aside from going slower what is some advice so i dont eat shit and trash my new bike in the rain
  my daughter is 17 days old  post pics
  rely on the rear brake way more  wear rain gear including pants and have waterproof gloves and boots  dont open your visor youll just have rain on the inside and the outside then
  my daughter is 17 days old

  you dont become a motochad until your ride has a shad faggot
would you buy a 1984 honda nighthawk with 36000 miles for 1500    
  pretty much any street legal bike for 1500 is worth it  i wouldnt buy a nighthawk myself though because i purchased and rode home a 40000mi nighthawk 750 for a friend once and it was a lead missile
  that looks like a fine buy if youre into it not a weak manlet and are willing to turn a wrench a little
    what do you mean by lead missile just shitty handling    im a manlet but not weak im willing to put a lot of wrench work into a bike as long as the problem isnt too crazy
    pathetic as always stop giving people advice when youre shit
  heavy cruiser ergos shitty old suspension  if you like it buy it
  t this guy
  tbh i just need a bike my brand new streetbike got fucking stolen and i was out 8k now i just need any bike to give me a reason to live as long as its decent im always down for doing better for the price or mitigating risk when buying used
    just terrible
  brand new  8k  no theft insurance  math_floating_in_airgif    its 1500  it doesnt look thrashed  its even got the stock pipes  its gucci nigga
  
im gonna pick up a heavy turd shortly its probably gonna end my ass but it looks to be a good distance machine and ive been jonesing to work on a bike for a long while carb rebuilds are fun
when buying a used bike what things should you look for to make sure there arent any mechanical issues is it worth paying a mechanic to check its internals
  do compression test  listen to cam chain  thats bout it you can check shock seals chain and tires but i always expect to change em anyways
  wr is that you
  of course
tfw still no gf  cant wheelie myself away from this feelie
ive always had a urge to learn about motorcycles does anyone a good place to start i wanted to buy a motorcycle next year
  does anyone a good place to start  owning one
  take the msf course and read the sticky
  learn how to operate the clutch and throttle  immediately jump in to a two week police motorcycle school   you will have better slow speed skill than the majority of people on the road   from there just go ride no one can teach you how to ride on the street its a demon you must face alone  twist of the wrist 2 is good for cornering position theory can be used every day on back roads
    reee i want that tag so bad and that store is never fucking open
        thanks
where can i learn about fixing bikes
  dont ever buy a supersport whatever you do
reminder that mounting your phone on your bike will kill the camera due to the vibration my phone struggles to focus when taking pictures
been wanting a camping bike for months  asked in thread multiple times for suggestions  generic dirt baiku and adv shit that can only operate in well maintained trails  not a single person suggested farm bikes which ive only just now somehow came across    i fucking hate each and every single one of you it took a normie motovlogger with an overcommercialized video format to find the appropriate type of bike
  i have thousands of offroad miles on two phones without any camera issues
  i have been obsessed with motorcycles for 10 years and i have never heard of a farm bike
  why is that    also whatre /dbt/s thoughts on turning a bike into a project cafe racer
  imagine a tractor but actually a motorcycle
  thats called a four wheeler anon  the bike youre looking for a dr650
  low quality bait
  shes not latina shes a polak
  also whatre /dbt/s thoughts on turning a bike into a project cafe racer  unironically a shitty meme for hipsters and has been a hipster meme since before memes were mainstream
  too tall not agile enough gearing is way too fucking long too heavy for actual mud    think about a motorcycle thats meant to emulate a horse
  if you know how to ride a bicycle well then youre already 70 of the way there
  farm bikes are shit though might as well get a 250 dualsport and put knobbies on it
  0/10
  you need to give him at least 1 since he got you to reply
  unironically not bait i just like the look of the downward turned handlebars no need to be salty
sup my dudes i just got a vfr 400 last week babbys first braaapppppp i just thought it looked cool and the seller told me a good story about it so i bought it already spent the battery trying to start it last night with the kill switch engaged thougts ps im like 191 meters and apparently its made for midgets
  you clearly havent done enough research or training
  still didnt sell that bike
  did you not have the owner have it idle for you before you bought it how much did you pay
  its long gone  shes sputtering at 8krpm in heaven now
  well i fucked up obviously but its a whole new machine to get used to       he did and i started it before but last night i wasnt thinking clearly so i forgot to turn off the kill switch and so fucked up the battery my plan is to charge it tonight i paid zar25000 it has 20k kilos really good condition real sexy just the only thing i noticed so far is the gears dont shift super easily or comfortably  it seems like it wasnt quite made for someone of my proportions but im sure ill get the hang of it
    spent the battery trying to start it last night with the kill switch engaged  that are you talking about if the kill switch was on pressing the starter would do nothing to the battery
  well it did the kill switch was on and when trying to ignite thered be the electrical churring noise but it wouldnt actually go on so i kept trying and then the battery died      anyway i was more looking for opinions and thoughts on the bike itself im an utter novice still so my exploits so far are not very amusing
  not necessarily some killswitches only cut spark
  then youve got bigger problems than a dead battery
if the next person who makes an op fugs up the map link im going to kysms

builds shit
want to support my country and native industry  american cars are all made in mexico and korea  the most made in america car is a fucking toyota
  what hurts most is that even after bailing those fuckers out they didnt give a shit about us and now they are closing many shops again
    doesnt really hurt to me i knew thats how it was the entire time got used to losing to the big guys im ok with it better than not being ok with it and getting pissed while it still going to happen anyways
  the cuck mentality through and through
    lmao youre getting butt fucked too guy just because youre not ok with it doesnt mean youre not a cuck
  lets specify ford is a global brand and never took a bailout
  thats the literal definition of a cuck you dummy
  the most made in america car is a fucking toyota  where do magapedes get this weird idea from toyotas are only assembled in the us most parts are sourced from nippon
  the methodology is described here   where a car is assembled  its domesticparts content  where its engines and transmissions come from  how many us factory workers its parent automaker directly employs relative to vehicle sales    
  toyota is more american than gm
i unironically love fca    pacifica is best minivan  challenger and charger are eternally chad and based  keep wrangler and grand cherokee will always be cool it does not matter what you say jeep renegade is the best subcompact crossover and perfect girlfriendmobile  alfa romeo cucks the germans daily   ram has the best pickup trucks best looking exterior and interior by far    only memers hate fca
  this entire post is a meme
  every one of the brands you mention sells on one point and one point only appearance nothing about their internals is superior people only like them because they look pretty theyre like the invicta watches of cars all style and no substance
  yes the japanese car brand designed and owned and profited by yellow japanese people in japan is secretly an american company because they build a car in tennnesee and whereas gm and ford america companies build one car in mexico    ill never under this post purchase rationalization used only by japanese car buyers its like subconsciously you feel guilty so you tell yourself your japanese car made by a japanese car company makes you more in tune with the founding fathers than someone driving a mustang
  ferd makes better trucks gm makes better cars japanese make better minivans
  this is called asshurt
  ferd makes better trucks  kek
  dodge trucks are a meme
  they do deal with it dodgenigger
  hes right
  they do you can find ford super duty trucks pushing 500000 miles that are still running flawlessly
fiat makes the best econobox out of the three
  depends on the model tacoma is 75 us parts including drivetrain and assembled in san antonio rav4 their best selling vehicle is assembled in japan and canada
  thats why most of their small economic cars are gone or are on the way out they cant compete with foreign manufacturers and have decided to build only trucks and muscle cars its disappointing personally
  they are employing thousands of americans and contributing to american industry meanwhile big 3 shitters have been cutting jobs and destroying careers and families for decades they cant compete and offer a product people want to buy so they take it out on their workers while execs stay rich
  to be fair thats actually the jeep cherokee like 72 american made
  chrysler tech here the renagade is an absolute pile of shit in every regard other then looks
exactly
  i unironically love fca    pacifica is best minivan  challenger and charger are eternally chad and based  keep wrangler and grand cherokee will always be cool it does not matter what you say jeep renegade is the best subcompact crossover and perfect girlfriendmobile  alfa romeo cucks the germans daily   ram has the best pickup trucks best looking exterior and interior by far    only memers hate fca
  based far side poster
  and so is the ford f150 but both of the vehicles parts come from out of country sure built in the states but it wasnt built with american parts
  the percentage is the american parts though
  this american made means american parts which is the percentage it used to be the wrangler before the jl came out
  well shit ive been lied to yet again by jalopnik guess its my own damn fault for believing journalist bullshit
  you think theyre closing plants because they hate us but really theyre just discontinuing the recession shit cars they shat out for the past 10 years  expect great shit if gas prices stay down
  i wish chrysler wasnt shit because in my honest opinion their vehicles are really aesthetically pleasing
  objectively incorrect only crew cab silverados are build in silao    traced all the parts myself the double cab was entirely made in fort wayne    oh boo hoo welcome to business union worker
  theres a  on the window sticker thats what were talking about
i find it interesting that americans often base their decisions in higher institutions like governments instead of their own personal situation  for example a guy going to uni might buy a car out of his league instead of buying a 2nd hand shitbox like europeans do so the americans ends up in debt for 10 years and the european has a car he can actually afford in 5 years
  lets specify ford sold out its soul and the only drivers car it sells in the us besides the v6 gt is the mustang
what drives a man to do this to a car
link for anyone interested im sick of seeing the cars i want raped while im stuck with a shitbox he wants 30k for it by the way 
their car they can do what they want with their own money they dont need your permission  some people enjoy eating out their partners asshole even though thats where shit comes from
there is a certain group of enthusiasts that think this style is cool so much group think that you end up with cars taken to this level mostly minorities and weird white kids from what ive seen
  stop being poor and immature maybe you will have money
  we like to customize to our tastes or what we think looks good some like to customize to the new fashion statement or trend  im not sure about using the oil cooler as a bumper but the wide body kits looks ok
the boss kit is the goat but its like 5k if you could install it yourself youd be better off just buying an s14 for 7k
  looks really good without any stancefaggotry
  basically everything looks better without any stancefaggotry
  yep its a legitimately cool kit i wish they would make more that completely transform the look of the car real shame that they slam the fuck out of it on all the show cars
  this saw a boss kit at a car show last year and fell in love with it its like the perfect car shape in my opinion especially with a rear bumper delete lol
    ruining a perfectly fine looking japanese coupe with a wanna be muscle car body  you retards should just buy an actual muscle car anyone who does this is a class a turbo faggot and there is nothing you can say to prove me wrong
  yeah dey cool
  but it looks like an old japan car 
    this desu
  the exact same bodylines and panels as a dodge challenger on the kit  classic japanese cars  yeah nah there is no correlation between a boss kit and a classic japanese car its made for low iq jdm retards because they want to stand out
  maybe its because old skylines look like challengers
  you missed the joke
    the bodylines do not match in any way shape or form unlike this car never mind this kit was designed in the early teens
  excess melanin
  thats nice and all old skyline still ripped of the challenger which inspired the new one    if you to get specific its a cuda/challenger hybrid
  you cant change the fucking bodylines its just a front bumper and fender flares modifying the car beyond that would take experienced coachbuilders
lets take a round 90s car and add jagged hard edges to it brilliant styling choices
  im talking the front of the car you inept mong if you want to talk about the car as a whole even more reason to fucking not use the kit lmao its disgusting the way theyre forcing the car to pull off a look when none of the lines match the original designwhy not use a kit that exemplifies a cars lines instead of trying to pull off something it isnt     yes they did but they still have their small design elements that drastically differentiated them from a challenger the kit doesnt do that in the front of the car
  but they still have their small design elements that drastically differentiated them from a challenger  the kit doesnt do that in the front of the car    the typical kit looks more like a cuda grill and headlights in a challenger bumper but what do you know the old datsun/nissan style fits too its not really a direct copy
  and i forgot the image
          after seeing these kits next to their older counterparts i actually like them now
  see those little design elements drastically change the look compared to  this now looks like a classic japanese car but the kit as a whole still creates a giant clusterfuck in the design read what i wrote here 
  honestly i feel like the kit would look best not done up as a fauxracecar but instead trying to look like a lightlytuned streetcar with no chin spoiler or anything wacky like that just make people think there was a retro throwback coupe in the 90s that they dont remember
  yeah but crazy ass aero is back in style give another few years and clean builds will be back in fashion seen a few without the lip though
  and what happened well on 4channel they say that the anons heart grew three sizes that day
  that car is ugly    pic related is not
  who wore it better
how many of you actually own an schassis let alone an s14    automatic ka shitboxes dont count

  tfw no butt munching with ur friendo rn     have a big cry and a sad cum
  mostly minorities  its usually flips and whites that hang out with asians at least from what ive seen
  havnt been here in a while now i remember why  why are you all so jaded and fun hating
  imagine being this obsessed with race lol you sound like a dumb libcuck
  but at least match the tail light with similar style would be much better but i guess the point is to show work been done in a more rough apparence
  at least its not a cum inthebum   graphic depiction of the homoez after a buttsexing
i actually like this  if its not flip ups muscle fronts are nice
unoriginal but whats your dream car thread  mine is the renault turbo 5 i just love the power and look of it it really grows on you the more you look at it
you cant find a more perfect car
ill never own one because they cost insane amounts of money but they seem fun and not that much of a headache anyone know what they are like and how reliable they are

why do people like cambered wheels they look retarded
  because people are retarded
  why do people like thing i dont like 
its the automotive equivalent of walking around in public with your pants slipped down to your ankles
    
it makes it look like the car is drifting even when its standing still which makes for some cool photos
a slight negative camber can look nice on a car   these people take it to stupid levels though
  it makes it look like the car is drifting  it doesnt  it just makes the car look like it collapses under your burger weight like in a cartoon
its showing off 99 of /o/ cant afford to even have a show car like that
i saw a stanced minivan today parked outside the courthouse wish i had gotten a pic
  it costs almost nothing to get camber done on your car
  this is a new age of retardation
  at this point you might as well start stealing little girls tricycle wheels for your shitty honda    its not functional it just makes you look retarded revert that shit back or scrap it and buy a car with an engine that runs clockwise you fucking snowflake hipster
   clearly has no idea what hes talking about ignoring the fact that having a show car right out of the gate means buying a second vehicle a nice set of wheels costs more than the average poorfags only car for example my wheels and tires alone ran about 6000 i havent done any suspension work but getting airbags installed would be about another 3000 so 9000 is almost nothing 
  the people that do it also look retarded because they are retarded
  you
  so 9000 is almost nothing   to make a car look like four junkyard steelies the wrong sized tires from abduls used tire emporium and a suspension cut and weld job done by bubba for 50
  check out this retard
  i said camber costs almost nothing learn to read you fucking brainlet
  congrats you wasted thousands of dollars to make your car look like you dragged it off a detroit inner city lawn     do you also leave empty beer cans and discarded needles lying around it for extra effect
  found your ride
  my car looks clean dude you dont know what youre talking about i said if i wanted to stance it then id have to pay extra for the suspension i might actually need new tires come to think of it but either way the point is that people who have cars that look like the op do it to show off a car like that doesnt cost almost nothing altho he did cheap out on the wheels a little i think those are only like 600 a set
  because ricers are retarded and think hurr drift cars have camber what if i turned it up to eleven am genius  and thats how retarded trends are born
  nah camber goes all the way back to the 60s
so much hate in this thread but when you pull up in your shitbox next to the slammed car which one has the qt asian girl in it
  is that a corvair damn son i didnt know you could make those even more dangerous
  that however still proves my theory its a low ride up to eleven which needed cambered wheels in order to sit even lower ricer boomers we need a term for them thought hurr low riders are low what if i made them even lover am genius  camber reexploded recently due to drift cars adopting it for handling purposes
  the corvair was no more or less dangerous than its competitors shockingly ralph nader does not have your best interests at heart
  haha no
    /thread
  the only problem the corvair had was that it oversteered more easily than other cars and really if people cant correct oversteer they shouldnt be on the road to begin with
  agreed
  which actually begs the question if ken block can turn a brick like the mustang i hardtop into a drift car what is stopping one of us autists from turning a corvair into the ultimate drift meme machine
  money
  there is pretty much no mustang left in that car      but this
finally someone who gets it  independent suspension was a mistake beams are nice they hold the wheels at perfectly straight camber all the time as god intended
  it doesnt prove your theory at all you completely spun around what you first said
  why do people like anything they look retarded
would i be mistaken in assuming that cambered wheels have worse traction since less of the tread is making contact with the road
  why do people like a thing that is so retarded tho
  because it triggers people like you
  how does any of that shit relate to changing the camber
camber used to have purpose back when tires were skinnier it allowed for more surface use of the tire when taking turns but with how wide tires are today camber is only for looks  which look stupid btw stancefags are more cancerous than donks
  the showing off would be a lot more effective if you used that 6k to just buy a nicer car in the first place
  because a stock car looks sooo cool
  i hope the 6k you spent on wheels were for some ultra light magnesium rims otherwise congrats on burning your money in the most retarded way possible
  close forged aluminum not that it matters since the car has never left the interstate and only has 2900 miles in 2 years they could be made of iron as long as they look nice
  this when i didnt know much about cars i would always see this super stanced car parked on this street and i always thought something fell on it or something and the gay is too lazy to get it towed
just
  camber affects straight line grip yes but mild camber typically no more than 5 degrees at most gives traction for cornering
it was cool in japan now its just cali retards with too much money trying to recreate bippu with their 2013 genesis widebody
  theres a difference between driving a car around and driving a car around with contact patches smaller than a pushbikes its dangerous not simply stop liking something i dont
  thats like 5  tops  its mostly just slammed
i guess they help with cornering
stancing looks like your car fucking broke down and you couldnt find the proper size rims
  are you fucking retarded
  do you think that car ever gets driven look at the tires its a show car inb4 nuh uh i seen a guy driving once like that
  lol what the fuck  this nigga srs
  yeah i guess they just get trailedd around to the various car shows   you got me there
  usually especially guys with static drops since its usually impossible to actually drive anywhere anyway
  pic or it didnt happen faggot
  found the stancefag
  yeah im totally gonna post a picture of my car in a thread thats already full of ass blasted poorfags who hate me because i went outside the hivemind im sure the response would be very positive and welcoming
  looks much worse than if not slammed and cambered
  99 of stanced cars are beat to shit rustbuckets
  99 of stanced cars are not beat to shit rustbuckets
  i dont like the camber but the exhaust cutout is sick desu
  99 of stanced cars are beat to shit rustbuckets
  100 of you is a jealous poorfag
  stanced donks are the next fad screencap this
  jealous of garys 2003 honda jazz with cut springs and 10 wide steelies  sure am
  i was referring to the op picture but if youre jealous of the car you described too then ok
  beams are nice  unsprung weight
  camber used to have purpose back when tires were skinnier    this sort of  skinny tires maintain a consistent contact patch with the pavement albeit smaller wide tires contact patch varies as the camber changes while cornering well designed suspensions attempt to keep outside tires vertical zero camber while cornering but in modified suspensions this is more difficult to achieve so a compromise is to allow wheel some negative camber and when the car rolls the tire will lean back up straight    back in the old days extreme negative camber was also used with skinny tires and spoked wheels not to improve the contact patch but to keep the wheel loading along the plane of the spokes since spoked wheels are not as rigid as forged alloy under side loads this isnt as important with forged alloy wheels because the metallurgy is more than adequate to make a stiff wheel
ridiculous max power rice looks infinitely better than stance  slammingcamber looks like bambi on ice at least a massive wing fart cannon and bright green paint on a saxo looks fun
  t busrider
  think you can standjfif
  wow dude good one ive posted pictures of my car before as i was putting the final touches on its initial show stage last year but fagg/o/ts are like crabs in a pot they hate people who have nice cars and love nothing more than talking shit while their twenty year old saturn rusts on the side of the street in front of their apartment thats why you very rarely ever see someone with a cool car post pictures of it because we get tired of the same rehashed comments every time
  they could be made of iron as long as they look nice  you shouldnt be allowed to alter anything on any car fucking showtuning faggots
  sorry i dont look at cars as if they were just appliances
  depends a lot on the tire  also the camber gain inherent in the geometry of the suspension  other things to consider are roll center coupling and scrub radius
  nice cars  not stanced
  pure stock is pretty cool to me
    muh car concept inspiration
  looks boring as fuck compared to every other stock drag class
  instead you look at cars as if they were lawn ornaments   and by what logic does someone who wants to improve their car look at their car as an appliance i swear every single stancefaggot ive talked to is in a hivemind and says exactly the same shit whenever theyre put on the spot about their knack for ruining cars
  this is going to make the wheels horribly unbalanced wont it
  every hater is the same too immature and jealous
  immature i can see jelous fuck no you can keep your broken peice of shit i like car that you know you can actually drive
  yeah thats why you guys always bring up money and being attention whores maybe if you spent less time hating and more time bettering yourself you could have something nice too sorry you dont know how to drive though
  then lets try to be civil about this what do you find attractive about a stanced car if you lose the drivability aspect of it
  ad hominem instead of a point  like poetry
  looks obviously thats what drives most people to buy and do what they do to their car      ahh this coming from the guy who calls things a broken piece of shit you cant drive the irony of haters is never overwhelming stop projecting and you wont get called out kid
  you cant argue with the fact that it is literally broken     the point of many of the performance cars that you stance is to be driven quickly when you dick with the camber to that degree you completely destroy every bit of the suspension geometry making it unable to drive as fast     now i dont know about you but to me if something doesnt do what it was meant to do that sounds pretty broken to me
  look up the definition of literally look up the definition of broken stanced doesnt fall under literally broken  youre just a tryhard poser enthusiast my dude the point of the car is what you make it
  i am genuinely curious not trying to be an ass here but why do you find stance attractive im asking honestly about why you find the excessive camber to be nice looking
  and by what logic does someone who wants to improve their car look at their car as an appliance  because you only care about function thats why youll never understand you can never see that theres this aspect of cars that is more than just being a machine designed to be driven
  i like appliances that you know you can actually use for their intended function as designated by the manufacturer
  in a literal sense  not in working order  that sounds like exactly what i meant you cant possibly call your car in working order if your car scrapes on flat roads and cant corner faster that 10mph
  why does everyone think every stanced car is the same you dont even need camber to be stanced and most dont have a lot of it what kind shit is why do you find this attractive anyway do you go around asking people shit like why do you think blondes are attractive why do you like that color you just do man i think good fitment and no wheelgap looks good cars look better closer to the ground      just because you dont know shit about stanced cars doesnt make your false beliefs are true
    improving upon the manufacturer specs and making the car faster and more fun to drive  vs  making it purely an aesthic peice of nonfunctioning machinery soley built for having pictures taken of it and garnering attention    seems like an easy choice to me
  subjective horseshit is objective  wowie zowie haters are a hilarous
  maybe you personally have dumped enough money into your manuelmobile so that it doesnt scrape rub and sound broken but i can certainly tell you that sitting in a car meet watching not just one but many shitted up cars tearing up bumpers on the ramp into the parking lot definitely doesnt make you guys look good
  more subjective shit no one cares about your opinion scraping is fun to some people
  ripped my oil pan off wow so fun1  you can say drifting damages cars too but at least going sideways is exciting
  he said machine so ill say machine too   its sad you cant appreciate art you know there was someone else who hated art that he didnt like and banned all the works he didnt like and forbade artists from displaying their works  that someone was hitler
  not him but i think that we think that because most stanced cars are the same my dude i will admit that there are a few shining examples that are done really well but honestly most of them that i see driving the roads are cookie cutter copies of each other if there was more variation in the community and many of them were far more nicely implemented then i dont think you guys would have such a bad name however stereotypes do exist for a reason and if you guys want to stop people from hating you you need to realize what those are
  driving cars and not driving them wears down a car too cars are a constantly degrading thing sorry youre too dumb to know about preventative measures keep being a little tryhard tho
  alright i was somewhat with you until you called your shitboxes art you cant seriously think that highly of your car do you actually
  driving cars and tearing off your exhaust on a speed hump are not the same thing  at least rice/performance modding actually looks cool and can make pretty average cars do some amazing things making a golf quick enough to embarrass m3s is fun making it look like an elephant sat on it is not
  thinking that shattering your oil pan on a reflector is the same as regular wear and tear  holio fuck the absolute state of stancefags
  lol i dont care if you hate it because its subjective haters are the ones who are salty at others for using their money on their cars and act like their opinion is fact personally i think its hilarious what you said can be applied to pretty much every car scene out there    oh wow a miata on rpf1s  oh wow a foxbody with a ls swap  oh wow a blacked out lifted diesel truck         lol its just more subjective shit from autistic immature kids who think you can only play with toys their way or youre wrong
  stanced and slammed  not running a dry sump and chopped pan    tyrone you silly fat bastard
taste is subjective some people like eating dog shit youre just a hater
  subjective  subjective  would you like to make a case as to why your argument is objective
  your entire argument is i dont like it so its shit this is about the same mental level of an elementary schooler      lol look at this crybaby
  tyrone  nah niggers cant into stance its usually spoiled little white boys and spics
  i know a black guy with a stanced s14 with a 2jz swap he did himself lol why haters such a underaged cancer
  knows a black guy  doesnt report his car as stolen    do you even care about your country m8
  calls me a crybaby instead of offering objective argument because there is none  ladies and gentlemen we got em
  some people dont spend their lives in the basement browsing /pol/ all day and interact with humanity in person      keep on crying lol imagine how retarded you have to be to think taste is objective kids are really stupid these days
  my accusation was more like why would you break something cool for attention but now that i write it out breaking things for attention is a red flag for autism it checks out
  art noun the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination  yeah i do
  and i already went against that because its not broken lol
  lowering a car is an expression of creative skill and imagination  wat
  ive interacted with humanity enough and held these beliefs long before its was hip or funny long before /pol/ even existed to be honest    if you were baste youd grow a set and realize the problem
i feel like i lost braincells reading this thread jesus fucking christ how come stance threads always bring out the retards on both sides of the coin all stance threads should be deleted immediately after creation
perfect camber
i dont like it its ruined mom make them stop playing with their toys like that they have to do what i want theyre stupid they need to use their money on their property how i want them to    am i supposed to take you guys seriously      lol sure thing id rather not be basted though
  camber isnt even the most important thing offset is everything
  kekd
  i wish my shit was flush with the fender like that but once my car airs down it would be a big problem lmao
  id rather europeans kick all the mud filth who gang rape their daughters out of the country world wide    but we aint there yet
  time for some stretch and rolled fenders      payback for crusades divine punishment
  you mean compared to all the niggers and spic gang activites in america lmafo
  this    have you faggots ever gone outside or to a car show    these stanced car owners put a shit load of money in their cars from bodykits expensive wheels big spoilers you name it cars are super fucking clean    do i like it hell fucking no  but i tell yall those fucking cars are not rustbuckets
  europeans are superior  get rekt and overrun by starving refugees from shitholes  kek      as how its always been there are those that do it right and those who cut corners or on a tight budget but yeah i usually see stanced cars in better condition than your typical car of the same vintage
  might not be rustbuckets but theyre fucking boring wow dude you switched out the acura badge on your rsx with a honda badge nice dude really cool  ls rustbucket pic related pulls into stance meet  mogs everyone
  ls swapping a shitbox is about as boring as you can get there are also plenty of ls swapped stanced cars so nobody will really give a shit
  you really think of it wasnt for our backwards (((justice system))) we wouldnt have already taken care of it once the economy crashes its gonna be a ball     but this isnt the place for this type of discussion
  ls swapping a shitbox is about as boring as you can get  nice contrarian cope brother   nobody will really give a shit  then what do you call it when a crowd of stancefags go yoooo around a turbo ls 80s shitbox shooting flames with the 2 step
  so much ignorance and projection
stancefags are usually nonwhites  nuff said
  the only race i see more into stance than white people are asians go back to /pol/ child
  projection  ls swaps are boring  you just repeat everything you read on this board dont you
  but 100 of stances cars are ruined    so theres that
  these people are retarded lol    everyone stops and looks at a sleeper popping flames off the limiter cause you just dont expect to see a little fairmont ripping ass    its always the same batch of meme cars at shows so whenever you really do something odd people lose their shit    hes a colored hes a little slow     he doesnt even realize how ironic and boring that ls swapped rx7 is
    lol someones salty is diamond dozen swap isnt special i will roll eyes in your face and make fun of you if you try to show off that stit no one cares about it it was boring years ago let alone now guess you just dont have the skills to do anything
to make it better hes a underaged kid making racist jokes calling people stupid while missing the point of posts and being generally retarded    sigh haters have always proven to be on the low end of the intelligence bar
  im not the guy with the fairmont im the asshole with the s500    i want to do a rear mount turbo set up is that special enough 6700 hp big body mercedes    anythings special compared to a slammed honda or jetta so theres that lol
  you can roll your eyes but would you agree to a race    cause youd lose you realize
  beanboi is mad because his honda badge swapped rsx is getting mogged by grandmas 4 door fairmont lmao
  implying the racism is a joke    no we really dont like you coloreds
  its really not ls swaps are the mediocre it just works thing of the car world i dont care what you do but a ls swap impresses no one          lol this fucking ricer probably goes around racing sports cars that arent racing and says he won on social media so slow you have to pick on shows cars lmao    go back to /pol/ underaged cancer
  go back to africa nigger
  he would never agree to a race in the first place    he spent 2 grand to make his 100hp jetta literally unsafe and useless by cocking the wheels at a 45 degree angle 3k on wheels and ran out of money for an engine worth a damn     lmao beanboi
  be born in the usa  have iq above 80 and over the age of 16 so not racist retard  hurr go back 2 afrucuh      fucking benchracing ricer larpfags lol haters going on new lows
  you fucking idiot i just told you its a benz s500 with the factory 50 and i want to throw a turbo underneath it i didnt say i want to ls swap it    is english your second language
  i dont care what you do  lol you are a fucking projecting ass tard aint ya
  hella mad you cant drive in a light drizzle because you have less contact area than a motorcycle
  dang no originality and you dont know how to drive the hilarity ensues
  why did you get a jap car i thought yall loved you some    yurrpeeyan carz baybayyy    your show car 97 integra with the jdm front clip is fucking retarded
  keep coping you disgusting nigger everybody is racist communists just made the term into a shaming tactic  
beanboi lmao
  i dont even think you spergs are thinking before you post anymore      lol how pathetic you have to be to try and rationalize being stupid
  seriously what car do you have stop posting pics of other peoples cars until we get to laugh at your dumpster fire
  just a plastidipped porsche with a bodykit and aftermarket wheels  woah this guy is a real auto enthusiast       i know he wont id race him on dry rotted street tires and still gap his ass let beanboi seethe with his shitty acura he built for instagram
  lol means a lot coming from a guy stealing pics of a fucking fairmont      talks shit  cant even get the car model right  oh man i love all the projection and irony you keep giving me underaged cancer belongs on 4chan not 4channel
  very astute observation    stancefags are the literal male version of instagram whores lol    all looks no performance male narsasism
  you mixed up both replies lmao well done
  im the one with the mercedes you dipshit
    retards on anonymous boards  hurr u stipid we not same    lol how pathetic
  ill time stamp i was actually gonna go start the beast in a minute you little monkey lol    all that money you spent to make your eg civic an absolute turd and you could have had a big body benz with a 50 vee ayte
also good job ignoring the entire post just to talk shit lol dumbasses dont know cars stance or how to make a decent post  typical haters      i dont really care about your beat to shit used gypsymobile nothing about it is impressive
  i dont really care about your beat to shit used gypsymobile nothing about it is impressive  typical hater baka senpai bet he gets more likes on instagram than your shitty acura
  i hope so i dont even have an instagram lol you dont put anything into your car so why would i care about it
  the only thing new on a stance car is its financed wheels and its ebay coilovers lets not act like youre rolling in a 2019 now little man    gypsymobile    you mean the reichmobile this is a panzer youre looking at not a 93 acura econoshitbox with wheel bearings that are literally screaming for mercy lmao
  lol like i said  dumbasses dont know cars stance or how to make a decent post  typical haters    yeah nah your car is an old shitbox driven by brown people working as gas station managers it looks like you dont even take care of it lol maybe if you actually cleaned it up and used some tlc i could compliment it but not right now i cant/
  of course you post a w220 with the ugliest fucking wheels in existence    the body work is coming soon havent had the car long this is a 1 owner car shes rough and hilariously i have paperwork from when the bodywork was done back about a decade ago lol    gotta love the east coast    look at that tuck biyatch
  god i could make so much money off of stancefags with just a shitty ebay dslr and kit lens    dly drvn  15 year old stock motor mercedes on coilovers  wow you must have a crazy high compression motor in that thing that only runs on race gas
  yeah get back to me when it doesnt have collapsed suspension and a body that looks like a 80s toyota      doubt it since most stance guys have their own cameras or at least friends that do and lol such a tryhard you likely would destroy that car if you tried to daily it
absolutely perfect right here maybe lowered in the front more    the 20s i have on mine are too much to be honest but they look good     my car is lowered so i think a nice set of 18s like this pic would be mint
if you knew about cars you wouldnt worry about the collapsed supsension but i understand anything more intricate than an ek hatch is a little scary for you lol
  thats nice still looks like shit and like you have collapsed suspension guess its only funny when its a stanced car lol you dont even know what a 350z is and called it a porsche you dont really have any room to talk
  youre still getting me confused with the fairmont guy lmfao
  thats nice yourre anonymous youre both retarded basically the same
  you likely would destroy that car if you tried to daily it  its a 15 year old car dude
  for real dude what kind of car do you have were all waiting to see what youd stand next to as you roll your eyes lol
  and that is relevant how my slammed ride was 25 years old when i had it you cant drive a low car the same youd probably lack the skills and just fuck it up
  you dont even know what a 350z is and called it a porsche  lmao holy shit it is a 350z thats even worse someone spent thousands to put a widebody kit and a porsche kit just for instagram thats saying a lot about you beanbois and your instagram obsession
  somebody builds their own kit and car putting tons of hours of work into it because he wanted to out of passion  is clearly in japan    haters just like proving how little they know and put max effort into being as tryhard as possible lol
  cant drive low cars the same    literally driving 10 under the limit and swerving around the road like a drunk stuck in the middle of the street for 5 minutes trying to creep up a hooters entrance so you dont scratch your 35 ebay lip     the not drunk just slammed stickers exist for a reason
  not really a good choice of words considering how many die from drunk driving no one dies because of stance just because you think you know what to do doesnt mean you can do it
  implying you would want to learn how to drive around potholes in a clapped out s14    kek
  and that is relevant how  that car is totally driveable and daily driven is just a meme for stancefags say to feel like theyve built something substantial    youre not driving a purpose built drag car or drift car
rice is vehicular cosplay  stance is like cosplaying as your own deviantart fan fiction
   you would want to learn how to drive around potholes in a clapped out s14  how else would everyone know im a cool fast and furious jdm auto enthusiast
  thats nice just like with those cars if you dont know what youre doing you will destroy it
  theres a difference between virtually undriveable on the street and being inconvenienced driving on the street
  both would be inconvienced neither would be virtually undrivable
  well there is more to stanced than swapbadging not that im defending stance but stop changing goalposts most stanced cars are not rustbuckets
  thats why i said virtually and not literally i dont think tom bailey is driving his drag week promod to work everyday but you are right    my point is getting a fucking vanity plate to let everyone know your 15 year old mercedes is daily driven yo is fucking gay and tryhard
  might not be rustbuckets but theyre fucking boring  stop changing goalposts most stanced cars are not rustbuckets  did you not read the post the rebadging statement was in reference to the cars being boring and beanbois trying their best to make them look cool
cambered cars remind me of those awful car caricatures
  look how upset he gets when he is accused of not dumping stupid amounts of money into something so stupid
  and they wouldnt want to either
  its kind of like people who enjoy traps theyre objectively wrong to like traps but that doesnt stop them from arguing a losing point
  yes i cant remember if the dude made them as a joke or not but yeah wobblier than /soc/s sexual orientation
  because then they can ruin their cars grip and entire underbody and have an excuse why they get btfo at every single motorsport
  youre not driving a fucking formula 1 car nigger
normally i really dont like stance but in some cases a little bit of camber really makes the car look better
offset and muh stance nation type shit doesnt bother me except when on performance cars like this   i mean it really is blasphemous to the engineers and soul of the car when you think about it like i saw an sti lowered on bags with ridiculous offset and it was just wrong that car was designed for nailing perfect downshift revmatches when carving a canyon corner
  i meant performance cars like this 
  stis are trash without an ls swap shut up normie
  yeah i hate it when someone spends their money on their car to get more enjoyment out of it
saw a minivan with stanced out wheels and led headlights today imagine being that guy and unironically thinking that was a good idea
  yeah i hate it when someone spends their money on their car to get more enjoyment out of it  doing something specifically for attention is instagram whore tier shit
  pic unrelated
  you know thats a 350z right
  that would look way better with some decently meaty tires and wheels that were aligned correctly
  the badge is fucked
  it started out as people trying to emulate drift cars then some retards took it too far anything more than 2 degrees looks like you broke a tie rod     99 of people cant afford to properly align there wheels   so no one on here can even afford a wrench now wow
your mom loves you and youre retarded
so if you camber a tire wheel how does this affect the tire wear and does it affect steering stability
  nah cone shaped tires are peak performance
  literally came here to post this you cunt  stop stealing my posts
  pls be b8
can we agree that anything beyond 3 degrees of camber is functionally useless
  narsasism
  traps might be gay but stancing is for faggots  t homo
  came here to post this
whats the fucking point who decided this looked good why the fuck do people lower their cars until they cant even get over a 2 inch bump
  blowing large amounts of money in hunk of metal is creative skill and imagination  dude i have some nice wheels on my ride too but 1  its not and will never be art in any shape or form and 2  i dont use the money it cost me as a way to taunt anons on a mongolian tent building forum
  mongolian tent building on the other hand is art desu
  this is the same postmodernist stupidity as using piss and shit and smearing it on a canvas and calling it art
  if hitler would be on my side and ban stancing then ill take hitler
bunch of immature ignorant tards hating on something  haters never change      wrong people have been doing this before drift cars were a thing      lolno funny that you guys dont even know race cars run 34 degrees and it isnt even uncommon
millenial historian and engineer    ok dude we get it you know everything that ever has been and youve got your foot in the door on everything that ever will be    now fuck off    not once have you posted a pic of your own car
  cringe
  post your car    if it isnt stanced your a poser and a fag and need to get your shit together
  nice projections bro we all know most of /o/ are a bunch of tryhard enthusiast wannabes
  again all you gotta do is post your hunk of shit lol i posted my car youve yet to show us up
  lol keep on sperging ya tryhard
  nobody unironucally likes it its just for attention even nocar normies think it looks stupid/broken my 3 year old daughter even noticed some fag in cambered brz and pointed out it looked broken
  even nocar normies think it looks stupid/broken  even  broken  normies are the only ones who think this tbqh rest are just immature kids who dont like it so they say its stupid like elementary schoolers do feel sorry for your kid
  normies and the rest of the automotive community theyre all laughing at you who does that leave that actually likes it
  like i said immature kids being tryhards them laughing doesnt mean much with all that shit taste
  feels sorry for his 3 year old that can recognize something is wrong with double digit negative camber     sounds like a smart kid tbqh senpai
  t bus rider    i couldnt imagine being so lame lol
  stancefag  others have bad taste    well if thats not the pot calling the kettle black i dont know what is
  dunno her dad is an immature kid thats why im sorry its no surprise your shit taste influences      ho boy another projection
  were trying hard to get you to post your car
  makes functional cars less functional/perform worse for muh fitment trying to be instagram famous  calls others immature kids    weeeeew laddie
  he wont admit that hes a 73 iq puerto rican with no taste and no car
    and im laughing at you being spergy tards      i dont like it so no one else likes it and only want attention  i dont like it so its shit  lol yeah its like sour grapes and you having the mentality of an elementary schooler
  weve moved beyond wether on not its liked by those of us posting    were at you posting your car to prove your not a poser    we all want a good laugh at your 96 integra sedan
  the only people that like it are other stancefags youre all deluded
  dont really care and im still laughing at you being a tryhard sperg the way youre calling me a poser doesnt even makes sense and that makes it even funnier
  the only people who like things are the people who like it    goddamn anon you may just be a fucking genius lmfao whats next the only people that like nascar are people who watch nascar
  the only thing funny is the fact that someone would sit around and post pics of other peoples cars and defend them when they get shit talked instead of soldiering on with the thread and continuing to post pics
  why would i sit here and spam the thread with images lol u dum not defending anyones car either just calling yall out for being the immature little spergs you are
  lots of people like nascar but dont go to races  lots of people like art but arent artists and dont own art  lots of people can appreciate all different kinds of music even though they cant play any  lots of people like classic/antique vehicles regardless of owning one or even having barely any automotive knowledge    but theres people who like camber/stance/hellaflush/instabuilds and them theres everyone else even anons 3 year old child knows its shit     normies arent looking at your ebay cambered shitboxes with 2 years of min wage salary wheels that cant even drive over a speedbump and thinking its cool or lusting over them no matter how much you call them all haterzzzz bruh
  your post makes 0 sense and doesnt even work the way you intended  all that projection  top fucking lol you tryhards are fucking retarded
tfw this will never not be true
  youre fucking retarded lol
  whats your ig name so i can follow your sick build brah we know you have a vinyl of it plastered across your windshieldright above the locally hated vinyl
totally not doing it for the attention bruh    i dont know whats worse stancefags or coal rolling brodozerfags leaning towards stancefags
  noulol        all this projection  jesus dude
  hurr ur projecting    i see you have no arguement ill see myself out of this cancer thread about a cancer fad
  gib me attentions pls  i dnt lk this is shit  i go find things i dont like and whine about them for attention  u wont gib attentin so im leavin   dis ib cancer    bye hater
4channel was a mistake the normie faggot in this thread calling everyone a hater and defending stanced cars needs to consider killing himself
  ah wahah u a normy  this is sekrit qwub i been here all summer  ah i cnt stnd this    go back to facebook you underaged cancer
ive got a running theory that people with stanced cars are just bad people and reading this thread is confirming it yet again
                                      
when the benz tucks hard but its just an air leak    some men just want to watch the world burn
  niggers of all colors love them
  then show me is with that set up looking better
  move engine to the middle
    130db interior  bbut my weight distribution
stancefags are literally the stupidest pieces of shit that have failed to commit suicide today
  are you going to complain about the co poisoning too live a little
  i call wang

nothing because its some fag that bought it with his dads money  anyone whod actually appreciate it including the boomer that never takes it above 25k rpm wouldnt blast loud music instead of enjoying the engine sound
  engine sound and a little bit of your favorite tunes softly playing in the bg is absolute kino nobody can argue otherwise
  ive seen a few mustangs and even a camaro on my way home from university in the uk never a challenger    literally the only inproduction burger car worth having so not sure why

  probably just shit on it because i have an m5 and were not on a drag strip
  m5  i bet its a 1991 rust bucket
any 57l owners here 64l is unnecessary right how about 50l mustang steering feel as numb as they say going to sound retarded because it is but i love banging gears in my 2nd gen dakota dont want to lose that agile flickable feel but cant get burger barges out of my head    or do i just pay an exuberant price for a 20y/o jap shitbox ive always wanted sense being a kid          pic not related
gap a bitch
  downshift
  57  i was but then a valve dropped and fucked everything up coolant was fresh and oil was done 1000 miles prior to this never again
what are you gonna do rear end me theres no passing zone for miles and my car is worth less than your bumper    turn my music up  ignore him  probably have to flip my mirror down because led headlights are a deadly laser
  make devil horn sign through the window and start headbanging violently
  the whole song is your favourite part  6 minutes long
  its pass you before you get to a turn
  wat do  nothing
  thats odd i was always under the impression the 57l was a good engine for being replaced so quickly or is that just the truck engine also sorry for your loss anon
  6 minutes  you are like a little baby
    prog intensifies
  its all good driving music too
  my night was shit and now its great thank you anon
        he thinks those are long songs
  wait till im in a no passing zone and drive 5 mph under the speed limit
    dude just go test drive them there is absolutely no way youre going to know unless you get into the cars and try driving them for real you might think that you really enjoy driving a little japanese go kart with a high revving engine but you might find yourself enjoying easing along in your big v8 bruiser instead
  fucking zozzle
was driving home on the gowanus the other night and on the otherside manhattan bound there was a wadded up orange challenger boomer edition r/t i could only imagine the stupidity that went on for him to wreck it on a dry wednesday night with moderate traffic
  true man youre right the little japanese car is sort of hard though because its not like i can stroll on down to the dealership for a 1998 nissan 240sx and it would be weird to go up to someone who has one and be like awhh no way dude let me drive your car1     but yea youre right i can sit and think and think on it all i want but until i drive them i wont know
  i enjoy both
  reddit spacing
  ive owned one of each the 64 is a shit load more fun than the 57 given how fucking fat and heavy that car is the challenger steers way better than any of the bus riders who have never actually driven one on this board proclaim the current gen mustangs handle much better as do the camaros the challenger isnt what id call agile my old prelude and tls were agile its morei dunnoworkable the camaro is pretty agile actually mustang is somewhere inbetween    ive owned japboxes ive owned land barges ive had one euro sports sedan had my brothers s5 for a summer and i own a challenger theyre all fun in different ways almost none of which are safe and legal in traffic highway pulls in the challenger are legit fun the jap cars in twisty roads were incredible the s5 was like a combo of those things my old grand marquis was the worlds most comfy cruiser if you decide to get a boomermobile test out the challenger mustang and camaro then decide how the feel weighs against the look its an inverse relationship with all of them performance is the worst in the challenger slightly slower slightly heavier slightly less nimble but looks are the best imo looks are worst in the camaro but its faster lighter and more nimble than all of them mustang is perhaps the best of both worlds but it comes down to taste and feel    at the least itll certainly be a lot cheaper to get your dream japbox
  give him some fuel  give him some fire  give him some dawichadezai
  depends on the situation  if its on the highway abort mission  if its on snow or a twisty road lol try me or wreck yoursefl
  make sure im not speeding because its actually an unmarked phoenix pd traffic enforcement vehicle trying to trick people into breaking the law
i know its not a toyota but it is the cheapest v8 ive seen around arent srts performance as well
everything about this car is shit you might as well just get a crown vic so you can join the rest of the insecure wannabe cops who think their piece of shit is cool because wow rwd v8
its probably close to fucking up cause murica quality
    no offense op but shopping for a car threads should be autoban    who gives a fuck buy it or not
  those are pretty quick but its still a jeep so itll have all the issued that the regular gcs have
these are pretty dope but severely overpriced atm
not many of these bad boys around rare opportunity
let me guess you drive a commodore and got butthurt by an srt once before    anonymous  12/03/18mon065458 no20074151  everything about this car is shit you might as well just get a crown vic so you can join the rest of the insecure wannabe cops who think their piece of shit is cool because wow rwd v8
  how much do you think it should be worth its currently over 10k now     i think i can only afford 15 max
engine and transmission are probably good transfer case oim rear diff will probably shit itself    interior materials are garbage    hvac blend doors will go to shit requires dash removal to fix if coolant has been changed more regularly than suggested the heater core will puke requires dash removal to fix    i had a 2005 47 that was the last chrysler i will buy the last american car i will buy the last car made in america i will buy
  2006 jeep  hope you have a car lift in your garage because your going to working on it all the time
      woah are srts really a money pit like ive seen the lmao jeep memes a lot but my 2008 wrangler has had like 0 issues besides the suspension thats my fault for flogging
  srt may be better built but grand cherokees are generally disposable cheaply made garbage zj and maybe wj excluded

ride in toyota auris   its automatic   its this shifter   i never saw anything gayer and flimsier in my life you really need to see this irl vomitinducing
looks basically the same as a 3rd gen prius shifter pure onions
  from this angle it actually looks less bad you need to see this irl   manual auris has a normal looking shifter this is just awful
  i commute in a prius same shifter quit sperging out about the shifter in the car you got a ride in busrider
  says the shifter is  autotragic  might want to get your priorities straight m8

  engine braking
dont be mad at the car be mad the designer and manufacturer respect and be kind to the car for what it is
i need help returning my old ford ranger 05 26 litre 4cylimder back in shape at first the transmission was cucked which forced us to leave on the drive way for about 8 years were finally old enough my brother and i to have a job and put some money in to the old thing where should i begin it wont start up and all the old oil is still there we changed the battery so atleast some lights in the car are on but it wont turn on and everytime we turn the key it all shuts off
put a breaker bar on the crank pulley and see if it turns it should sounds like starter solenoid is seized hit it with a hammer a bunch while trying to crank it
  is there a video where this is done i dont know what that is in the car
  m8 you gotta google a bit with this stuff if you read a term you dont recognize figure out what it means i would also invest in a haynes manual for the truck   crank pulley is the big pulley on the bottom of the serpentine belt maze its connected to the engine crankshaft starter motor is underneath the truck sitting against the flywheel where the engine and transmission mate up whapping it isnt a guaranteed fix but its free
anyone here ever bypassed a rev limiter on a bike can there be adverse effects i like to keep bikes stock but im curious what my cb1100 can do without the limiter
do you even understand what its there for
  this nigga a fucking retard im surprised you havent killed yourself yet
its not a speed limiter you retard its to keep the engine from blowing up shit can only spin so fast
also if you are already hitting the limiter in top gear that is how fast you gonna go anyway the engines got no more to give
    holy shit there are actually people like you
youll get valve float at best if you disable the rev limiter    most likely youll lunch the valves and require a complete engine rebuild though
natural selection
  what my cb1100 can do without the limiter  this  
  you cb1100 is an understressed air cooled unit with a torquey cam profile and only 100hp you shouldnt mess too much with the revlimiter if you want a higher top speed find some way to disable the stupid 112mph limiter the engine isnt anywhere close to stressed at the speed limiter    the revlimiter reports 9000rpm closer to 8500 irl there are 80s and 90s cb bikes with 10k redlines and more power from the factory check if cams and heads are swappable otherwise be ready to spend big bucks on cams port and polish full exhaust and a tune
remove the limiter op the only reason its there is because of emissions testing you can unlock huge amounts of power by removing it once you remove it make sure to put your bike in neutral and hold the throttle wide open for 10 seconds that way youll be able to find out how high it can actually rev so you can remember for later good luck
tfw no cb1100  feels bad man
  limiter is there for several reasons chief among them allowing the bike to reach an acceptable mileage and becuase after a certain point in the rev range the engine cant pull any more air in due to cam and flow inefficiencies and you lose power     the only reason to remove it is if youve already done the necessary work to the engine to pull in more air above where the rev limit cuts out
  this  engines are usually tuned so that by rev limiter theyre pretty much spent
  your engine counterweights will spin too fast become unbalanced and fuck the engine up
  wont do more you cuck just get pc and full system in you want an 10hp gain
  lmao what  how do physics work in your head
for all the riders out there whats your opinion on the street lineup
made in india
like a harley but worse    if you want a cruiser go jap
i rode a street 750 and aside from the initial heueuhehgh muh tork its a pretty lame bike i had a gs500f at the time and was really disappointed with everything except the torque in the low end very few modern features with a very modern price tag i do like the way they look though
  indian 3
  if you want a cruiser go jap
i think harleys are underpowered and over priced especially the 750  japs make good liquid cooled cruisers    
  hes not wrong
  youre probably better off buying a honda if you want a 750 vtwin shadows are actually pretty nice
  harleys are the same and sometimes cheaper than jap bikes in their class you can literally just compare prices
  hur dur tough america  made in india with sub par components    i know lets talk about screaming eagles and shit and ask a premium price
  all us sold harleys are built in the us
  with chinese and indian parts motor is made in fucking india
  incorrect the engine for the street models is made in kansas city mo
the street rod looks cool seems a little under powered compared to my bike i wouldnt mind havingone in my garage desu
rode a friends street rod coming from a 98 honda nighthawk 750    motor is lame sure but its a harley everyone kinda saw that coming revs better than a sportster i guess very linear power delivery just didnt feel like very much power at all    ergonomics are fucking terrible at a glance it looks like a shrunken xr1200 but hd fucked everything up handlebars are silly low pegs are not quite rear sets not quite mids and youd have to be 51 to enjoy how close to the seat they are shit buttons and switches too    my 20 year old honda outhandles it thats all im going to say about that    all said really underwhelming bike im curious if these things are cheap overseas like do the ones sold overseas make financial sense cause this is not anywhere near worth the 10k hd wants here in the us
  and youd have to be 51 to enjoy how close to the seat they are  i mean they were marketed as starter bikes for women
    so basically a new sportster
better if it was a different brand harley davidson makes people look like fair weather posers
  id rather something good
  paying the harley boomer tax  lol no
can someone explain why ford f150 and trucks in general are so popular in america is there a somesort of tax loophole that makes owning a truck cheaper in long term than a regular car i mean they must be more expensive to buy get worse mpgs and are less practical in cities due to larger size than a normal car
theyre practical its not much more expensive to buy or operate
two f150s can pass by eachother with space to spare on your average american highway    parking spots fit a dually with 1 extra on either side    you are talking about a different world anon
  trucks cost more to maintain but generally last longer than cars an f150 gets the same mileage as a taurus or crossover so the mpgs are irrelevant its also the same size as your average sedan or crossover see pic related so staceys can park them especially with the 5 cameras on the outside also keep in mind most trucks are leased so thats how so many people can drive a 60k truck
  space isnt a concern  fuel price isnt a concern  at 40k you get a comfortable highway cruiser with 4wd and tons of space inside with the option of being able to haul anything
  an f150 gets the same mileage as a taurus or crossover so the mpgs are irrelevant  in your fucking dreams  its also the same size as your average sedan or crossover  in your fucking dreams    retard
  before we start the shitstorm where do you live
  what difference does it make for size or fuel consumption does spacetime ripple between countries
  our cities are bigger and have more space for cars generally than european cities
  were just trying to figure if you ride the bus or take the tram
  because in civilized places the extra 20 a month if that it takes to refuel a truck over a sedan is irrelevant the extra inch over a small sedan is also not an issue most places    you dont need to answer because i can narrow down your location to a few places just by your attitude
        okay makes sense
  in other words youre trying to derail a topical argument into insults based on personal background you dipshit get fucked
  are you fucking daft the extra inch over a small sedan pickup trucks are at least three feet longer than any common sedans
  im guessing either ca or nyc you seem like a cuck but not quite europe cucked though i may be wrong
the average parking space width in texas is between 859ft or around 275 meters
  ahhh british nailed it    three feet longer than any common sedans    a common sedan for you guys is a 4 door fiat 500 thats why i asked where you were from
  a taurus is 202x76 inches lengthxwidth  a regular cab f150 is 209x79
some of us use them i loved my beater focus but having space for only one vehicle and moving to a northern part of the country where its snow covered 5 months of the year it just makes sense     i haul my motorcycle without a trailer use it for camping and outdoor activities such as hauling my kayaks and enjoy the real world 25mpg i get on the freeway and 19 in town thats pretty close to an older awd suv or crossover thanks for the 27 v6 ford     also i paid 33000 for mine dont know why everyone assumes they are all 60000 they range in price from 2500075000
  like other anons said our roads are plenty big enough and gas isnt too expensive also practical       but they are also just cool to certain crowds boomers and blue collar folk buy them to fit in with their friends cletus wouldnt be caught dead in a fiesta or corolla
  maybe you should look up units of length sometime because you clearly havent learnt anything about them in school if you think an inch is three feet long
  a taurus isnt a small sedan in fact its one of the largest sedans you can buy and a regular cab f150 entails a cab for two people and a bed thats too short for basic building supplies youre comparing apples and bacon
  a regular cab f150 is 209x79     2437in for a crew cab 4 door    thats 3 feet more
  i mean definitely agree with you all around but 33000 is still a lot you can get a fairly reliable shitbox for around 1015k new which fills most peoples needs most of the time    that being said if you make decent money why not
  nobody buys single cab f150s anymore
  the improved resale value of trucks is very attractive when most buyers finance their new vehicle purchase for 4 years    the operating cost isnt hugely different
  funny thing is i wanted something smaller i could not justify a tacoma or colorado/canyon because they are not that much smaller have worse mpg overall capabilities are pathetic the cab even in 4 door is smaller than my extended and they cost the same if not more     the frontier is just fucking ancient well priced but ancient     hopefully the new ranger cleans up the small truck segment
  somebody in the market for a crew cab pickup isnt going to be cross shopping small sedans like a civic      33k these days gets you dick all thats like a 180hp tiny crossover just like before somebody in the market for a new truck isnt going to be cross shopping used shitboxes
one word  safety the iihs can give little cuckboxes a five star rating based on weight class but anyone with a brain knows that the game is about whos bigger and heavier and right now everyone is in an arms race with each other for whos biggest
  that was the original argument though i quote  its also the same size as your average sedan  the extra inch over a small sedan is also not an issue most places
  the operating cost isnt hugely different  compared to what
  exactly gm doesnt even sell em anymore
  not that poster but i actually somewhat agree     with exception of tires and brakes and other wearable items they are pretty hardy and low cost in the 1/2 ton segment 150/1500     ford dealer charges me 28 for oil filter and oil change on the 27 ecoboost thats the same price they charged me for my 2014 20 focus the service intervals if you stick to them are longer on the trucks than the small sedans one could argue the increase in wearable items is irrelevant since good truck tires last double what you are going to get out of a sedan same goes for brakes and other wearable items     id say its a wash this is talking about the 1/2 ton start getting into the heavy duties and diesels and we are obviously more costly
  and thats why even though in theory freedoms are great and all in reality people are fucking retards that need to be protected not only from themselves but more importantly from others
  what about fuel though getting a truckbarge over a mid sized something can easily raise your annual fuel bills by up to 50 and thisll end up costing the average driver an extra thousand dollars every year
    are you saying the government should step in and stop people from buying bigger and bigger cars
  a new camry an average sedan is marginally smaller than an f150 how is that so hard to understand just look at this pic ffs  notice how that jetta is pretty much the same legenth as the f150 beside it notice how the corolla is barely smaller than the crew cab silverado beside it    this is why i asked where youre from though its painfully obvious that youre european just based on your size comprehension
  whats a grand a year for the ability to tow and haul shit    are you retarded
  when you make 82k a year thats not much in the grand scheme of things even accounting for your inflated numbers
  gas is cheap
practical  yet nobody says one practical thing    the reason why they buy them is because its a status symbol and image building euros buy different cars for these things americans want to believe they are lean mean cowboys so they have to have a pickup
  getting a truckbarge over a mid sized something can easily raise your annual fuel bills by up to 50    lol no i hate to break it to you but crossovers dont get the 40 mgp they claim in reality its closer to 20 which is the same as a truck
  a van does that better    a van is actually practical trucks not so much
jeebus   taurus is 202 long  accord is 192  camry is 192 long  charger is about 200 long  7 series is over 200 long  an f1fiddy supercrew is 230    about 2 or 3 feet longer that really doesnt matter though as american cars used to be huge so most areas are built for it
  depends on what a midsized gets i average 2123mpg depending on what kind of driving im doing on that tank the capability is far greater than any mid sized sedans can we be real awd crossovers and suvs which are somewhat closer in capability for the average user are around 25mpg average thats a huge difference in capability for not alot of mpg difference having gone from an old 54 v8 f150 to a 2014 focus that was always 35mpg i get it but you cant compare the focus to the f150 i used it as i had a 100 mile commute now i ride my bicycle to work so having a capable vehicle i use less economically still makes sense
  how much is that grownup units
i switched to a v8 pickup from a modern v6 luxury crossover and the fuel difference isnt that much partly because i dont need to buy premium anymore which i realize now is a scam
  are you completely fucking dense    jetta  185 inches    camry  192 inches    f150  209  251 inches thats anywhere between 15 and 6 feet longer than a current camry or 2 to 65 feet longer than a current jetta    not to mention how much wider trucks are jetta with mirrors is as wide as a full size truck without mirrors
  no ability to haul heavy weight with a trailer hitch sweetie
  sorry we cant explain it to you without freedom measurement license
  and who makes 82k
  i get about 20mpg on 4x4 27eco but tank is 32gallons so it works out  we were getting similar mpg with rav4 and sienna so i dont really see the problem with trucks
  like what what in your life is so big and heavy that only a truck can tow it definitely not your fucking lawn cuttings or lawn mower so what is it your wife
  crossovers mostly use engines designed for sedans
  oh does the poor little baby need base 10 because he still could ts on his wittle fingers    for euro trash dont worry you will never be able to afford anything much more than 2 meters in lenght    if you are an aussie shit poster you know damn well its about 54 wallywoos
  it blows your mind people make more money than you and buy what they want doesnt it
  yea that was oddly specific     f150 owner this was my last paystub at my primary job since we are being oddly specific
  average income of a f150 buyer
  are you telling me that every truck owner in the us also has a house sized camper trailer
  and you got the v6 here i thought truck buyers were retarded
  im sure it is only rich people buy pickup trucks because theyre they only ones smart enough for the realization
  american pick ups are rated for smaller trailers than vans
  a ccsb is not much bigger than the average sedan in the real world cherry pick all the measurements you want      chad who got paid to go to trade school      rv boat snowmobiles you know fun toys actually youre european so you wouldnt know and no you cant fucking tow these safely with a fucking car so dont show me some grey fucking euro trailer filled with 500lbs of firewood
  4 million rvs were sold last year i think it was over and a shit ton of boats 4wheelers and every sort of work and play trailer you can imagine we have 330 million people 15 million or so pickups really isint that big of a deal
  seriously its like this dude has never heard of dirt bikes atvs snowmobiles jetskis    you know man toys    hell ever have to move to a new house or apartment that truck is all of a sudden real fucking practical
  325 horse 400lbs torque 4x4 with that 20mpg average the 27 was the practical choice nothing wrong with the v6 the 50 could be had in cheaper packages did not do it for me
  in the real world  what real world is that the one where you expertly eyeball complete bullshit because youre a fucking moron instead of accepting the proof of actual numbers
  go look up a 5th wheel rating sweetie its alot
  not everybody but a fucking lot do there are hundreds of storage lots like these and theyre always packed      not in america we dont tow shit like you it boggles my mind how such a car safety cucked nation goes out and tows shit improperly like you people
  cant afford hot dip galvanizing on the simplest of things  boohoo those euros and their grey trailers why dont they just paint bare steel black like us superior americans do so it can rust away within ten years  also even americans have come to the realization that you dont need a retard barge to tow an atv or snowmobile
  thats a strong blanket statement show proof show me a 1/2 ton equavilant van that can tow up to 12000lbs if packaged appropritliately
  rvs are tacky as fuck    youre probably a boomer doing 20 km/h on your yamaha gaystroke you wouldnt last with me for 5 minutes on finnish trails    i keep my boat in the sea reel in for the winter and a van is more practical anyway its okay to buy pickups for status symbols and image reasons but ffs dont say they are practical
  that truck is all of a sudden real fucking practical  van is even more practical everything keeps dry and wont catch wind
  improperly  speak for yourselves you can lecture us on proper vehicle usage once your road death rates are lower than ours you complete fucking dickfaces until then please do continue to throw thousands of pounds of tongue weight on shitbarge trucks because youre too fucking dumb to balance your trailers properly
  hell ever have to move to a new house or apartment  yeah about once every ten years and i just rent a box truck then
  you can lecture us on proper vehicle usage once your road death rates are lower than ours    id imagine your shitholes population is less than that of a single us state where is it again
  not to argue as i somewhat think americans can tow more than they do but there is something to be said about a good domestic truck     that jetta cant tow two 1liter 600lbs wet adventure bikes at 10000 feet on dirt roads requiring 4x4 fun fact a trailer would get in the way so i just throw them in the bed or the truck cant even tell they are up there doesnt bog down at all and performance and saftey remains the same
itt spastic britbong
  listen man you are the only ones spouting off about them only being a status symbol and that they arent practical but i understand coming from someone who must live in a city because even american cities well theyre still just city boys but if you would step out your realm of comfort for a bit you would see they are used in quite the sense they are intended even in youre country i love how america is exactly what comes to mind when people think of trucks but their are trucks all over the world in other countries big and small that are very reliable work horses and every day drivers    youre only seeing the 10 because thats what catches your attention and your frail mind doesnt allow you to see anything else those people with those trucks are the reason why you have a lot of the things you have
  and you cant drive it offroad youre forgetting that
  where is it again  youd know if your education wasnt third world tier
  theres no status symbols in finland havent you heard
  so a snowscooter is 200 kgs and dirt bike 100 kgs were you planning to haul 60 dirt bikes    a dirt bike is more practical to put in a van since it wont catch wind and wont need much to tie it securely you can also leave it there overnight and its behind locked doors so nobody can mess with it      i trust our engineers more than american cowboys
  that jetta cant tow two 1liter 600lbs wet adventure bikes at 10000 feet on dirt roads requiring 4x4  have you considered riding your adventure bikes on those roads or do you just tow them around to show them off
hes from finland
  am i supposed to assume every retard itt is an angry finn     are you ashamed of where youre from or something
  this is great so now youre spouting off about how much weight you dont haul
  it does its going from mexico to alaska in july
  what is per capita stats  t burger with republican education    eu is bigger than usa
  no but ive learnt from past shitflinging threads on various occasions and topics that any personal information will not serve an argumentative purpose only offtopic insults
  i still gotta move it in the winter and this is where i live plus there are times where staging and setting up camp is nice not every ride is a long way down documentary
  uhh try not living in a flat fucking wasteland that shit wont work in the mountains hence why it works in europe a car wont make it up the logging roads to the good trailheads here thats in the summer its just not happening in winter after a 15 snow dump      im a tent guy so theyre not my cup of monster but a lot of people like them and thats fine you dont even have mountains in finnstan so dont talk to me about trails      what is a canopy
  there are no mountains in europe  also  buying a truck to then turn it into a really shitty van
      someone in floofland likes fords you couldnt see yourself in the drivers seat
  those people with those trucks are the reason why you have a lot of the things you have  americans fought with the communists against our democracy so whatever they did they mos def arent the reason for anything we have    im from a farm buy what you want i dont care i buy feel good stuff too and shit for bravado but i dont go full retard and say that stuff is practical
  huh dont follow
  so youre moving between offroad cabins
   you really havent gone into how its so unpractical
  you couldnt see yourself in the drivers seat  i would if there was any fucking point to it
  blackbullpower  holy fucking shit you literally cannot make this up the absolute state of eurocucks
  i mean not that poster but this is the first home in 10 years ive lived in that has a road that goes to it some of us legit live in the mountains
  vans are low youd drag any kind of construction site and yes we have plenty of vans over here also plumbers electricians you name it uses vans also you really just have no idea
  sort of yes because 6000kg is something i can easily let someone else haul because its such rare occasion and doesnt justify the extra money spend on a truck through gasoline insurance and the price of the car
  weird because we have vans in the company and never have any issue on construction sites because they have roads leading to them who the fuck builds shit in the middle of fucking nowhere with only 50 miles of mud leading to it
  i can assure you we have more demanding sno enduro trails and we are better behind the bar than american fattballs
  shitty van    show me a new 4x4 van with ground clearance and a 400hp v8 ill wait     oh and theres also not looking like a rapist which is nice       outside of the city theres definitely driveways that require a 4x4 vehicle ive been on some that take 5 minutes to drive up from the road to the work site you arent getting a fwd or rwd up them safely
  someone is butthurt funny story insurance for my truck is the same as my shitbox 250 every 6 months
  its called pioneering
  oh and theres also not looking like a rapist which is nice  americans sure are obsessed with image for how much they stress theyre individualists
  who the fuck builds shit in the middle of fucking nowhere with only 50 miles of mud leading to it    people that like privacy and lots of land
  its prohibitively expensive for you anyway because of your situation and government it was never an option to begin with     you use chainsaws to cut timber lol
  overpriced bad on roads bad for transporting stuff bad for transporting bikes you cant put your cargo behind locked doors poor mileage    if youre a logger or eath mover then things are different in those cases pickups are better because you lift your buckets and fuel containers on and off the bed with your machinery     but in 99 of cases vans are more practical vans dont look as good as pickups but they definitely are more practical
  thing is i can and i will dont be jealous that you cant own a capable truck that is more comfortable than a sedan and makes for a great dd
  europoors can only build stuff if theres a paved road next to the construction site  europoors dont have any land anyways so they only have to walk 2 cucklometers for an empty 1 square cucklometer plot
  the actual construction site brainlet or is already paved by the time you get there    for you and you havent heard of tax breaks have you  vague hyperbolic opinion  what are aluminum ramps  get a camper or trailer or dont live in niggerville finland  not anymore grampa
  its prohibitively expensive for you anyway because of your situation and government it was never an option to begin with  its not    you use chainsaws to cut timber lol  yeah i know you cant drive a snowscooter fast
  see as someone who has not written you off completely you have to recognize something about the usa vans are fucking expensive a comparable 4x4 van with the same capability of my f150 would be double the price     its regional differences but try finding a 4x4 van with clearance decent cargo space and power and your looking at a sprinter in the 60000 range
  do all construction sites immediately turn into mud pits in your country
  sure youre allowed to have hobbies but dont claim its practical or the cheapest choice    dont be jealous   very touchy and defensive attitude    comfortable than a sedan  but its not ive driven both
  hurr country with 3m cars shouldnt be safer than one with 263m  hurr country that averages 14k km a year is at same risk as country that averages 14k miles a year  just look at that the stats goys      im more interested in numbers than shit flinging
  what part of per mile driven dont you understand you fucking pea brain
  american cars used to be huge so most areas are built for it  a lot of parking lots have shrunk their spaces they still leave some spaces for the bigger cars available at the outer edges of the lot but many spaces are not only shorter but are not as wide decades ago the driving aisle is also narrower     one parking garage i use has almost all the spaces marked compact only those are the regular spaces and there are some of the larger spaces available for the bigger cars when a truck or full size sedan parks in the regular spaces opening the doors to the first detent will come close to hitting the car next to it
  thats funny i drive a log truck now go suck on more salty coin licorice and show us some more pictures of your stabby knife collection i know all you fins have     does rain not make dirt wet where you are
  you cant even own cars in your shithole lmao stay mad eurocuck
  no      sure is nice living in the first world and not having to worry about theft like that try sneaking into a campsite and stealing somebodys dirt bike if you wake up a bunch of drunk hunters theyll skin you alive and feed you to the bears    a van can only be used for work while a pickup can be used for work and play vans are impractical for anything but work which is why theyre generally only used as trade company vehicles if you need a personal vehicle to haul your tools to the jobsite then a truck with a canopy is more practical
  what are ramps  trailer  niggerville t mutt  american republicans are classic example of dunningkruger effect
  what is sample size  what is 1/10 of 1    thanks brainlet
  sure but dirt requires active digging over to turn into mud especially once vehicles have driven on it and compacted it does this look like itll turn into a mud pit as soon as some rain falls on it
  what sample size are you talking about now are you saying that federal road fatality statistics leave out 99 of deaths and then extrapolate
  vans are fucking expensive  thats possible but americans refuse to recognize the rest of the world    economics of scale come to play at some so preferences can shift prices also usa doesnt factor in the costs of co2 emissions to gasoline which supports pick up trucks on raw practicality i still see vans being more practical and people are allowed to have hobbies and fun stuff but americans are begging for flak with insisting pickups being practical
  you i kinda feel like i should gotten 50 but early torque is nice you thinking of getting a tune
    still havent made a strong case for a van one of your typical euro vans that is
  love those shit eating graphs that paint one bar three times longer than the other for a 5 difference
  no  classic american 400 meter straight line hot rodding with 3 metre long track  yeah americans dont even know what they are talking about
  t 9726 iq
  naw just maintaining it and probably giving it to my father in a year or two its a 2018 so itll just be broken in waiting on a potential raptor ranger if one comes out ill be first in line this is just a utility vehicle until then
  135 though its been tested in therapy
  therapy  ahahahahahahahaha what a tremendous faggot
  yet no social skills or empathy at all strange
  theres a big difference between ground thats been built on for 1000s of years and ground thats been disturbed for the first time by humans the later turns into soup with rain or snow and the driveway and landscaping is usually done last      there are more miles of sno enduro trails in the us and canada then there are roads and trails in finland
  that old barko  yikes
    looking at that drain we can see that it is fresh uncompacted substrate    also that trucks tire came off    that said though construction on that scale in the us people who use pickups just use them for people transport    a 3 foot excavator bucket would put an f150 on its bumpstops and still load an extra thousand pounds into the rubber stops
  you know ranger raptor not coming to us i am waiting for new bronco svt
  no but some european roads are over 1000 years old you can see it especially in really old greek and italian cities  when people discovered america they built roads for those horse box stuff cant speak english sorry so roads are much wider in the us and for the gas prices well gas is much cleaner and cheaper in the usa
all this yurosperging about practicality and cargo vans  practicality is a secondary concern to most american car buyers stay mad murikans have options because they dont get taxed into oblivion for anything that isnt povertytier      in the usa crew cab pickups and to a lesser extent larger/truckbased suvs have replaced the landbarge sedans of old     in the past suspension tech for trucks limited their ride comfort compared to a large sedan this is no longer the case and a truck is roomier inside easier to get into offers a more comfortable seating position and is easier to see out of especially compared to todays sedans jesus christ    tldr because comfy
  this an f150 crew cab is like 3 feet longer than any momdriven suv
  two f150s can pass by eachother with space to spare on your average american highway  youd want to fucking hope so any vehicle should be able to pass each other on the highway except for maybe two oversized bdoubles
  the same size as your average sedan  are we talking about a 1976 buick    most get crew cab trucks and those are about 20 long
  the f150 crew cab is 20 long the rav4 is 15
  as someone who has ddd a truck all my adult life    reliable even if the interior squeaks the running gear is built to take a lot more abuse than the average passenger car  parts are cheap and easy to find  they are simpler and easier to work on than comparable passenger cars  more leg room than any car ever  massive windows    plus all the utility theres a lot more home/landowners in the us and canada than anywhere else so people here actually use them for truck stuff even if its only occasional
  the bulk of their sales are base model commercial fleet trucks
running gear beat to take more abuse    funny way to say american cars are shit piles so the trucks seem good by comparison
      what utility is offered by a pickup that a large suv or sizeable crossover/ van doesnt besides hauling tons of literal dirt in the back of the bed    plz no bully
it was cheap and i can abuse it while working on the farm and it will be cheap to repair
  uss retarded laws make cheap light trucks prohibitively expensive for what they are so people have turned from owning a car plus a barebones small truck to do hauling to just owning one big luxurized truck that does both for not much more
  this
  have you actually ever towed anything sizable like ever
  moms drive tahoes      for the average suburbanite the pickup is used for trips to the hardware store and hauling kid stuff  its easier to put 2x4x8 in a pickup  easier to get bulk mulch or bags of mulch  easier to put the kids mountain bike in  easier to put kayaks in vs on the roof    with an open bed you just throw stuff in and take it out hose it out when you are finished its easy    what do you lose a trivial amount of mpg handling which very very few americans care about and if they do they have multiple vehicles    t former truck owner now have suv and use a utility trailer
  you have an open bed not a limited closed interior space let your imagination run wild
    thats just what you tell yourself to cope fleet sales at best account for 25 of sales for ford so even accounting for that it still puts it in the top selling vehicle now wheres your god
  imagine the thought process going through someones head that makes them buy a 5500 lbs pickup truck because  god forbid  theyd have to put the kayak on the roof otherwise
  were do you put the other one or two kayaks you would have three or four you the wife and one or two kids
  have you considered that people with 911s dont have children have you considered that people with children drive other cars are you seriously defending driving a 5500 lbs shitbarge so you can move a few 20 lbs kayaks a little easier five times a year are you aware of how idiotic this sounds when did americans become so stupid lazy and entitled
    2x4x8    no where else in the world does anyone use such babby lumber
    sorry i meant to say in the same lane
    the running gear is built to take a lot more abuse than the average passenger car    loading it to spec is abuse
all these seething europoors and soibois itt  kek
  have you considered that people with 911s dont have children  yes and people with them have children and pickups and most suburbanites with pickups have children  have you considered that people with children drive other cars  yes they usually have a few i have 1 kid and a wife we have 5 cars most of our friends have multiple cars and one is often a pickup  are you seriously defending driving a 5500 lbs shitbarge so you can move a few 20 lbs kayaks a little easier five times a year  its more than 5 it can be quite often why are you so opposed to people being allowed to buy a vehicle they feel best fits their needs why do you want to make choices for people  also i said it would do more than move kayaks why are you ignoring that    when did americans become so stupid lazy and entitled  when we gave the world freedom and put a car on the moon   for an ameican white collar family a 40k pickupeven less if you shop used isnt much when your household income is 300k or so do they not have grapes in your commie country    id say the only great harm is co2 emissions if he pickup is used as a daily driver for longer commutes
  i have 1 kid and a wife we have 5 cars  peak burgertism
when we gave the world freedom  when your household income is 300k or so  fucking delusional the average american earns 50k is in debt and all youve done to the world is force your hegemony on it for your own benefit none of it has anything to do with freedom
  one of them is a six thousand pound suv that has never gone off road and probably never will unless my wife hops a curb at the mall    it also at very best gets 18mpg on the highway sometimes single digits around town
  sweetie average means everyone not exclusively those actually working or with a job
    combined with that your load area is also isolated from your cab
  sweetie average means everyone not exclusively those actually working or with a job
  do you a 911 to go get groceries
  are you saying your weekly or even biweekly groceries wouldnt fit in a 911
  europeans sure are obsessed with americans
i had a dodge ram 1500 when i lived in dallas had no issues with its size driving around the city or fitting into parking slots that got rearended and totaled out so i got a chevy silverado 2500hd the chevy is much taller and just feels a lot bigger than the dodge did i actually did have some trouble driving it around the city and parking it in tight spaces luckily about a month after i got the 3/4 ton chevy i moved back to my rural hometown and dont have to drive on congested city streets or parallel park it very often i wouldnt dream of towing a camper like this with the 1/2 ton pickup either
  when i go hunting ill throw the dead bloody deer or hog straight into the bed of my pickup truck and haul it back to camp where i process the animal    also you can easily haul oversized objects and appliances like a full size refrigerator or chest freezer in the bed of a pickup truck i can drive my motorcycle straight into the bed of the truck and strap it down if i need to haul it somewhere instead of using a trailer
  why are you so obsessed with vans they arent more practical on averagethey are more of a niche vehicle for plumbers and delivery drivers  trucks can haul all kinds of dirty stuff and its much easier to load i can stand up and load cargo that is 6ft and throw stuff over the siderails easy hell i just took 3 trees worth of leaves to the dump in one trip in my 8ft box theres no way i could have crammed them into a stupid van and it would be foolish because they started to mold quickly i did see some spics using an old van and they had  50 bags of leaves took way more time to load and unload it where i would load a 8x4 ft tarp taco every few minutes  remember this euro we actually have land acerage and all the maintenance that goes with it america is larger than you can comprehend
  and i almost forgot about being able to haul gasoline cans or propane tanks without making your car stink of gas fumes or risk a very unlikely propane gas leak in your enclosed vehicle that goes for anything that has a small gas engine like chainsaws weed eaters lawn mowers generators etc too because those things always leak some gas / oil out of them
  trucks make sense to home owners and people with diy hobbies that involve more than what a typical van can handle suvs with that kind of space and tow capacity are more expensive f150 is just one popular model frankly too expensive for what you get ram or nissan trucks are cheaper and just as fit for the task
  nissan trucks are actual literal shit
  yeah you can get a tax break / government subsidy if you list them as farm equipment in some situations
  used trucks are cheap and gas is cheaper if you have uses for a truck there isnt any major downside in owning one unless you live in a place like new york city
  theyll fit but what the fuck is the point of a car that fast when you drive at the speed limit to the grocery store are you taking every turn at 100mph with it is it worth having your teeth and bones rattled out    i dont get how people say trucks are useless then go and recommend a small sports car to daily drive
  and one more thing you can actually write them off as a business expense if you run a business thats why denalis king ranch and other 80k trims exist its fucking genius
  well you can technically do that with any leased vehicle as long as you own a business the truck will actually make you money tho unlike something like a 7 series
because a shitbox van couldnt haul my fucking trailers if it tried
  what is e350 powerstroke
  very hard to find vans are fucking horrible to drive they feel bigger than they are and rattle like shit not remotely comparable to a pickup that feels like a big car
because you can haul couches in them the fastest way to get laid is helping a woman move a couch
  pickup truck the same dimensions as a van but riding even higher and more wobbly somehow feels like a car
  vans flex like a motherfucker compared to a pickup that needs to be safe and shit a van is designed to drive like a van and a modern truck is designed to drive like a car try it sometime
  the chad ford ranger vs the virgin van
  not a thing anymore not as comfortable as my lariat 250 doesnt have the same seating capacity all around not as good my truck just works thats why ive got two 250s and two 150s
  mate a transit could pull those
  lol no
  this is a comfy picture
  are they filled with lead coated bricks
  we dont use little shitty plastic trailers here in america a pickup with an empty trailer here would require a commercial drivers license in europe
  rainy day  lmao just throw it in the truck
  theres no such thing as commercial or noncommercial licenses in europe theres only different weight classes the commercial aspect comes from what driving is done a transit van can be as much a commercial vehicle as a semi truck combination
  why didnt you just get 1 850
  well regardless you wouldnt be able to drive an american sized unloaded truck and trailer with a normal licence in europe tldr shit is a lot heavier here inb4 hurr the people too
  my truck just works thats why i have four of them  usually people have four of something because three of them are constantly broken
  but the original shown trailers are perfectly towable with a transit the truck larp trailer is pointless outside of larping as a trucker and wont see work like gay brotrucks
  multiple crews
  the big red one is 24 ft with 12000 lbs axles and a crossmember every 12 inches a damn transit could not pull it not empty not loaded
  so you think a transit cant pull an enclosed car transporter because the other 2 are effectively a horse float and a tandem axle car trailer nothing spectacular
  are you inbred
  or you could be attractive and not a faggot
  couldnt pull the other red trailer either and with the weight that ive put on the flatbed before i know a transit couldnt pull it a truck is just better suited for these kinds of things
  those trailers weight a lot more than you think that black one is probably 2000lbs easy      a little ironic coming from a brit no
  i just checked fords website and it looks like the highest towing capacity available with any of the transit vans is only 7500 lbs im not the guy youre arguing with but i regularly haul 10k12k lbs on a dump trailer and 8k lbs of equipment on a 16ft trailer those are bumper pull trailers my friends mom has a 1 ton dually and hauls a monster 14k pound fully loaded gooseneck horse trailer with living quarters to rodeos multiple times a month
  t guy who needs someone to move his couch for him
transit can tow 7500 lbs  f150 can tow 13200 lbs  f250 can pull 25700 lbs  there is no comparison
  not true  gm and dodge just dont have offerings for their single cab trucks on their website yet dodge is waiting to switch production of their regular cab 1500s from saltillo mexico to their sterling heights plant where the crew cabs are already being produced i dont know gms situation but their media pages say theyre releasing their regular cabs later in the year along with the smaller 30 l duramax diesel
  well the single cab is pretty stupid theres no interior storage room and you cant recline your seat even most company fleet trucks are double or crew cabs because theyre more convenient
  ive always had either extended cab or crew cab trucks several of my friends had single cab pickups and i agree they suck theres no room to store anything except for the bed which isnt secure at all i almost bought a single cab pickup once but im glad i came to my senses and got the extended cab instead
cant do this with a car without using a trailer
  older cheaper trucks are the true red pill  some one screenshot this
  or this
  or this
  or this       i put too much damn money into this truck but itll last me a long time i dont want to get rid of it either if the engine blows again i will likely swap in a diesel of some sort perhaps the baby powerstroke for giggles and flat deck it
  mods are a nigger to work on but they last forever dont make em like they used too
  did that with a 2016 toyota sienna
  you could probably pull a flat bottom aluminum boat with a sienna maybe even a bass boat you wont pull a big boat like in that picture with one though
  also cant drive through multiple inches or sometimes feet of snow if you have no ground clearance
  pulling 3 ft / towing it hundreds of kms up and down hills that are 2 or more km long   its a late 70s 24ft kc thermoglass fiberglass boat it likely weighs just as much if not more than your sienna
  its also quite difficult to show the world just how autistic you are with a car       thats just the boat without fuel people or the trailer
  i saw this dudebro driving his new f150 home he was hauling his bitch in the passenger seat nothing else he was driving like a moron too guess he didnt get the breakin memo
owning and driving a truck is cheaper than renting one several times per year daily driving a truck is cheaper than buying and owning a truck in addition to whatever tiny shitbox you want to get 35mpg trucks are nice to drive comfy for cruising and have good image
  yeah think about that the next time you decide to skip the depreciation and buy used      a truck with something fun and light for the city is the peak garage
  why do euros always say this    it depends on what youre hauling if youre an electrician it makes sense since you need your gear to be protected from the weather but if you do pool maintenance youll want a truck so you dont have to breath in the chemicals and can replace just the bed instead of the whole vehicle when it inevitably rusts out   trucks also have the benefit of being able to carry taller loads heavier trailers and are easier to load with machines
  americans are just retarded and have been (((fooled))) into thinking bigger is better and that they need trucks
  because its the best way to disguise your homosexuality from your friends and neighbors
          keep flexing on the euros
  the euros do not understand north american culture and just how large our land is you can drive for hours and not see a single person let alone a house or a city that is simply why pickups in north america are as large and luxerious as they are why would i buy a luxury car for 120000 when i can buy a 2019 ford f450 limited with a 67l powerstroke for 103000 cad so like 2532 us probably get more features and still throw a camper on the back and haul my boat
  so when you actually going to tow something big that you actually needed the truck for
    theyre just mad because they know if they had an f150 they would be forced by momma merkel to truck in some more africans so they could experience further cultural enrichment
  see    
  a boat on a tandem axle and bails on a 2 place sled trailer i am so impressed
  i would hope not
  why would i buy a luxury car for 120000 when i can buy a 2019 ford f450 limited with a 67l powerstroke for 103000 cad so like 2532 us probably get more features  thats a dipshit comparison spend some time in a true luxury car even the highest trim pickup sucks ass inside in comparison the features a truck may have over a luxury car will only be utility realated     trucks are great but they are not luxury cars not as comfy as a good car not as sporty as a sports car
why are euros so butthurt about americans being able to drive whatever they want is it because owning a big v8 truck is prohibitively expensive for you with the crazy displacement taxes and fuel prices and the only work vehicle you can afford is a shitty underpowered 19 tdi van with no offroad ability instead of being jealous of americans having choices maybe you should lobby your government to repeal displacement taxes and stop taxing fuel so much
  full size pick up  tons of space inside  not even the megacab ram has a ton of space inside ford and chevy full size suv are superior to fullsize truck for inside space
  i dont know of any 4wd vans that can tow 5 to 8 thousand pounds and still get better fuel economy than an f150 the ford transit 150 maxes out at around 5500 pounds towing capacity and they rarely have 4wd besides the transit is not nearly as ass attractive as an f150 unless you where living out of it
why do americans pretend they can go motocrossing or snowscootering in any meaningful way
  its because your dodge was a half ton while your silverado is a threequarterton
  well yeah i know the 3/4 ton pickup is bigger than the 1/2 ton but theyre both full sized pickup trucks and in terms of actual dimensions the silverado isnt that much bigger than the dodge subjectively the silverado just feels a lot bigger to me while im driving it especially when it comes to crowded narrow city streets and parking lots i just didnt expect the difference in driving experience to be so large
  i turned my truck into a van because i dont wanna look uncool even though a van would be way more effective    outside of the city theres definitely driveways that require a 4x4 vehicle ive been on some that take 5 minutes to drive up from the road to the work site you arent getting a fwd or rwd up them safely  yeah a lot of those mountain guys own trucks but i also see their driveways filled with shitbox jettas and honda civics they smash up those roads just fine
  throw it in the truck and weigh down a tarp with some rocks is faster then shove it in a van especially if youre by yourself
  isnt a truck just a big heavy/strong motor vehicle with an open bed  isnt a transit or other large van just a big heavy/strong motor vehiccle with an enclosed bed
the seething yuros xddd
  because i dont wanna look uncool  americans in a nutshell
singlecab w/ 6ft bed in the city where 1/3rd the time i only have two foot parking clearance the truck spends most of the week parked becuase i ride a bike to work or take the bus cuase i pay more to not live in the suburbs where public transport is useless and highway traffic is hell    i occasionally use the truck for long 2050mi trips to moms house or skateparks and try to carpool a buddy and regularly use it to haul furniture and wood and crap to skateparks to ride onfor a while i kept a kicker ramp back there occasionally i drive it to work if they let me know they nee help moving stuffs and before i had a job i was constantly scrapping metal and had a hauling ad on craigslist tons of buisness in the silicon valley becuase all the indians and asians drove tiny econoboxes    mexican econotruck driver  its a manual and stop and go traffic blows
  parking spots fit a dually with 1 extra on either side  this is a lie
  transit max towing capacity in the largest / strongest option is 7500 lbs    an f150 easily goes over 10000 lbs towing capacity in most configurations and 3/4 ton and 1 ton pickup trucks can hit 25k pound towing capacities with dual rear wheels and the appropriate engine/trans/rear end
  an f150 easily goes over 10000 lbs towing capacity in most configurations    well not most but it can go over 10k lbs in the right configurations at least
  a lot of middle america places have parking spots almost big enough for 24ft box trucks its pretty rediculous a lot of middle america places the only place to go is walmart pretty rediculous     i know a number of people whose lives consist of watching tv while yelling at thier kid or driving 22minutes each way to walmart
  you cant even spell ridiculous    uur opinion  wgaf
  an f150 easily goes over 10000 lbs towing capacity in most configurations and 3/4 ton and 1 ton pickup trucks can hit 25k pound towing capacities with dual rear wheels and the appropriate engine/trans/rear end  isnt this thread about using trucks as daily drivers i see old while ladys drivinggiant empty dualy trucks a lot
  useful quality post
  well yeah i have friends who own 1/2 ton pickup trucks that have never towed anything more than a jetski behind it and the most theyll ever haul in the bed is a couch once every few years they dont really need a truck of course but trucks are comparable in price fuel efficiency and ride quality to full size suvs so why not own one even if you never get close to using them to the limits of their capabilities having a vehicle with an open bed separate from the passenger space is still handy to have
  i see old while ladys drivinggiant empty dualy trucks a lot  no you dont dualies are uncommon and almost always driven by middle age white men
  instead of being jealous of americans having choices maybe you should lobby your government to repeal displacement taxes and stop taxing fuel so much  yeah id fucking love to live in american conditions theyre a gleaming beacon for a good society in the world
  eh most areas are great as long as long as you dont live in an innercity shithole a 10 minute drive outside of most innercity areas will get you to a nice area to live in and another 510 minute drive from there will get you to some nice suburbs full of large houses with 23 car garages and very low crime rates if youre poor and want to live in/near a city then youre gonna have to live in a sketchy area but this is true of a lot of countries id imagine rural areas have much lower costs of living and you can live comfortably on a modest income in a smaller town / city
banned in the eu
   see old while ladys drivinggiant empty dualy trucks a lot  a lot of grandma/grandpa age people have giant cadilliacd out dualie crew cab trucks  maybe its unhooked to their 1/4million rv trailer atm i see it a lot though
  whens the last time you were in a 100k german car its a sea of fake wood shiny black plastic and the same textured plastic you find in 15k shitboxes its a fucking joke       naw lots of old ladies and horse chicks daily them which makes it really sad when /o/ says theyre too big to daily      a lot of those snowbirds have a big ass fifth wheel that they tow with it or horses
american retards dont seem to understand that no one in europe would drive their trucks even if fuel was cheaper   europeans value different things in a car   thats why european manufacturers built masterpieces of automotive history while american peak was sticking a 10 l 180 hp beast engine into a 3 ton coffin with the handling of a boat and sticking a lot of cheap chrome on it   thats why american car industry had to be bailed out by their government   thats why they built almost nothing but shit for the last several decades   americans just lack substance as humans and that reflects on everything else in their sad thirdworld dystopia not surprising from the descendants of people who couldnt make it in the old world so they had to run awaythey are quite literally the refuse of europe
  rent free
thirdworlders are still seething
  this is so true my childhood friends were horse breeders and their parents always had the absolute most top trim tricked out dually trucks for hauling trailers horse trailer toy hauler hay trailer dump trailer you name it they had it these trucks were expensive and they just treated them like regular farm trucks they have since retired from breeding but still just stick to these massive trucks because now they are hauling luxury fifth wheel trailers to go to poker competitions and other boomery
  im not talking about ghettos you idiot im talking about the general entitled wasteful approach to life that nearly all americans display
  and why is it that europoors continue to display massive inferiority complexes and unending butthurt
  you idiot    fuck you how was i supposed to know what you meant by your vaguely worded shitpost
  so thats why you move here and buy a 70k half ton right away
  as i wrote its the refuse of european society was is and will be
  sorry eurocuck but the last men of europe died in ww1 and 2 all thats left is refuse
  spend some time in a 2019 ford f450 limited and you will realize you are completely wrong
    thats why american car industry had to be bailed out by their government    because the fuel economy of a car influences the profits per item    more americans bought and currently buy cars than euros the reason why they went under is due to mismanagement and if you still truly believe that selling the most products means bankruptcy then you really have some euro grade red mist
  i was in an f350 limited it was nice but no where in the same league as a lexus lx or ls
i dont know why you people say a f150 gets the mpgs of a crossover crossovers dont get like 12mpg in city driving they get like double that    just because an f150 can get 30mpg on highway doesnt mean its not much worse on gas because every acceleration in that heavy thing is going to eat gas like fuck    an f150 in city uses 50 more fuel than a crossover and 100 more fuel than a 4cyl compact car
  most crossovers are pigs on fuel because you need to be constantly flooring it because you have a 170hp engine trying to move 5000lbs actually any small turbo engine will chug fuel if youre always on it that only get their rated mpgs when theyre at 20 load on the highway when i drive something like a 14t i get the same mileage as my 48 v8 work van    like people have said before the difference between 15mpg in a f150 vs 25mpg in a crossover on a veeery good day is negligible its not even a 1k a year difference in fuel for something way more versatile fuel is cheap in america and we dont get taxed on bigger engines or emissions
  ive flogged the shit out of mine for many years they are with some engine exceptions like the late unlamented 42 hydrolocking turd reliable easy to work on have enormous aftermarket support are comfy and in general truck quite nicely gasoline is nearly free in uncucked states and i live where its dirt cheap barring rust wreck or fire they may be immortal as a mechanic i dont get paid to work on my own rides so i buy used fords and chevys either are fine for hauling my f150 handled having a heavy liftgate with a milling machine in the bed nicely they can carry considerably more weight than rated if you replace the soft for comfort rear springs i use urethane timbren load boosters
  buy  you mean finance
  bro it really depends where youre driving    i use 5000 of gas per year in my 4cyl accord 90 city driving i consistently get 24mpg if i cut that to 15mpg i am paying another 3000 per year in gas or another 250 per month in gas    if im making only 3k a month you can sure as fuck bet 250 or nearly 10 of my income being lost to truck gas penalty its a big deal take all the money from bills out and im basically losing 30 of my money because im putting gas in a truck instead of accord
  more like it depends where you live your gas prices are brutal really an extra 250 a month isnt a lot add up all the dumb shit you spend money on and itll be a lot more than 250 a month that 250 a month still gets you to work
me manly man me want big truk  me no feel safe in sedan big truk only no small truk    literally the only reason
  stop liking what i dont like  stop having what i cant have  you dont need it so you shouldnt be free to buy it  if i cant afford it noone can
  op only nip trucks ever do work remember that american trucks are for show only
  id like to see your tacoma haul a 2000lb fertilizer spreader with 4 tons of fertilizer in it    not that theres anything wrong with tacomas theyre great little trucks with 4wd they can get you in and out of just about anywhere and are much more manageable in the mud than a bigger truck is imo but there are some things it just cant really do
  huh 98 of fleet trucks are domestic tacos and tundras spend their entire life getting groceries or taking kids to hockey practice
  the shop i work for has a pretty good sized fleet of trucks all of them are ferds and dodge rams no import cuckery to be found
  it could though silly yanks think a vehicle can only pull what the paper says    a hilux does all this work you are showing off in my country i think your country just inflates numbers to make it seem more capable than they really are
  it is possible for a tacoma to pull 10000 lbs sure but when you inevitably rear end someone because you couldnt stop in time the insurance company is gonna cut you loose for hauling shit thats over the vehicles rated capacity and youll be stuck paying for everything you wrecked out of pocket and might even face criminal negligence charges if you kill someone pulling 10k lbs on a bumper pull trailer in a 3/4 ton pickup truck isnt a very fun experience i cant imagine doing that regularly with a midsized pickup truck
consider just how many people live in areas with winter climates and it will be easy to understand why so many people opt with for a large 4x4 vehicle with a lot of clearance
  anything can tow anything when youre stuck in 5mph traffic like europe its a little different when you have to move that load at american highway speeds with the hills and mountain highways we have here our 400hp and 400 lb/ft trucks are working at full power to tow our loads how well do you think a 100hp hilux will do          a lot of rural acreages and such require a 4x4 in winter because they dont plow the roads ive been up some steep as fuck driveways that definitely require a 4x4
  or you could drive an f150 and get 22mpg average mixed driving
      taking the bait
  my friends house has a about a 1000ft driveway and the first part is so steep that you need 4wd its paved
  paved  4wd    your friend is a moron
  truck owner that agrees its called proper tires i love my truck but honest my shitbox fwd with studded snow tires was just as good if not better at slick driving without awd i cant run 4x4 except in extreme circumstances a 4x4 truck is shit on paved roads with ice a fwd cuck box or awd wagon with studded tires is prime
  i drive my 79 f150 in the winter because i dont want my 83 rx7 turning into a rust bucket over night
eurocucks have no national pride    we also fucking love to drive monsters that know no bounds instead of those things you consider personal transport
  currently looking for one of these lol    gonna make it a camper in the back and do a nice straight axle swap
  well youre obsessed with muslim dick eurocuck
  were not entitled you commie fuck  we actually hate socialism and dont constantly bitch about the government not giving us free gibs  unlike you eurofags
nothing wrong with a rape van
  4wd wagons and fwd cuck boxes are all great until you have to drive through 2 feet of snow over the course of 10km of road just to get to the highway like i have to do every time a big snow dump happens because the roads never get plowed until 2 weeks later
  thats possible but americans refuse to recognize the rest of the world  its because youre completely irrelevant to us eurocuck
  peak europoorism  stay mad cuck
  makes fun of a strawman  big brain wojak beating himself at chess  lul the projection is uncanny
this might be a dumb question but do airbags do anything to help you when you are wearing a seatbelt or do they just exist for the 1 of people out there too retarded to wear their seatbelt  me mam will only let me buy a car that has a drivers side airbag but i really wants me an e30 and i never plan on driving without a seatbelt anyway
  enjoy your whiplash
  airbags are meant to work in tandem with seatbelts the seatbelt holds you in place where youre supposed to be keeping you from flying out a window or getting tossed like a rag doll around the interior of the car and the airbag provides a stopping force spread out over more of your body than the seatbelt alone airbags are worthless if youre not wearing your seatbelt
are you retarded   airbags are deadly without a seatbelt
  but surely if im held in place by the seatbelt i wont even touch the front airbag
  you certainly will at high speed
  please go test your braindead theory on a tree
  airbag in road car is like both helmet and hans it cant replace your seatbelts
  how high of a speed exactly  i rarely go above 30 on my daily drive      maybe explain this to me instead of being an ass
  theyre definitely a good idea ever got into a collision where you were wearing your seat belt but the air bag didnt go off your shoulders are probably going to be sore for the next couple days now imagine you hit someone at a good speed without an airbag either the seat belt will rip or something in your body is going to rip
    have you never seen any crash test footage    
  this is a 40 mph crash test btw
  have you never been in an accident the airbags dont always go off if they do go off youre going plenty fast
  heres a good shot    
  well damn that was supposed to start at 220 so just jump to that point in the video
  in america the airbags are larger in part to compensate for the likelihood of the driver and passengers not wearing seat belts
    are these american pickup trucks just built like shit or something  the seatbelt looks like it isnt even working  if all seatbelts are that badly made then i guess your point is proven but theres no way muh german engineered seatbelt is gonna be that shit right
ok so im well aware that a modern car with airbags is definitely safer but i want an 80s shitbox whether it will kill me or not im just wondering if i can use the seatbelt thing as an excuse to convince me mam to let me get an e30 instead of an e36
  its a three point belt  they do not do much
  kek your mother is trying to do you a favour dont buy thrashed german cars
    is this some kind of ricer fuddlore  id chalk it up to boomers but most of them seem to be firmly in the thrown clear camp
  when airbags fail to deploy people sometimes rupture their aorta from the massive force of the seat belt against their abdomen thats how my brother died
  im glad those retards arent here i guess the americans are all asleep rn or something      all ive learnt from this thread is that seatbelts are actually built like shit i always wondered why they dont have any spring in them to absorb forces like that and i wasnt awear that they hardly do anything to stop you moving in your seat desu all i want to do after this thread is buy fucking racing harnesses
  thats not how airbags work what is a head rest
  glad those retards arent here  do i need airbags if im wearing a seatbelt   yer poor wee mammy
  poorly built  dude do you understand how much sudden violent deceleration sucks thats a big part of car crash injuries you want a belt to be a bit elastic and the airbag is a cushion for the same reason fma basic fucking physics dude more time slowing down  less acceleration  less force on your body
  read a fucking article retard ill spoon feed your idiot ass this one time situation front end crash at 40mph you are buckled in and the car has airbags as the car detects a crash it first triggers the low speed sensor the car then locks the seat belt retracts it too if you have something ritzy to hold you in place at the same time it primes the airbag firing circuts as the crash progresses and your frame meets their frame the increased deceleration trips the high speed sensor at this point your body has taken out any bit of slack in the seatbelt a section of the belt is folded over itself and specially stiched so that as your body keeps moving forward the stiches rip out in a controlled manner to spread the deceleration out over a longer time while the seatbelt was doing its thing the airbag fired and inflated as the stiches rip out the airbag is also catching you the entire crash system from the crumple zones to the seatbelt to the airbags are designed to spread the deceleration out over the longest time possible all that stuff on the inside is designed by smarter people than anyone here to stop your body as slow as possible that means you have to keep moving forward as they control how fast you slow down
  buy fucking racing harnesses  internally decapitates self
  holy shit someone with more than two brain cells to rub together
  im glad the americans arent here  that means i get to be retarded
  do you understand how much sudden violent deceleration sucks  to verify mythbusters had tested variations on seat belts including ones made of duct tape but what they found out was that strapping in the body to the max resulted in more gforce trauma to the body so it was desirable to have the belts flex and give
  sorry to hear that anon
  only in europe airbags are specifically nerfed in usspec cars to be relatively safe without a seatbelt of course this reduces their efficiency but freedom isnt free
  this  if the seatbelt rigidly bolted you to the seat and the front of the car wouldnt crumple then the resulting nearinstant deceleration of your body would result in chest crushmaximum and dick crushmaximum
airbags were a mistake everyone shouldve used wires and pulleys like audi
  but seatbelts still use a tightening system
  yeah but its electronicallyactivated now
  because more reliable
  sae spec airbags inflate quicker and are larger than equivilent ece spec airbags the difference is because sae spec requires the bag to be able to catch an unbelted occupant while ece spec is tested against a belted in dummy youbcould at least be assed to look at least wikipedia before talking out your ass
  yeah but what if i go slow
  i just want you to know that i have been mad and hated everything tonight but i laughed at this    thanks anon    fuck captcha
    arent they mechanically and electronically controlled  if the parking brake needs a mechanical mechanism then im sure the seatbelts need it too
  doesnt matter how low youre going if someone crashes into you at 100mph
its a pretty cool system   problem is that people are painfully unaware of the forces involved in a crash   without safety equipment impacts even at low speeds can easily lead to horrific injuries and death   wear your fucking seat belt
  i thought it was an electric sensor triggering an explosive to power the mechanism
airbags do nothing in a serious collision they just make lower speed impacts a bit more comfy    t  the paramedic who runs one week of the traffic offender program im doing    he also told us if a car rolls with a person not strapped in that person will kill everyone else in the car by bouncing around the car and giving the other passengers deadly head injuries he said hes seen that happen like over 15 times or something crazy like that
  airbags are meant to work in conjunction with seat belts one of them wont provide the same level of protection of the two together  in the us airbags are a bit different bigger slightly slower to inflate because seatbelts arent mandatory everywhere and they have to work with the assumption that the driver isnt wearing one so they are a bit more effective alone as opposed to the european counterparts    seatbelts stop your whole body from being launched through the windshield or sliding towards the foot well airbags are there mainly to protect your head which is the only important bit that is not stopped by belts from impacting the steering wheel and/or to avoid severe whiplash or death from your neck snapping    go watch videos of crash tests and see for yourself    airbags in the eu are deadly without a seatbelt
  automotive tech here i still remember my instructor harping on about thisthe airbag generally will only ever deploy in collisions that would have killed you even if you had the seatbelt on cars now how so many sensors and computers that they can usually figure out if the airbag is needed many will only deploy them as needed and have multistage airbags example 30mph collision mostly localized at the front right of the car will only trigger stage 1 of the passenger airbag and nothing else
  automotive tech here  does that mean you are a mechanic  nonnative english speaker here
  can confirm i have hearing damage from airbags
  this is false the airbag wont do shit if your body is already sailing through the windshield
    do airbags do anything to help you when you are wearing a seatbelt    air bags prevent your body from hitting hard surfaces inside the car     i never plan on driving without a seatbelt anyway    good seat belt keeps your body in your seat unbelted passengers can harm you in a crash please tell your friends to buckle up if not for themselves but at least for you
  sae spec airbags inflate quicker and are larger  for amerifats
  is an adult  gets cucked by his mother  the fuck  id advise getting a car with neither so you can end your miserable existence seriously what the fuck
  the beneath shot with the transmission erupting made me queasy
  mfw not wearing a hans device to starbucks
  the beneath shot with the transmission erupting made me queasy  that was the transfer caseawd/4wd when the front end was shortened the transfer case is the fuse in the driveline
  wahh wahh wahh wahh spoonfeeeeding     god youre a bitch if you hate telling people things what are you doing here just go outside and stay there
should i just get a used one or is it worth my time to go out and buy one new i live in california making a thread because the sticky is just cars not motorcycles also already got my moto license
electric motorcycles are shit  except for dirt bikes like the redshift
  electric motorcycles have insane torque delivery its like jumping to lightspeed theyre a fun toy to have if you just ride around town and dont plan on taking it on long distances
depends on what sort of riding youre expecting to do with it daily commute just fine weekend trips not so much also as far as i recall theyre still pretty expensive and itll take years to make up the difference in price by not having to buy fuel if ever
    fuel cost isnt my concern insomuch as it is convenience and better traction control i dont enjoy getting gas    know of any good models
  they are slower   the zero sr does 060 in 33s same as an sv650 expect the zero costs 16495 and the suzuki is 6999
bump
    with bikes youre better off just going with ice for cars the power density of batteries is close to being tolerable since most can manage 2300mi/charge and be competitive weight wise but for an electric motorcycle to have a similar single tank range to an ice bike it would have to be ridiculously heavy and currently youve really only got the zero which only gets 120mi range on the highway with the upgraded battery for comparison with my klr with a slightly larger than stock ims tank can go around 270mi between fillups and its still 40lbs lighter when wet despite being the heaviest 650 thumper     if you go with an electric bike just realize that you can really only go to destinations that are around 40 of the maximum range if you want to keep some charge in reserve for an emergency and if you do run out youve got to get the bike towed rather than walking to the nearest gas station
do actually exist people like these        buy a brand new gas guzzling car  oh god what the fuck im killing the earth  swap it with an hybrid model with less than half the power so my green conscience is satisfied  lose a fuckton money in the process    im literally astonished
do people like this actually exist    gee i shouldnt drink before posting
  the op in the link is a woman  all you need to know
  yeah but her husbad instead of beating the shit out of her agreed on buying her a new car
  burgersoys gotta buy new or people will think they are poor for having a 3 year old car
  i traded in the rc with only 2000 miles on it    1 year and 2000 miles what the literal fuck
  spends 100k on a ev with accord quality  but i dont have to buy gas anymore
  i didnt read the article either way they are dumb
says they care about carbon footprint so they buy a car which required a shitload of energy to make
your typical nipshitter
these people are delusional as if they are doing something good for the environment the whole thing is just virtue signalling it kind of pisses me off because i often ride my bicycle and i see these people use their cars to drive very short distances how about reuse and recycle and keep what you already have to make it last as long as possible its just all boomers
  last as long  when your dead your dead
  when husband and i   either a woman or a faggot cant expect them to understand trivial things
  why not just drive it half as often and actually enjoy you car
  she gets 16 mpg  vs  she gets 44 mpg that will probably compensate the carbon footprint of manufacturing a new car in 20 years  while some madman who got her old car for half the price may be hooning it and getting 5 mpg   green my ass
  yfw that effectively did nothing and commuter car emissions are only a fraction of overall greenhouse gas production    yfw eating less meat especially red meat has a greater effect on emissions than any type of car you could drive    i always wonder how people so illogical end up with so much money their luck must be absolutely insane
at this point im just praying that a car manufacturer will give enough of a shit to make an at least somewhat lightweight cheap rwd car instead of only making big 7000 pound suvs and solely focusing on driving range like i know they will
light cheap rwd car    you really think muskrat is gonna make something for your demographic that faggot is too busy adding giant panel gaps to his new semitrucks
  every time someone makes a car like that everyone calls it slow says its too expensive and doesnt buy it because they can just buy an old car and make it better for less
  you cant even get a lightweight rwd ice car these days well you can but its supposedly too slow for people here hows that gonna work when you now need to fit a 2000lb battery pack in it
electric and cheap dont work yet because batteries are expensive if youre spending out the ass manufacturing a giant battery pack youll want to use it on a vehicle with huge margins like a crossover model x or gt car model s the closest to a cheap car that makes economic sense is the 35k trim model 3 and that hasnt reached production
  leaf and ioniq arent too expensive and they dont come from the elon musks magical factory
  just get the alpine you nigger
  and only have 150km range and are slow
  leaf costs 35k and the bolt costs 40k    dacia sandero costs 6200
finally got a car  got nowhere to drive to  what the fuck what now
where the fuck do you even live  surely theres gotta be some road around you
i was looking at this thumbnail for the longest time thinking it was some kind of structure on some farmland taken from a shot way up in the air
  i cant unsee it now
  there are roads but no destinations its a metaphor for life for a lot of us actually
  open google maps find a cool road and go explore buy a snack somewhere and turn back not that hard
  drive out to the middle of a field and see it thrre alone fag that sounds rihht up your alley
  if you wouldnt mind where are you located the road is the destination you just have to find good ones
  deep shit but there doesnt need to be a destination just gas the jews hit the gas
  dont be such a melodramatic faggot anon all roads lead somewhere and some of the most interesting places ive found were by just driving and exploring on my own without any destination in mind
  lol i saw that pic from r/wtf too
  are you admiting to going on reddit or are you taking a jab implying op being there
  holy shit me either
  both
  with a car you can go anywhere exhales cigarette
  go exploring pick a place or a store and just go look around at stuff got some extra cash go hang around in a restaurant act like an adventurer be a protagonist
  do you have electric light or maybe second sight
  get ticketed for cruising
  do you mean the homosexual term or just driving around because you want to
  roads where we are going we dont need no roads puts back his fancy glasses on
  llike wwhat a ticket for cruising i mean just for driving adhering to rules and laws and all but for the sole fact you were just driving around pointlessly what kind of nigerian country you live in
  what have you done
  thats how it is on this bitch of an earth    when i first got my license i was excited about being able to go to gamestop without having to see if my mom felt like taking me then i realized i had nowhere to go  at least getting to school was a lot better
  its legalized racial profiling to allow cops to pull over niggers skulking around in cars  be white and youll never be bothered  or better yet live outside of minority infested shitholes
finally got a car  can finally fuck off from parents  freedom
  what kind of nigerian country you live in    america     its usually in metropolitan areas that have a lot of congestion i started noticing a lot of the signs pop up in the late2000s after the fatf craze
be europoor  cruising is more expensive than just burning money outright due to ludicrous fuel prices
back when i was a neet i used to look forward to being sent on errands to the store because it would give me an excuse to drive my car that i had poured all of my money and energy into    it wasnt rare for it to sit for a week or more though the good roads were too far to bother driving to
  be europoor  fuel is 1 euro a liter  car burns 8l/100km on a hard day  spend 10 euros and drive the living shit out of it  feels good
  retard
  cruising has a special meaning that youre probably too young to know about  
i got ticketed last week for driving without a girlfriend i thought it was such bullshit at the time i tried telling them i was on my way to her house lie but i have no idea how they could tell im going to court in a month to fight this 953 dollar fine what evidence could i use in the court of law
  hunt ferda twisties if you live in a rural area dirt road hooning is a grand time
  taco bell
  put a picture of a girl in your wallet and tell them she lives two towns over and shes not on facebook
  anon they surprised me with a surprise penis inspection theyre telling me it doesnt taste like a vagina so i couldnt prove coitus within the last 2 weeks im so fucked and my permit to travel without a gf only allows me to travel through the sewers and my parents car

  this  if im not driving to and from work im driving to go get snacks
buy first car used  its much more premium than i had planned for due to circumstances so scared of breaking it  live in big city and have it in paid garage  no backroads anywhere nearby only endless traffic  yuropoor so gas so expensive i feel the money flowing out of my pocket every time i drive  its suffering desu i just wanna practice and learn how to drive better not having to move 2 meters every 5 minutes in traffic
  wow you can make cigarettes come out of your mouth id smoke it still
  i feel like that drive with care sign would make many people upset and cause them to drive like assholes hence the lower pic
  i dont think it does much but normies are the majority not us loner types
  this     we need fucking answers
  i understand you so well   i have the same exact issue my car been sitting on parking lot for about 2 yrs now and last time i tried to start it i discovered that squirrels built a nest under the hood and completely destroyed harnesses wiring (((
  its a spider covered in some kind of fungus/mould
  so drive to the outskirts of the city at night brainlet  and buy a twingo it /sips/
  gas the jews
its raping everything of similar price in sales so hard when the crossover pickup and econoboxes come out its going to dominate quicker than anyone expects
  ill take a solid state battery model y please tesla is the most american car company around because the big 3 love to manufacture in mexico and canada
    no    elon musk is a white male who wont repeat leftist talking points    we must destroy him narwhals engage downvotes
  tesla does for electric cars what ford did for cars
wheres the fucking semi truck i thought they were going to make thousands
  in all fairness     i do agree that if the model 3 sold well than the model y will sell like fucking hotcakes
  also   reintroduce badgeing you fucks
  bruh  
  just wait until the real car companies take the ev market
  planned to start production in 2019  new roadster is set to start production in 2020  model y is probably in there somewhere too
  the chevy bolt exists and a long range leaf is coming
the ford of the 21st century  so unreliable shitboxes it checks out
  but didnt they not count sales numbers until all the pre orders were being built thus taking years worth of sales and consolidating the numbers into a few months time frame
tesla wins the game of cars musk is coming
    tesla isnt selling economy cars with ev propulsion they proved that ev luxury cars are where its at so lets see a cadillac escalade with an ev powertrain or even a cts then theyll actually be competing
  said the increasingly nervous man for the 10 year in a row
  just wait until the real car companies take the ev market  they are trying for years now with limited success
  every brand is coming out with their own electric cars
  ford innovated by making the assembly line streamlining production to make it faster and cheaper they were turning out cars at an incredible rate tesla still only does low volume they still have basic quality control issues despite their low output relatively tiny auto makers like kia can manage body panels that fit kia doesnt have a dash board or windows that rattle above 10mph kia doesnt have an issue with installing defective windshields making the customer wait a month for replacement then putting in yet another defective windshield tesla has all these problems    musks auto venture has no appeal apart from pop cultural gravity surrounding the man himself people like tesla because they like elon musk the company itself is very poor at the one thing an auto maker should get right they might as well be the ev version of chrysler
  puts random blue leds on uglyfied golf or similar shitboxes and offers less than 100 miles of range
this guy think tesla will be the next ford not dmc
  itll never work 600700 miles on a single charge while pulling 80000lbs up and down mountains while maintaining highway speed fuck outta here
  caddy had a 2 door volt
  itll work    the question is cost to purchase vs cost to operate compared to diesel or cng and charge time
thinking being like ford is a good thing
itt europoors nipshitters and gmcucks literally assmad ford is the best auto company in existence
  based    every tesla thread is filled with leddit gayest shit i have ever seen  its all so tiresome
  nah tesla will be the apple of cars  take an idea that existed for ages already   claim it as your own breakthrough and overcharge the shit out of it  now where have i seen this before
  but apple is famous for user friendly design
  normies love it  enthusiasts of the field despise its walled garden approach selfentitlement an ridiculous brand markup  again huge feeling of deja vu
produce shitboxes   they dont sell well because they are shit  stop making them  i doubt musk is that stupid
  be gms chevrolet make an ugly but reasonbly affordable electric vehicle the bolt  get pissy and decide to only build a limited number per year to meet govt give me dats  company is going to fail suddenly care about electric cars again  scramble to make evs while in death throes    yea its really working out well for them right now eh
    i dont own any apple products and i think they try to push a divisive brand image but theyre pretty revolutionary
  theyre pretty revolutionary  theyre not they have a very known practice of taking features from small lesser known brands and claiming them as their own ideas
  its raping everything of similar price in sales so hard    sales are barely in the hundreds outside the dictatorship shithole third world
  sales are barely in the hundreds outside the dictatorship shithole third world  this southwestern european so far ive only seen one s and one x

screw hooning who wants to take the backroads into the wilderness with me no cell reception no street signs or markers anywhere just you your ride and nature in all its unforgiving beauty
  tfw you will never see your state in this much snow and drive your car in this white wonderland
sounds like shit fuck snow
  snow isnt the issue its the stupid bastard municipalities that pour brine shit and destroy my precious shitbox make studded winter tires mandatory so i dont have to wash my car every time i drive it
  make people spends hundreds or thousands of dollars so i dont have to spend a few dollars to wash my car    1st world problems
  no cell reception  im always scared of having an issue in areas like this if its snowing you should really have some blankets and warm clothing
  i know we are all trained to keep them on us and keep ourselves plugged in at all times but there is something so liberating about being in a place where the world cant drag you into its problems
  i have a cb radio to call mexican truckers and forest pigs to save me but i always have blankets too
  that being said youre a massive faggot dude
  how so
  yep definitely true for the times ive been away with out being plugged in ive had too many close calls with things that a nice drive into the snow would end in me being stuck for days lol i also remember the guy from reddit tried to save on a hotel and slept in his car ran out of gas and woke up with his legs hurting but fell back asleep he had to get them both amputated from the knee down
  hurr smrt fones  not sheep like u  world problems exist outside me a true island
actually having snow  i wish nigga
  your reading way to much between the lines i genuinely think everyone could use some real time away its not pretension or superiority its a mental health issue
  aight i apologize
  you believe that story
im a yooper and have given up driving a car for the winter i just hop on my sled and go wherever i need to all the roads are never plowed and the snow is so deep it makes trying to drive fool hearty
  its cool to be honest the whole reason i was on that road was because a driver i sent up there on an hour long run hadnt reported back in two hours sure as shit i found him stuck in a ditch with no cell reception and he didnt appreciate the solitude the location offered him
  ya unless he was drunk or on drugs that story is bullshit your body will wake you up if things get too hot or too cold go ahead and try it if you dont believe me
    government brining is free
  road benifits all taxpayers not just cagecucks cunt
  honestly going out in remote areas without any cell reception made me realize how much of a pussy i really am it made me really anxious the entire time because i knew if i broke down or something id be fucked
snow wheelin is best wheelin
      2wholesome4me
  snow like that on the trees is heavy as shit youre just begging for branches to fall down on your car or have trees blocking the road entirely  t northeast
  screams internally
tfw never had a car dad
tfw have a loving dad that wants to learn about my hobby because it makes me happy
  i dont want some basedcuck stepdad like you i want a dad that was actually into cars himself
    become the car dad
had a car dad  ignored his suggestion to get a manual as my first car
tfw my dad is a vw fag  keeps trying to convince me to get a vw or an audi instead of getting a bimmer
  my dad is only mildly interested in cars likes cars but not enough to actually drive anything cool   him and my grandpa used to rebuild engines back in the day always wish he would of shared the same experience with me at least he helps me with the maintaining of my shitbox
  you never held the shop light for your dad as a kid  you never grabbed wrenches or beers for your dad as a kid  you never completed a father/son project car  you had to learn how to work on cars by reading and posting on phpbb2 forums c2006
  tfw dad is a lawyer who just leases benz and jaguars every two years   its a sad feel
  are you me
  same mine was a firefighter who was the goat at fixing stuff but he was never into cars at all always had wagons and practical cars
  tfw never had a dad
  your father is trying to raise you to not be a douchebag
  im here for you son   what do you wanna know
  i know that feel
  tfw never had a car
dad had a mkii supra while i was young  instead of putting it away for me he sold it for chump change and bought a mazda 3
  i know a somewhat similar feel anon  dad had a 70s cutlass with a desmogged and hopped up rocket 350 and the dual gate  sold it before i was born to help pay for moving and raising me  always talked about how much he loved it and successfully passed his love of the generals most mismanaged marque on to me  taught me all the neat little things like using the location of the oil fill tube to see at a glance if a car was a chevymobile  i never got to buy him another one for us to work on and cruise around in
  tfw family business is auto repair shop
  dad doesnt even change the tires by himself
  good lad your dad is get into that tdi lyfe
mfw dad died in my childhood  mfw dad was an avid car collector  mfw my mom sold all his cars for dirt cheap post mortem
  tfw never had a dad  step to my level son
  would of  its would have  would have  not would of  wouldve  not wouldof  would have
dad was never into cars  bought cheap beaters and ran them into the ground  his car gets stolen in 04 since buying it in 95 just bought a cheap hilux for a getaround after  learned wrenching by my own  eventually found and recovered his old wreck 15 years later  he sees it  oh yeah just sell it its pretty trashed  fuck you dad i fixed it anyway
car dad tells stories about wrenching and hooning when he was young  hasnt touched cars since the mid 70s  build a car with car dad  dead set on an ls   hes weary because computers but goes with it anyway  engine fires on the first try  cant get over how easy it was and how reliable it is  loves the sound  mfw watching my old man praise ls engines at car shows   mfw he proudly points to me when they ask who built it
  same he keeps saying vw audi and discourages buying bmw
  thats the best feeling dad never does anything for himself debated for months over buying an 8k 2010 yaris for a new daily to replace his 99 ek hatch he impulse bought after his 96 legacy wagon finally shit the bed point is he doesnt like to do stuff for himself or just hates working on cars anymore so i have a project were trying to get done changing the engine in my weekend car weve worked on hundreds of small maintenance or repair or upgrade projects on his and my cars    gonna miss him when hes gone one day still havent quite figured out how life is going to be when that day comes
had a car dad  he died when i was three or so  can only remember that my mother was driving his golf mk1 gti with a bbs bodykit similar to pic related years and years after he died  shit i think id like the guy
  hed be proud of you anon
  dad never does anything for himself  yep my dads the same way he originally wanted to do a 383 or build the 350 that was in the car but i can tell hes glad we went with the ls like hes genuinely excited about it that was the real goal i didnt want to see him just roll into retirement after working for 50 years and just wait he even said he never thought hed be doing this kind of thing again since the 70s    drag strip an hour and a half away  used to count how many days wed gone and laugh about it  were here pretty much every week  eventually lost count
want to learn stick  dad is 50 so he knows how to just because manuals used to be ubiquitous  keep asking him to teach me says he will but blows me off for a year when i try to actually get him to do it  end up driving 100 miles to meet some anon from /o/ who teaches me stick in his turbo miata because i dont know anyone who can teach me  dad is furious when he finds out i met some stranger on the internet who cucked him out of a fatherson learning experience  grounds me when i tell him its his fault for ignoring me for over a year    no regrets
  burgers having this much trouble learning to drive stick
dad was a car guy he tuned and would race other hot riders the 60s 70s and maybe early 80s but by the time i came to be in the late 80s he gave it up he still had his cars but they were mostly junk i never even saw him touch one mom sold most of them after he died i often wonder what happened he retired when i was 5 so its not like he didnt have time to wrench on them
  post pics
  tfw dad knew some stuff about cars because of cargrandpa  tfw cargrandpa used to build and race a lot of cars  tfw cargrandpa was a murderer and killed his wife and himself before i could even meet him and fucked up dad for life  tfw im a bigger fan of my step dad and he knows a lot about most things  tfw i dont really fuck with my biological fathers entire side of the family anymore    i aint even mad wont have a cuck for a father i still love him but i only talk to him every 6 months or so he hits me up when his shitbox scion xb with 300k miles acts up
  end up driving 100 miles to meet some anon from /o/ who teaches me stick  how fucking retarded can you be
  heres as it was circa yesterday theres been so much rust cut out and engine runs great im cutting a hole in it for a floor shifter when that arrives and the seats need to be trimmed already
my dad is a paintingmasonryplumbingcarpenting dad   cant even start to calculate how much money i saved up by him helping in my own house   he used to love cars but he gave that up when he had kids   he used to drive this awesome pre 1990 gwagon he sold it to drive a benz stationwagon   sorry dad
  implying your based benz father doesnt haul ass in that station wagon when hes alone
  having to meet someone to teach you stick  stick aint all that hard to learn  hate to break it to you
my dad has a grand national and could beat up your dad
  used to now in his old age he is becoming the cliche retired driver
  tfw have a car dad  taught me everything and made me grow a passion for v8s   best memory i had with him was when i was eight years old and he would take me out for joy rides in his trans am
tfw dad knows mechanics and is an actual mechanical engineer but hate hooning big engines and wasting money on cars
  having an engineer dad    im sorry on the bright side at least you had nice things as a child
  this  dad goes to shop to get small shit fixed  willingly forks over 600 every time  shocked when i flat out refuse same shops estimate of 2000 for economy struts and shocks
    i have an engineer dad too it wasnt bad we lived well within our means but the whole family mostly keeps to themselves im an engineer now too i suppose it was destiny
  nice
  be me mechanical engineer  studied dynamics and ic engines  dads an accountant    can i be your new dad
neither do i but that doesnt stop me giving advice on /o/ and ridiculing american cars
dad sold the s2000 for some mercedes convertible thing
  based mercedes convertible   vs  literally as gay as a miata s2k with just as much interior room as said miata    pops made the right choice
  but muh vtec
tfw have car dad but he insists he knows more than me and gives me shit for not having the same tastes as him so instead of fun father son bonding its just competition to prove each other wrong
  are you cute do you pass for a girl ill be your car daddy
  tfw have a car dad  mum devorced him when i was like 6  she never let him see me  told me he never wanted to  never even let me talk to him on the phone    be 21  dad somehow got our house number and called  mum actually let me speak to him  i arrange for him to come visit  we spend days just talking about cars  mfw he has patrician shitbox taste  used to own loads of cool ass shitboxes  do dad stuff with him  finally realize what ive been missing this whole time  find out he actually wanted to see me all these years and mum lied for no reason  secretly hate mums guts from now on    tfw couldnt grow up tinkering with dads shitboxes  probably wouldnt be a depressed gay trap fag who stays in my room all the time and has no freinds  tfw i was so close to living the dream i didnt know i wanted
  fuck your dad
  looking clean dude
  how the fuck did you find it
    tfw almost every single one of my dads cars are worth like 50x what he sold them for nowadays and are all uncommon or classics now  you cant blame them tho its hard to know what a car will be worth in 20 years half the shitboxes we drive now that we think are worthless might be cool classics that all this kids want in the future    funnyest one was his s13 200sx he hates drifters and was really upset when i told him what the drift tax was and why that car in stock condition would be worth tons now
      missing a thinly veiled miata gay joke
  women are essentially the embodiment of evil and the shit theyre allowed to get away with these days is disgusting    probably wouldnt be a depressed gay trap fag who stays in my room all the time and has no freinds  ah yes severe single mother syndrome
honda manages to make the new civic si have a rev hang much worse than the wrx
    direct injection    not even once
every manual car has rev hang nowadays part of new emissions regulations
can it be mapped out in modern cars i still drive a couple of old classics and the difference is so stark
    i had to look up the term forgive my ignorance but what is the negative
  not audi
  fast shifts require the revs to drop a little or itll be a jerky ride also it fucks with predicting how much engine braking youll have as the revs will hang a little and then suddenly drop so you cant just rely on steady engine braking  cars get rekt with more and more emissions shit  bikes have a real world emissions test yet come with a autoblipper from the factory that cuts timing to burn fuel in the pipe  i honestly dont get whos jewing who anymore
  that makes a lot of sense thank you   id also like to know if that can be easily programmed out
all this emissions shit is a scandal in itself as there are 100 corporations responsible for 71 of the global emissions and theyre all literally oil/coal/gas excavation companies no wonder car manufacturers are cheating theyre getting unfairly fucked and know it
  this and this again
  true my audi has 0 rev hang while my shitbox mazda and many other gas/petrol cars have it
  id also like to know if that can be easily programmed out  its trivial to remove with a flash but contrary to what retards on the cobb forums say it can lead to warranty claims being denied
  lets not forget the eleven container ships that produce more pollution than every single car in the world combined because they burn the sludge they scrape off the bottom of the refinery tower
if only you knew how bad things really are
oh no
dude that shit is like a poster for a horror movie  twongi is coming for you anon  teehee
why did you post this 
  i dont live in paris so i dont care
  let them eat cake
why didnt you save me anon
93    good ridance
  why would they do this
wtf is happening to the poor twongi oh nooo
  the french arent human
  this is correct the french arent human the french are african
  you misspelled merci you had one job anon
  you fucking monsters    its time to bomb france
  help
  might as well light a watch on fire with how much it was worth    just have a mass shooting like a civilised country
nooooooooooooooo  its not fair
fucking surrender monkeys kek
  and thats a good thing 
thats what you get for importing a bunch of niggers to europe  lmao you guys are headed for another civil war
  because diversity is strength
  i dont live in paris so i dont care  you might be forced to care depending on the president for example obama made agreements to take in overflow immigrants from various other places including rejects from the examination process those were outside of the annual limits on immigration    thats why the african immigrants to australia that were rejected due to criminal history were taken in by obama but trump took office before the process was finished and you should remember that difficulty trump went through trying to reject the africans with criminal records he was forced to take them because the congressional democrats stood firm and the other immigrants in the usa started protesting about racism    so yes you do have to care sometimes
  nice try /pol/
  yellow vest protest  plenty of these protests go on in the usa along the protest path blm tosses nails on the road so car tires eventually pick up these nails
f
  i knew /pol/niggers were dumb but really
  why  he never hurt anyone  _
  their hate for the country is huge and they have no gratitude for the social welfare they get as they feel they are entitled to it and more road raging riots are more celebration than anger since some usa photojournalist photos in the past showed happy smiles among the rioters the ragers were having a good time letting loose
  diversity  everyone is black  really gets my noggin joggin
  are you in france and do you know more about the protest our media here isnt reporting anything about it in the news that ive seen    what what ive read online the protests are over increasing fuel prices originally and something something immigration     could you elaborate on why and how much the fuel prices are increasing fuels prices in europe have been pretty damn high for a long time dont see why the french are only just now protesting about it what are the other causes
  basically rich vs poor   they increased diesel prices 16 for environmental reasons which pissed off all the peasants in their old shitty peugeots and increased freight costs
  the protests are over increasing fuel prices originally and something something immigration  the actual problem with violence is that a bunch of muslim immigrants and african immigrants muslim or not take advantage of any type of protest they blend in with the protest and start rioting and looting
  no clue about other countries but here in germany gas prices rise since months since we had a dry period and our main river rhein is so low that the ships cant pass through and therfore gasoline and diesel cant get produced or reach the places they should be also increasing prices means people get forced to buy new cars since theyre more efficient and specially pushing the buying or renting of ev/ using public transportation or bicycle or car sharing  also diesels got banned from pasing through some streets but that has nothing to do with the prices
  we had a dry period and our main river rhein is so low that the ships cant pass through  i really dont believe this meme  what about the pipelines we have
  peasants in their old shitty peugeots    give me the money to buy a newer car and then maybe i will let go of my old shitty peugeot    fucking government npc
  where
  whenever an infrastructure plan is hatched the greedy big cities take it all suburban and rural areas have no access to public transportation even if they wanted to
  shouldve thought about that before moving there is it my fault that you make yourself dependent on one form of transportation do you deserve my help
  wahhh give me euros  try making money yourself you retarded frog
  so are rich people supportive of the higher fuel taxes or are poor people just angry in general because they are the ones hurt most by fuel expenses      those protesters look pretty white in the pictures ive seen much more so than i would think frances cities populations would be
  frances minimum wage is 54 higher than the us in converted dollars so why are you having such problems plus you get five weeks of vacation time and only work 35 hour weeks
  dunno its just really sketchy
        those fucking frog niggers will pay
  i see yes but thats what they say
  send all twingo refugees keep the frogs
  this i sort of understand but why the twingo is it popular with the burgeois
  those fucking frog niggers will pay  no they wont    almost all of the rioters will get away with it as they hide behind antidiscrimination laws as weve seen in the past 4 years of rioting news from france
  i obviously dont want people rioting against increased gas prices punished dumbass  i just want the fucker who torched that twongi to get kicked in the nuts proper
be french  vote for higher taxes and prices  receive higher taxes and prices  protest higher taxes and prices  what did the french mean by this
  total sa frances biggest refiner is in the process of shutting its largest plant in the country the 247000barreladay gonfreville facility in normandy due to a labor dispute a spokeswoman for the company said on tuesday a few hundred miles away in the netherlands retail fuel stations are running out of supplies because of shipping constraints on the rhine according to royal dutch shell plc    shell said nov 20 that it cut production at its rheinland refining site the biggest complex of its kind in germany due to low water levels on the rhine in a tweet on tuesday the company said that it was temporarily unable to supply some unmanned fuel stations in the netherlands    gas stations in germany had already been running dry due to the situation on the rhine a major petroleum product transportation corridor that runs northwest from the swiss alps all the way to the netherlands switzerland released emergency fuel stockpiles because of the situation on the river    quotes     the low water levels in the rhine are due to there being less or no more alpine glaciers feeding the rhine and the glaciers have melted then not renewed because of global warming doesnt matter though europe has been overpopulated for decades look up the river stones
  the voting majority represents everyone  congratulations youre mentally retarded
  i hate france now
  i hate france now  a lot of those immigrants have always hated france but they live there and elsewhere in europe for social welfare support its pretty similar in the usa where many blacks hate the usa but continue to choose to live there instead of emigrating back to africa    picture of african migrants in france doing mass carjackings near the chunnel in order to have cars to drive into england
come to thread for twingo memes  its s p/o/l episode
  its time to bomb france  flipping over cars works too    the past fifteen years of migrations from africa into france has built up large diversity slum areas full of discontented and violent peoples who came from violent backgrounds in violent countries full of corruption
  if only you knew how bad things really are
  french people got what they deserve they fucking sucked ass during the elections    t butthurt macron hater
  if only you knew how bad things really are  foreseeing stuff like this is why so many british voters ended up supporting brexit to avoid all the immigrants flooding the country
  t bootlicker    their hate for the country is huge  of course they would hate the government because the government actively hates them and demands more money from them  and they have no gratitude for the social welfare they get as they feel they are entitled to it and more  maybe because they dont want it and dont want to pay for the rest of their lives so other people can live off their dime
  doesnt take in account taxes or the extreme costs of living in european cities
shits going down
    punished twingo    a twingo denied his hons
  niggers dont care about the gas prices they all ride the bus or the train      eat shit faggot
  why are we still here  just to suffer  every night i can feel my block and my driveshaft even my brake discs  the body ive lost the driving buddies ive lost wont stop hurting its like theyre all still there  you feel it too dont you
the water truck is deebly goncerned
  that truck in the fog has a menacing aura
  take pics from the african neighborhood of paris  waaaah everyone is black
  french people got what they deserve    which french people are you talking about there are real french people and then there are a lot of french citizens that hate the country but they or their parents immigrated to france for social welfare and infrastructure benefits
  its like that in the usa too we have plenty of people who are technically citizens but they hate the country and consistently behave poorly theyre here for the money or because they had to flee their country due to debt or criminal records weighing them down
we protest the current government politics by hurting twingos  niggers
what if we remade christine with a twingo
  miata would be better nobody here in north america knows what a twingay is
  theywillbe
doing tranny maintenance for the first time   gm 4l60 has no drain hole   carefully remove all but one bolt let nasty brown tranny fluid dribble into the catch pan   accidentally drop the pan splashing brown oil everywhere   i have basically taken a bath in tranny fluid   still have to work on truck for 4 hours before its drivable
taking four hours to do routine maintenance  tell me you at least did a backyard mechanic flush     definitely would consider it if i were you its messy to do buy its beautiful just need a 3/4 tube for the 4l60 iirc     grab yourself a corvette servo while youre at it
  enjoy smelling like transmission fluid for a week the smell takes forever to go away
 smelling like tranny fluid    idk about that as somebody who has mildly degenerated into foul bachelorhood i rarely really know what i smell like     i do know that i still felt greasy even after taking an hour long shower     4 hours flushing    i didnt actually do that and the transmission fluid was not the only thing i was doing  plus this was a 4x4 so you need to take apart the driveshaft to get to the transmission     backyard mechanic flush  connect tranny cooler outlet by tubing to waste container run engine for 30 seconds until a quart or so of fluid comes out add that much through filler right
  protip wash with dawn dish soap real good then with regular soap
     gm 4l60 has no drain hole    i worked on fleet silverado/express for a living none of the gm drain pan plugs ever come out like the 4l80e that have them theyre put in tight as a nun from factory and unless you get a really good grip and can loosen it first shot youll just strip it to shit
    yeah i was looking at aftermarket transmission pans that have plugs extra capacity and cooling fins but my wallet said no       ironically me having access to a full lift probably made this worse if i had just jack stands and stuff i would have dropped the entire pan just a few inches into a drain pan larger than it instead i dropped it onto myself and sploosh     alternatively use my peristaltic laboratory pump and length of fuel and lubricant tubing to pump most of the fluid out of the transmission
  get a pan off the 2002 avalanche and suburbans they have a drain plug
  my 2002 avalanche came with one from factory its a blessing
  thats how i usually do trans fluid changes i have a 12v oil transfer pump with plastic hose thin enough to go down the dipstick tube into the pan i just suck as much out as possible refill and run it for 20 minutes then suck it out and fill with fresh fluid again
  next time you plan on this go online and buy an aftermarket pan with a drain plug     as for the backyard flush two big buckets one full of clean one empty connect an intake hose to the clean bucket put a hose in the empty bucket have someone start it let the pump do the work be sure to watch it closely shut it down before the clean bucket empties
shower with dawn
a fucking leaf
  nim more like dim lol nissan is for retard
youre chilling in the club with your model s  a leaf slaps you on the ass
  prius be like  hold my beer brah
ill take this over any fag tesla
  its based on a shitbox hatchback there are way cooler ev racecars    on another note is this noise synthesized sounds awesome  
  goodness no that sounds atrocious
  looks pretty neat
  is this noise synthesized   they all are evs are naturally comedically quiet and required to artificially make more noise by the laws of both road and race track
  this looks great gimme a z35 with this design language nissan
  sounds like gear whine to me
  too bad it is some expensive carbon fiber work
self driving cars shouldnt be allowed to have faces
it literally looks like this
  they make their cars look retarded just like their consumers
  what consumers
  came here to post this
why would you double clutch upshifts in a drag race
you dont you let off the throttle and bang shift then back on that gas
  you should be flatshifting in a drag race if youre a real tryhard
  because it was people who dont really know anything about cars trying to make a car movie
  double clutching reduces the danger to the manifold and keeps you piston rings from frying
  you mean if i get in a drag race then my floor pan isnt gonna fall out
  depends if you have a dangerous manifold
  oh i see you drive a subaru
590 hp  0 to 60 in 35 seconds    how are car enthusiasts going to cope with the fact that every soccer mom who pulls up at a light next to them in this is faster than their car
soccer moms wont be driving those they will opt for the q5 or q3 20l 4cyl which my car will btfo
  every soccer mom can afford an e tron
  yfw when next year headline states new for 2021 audi just unveiled its challenge to the tesla model x
  soccer mom  buying anything other than suvs or crossovers
    i dont care about going fast so i will cope extremely well
  how is the range when you constantly floor it or drive it hard
  i doubt your car can btfo anything considering any vehicle you sit instantly loses at least 100hp/ton
  rotards making jokes about piston reliability    thats rich
  sedans deter vaginas because theyre just too unsafe stacy needs to sit up high to not have a nervous breakdown
  they already revealed the etron suv
    you act like thats a bad thing where i go
  a 2018 camry is literally the same weight as and safer than a rav4 the 25l camry is only 150lbs or so lighter if that it also gets much better gas mileage and has more power    literally a false sense of security
  what season of ice truckers is this
  having less hp/ton is always bad thing everywhere anyone goes
    the montana episode where i got talked into driving through two fucking blizzards for 5 grand and still made the load on time thanks to my enormous testicles    that part of the country this time of year is astonishing to drive through if you have the testicular fortitude
    ill remember that having weight is a bad thing when im driving on 3 inches of ice
  you arent supposed to be driving in those conditions you know werner got their shit pushed in over that
  i will thank them for slaving away and financing cheaper ev production and batteries and when companies stop jewing people with battery rent models then id buy a a used ev
  every soccer mom is faster than their car  you mean the car is faster  they cant drive for shit
  i also said car to begin with lardface
another luxury sedan literally nobody will buy  oh hurray another meme mobile that citydwelling faggots will lease for 2 months
  rotaries are superior to pistons
  is that why theyre dead
  thats cool but why does it look like a new honda
  actually looks good unlike tesla models  add the fact that you can actually trust audi to do qc right and hit production deadlines
  you think logic works on women they just get pissed because you arent listening to what she wants women dont want solutions they want to revel in their own problems
  this tesla are finished when this and the mission e come out
    now that the engine is removed from the car audi has introduced a new feature to randomly electrocute the driver to death since its impossible for check engine light to come on
  kek
  id buy the shit out of that if it had a turbo 4
  nice taycan ill have the skoda variant when it ships
  you can already buy the a5 4 door
gotta live among the rich people nigga the soccer moms already drive the s models here buying the audi would be perfectly reasonable
  good luck soccer mum
  is the etron gt concept just an a7 etron
  the absolute state of the frsfag
    no i dont own anything newer than 2004 nice try though
  audi should be destroyed again  
it has the same exact shape as the taycan    that is some 90s gm level rebadging there
  audi already missed their own deadline with the q8 etron
  and jaguar aston martin ferrari and others already have planned evs in their lineup
easy i will work 95 fixing these electrical shitboxes that will make lucas electronics look like they being in a rolls royce then i will take my profits to keep my internal combustion deathtrap running for my kids to drive
i hardly ever see old aldis still running
  my mom drives a sedan because she says suvs are gay
  my mom drives an suv because she says sedans are dangerous and so do most women
my friend just bought an 87 crx si for 1000 it needs a lot of work and i told him its gonna take a few thousand to make it look and drive decent when you are in 1st and pull your foot off the gas it jerks and you can hear grinding same with second and third only not as bad fourth isnt so bad and fifth it doesnt do it at all is this the clutch the transmission or both also he didnt get a manual does this particular car require premium gas pic related
  sounds like the transmission is shot it had bearings let go and now under reverse load the gears push and are an heroing
    the jerking probably has a lot more to do with the motor mounts and the fact that the idle is probably pretty shitty    theres a motor mount near the bottom of the radiator that takes a huge amount of abuse and is pretty tiny its quite easy to inspect without taking it apart     the grinding could be a few things im not so certain on that i would make sure the engine lurching back and forth in place isnt contacting anything and that whatever muffler setup you have isnt dragging on the ground     do you have some more pictures
  im getting more he has to send them
  getting some of the engine
  have you checked the breaks recently one of my break calipers got stuck and the car jerked in 1st and 2nd making grinding noised that decreased as i got into higher gears might be an easy fix
  nah just picked it up today i drove it home because hes not as experienced with driving a manual since it was dark by the time we got back we havent had much time to inspect it fully
  try to prop it up some time and check if all the wheels spin easily in the meantime tell your friend to check if one of the brake discs looks worse than the rest just an idea
/o/ why do you hate this
im not interested in highly regulated samemobiles racing at high speed amateur rally is more fun to watch
motogp at least allows some interesting different ideas amateur time attack and the like is much more fun to watch
manufacturer does something slightly different   ban ban ban ban
  this    over regulated to fuck    might as well be just 20 of the same car
  boring
i dont hate it its just boring  this country only watches it because of max and if everyone would drive like him it would be interesting properly on the limit very ungentleman like as a competition should be out for blood during the game being civil outside of it
but i love it
  wrong on so many levels
  im sorry you dont agree with my opinion but i find it boring perhaps you should throw in some regulations to ban my opinion
if all cars are the same how come some are noticeably faster
  aerodynamics dummy that doesnt make them not boring they still have to abide by the same regulations as everyone else which is why people find them boring   the variety is in the body lines how fucking exciting if youd like to clue me in on more about it go right ahead because i care little to research something i have no interest in
  theyre almost the same you have to look for the details if they would remove the liveries it would be very hard to differentiate between them
  are you serious
im sure key differences in the vehicles are kept hidden     anyway american fag here and i like f1 and indy car rally is great but has no coverage here
  its popular cant like it
  dont regulate his opinion now
  they are not the same f1 is not a spec series  the manufacturers all have to abide to the same very restrictive set of rules though which produces very similar overall results  the differences lie in the little things and in the small loopholes of the regulations many parts may be shaped differently or be completely absent on some cars and there are plenty of things that you dont get to see under the bodywork that are completely different between cars    you can see the insanity of the regulations yourself right here    open the technical regulations tab and have fun
theres more passing in a single wec race than the entire f1 season
  too late other posters have lodged a formal complaint which will be reviewed and likely investigated by the moderating body leading to changes in the regs for the next thread
  theyre not the same but even if they were there are still numerous other factors that make cars faster than others this is why even in spec series you can see which cars have a handle on things while others flounder
all drivers cars and circuits might as well be the same
  in the 1970s it became very obvious that there werent enough rules andorganization and the sport was far too dangerous with many horrific and senseless deaths though the racing was great we are at the opposite end of the pendulum now    the cars are regulated to the point where all cars look and are built identically but the teams with more money are able to push loopholes and technology to the point of dominating everyone else everything looks the same but you always know who will win its literally the most boring outcome possible in this situation
  no f1 deaths in years  still sully the cars with the fucking flip flop
because he died    every winner after 1994 became unworthy of their prize because they didnt have to compete with this man
  imagine where we be with no regs
i fucking love f1 people bitch every time any 2 minute span of racing isnt an all time classic moment as if any other sport is somehow magic every time anyone plays it     the cars a fast the racing is as good as its ever been the drivers are cool fuck /o/ f1 is fun to watch
    now they have to contend with daniel ricciardo
    theres a point where humans couldnt keep up with the machinery it would have to be semi autonomous or youd have multiple deaths a year
    cars are built identically    do you even pay attention to f1 do you understand why mbamg is so dominant and mclarenhonda is a joke this is literally a golden age of race track to driveway engineering with deconstructed turbocharging effective packaging and performanceoriented hybrid systems
  that really dosnt seem that restrictive most other major series are either nearly this restrictive or require homologation and then have to grapple with those regs     f1 has produced some incredible cars in the last few years
  youre contradicting yourself anon
  hello there fia shill
  so instead of pushing the limits and mechanical systems and advancing driving aids and safety equipment we nerfed it all and called it a day over and over again    nascar already exists if you just wanna see the same car in 100 different colors
    mercedes actually has a turbine a few mm back which helps them lower their center of gravity by a lot
    wut
f1 used to set the trends    now f1 just follows the trends    also boring
sadly /o/ is full of underage weebs pavement princess and stop light ricers that thinks /turnleft/ is the pinnacle of automobilism and engineering
  i dont its been a decent season as was 2017
    i only follow f1 because i like to shitpost together with /f1/ on sp
its become nascar
  car development in nascar is even more bullshit than f1
  for real
  literally not even close to prosts skill
  overtakes you  locks wheels  gives you the finger  nothing personal kid
  imo he was third best after fangio and schumi
i dont i love it but its just hard to really get into in the us because most of the races happen in the middle of the night pst or at the ass crack of dawn i dont like watching replays of motorsport so i have to follow it through recaps mostly still one of my top 5 sports to follow
  this theres no action just followtheleader youre lucky to see one good battle per race in current f1 meanwhile in v8 supercars or dtm the cars are side by side through every other turn    i personally always preferred touring cars to formula racing but at least old f1 had the spectacle aspect of controlling manual turbo lagging 1000hp machines with no driver aids
    no youre a dumbass who doesnt pay attention to f1 and the engineering did you know that mbamg split their turbo which allowed for similar power delivery but much better packaging so they had better aero down the straights and better weight distribution mclarenhonda was a shitshow because mclaren kept asking honda to change certain dimensions to fit with the chassis but honda wouldnt do it out of pride so mclaren was left trying to make stuff fit where it couldnt and the car was unreliable as a result    f1 is not identical the cars are very different and thats why some are dominant and some are terrible even though some drivers are far from fantastic and some are just awesome
  wow i missed this
    the cars are also slower and much tougher in dtm/etc than in f1 you can bump in those series and it just cause a scrape but a bump in f1 and the car would fly off the track and into a barrier
  he was already washed up when he died silly
    he took pole in his last race and was leading before he crashed
  yes i know of course thats why i said i prefer touring cars to formula cars they make for better racing
    but the drivers are worse in f1 you make a mistake thats the race in dtm or whatever you make a mistake and thats 3 positions that can be made up on 2 laps
  interesting different ideas  yeah aprilia sure had an interesting idea on blaming bautista and bradl for that bike being absolute shit two great riders fired for getting way more out of that bike than it should have been aleix has statistically done worse and is going on his third season with them     i still enjoy watching formula 1 just to see the technical marvels that are the cars but i wont be as dedicated until the cars can follow better and there can be more legitimate racing maybe the 2021 regulations will fix it
  because the race is largely decided by who has the best qualifying lap it lacks an element of unpredictability that cheaper motorsports have  villaneuve was right its just the worlds fastest parade
  this i love the technology that goes into f1 cars theyre fucking marvels  but its just more fun to watch a 2 liter hatchrocket hoon around a forest and almost crash on every corner
  and he died on the 4th race of the calendar dnf early races first season racing for williams  schumi was dominating from start to finish a legend was born
  an unlimited open wheel series would probably be really exciting but would also probably go the way of group b rally after the body count of a couple seasons
  thats pretty much what hillclimb is and the body count isnt that high with modern safety equipment its somewhat safer than the group b days    
  yeah but hillclimb is against the clock an unlimited open wheel on a circuit against other drivers would be an entertaining blood bath
  not saying other series arent restrictive im just saying f1 is one of the most restrictive and that is a direct cause for the cars to look pretty much the same to the untrained eye  even lmp1s reach similar levels of restriction but they are left with a bit more freedom than f1 and the class is going extinct anyway
  i think what hinders f1 and a lot of other upper tier racing is a combination of both regulation and cost youre not going to be as reluctant to stuff a jumped up family hatchback as you are a multimillion dollar purpose built machine
  also the sheer amount of skill and concentration it takes to get a modern f1 car around a track without dying doesnt leave a lot of room for crazy brass balls maneuvers
  i think if f1 had an unlimited speed run championship itd be tits  end of the season everybody gets to do whatever the fuck you want to your car then youve five laps to set the best damned time you can around a grand prix track  do you blow the fuck out of your car and hope the driver can handle it or do you build a car you know he can handle and hope his talent bridges the gap
  iirc in moto gp all use the same ecu for the fuel injection now
its really restricive also they say that it is the most advanced  lmp1 would apply better for manufactures as they have to fast but reliable they do one f1 season in 24 hours in terms of advancing production cars lmp1 would be the better platform  plus lmp1 looks more like a car than f1
  have you not been paying attention  at least six drivers have been brained
  but their engines and bikes are different  ducati and honda have a v4 but the ducati is way better on the straights  suzuki uses a i4  yamaha a crossplane i4
  schumi  unworthy  lynch thyself knave
    werent the dnfs from mechanical issues
  its fucking boringi had to find back markers in shit cars like kamui kamikaze kobayashi to root for when i attempted to give a fuck years ago
  virtually impossible to claim that one professional driver is better than another when their cars arent identical winning in a superior car is no testament to driver skill
  dnfs were from spins early season 1994 williams was very nervous because the chassis was design to have active suspension
  implying pole and a few laps lead is enough to win races     senna took pole in all the other races too but still managed to dnf the car each time
  werent the dnfs from mechanical issues  sennas dnfs in 94 were from spinning himself out or dying
  that really dosnt seem that restrictive     dude there are like 25 pages of bodywork rules alone lmp1 regulations only have 11 pages
  also the nose was too low to the ground constribuitng to instability      it should be said that the b194 also was borderline undriveable by anyone other than schumacher
small tap  10 sec penalty lol
  i agree not sure you interpreted my post correctly
  colin chapman would be alive today building lotuses that can distort time and space in order to gain a 03 sec a lap advantage
  the eternal kraut  worthy
  max  civil outside of races  hes a fucking river nigger
  hes a hot head and a cunt outside of the race yes hes got a lot to learn   i just meant his way on the track thats how its supposed to be how he behaves outside of it shouldnt be seen as good
  not as good as alain the living legend prost
  people who rate senna over prost   people who rate hamilton over clark
    because the whole show romanticizes itself for fans like  who dont actually watch the races to see how boring it really is these days
  that wasnt even me faggot youve also only proven my point the cars all are almost identical does that suit your fanboy autism better if they were all grey you wouldnt be able to tell them apart they all use the exact same heavily regulated formula and setup only minute loopholes in aero and drivetrain allow wealthier teams to dominate lower ones i literally knew all of that theyre all v6 turbo hybrids rwd more than 733kg unladen 8spd paddle shift gearboxes with kinetic and heat energy recover systems they are virtually identical with only the minutest of details being exploited being ableto be exploited by the wealthiest of teams who predictably win every time you have literally supported everything i said in my post
  i dont hate it i love it
  there is literally nothing interesting about a group of exactly the same car with different stickers racing if i wanted to watch that id watch spec e30 or some shit
  every single car is different you mong
  you are definitely gay and they are all virtually identical especially to the casual viewer which f1 is severely lacking these days
rally is much more interesting also the drivers all seem like pricks to me
  what are you even saying you cant even make a simple plan
kind of amusing to read the f1 haters whining cos they are basically too dumb to comprehend how the cars and drivers differ and too stupid to understand and enjoy the sports complexities and subtleties yet can jackoff like petshopmonkeys to a bunch of primitive actuallyidentical cars rattling around an oval circuit for a tediouslylong time    like it or not f1 is the most technicallyadvanced most popular and most global motorsport in the world    still just as /o/ hates most cars its motorsport fans seem to hate most motorsports
  basically too dumb to comprehend how the cars and drivers differ  bunch of primitive actuallyidentical cars rattling around an oval circuit
  you wouldnt be able to tell me which one was a ferrari or a mercedes or a whatever if they werent in different liveries you twat
  still just as /o/ hates most cars its motorsport fans seem to hate most motorsports    /o/ isnt /sp/ if you wanted some actual discussion you shouldve posted a thread over there
  fucking kek
  im not fan of open wheelers in general also i prefer rallies
  t boomer      its different by a few mm
but i dont    
    no discussion on low regulation series is complete without this video  
regulation to keep things cheaper is important although i feel like it should only matter for things like rallycross and lemons maybe they could just cap cost instead
  is this a copypasta or are you really that much of a faggot    actual discussion about motorsports or racing vehicles on /sp/  yeah nah they just like kimi and car go vroom and who gets more points over there
  yet can jackoff like petshopmonkeys to a bunch of primitive actuallyidentical cars rattling around an oval circuit for a tediouslylong time  god damn i love you npcs
  ah yes the greatest fourwheeled shitpost the world has ever seen
  lmao this is underrated
  tfw you can no longer tell actual redditposting from ironic redditposting
  the offical wrc stream is the best option for watching everuthing else happens on a delay
  nigga he was leading the race and the standings when he died wtf is wrong with u
to much regulations brand and (((sponsor))) influenced advantages mostly spoiled rich kids running and is boring af    no one ever will never be able to start from the bottom as a poorfag prodigy wrencher warrior and pull an aj foyt
  exactly people dont grasp how unearthly fast unregulated f1 would be   the development race would last a single season before they reached the limit of human reflexes and gforce endurance the tiniest mistake would be fatal the sport would immediately lapse into a contest of who can keep their driver alive the longest with drugs/cybernetic enhancement being the new dawn  and spectators would be even more out of the loop amazing yet dull as fuck    f1 is no longer a race to the moon its now a game and theres no going back spend the teraflops developing the rules not on individual cars  that appears exactly what theyre doing the next couple years will be interesting
  contest of who can keep their driver alive the longest with drugs/cybernetic enhancement being the new dawn  lets fucking do it
  this nigga gets it
    drugs and cybernetic enhancement  my two favorite things
  unearthly fast unregulated f1 would be  unregulated  lets try that actually i literally believed as a kid wed have flying f1 cars by now kek  
  my guess is f1 would be over by the second unregulated season because there would be such a massive tech and performance gap between the rich teams and the not so rich teams that it wouldnt even make sense for the latter to participate    we wouldnt even get to the point of those fancy sci fy wet dreams because either too many drivers die or too many teams bail out of the championship for lack of money to compete    as long as it would be extremely interesting to watch unregulated motorsport just to see what crazy things they would come up with it rarely produces any interesting racing because as always who has more money get the better stuff and at that point any form of competition is over
  not implanting an engine in your chest that keeps you alive and also powers your car
  what are spending caps alex
  then its not unregulated stacy
  
  cuts and rams cars at first turn  furry avatar  terrible early 00s stock techno
  in the last like 20 years its been jules and that woman both from marussias and massa but halo wouldnt help there aside from that even if you say 6 thats six in how many other hundreds of drivers since the 80s not even since the beginning but since the 80s
  is that the lady who flew into a tent    thats fucking crazy she survived
  i dont its just boring
  i think its only been 6 driver fatalities from 1986
  yeah nah they just like kimi and car go vroom and who gets more points over there    far better conversation than /o/     racecars themselves are technically /o/ but you try talking technical stuff with brainlet busriders whose entire knowledge of cars comes from pop culture media
  he was leading the standings    not he wasnt he scored exactly 0 pts that whole season because he dnfd all of his races
  racecars themselves are technically /o/ but you try talking technical stuff with brainlet busriders whose entire knowledge of cars comes from pop culture media    so much this with a few honourable exceptions edgy 12younderageb have spread like cancer from /b/ and /pol/ into every board wish theyd packup their big wheels and fuck off
  who is saying there should be literally 0 zero rules fucker
  stfu you fucking reddit cunt just because the fucker died because his crew didnt weld his steering column properly doesnt mean we all have to suck his dick and praise him as the best
    yeah were flooded with retards rn but at least the core /o/tists who are left know whta theyre talking ive been to f1 general all of them dont know anything about cars
    yeah because his cars were crap they were the mclaren honda of that era
  before they reached the limit of human reflexes and gforce endurance  they could do that after a week generating downforce is really fucking easy when there is nothing you cannot do
    technicallyadvanced  lmp1 would take that title    most popular  nascar would take that title    most global motorsport  autocross would take that title    but in reality f1 is very misunderstood because on the outside it looks overly regulated and technically boring but when you pay attention to the sport you realize that its very complex and interesting right now were in a golden age of paddock to dealership motorsport engineering but its hard to see that when all we hear about are the drivers and the halo and the bickering over the v6 and the hybrid system but if you take a step back and look at f1 and then look at production cars we have several performance v6 options because it offers better packaging and lower cost and several performance hybrids that work in tandem with ice and these same companies are working on f1 powertrains honda ferrari mbamg     also there are a lot of people that dont realize that mbamg rocked the f1 world when they debuted one engine to sell to other teams and then used a completely different engine for its own cars if youre not aware the engine they sold had the turbocharger intact and mounted in front of the engine whereas their engine was mounted in the vee with the turbo split on each end of the turbo and connected by a propshaft this seems overly complicated but it gave them a lot more freedom and opportunity with packaging the car so they had better aero and better cooling than every other team including the ones who bought and ran their engines through the year other teams tried to copy this but it never panned out
  lmp1 would take that title  hahahahaha  in terms of icu development f1 is far ahead of that curve
  i type all this out because people who consider f1 as boring are right if you want wheeltowheel bumping grinding rockabilly racing then it never will be in line with your interests but if you want racing with very technical engineering differences and teams that cheat the rules in interesting ways and technical racing and lots of politics everywhere then a person will enjoy f1
    intensive care unit or do you mean ice or do you mean lmp1 builds cars that are not only fast but also supple enough to allow for several hour stints and modular so repairs can be done in short amounts of time while f1 cars are trashed after catching a pigeon in the wing there is more to technically advanced than just the 6 cylinders of the engine especially when youre talking about the porsche 919 that has electric motors stuffed in the front wheels and has a combined output of 1160hp and set the lap record at spa
  thats what unregulated means you stupid homo
  real life redline minus the weapons  id watch
  what title would rally take
  its irrelevant anyway spending caps are impossible to enforce
  f1 is interesting but the real problem is that paying attention wont guarantee you the full story  most of it comes out years later if at all we get explanations for how the regulations should work but not how the teams actually abuse and skirt them theres no way to share the ingenious engineering with the audience without the other teams stealing it so everyone just keeps quiet    your story about mercs two engines is a good example of inseason reporting its bogus but kinda sorta what happened     mercedes were cleverer than that the rules forced customer and works engines to be identical and they were customers had the same splitturbo and all but the rules didnt say the engine software had to be so merc gave everyone else gimped engine modes in the name of reliability  and thats all we knew until the next year  then we learned through lots of deduction that merc had been using a special qualimode that used the turbo in a brilliant way to boost power for a single lap and they had a trick combustion system that gave huge fuel savings williams had been given the stripped down version and poor mclaren got nothing but an emergency tickover mode merc thought they would be rivals that year you dont have the same fuel oops looks like you have to use the emergency mode sorry they were estimated at the time to be 50hp down but looking back its obvious the deficit was double that if not more    again no one had any idea this was all happening until later and im sure theres more juicy details that wont leak until the next engine architecture
  ironic that youd post that along with a dtm webm those are the most aero dependent touring cars around
  i dont hate it but it used to be better
  porsche 919  set the lap record at spa  4 months later vettel hamilton and raikkonen all lapped 2/10ths quicker
  unfortunately qualifying is what matters the most and sundays are boring as hell  it peaked in 2012
  inwent through the whole reply chain and not once did anyone mention an f1 series with literally no rules ome fag used the word unregulated colloquially so he could talk about some anime scenario with drugs and deus ex cybernetic enhancements  name one1 racing series with literally zero rules faggot    impossible to enforce  have i told you of our lord and saviour blunt force trauma
  some guy says f1 has too many regulations  some other guy thinks of how cool would be to have unregulated motorsport  posts after that are about how short lived unregulated motorsport would be    and you jumped into the discussion of hypothetical unregulated motorsport saying there should be rules in it and now you are sperging because you dont want to admit your comment made no sense in that context
  he doesnt know dhill came second in the championship in the same car that senna died in
  what are you even talking about anon
  he coukdnt name a racing series with zero0 rules  because they dont exist   thats what i thought faggot your hypothetical sucked dick
  it is referred as the internal combustion unit  icu fucking moron
  butthurt so hard he can only focus on that tiny irrelevant part of his post that nobody cared about instead of addressing the rest of the discussion     literally nobody said an actually unregulated series existed you are attacking a point that nobody was defending in the first place it wasnt part of anyones discussion     im sorry your simple mind was too overwhelmed by chain of a whopping 5 posts before starting to sperg about unregulated series not existing     you dont even have an idea on how to enforce the rules you are advocating for
  not him but ive never heard that searching for f1 icu brings up drivers going to the intensive care unit anyway dont they refer to it as the power unit pu
spoiler    i just hope the changes in 2020 bring back some glory to the endurance championship    until then im watching wrc
hey guys eurofag here  whats the best french stock car for drifting  preferably something old that can be cheap 2nd hand
twingo and mcdonalds trays
  france doesnt do driveshafts
  french  drifting  youre looking at old cars for this anon the french havent done rwd in ages   peugeot 404  peugeot 504  peugeot 505  peugeot 604  renault dauphine  renault 8/10  renault twingo mk iii if youre a wizard who can rip out all the nannies  youll have to be ridiculously lucky to find any of these for cheap unless theyre in awful conditions
  they are doing rwd right now with the twingo and the alpine a110 but they havent in a while before
  you might as well call twingo nowheel drive because electronic nannies as i mentioned fuck up the car to the point its idiotproof as for the a110  automatic  into the trash it goes until renault keeps being stubborn which is forever because the french dont have a car culture
  i love manuals and it sucks that the a110 doesnt have one but i heard that the double clutch auto in the a110 is very good for an automatic
  but still considering the a110 costs the same as a cayman or m2 which both have manuals it isnt a great choice especially for drifting  op just get a bmw
  its still an auto a double clutch auto at that theres literally no fun in driving the car
  the renault clio v6 was rwd
  op said secondhand cheap not i have 25k laying around    just get a bmw  besides the fact that he asked for a french car what if he gets something better than mediocre
  then the peugeot 505 is the only real option
  there is something better than bmw   for drifting in europe  youre retarded ok
  yes there is something better over every single fucking body picking a benz or a bmw as a drift car not just because its been done to death but because they are fucking boring unless youre talking about an mseries
  actually you can find a lot more 604s for cheap in france than 505s that is even considering that the used market car in france is complete trash
  have you ever wondered why everyone picks bmws as drift cars and almost nobody drifts m series bmws but modified base model bimmers
  drift off a cliff
  because theyre cheap theyre cheap because theyre utterly rubbish and only social status seeking morons seek them theyre rubbish because theyre boring even as an rwd platform their design has been the same for the last 30 years and the older bimmers have awfully unreliable engines there arent even decent bodykits available for these cars id seriously rather turn a gaz 24 volga into a drift car for twice the cost than drift a bmw  muh schassis  same thing the reason why they drifted it was because it was a cheap platform its fucking overrated at this point especially the 180sxs chassis which tends to cause the car to oversteer due to lack of rigidity in some points namely the pillars this is the reason why drifting started becoming fucking boring because everybody drives the same fucking thing
  so you define car capability for social status and exterior design holy shit dude  for europeans nothing even comes close to the aftermarket and part availability for bmws hence bmw is the standard track day car/drift car all around europe and is very popular even in america and asia  its a well known fact that bmw engines are more than bulletproof you even see japshit drift cars getting bmw engine swaps  aftermarket availability for parts good chassis and strong engines is exactly what people want in race cars/drift cars which is why bmw will always be the default drift car in europe
  well known fact that bmw engines are more than bulletproof  nothing comes close to aftermarket and part availability  mfw  if youre from germany and eastern europe and cant afford any better sure 90 of cars you see at a mechanic here are bmws
  is this opposite day
  guess all the professional drifters with 50000 bmw dedicated drift car builds are idiots then and you know better  what is the best euro drift car then
  and here lies the problem there isnt one  im definitely not trying to undermine the efforts of 50k prepared drift cars even bmws because with 50k you could make a 500 a feasible drift car but saying theyre the best for cheap is bullshit and thats what op needs a cheap second hand rwd car for drifting not one that needs a ton of money and a build to be fun you can have fun in an old rwd peugeot stock you cant in a stock bmw me and a bunch of friends tried and it made drifting boring
  you can have fun in a stock peugeot  you cant in a stock bmw  yeah you cant have fun in a stock x5 maybe youre just retarded
this fucking bmw fag might have never heard about fucking volvos  truly the most underated plataform for drifting  and theres plenty of them un euro
is a lexmoto hunter good enough to use to do the 3 mile round trip to work its 50cc but im way older than 16 so no longer that light any more not after going fast just getting through traffic
  i can get a second hand one for 600 and its rideable on my car licence
hell yeah and its be fun as fuck too
  not too slow
  just buy a bicycle
  got an e bike not powerful enough
  hell no dude youll do at least 35 40 mph if its a two stroke and if its a 4 stroke you might get 45 or 50 out of it if youre not a big fat fuck    dont listen to these idiots i used to fuck with old school mopeds and theres something about going 35 to 50 mph on a bike that weighs 125lbs    youll have a blast
  ive been driving for years but no fuck all about bikes so ill probably want something faster eventually
  i wouldnt mind one of these for my 90 mile round trip to work i have a car but it uses too much fuel cant be arsed with a real bike license traffic means getting over 50mph is rare anyway  you should definitely do it i had a 50cc scooter and it did 45 mph no problems furthest i went was about 50 miles a day and it wasnt too bad 3 miles is nothing  just derestrict it doing 30 on country roads is dangerous
its shit   get the biggest bike you can legally ride presumably 125cc if youre in bongistan  youre a brainlet for even considering this they only exist for 16 year olds who cant ride anything else
  this is how i feel fucking sick of sitting in traffic for 2030 mins to do about 15 miles to work and about the same home id get a scooter/ped but dont want to look a tit    125cc if you do a days riding course called a cbt was just thinking of the easiest option desu
greetings from the usa cucks  this is my starter bike
  lol we can ride anything on a full bike licence but im too lazy and just want to legally ride something on my car licence
  was just thinking of the easiest option desu  easiest option is just doing the cbt and learning
  i guess so thats been what a lot of people say apparently the cbt is idiot proof so it would be just going through the motions
just get a bike for 3 miles jesus christ
    i cant read more than one post
  this people really dont know how to have fun anymore
  you still have to do a cbt to ride a 50cc dummy
have been riding a 49 plated moped thats been upgraded to 72cc for 3 summers im 183cm tall and weigh 100kg never given a fuck it was still pretty okay for 35 km runs even with the gf in the back the suspension wasnt too happy going over speedbumps and did bottom out but otherwise it was totally okay
if you had to pick one car on the market right now to last you as long as possible while costing you as little money in repairs as possible what would it be pic unrelated
  land cruiser
    mazda 3 probably get it before the stupid new redesign
probably something electric taking the bet that battery replacement costs come down over time hybrids are too complex modern ice engines are very reliable but have higher routine maintenance costs
are there any modern cars that are made without these lcd infotainment screens in them anymore im sure those things bring down the reliability of a lot of modern cars since when the screen/electronics break the entire car is fucked
  well anon i have some good news
  genuinely wish this was sold in the us
      is this thing the new twingo
  i work as a bellboy and you cannot imaging how shit this things are among the pack you have     factory gear play  wheel wear  plastics somehow lose colour instantly    on the pos you have    unkillable engine
  toyota corolla
  hey scotty
  uaz 452 uaz 469 or lada niva old tech so everybody knows how to work on them minimum amount of high tech so no malfunctioning immobilizers and such parts are plentiful these cars have been made for decades   the most expensive lada niva is about 18kin finland the cheapest toyota land cruiser is 526k im not sure if uazes are imported to finland but russia is just next door so i theoretically import one from there
a fiat 500
  corolla is the answer     corolla always has your back  corolla never gives up on you
  lemme guess florida i remember seeing this dumb shit recently
  toyota yaris the car would probably outlast me due to my guaranteed suicide upon having to drive a yaris for any extended period of time
  fpbp  you cant afford a reliable car op
fiat 500l
  god why they were so ugly fiat doesnt even sell them anymore
  simple / reliable  those things are complete shit when it comes to dependability

  unironicly tesla model s  mechanicly simple  8 years unlimited waranty  some already well beyond 400k miles and still running  only thing you should avoid is launching hard all the time this fucks your driveshaft reduction gear and bearings over time and supercharging all the time
  so a basic relieable and cheap shitbox
  only thing you should avoid is launching hard all the time    the one redeeming factor in a ev  car breaks when you try to use it    you should also take a look at the tesla forums and all the problems people are experiencing these things are not as simple as you think theyre not golf carts
cant go wrong with a nice 4x4 4runner
  this they cost a fortune but i wouldnt trust anything else in the middle of australia
probably the new suzuki jimny      econoboxes that get scrapped after 4 years  reliable   lol
  mazda  reliable     pick one mazda is below the french italians and even septics now in reliability
  mitsubishi mirage  retard proof poorfag car    apparently not retard proof to keep  from playing in traffic
  man i wish suzuki still sold cars in the us if i had the funds id buy hp logics old jimny in a heartbeat
land cruiser 4runner i live in new england theres not a single more practical vehicle i could imagine unless honda started making non haldex cars
  wheels fall off for no reason  autopilot then guides you into a truck  catches on fire then locks all the doors  explodes sending flaming shrapnel out to immolate other cars
  that one time it happened means it happens with them all
  3dr world countries are filled with them      i drove a newer sandero for quite a while its a cheap car that doesnt hide that its a cheap car the 3 banger shakes the whole car especially the shifter you can see the steering column going trough the firewall if you duck a little loads of room 4 adults no problem
  the transmissions are complete garbage  the body comes with factory rust  underpowered
  buy two exact same models  cut out one vin number  make both cars have the same number  have the running costs of one car  have a spare car and when one breaks down take the other one
  this is a fucking steal wherever this is thats probably without the tax cheapest around here goes for 8000 now i think
  you know that suzuki was also known as geo in america pretty sure the geo tracker is a cousin of the jimny  same with the suzuki swift and or ignis and the geo metro
    well atleast the ones in the finnish army took a hell of an beating and continued to work maybe they are upgraded somehow from the stock ones i dont know but they are the only ones that i have any experience with
  you can do it just not all the time  it is a lot of stress for any car with simmilar acelleration to launch that hard
    tracker  vitara/escudo  samurai/ sj80100130  jimny  chevrolet tracket 9805  grand vitara/nomade    geo metro/chevry sprint  swift/cultus/forsa    anyway suzuki cars are simple and pretty reliable
here is the list /o/ came up with    land cruiser  mazda 3  toyota corolla  a fiat 500  toyota yaris  mitsubishi mirage  4x4 4runner      obvious crap list  silverado obviously overpriced shit  tesla model s over priced garbage impossible to maintance yourself
how are you going to know theyre reliable when theyre not yet tested through time even corollas from specific years have known issues more so per new model release

  the twingo is still being manufactured in its fourth gen but sure one of the engines used in the sandero was in the twingo as well
it occurs to me that this is the perfect motorcycle engine small car swap and i cant find a single example of it  1679cc  65 degree v4  200hp  9000  125 lb ft  6600  2x2x2 cube  shaft drive  beefy 5 speed transmission already in the block  aftermarket heavy duty clutch available   aftermarket superchargers available   there has got to be a ton of wrecked vmaxs  almost every vintage sub 2000lb shitbox has a terrible motor  why not  if im wrong post sauce
bikes work because they dont need to move car weights also the bikes gearbox ratio will suck more than alphonse
  vmaxes are expensive and have a cult following so the price of the bikes and their engines go down slowly it would be a nice choice but there are about gorillion inline4s available for cheap    bike engine swap have been done for ages they work fine in small cars    
its too wide   also bikeengined cars use a chain for final drive in tranverse applications or bolt the prop shaft directly to the output shaft of the gearbox if its longitudal
  what prevents me from taking a transverse bike engine and sticking a driveshaft where the gear was
  thanks
  you could do that on a bike with a chain but the output shaft on a vmax comes out of the back of the gearbox
  so keep it transverse for fe rwd its square anyway      mod the actual driveshaft
  shaft drive  transverse engine  why
  most cars have transverse engines and drive shafts
  thats much more work   which is why no one has done it
  unironically what do you think the mg guy did
2000 jetta vr6 246k km 2400 cad smash or pass
  mk4  almost 250k  shits about to blow up
  into the trash it goes
  hard pass
      why
  250k  well if its held together this long it might be a tough old bird  id have low expectations treat it as the washed up beater it is and get rid of it at the first sign of trouble
  they never make it to 300
  vr6s arent known to be reliable  if you want to put up with rebuilding the engine for preventive maintenance and such go right ahead  if its going to be a daily and you arent going to focus on modifying id pass  dont let /o/ or anyone decide what project car is right for you  i recommend a beat up japanese car if you dont already have a daily
  pass and find a tdi
  not op is tdi diesel im looking for a manual jetta of this gen or previous because a shitbox civic or integra begs to get stolen
  buddy had one back in the day twas a piece of shit the vr6 kinda sorta pulled hard but the rest of the car was a mess the plastic coolant lines need the engine lifted to be replaced
  yes and theyre the best engines vw makes plus torque and 50 mpg
  im going to get one with well under 150k miles anything to look out for
  what year
that would barely be worth over scrap money here 400500
  its not even worth 1000 its not a tdi
  im not sure later 90s2003 or so which ones are best
  i dont know too much about those but i still see a lot on the road and no dpf choking it up so youll be getting better mpgs than my 2014
is there a car in united states that nobody wants to buy
  a 2000 jetta vr6
  i own a 2000 golf tdi  390000km and it runs great alh engine is pretty famous for being reliable
  its not a tdi  this honestly
  be me   own tdi  its comfy as fuck   great on gas  hasnt given me any problems  routine maintenance   mfw   you wont regret owning a tdi
  but its slow
  but its slow  implying i give a fuck about racing
  so get the boost turned up and trade some reliability and empeegees for torks    or you know get something thats actually quick for the weekend
mk4  vr6  enjoy your slow gas guzzling piece of shit that will break down on next day
  if the interior is not bad its a decent deal  makes sure timing chain / guides arent noisy  its just a 12v that year they run forever but get tired after 220k and dont seem to make all the power  get an intake open exhaust a bit and enjoy one of the best sounding engines ever
whats the optimum highway road trip cruising speed   tfw 80mph is max comfy
  whats the optimum highway road trip cruising speed  as fast as your shitbox can go before it starts to shake itself to death which is around 110mph for me
  tfw mine is literally 65
  cant even drive the speed limit on 70/75kmh interstates without your car shaking itself to death  what kind of shitbox are you driving
  he means mph you fuck
  yea sorry i meant mph as well not kph
  85mphish in canada because its fast but not lose your license fast like 100mph 100mph is nice if you get a convoy going and know the hiding spots on that stretch of highway
be american  the average car has 300 hp  buy a 57 supercharged muscle car  go on the highway  speed limit is 70 mph  exceed by 1 mph   get shot by policeman inside his anonymous and impossible to spot car  die  1 week later receive home a 500 fine    usa usa usa usa usa
  20 over what ever the limit is also depends on surrounding traffic if its an empty road or youve got a solid convoy going faster is always better cops are fucking dicks though
  slower than where your car has to make 4800 rpm thats for sure
depends on gearing    if i cruise control at 55mph ill get 40mpg but 70mph i get maybe 32mpg
  it was accelerating
80mph  5k rpm
  my shitbox is geared way too high so in the mountains i get better mileage if i go faster and get as much momentum as i can ive monitored how much fuel is being injected and its definitely more when you lug the engine down
unironically 80kph is comfy as fuck
  i get best gas mileage around 75 mph so i usually just leave it there unless i see cops
  in the states its definitely 80mph which is unfortunately illegal everywhere except maybe montana
  be western european  average car has 100150 hp  buy 15 audi  fuck up suspension on speedbumps every 3 meters inside residential areas  go on highway  exceed by 1 km  get tagged by camera/hiding police patrol  receive 20000000000 euro fine and lose license  aint communism grand
100mph
  what about the krauts and their autobahn
  km/h
  theres more to west europe than germany anon
  unfortunately illegal everywhere  i went 2k miles across country at 80mph the whole way
    i had a 3rd gen with a 350 from 1973 swapped into it cammed as well the 4 speed manual with short rear end meant it topped out at about 95mph cruising highway speed was literally about 4k rpm and that constant in that old big v8 was terrifying the first few times eventually you get used to the damn thing screaming at you to slow down
  actually thats not how it works and however speed cameras are indicated so unless youre a complete retard you wont get caught we also dont have cops in civillian cars fining us and shooting us for speeding without the possibility to even notice their presence before getting caughtlol    average car has 100150 hp    yes and still we our highway limits are 81 mph and will be soon raised to 93 mph    still better than driving a car with 400 hp and being limited to 70 mph driving in fear of being fined by ghost cops in the land of the jews    l m a o
  still better than driving a car with 400 hp and being limited to 70 mph driving in fear of being fined by ghost cops in the land of the jews  literally never happens american cops are fat and fucking lazy unless you have warrants or are going 20 over theyre not pulling you over
  idk what country youre in but in norway most roads are 80 kmh not mph  and the highest is 120 kmh  id rather have angry cops who relax because im white instead of fearing for losing my license just because i wanna drive at a decent speed  fuck  this  commie  country
  tfw montana
  i dont want to speed but shit when im on the highway id want to at least go at 120 km/h however most people travel  140 km/h    also the whole in germany there arent speed limits for the highway is a meme because this actually happens on limited traits of the highway infrastructure they still have their 130 km/h speed limit
  didnt they used to have a prudent speed limit back in the day
  be american  drive 5 mph over the speed limit  the government seize your car    
    yeah ive had a few old timers talk fondly of that but ive never really experienced that    honestly around town the interstate drops to 75 and my old ass accord really seems to be comfortable doing 70 so i mostly leave it there    also with the amount of wildlife in this state and how fucking dark the rural highways are at night  its really best not to push the limit
  i know right  every fucking day on my commute theres cucks going the speed limit good thing theres 2 lanes so i can pass but i have to watch out for random popo  one of the reasons why i want to buy a sportsbike speed as much as i want  and i know about the autobahn dunno why youre responding to me about that  also outdated map breh
  im montanaguy    honestly on my 2006 zx6r i have a hard time speeding too much on the highway with the way its geared im at 78k at 80mph and its in kind of an awkward zone where you have to downshift once or twice to really get the power going because the cams dont really come on till 10k or so
  well im not sure what speed id cruise at on a bike being exposed to the air resistance and all  but at least it would grant me immunity to speed cameras and cops since i could just /crankit/ and fucking skidaddle  alas its not viable during rain and winter season  maybe i should just move to germany
  except for florida everyone drives 5mph over the limit minimum cops barely glance at you for 10mph and only pull you over for 15mph over the limit although you do sometimes get old boomer state trooper handing out tickets for 3mph over
  its more about revs than speed top gear at 25k rpm seems to be a sweet spot
  my car is at 3500rpm at 80 and any more than that its a bit loud and annoying    though any faster than 80 and im not cruising anymore
tfw car shakes like its going to explode at 80
  balance your fucking wheels or something ive driven a lot of pretty fucked up and clapped out shitbox cars and trucks and all of them have been perfectly stable at 100mph
  vro how the fuck is your rpms almost 5k at 80 mph do you drive a 250 cc car
  you dont need torque or horsepower just use gearing
  ok dummy
  yeah at 110120 i start questioning my will to live
  thats not how it works einstein you can produce more torque by gearing but not more hp
  what country are you in that doesnt have undercover cop cars
      oh geez oh boy a whole 20 over
  thats what you get for living in a garbage state
  spicy bait
i know this is off topic but is it better for an automatic trans to slam its shifts together instead of the normal slower shifts
  160 km/h 100 mph is perfect for an audi a4 20 tfsi
  tfw mines 85 before the shakes
what are the best vw cars and why is it a tdi 
  jettas are just german corollas but somehow with no german quality and no japanese reliability
how did we went from this  
because normalfags want cars like that  they dont listen to what some autists on 4chan say because you would be the only ones to buy these cars
  car makers dont listen
to this

  literally
  how did you even find one
  im not that guy but i watch his youtube videos hes really chill one of the reasons i bought an aw11 to my slav shithole 8 registered in the whole country apparently lel
  which slav shithole
  pff like im going to dox myself i post my wrenching on my white aw11 in here quite a lot ive actually bought mine on here from a germanbro a certified 4chan mr2
  i was just asking because i live in some slav shithole too so i might be one of these 8 aw11 owners and now that you mentioned yours is white im pretty sure i know who you are also good luck with the bt swap
  bt swap  holy fuck    no matter how much time i spend in here it never cease to amaze me  godspeed anon hope we meet irl some day if we havent already
  tas golf 2
  we havent yet ive got mine just few months ago hope to meet you and your swapped aw11 in june or when the next mr2 meet is
  literally who
  isnt yours red  the plan is having her back on the road in like late february march tops if all goes well so i hopefully make the next meet but itll be a never ending story as im working more and more on that car i see more and more stuff that i would like to swap
  dont forget to swallow
  old bmws  old mercs  old golfs
  yeah it is also how much is the swap going to cost you i would do something simmilar if i had spare money for it   since i have gen 2 bigport i thought about just putting on small junkyard turbo from something common like 18t and run it on low boost with stock na pistons but having custom exhaust manifold etc made would still probably be pretty expensive  potential problems with legal aspect of it
  ayyy now i know  well the engine was 2k  and i dont have details on how much will it cost to put it inside the car yet but i bet itll be about as much probably close to 3k  or more as im doing some mods on the side  i was quoted about 67k  for a rebuilt 16v full rebuild and ported/polished everything which i bet would be about 130hp on the wheels  no idea how are you gonna make the turbo legal tho supercharger maybe if it wasnt registered and photographed yet but turbo i mean you could always just bribe the fuckers which is possible easy and most of the mr2 guys does it but i would be a bit scared of some random pig forcing you to get it checked especially if you arent a bootlicker ive been threatened with that once already and my daily is bone stock    but dont quote me on anything ill deny it this is 4chan
  damn 67k for full rebuild is much more than i expected sadly it was imported here 7 years ago so i suppose it is all photographed already state inpection wise i should be fine since my mechanic has few friends at various testing stations but still im scared of someone forcing me to get it tested as you said luckily it never happened to me yet i guess i could always try to play dumb and say that this is how i got it after repair but that probably would not work lel gze would be cool option too but long term maintanability of the supercharger etc scares me plus i would need to swap pistons install gze ecu wiring harness intercooler and who knows what else but with just small turbo and low boost it should be possible to run it on all stock everything from what ive read guess ill have to live with my stock engine for now and maybe install some more aggressive cams and other invisible mods later    anyway i have to go now we can talk later on fb
  old stolen bmws  old stolen mercs  old golfs with fake gti badges  ftfy
  well idaho and his mechanics arent cheap but they are awesome as hell and do an extremely good job  well if it havent been through new inspection yet it wasnt photographed and that would be a true faggotry since blaming the mechanic can fuck them royaly  guys have one full supercharger and everything in their garage but maintenance was my main drive behind 20v swap instead of supercharger  if you need any 16v parts pm me i have the old engine at home

    bosnia is more civilized and has a higher standard of living than bulgariaalbaniagreeceromaniaserbiamontenegromacedonia
  thats absolute bullshit   t mountnigger   anyway most popular cars here are older vws and recently french cars
  theres actually a lot of 810 year old german big three cars around i know the lol stolden memes but most of them are imported from germany and italy where theyre dirt cheap because of the cost of labor needed to keep them on the road where as here you can have an engine out week long job done for 50100 euros and parts are pretty cheap the car part business is actually pretty developed since almost no one is buying new cars    so yeah the actual reason you see so many older luxury cars in bosnia and places like that isnt lolol they stolded it as much as wages for mechanics are so low you could daily a 30 year old jaguar and the fuel would still cost you more then repairs

why do people who drive manual have a god complex and automatically shit on anything that is auto     coming from someone who drives manual
  because we know were better than retards who cant figure out how to do simple things like shift
modern automatics can be good think pdk even modern slushboxes can be pretty good the lc500 and egg torque converters seem pretty damn good
  because automatic is bad  when you are used to having control over something as basic as your engines interaction with the roads driving something that takes that away is a big shock and makes the driver uncomfortable it is never doing what the driver wants and that makes the driver mad
  good in what sense perhaps in terms of gas mileage and quartermile performance at the higher end but these arent what make a car good to an enthusiast
  probably because they want to show of how much of a superior driver they are i used to shit on slushboxes until i drove one for a year i kind of miss it
  my manual is best  clunk clunk  stfu i think i will switch over to auto s2000 has spoiled me and every manual i test drive fucking sucks
  good as in dont rek themselves quickly relatively to a cvt or a french transmission not fucking dogshit for daily use can handle torks without burning the atf and general fun(((tm)))
poorish uni student who needs to decide between 2005 honda accord and 2005 saturn ion theyre both in my price range and have around 160000 miles both recently inspected i value function a lot more than form since this is just a starter car
  starter car
the phrase starter car doesnt instill confidence    if youre poor dont buy a car
  its not like im bad at driving i got 98 on my license test by poor i mean that im living on my own and paying for tuition and bills at a local college how else am i supposed to get between work school home and hanging out with friends without good transportation
  fuck this not having a car is literally worse than eating nothing but ramen and living in a shoebox public transport is horrendous and literally for criminals and vermin
accord easily its a good car to move around the city
  my vote is accord
how do you measure the right amount of engine oil into the motor    the jug is 5litres and only need 37 i think from the manual    how do you pour the exact in without filling over or under
buy oil jugs with a clear line with graduation marks pic related  if that doesnt work buy a jug with graduation marks and leave it in your garage so you can measure the proper out the proper amounts
but 4 single liter bottles and pour them all completely in there will still be enough left in the bottles that the little extra oil in the pan wont be enough to matter
 weird noise coming from transmission   decide to stop at a transmission place on my way home from work   he asks what transmission   i tell him it is the one that comes with an rb25det   he starts writing rv on his notepad   i say no rb as in romeo bravo twentyfive delta echo tango  he literally writes out romeo bravo 25 delta echo tango  mfw
  thats what you get for interacting with a mechanic literally scum of the earth
going to aamco  these chucklefucks couldnt bleed my 4runner correctly for 4 fucking days until i intervened and showed them the process via the manual
  i got my transmission rebuilt by aamco and honestly had a really bad experience
  my dad has his transmission rebuilt by them as well and it was awful     avoid that place like the plague op and anyone else it took them 3 months turning it back in twice and even now its still trash
        yeah i was pretty surprised with his lack of knowledge on stuff he may have been pretty new but damn i was pretty sure it was coming from my input shaft bearing because the noise only happens when the clutch is engaged and i just wanted some expert confirmation because im a bit of a noob when it comes to this stuff but he never said anything about it and just said i should rebuild the whole thing
  not knowing what transmission you have
  if you can find the actual transmission part number let me know
  most civilians arent familiar with the phonetic alphabet and youre an idiot to assume that they did   you shouldve said something like v as in valentine
  i intervened and showed them the process via the manual
  its an rp71 if you want the part number im gonna need more vehicle info  what is google
  only happens while clutch is engaged  throw out bearing youre welcome
    that would only be when the clutch is disengaged pedal pushed down would it not
    i mean i feel like the concept should at least get across for something like this and saying v as in valentine is literally just a modified phonetic alphabet
  story time  be me  my 350k mile freestar van is whining like a bitch   dont have time to rebuild  take it to aamco because fuck it  2500 later its fully rebuilt  get it back and its hard shifting like hell  bring it back to them and tell them whats wrong  oh sure yeah well look at it  2 weeks later i get the call that its done  they say they found an issue and fixed it at least they did it for free  get it back  its doing literally exactly the same thing  oh well take a look at it again  a week later i get another call  uh actually its the computer it wasnt our fault that its doing this these cars are prone to computer problems  but its exactly the same problem and you guys said it was your fault last time  get the car back i swap the computer get it flashed at the stealership  it didnt make a difference    i just called them back telling them they need to fix my fucking car its been over 2 months now since the first visit never ever take your shit to aamco i should have just rebuilt it myself
  aamco transmission  some shops might be good but in general a lot of these franchise shops have turnover as their contractor mechanics get enough experience to then move to other shops that pay more that basically means you have newbie contractors working on your car as their learning experience they make mistakes in the learning process but no comfort to you as its your car that has all the mistakes
are scion tcs any good    i found a 2014 with 36k miles for 12890 in need of a new car and i kinda like this ive genuinely never heard of these or seen them on the road before but figuring theyre toyota i would assume they have the same relatively good reliability as other toyota cars    anyone have one of these or any experiences
no
  2door camry ride is firmer louder i am not sure how fun this thing is to drive i personally never cared for them
ive only ever seen asian kar gurls driving them
  asian kar gurls    
  i drove a manual 06 tc for about a year was pretty fun but wasnt anyrhing special back seats were predictably cramped but a good amount of storage space i like driving it more than my xa thats for sure
  the ones who think pink interior leds are sikk mawds and show them off at car shows
  these and the hyundai veloster are the most popular cars among the young car people in my area
  theyre ight
  theyre pretty reliable but they are cheaply made rattling shit boxes extraordinaire theyre also very slow very popular with young people but for that money you have so many options like you could get a later 2000s saab 93 or 95 in excellent condition woth low miles for around 5k and it would be a better car allaround for way less money but will probably need more minor repairs things like the thermostat and power window assembly for example are notoriously bad on saabs but it would beat the hell out of driving a scion shit for 12 13k id check out the used lexus market
like why the hell would you buy that scion when you can get an is 250 or es 350 with low miles for the same price    
  recomending saab   the 235/234 drivetrain is great but all the finicky bullshit that happens in these cars is stupid
  yeah i had one for two years and gave it to a friend because the windows kept breaking he hasnt had any trouble with it though apart from the power windows the later 95s are better than the early ones they fixed some shit over the years id still rather drive the saab than a scion tc no contest
  its a nice looking hatchback but thats pretty much it for almost 13k you can probably get a frs/gt86 for just a little more
that seems like a lot of money for that they are also slower than the slowbaru
  76k miles vs 36k miles  reported accidents         why would op not go for the scion over those shitboxes lexus is literally toyota with brand name price
yeah scions are huge plastic rattle boxes nothing soft touch or anything inside i drive an xb for work it actually drives pretty nice and very reliable for my job we beat the shit out of it and its gucci
go out to the car  four goddamned bird shits on it
can any fellow leafs help me with this i got charged for driving with no insurance in toronto and im from quebec didnt pay the fine and now theyre saying i cant access any motor vehicle services until i pay im not going to is this only valid in ontario or can i still renew my stuff in quebec and keep going like nothing happened
  im fairly certain its only valid in ontario might get a little tricky if you get another charge in ontario though
  provinces usually communicate with each other in this regard if youre an ab resident and you get a ticket in bc itll be on your ab file and youll have to pay up quebec might be a bit different because you frogs love to have your own special systems and there may not be crossover but i wouldnt hold my breath    for the future take a photo of your insurance and registration for that matter and also email it to yourself that way youve always got it accessible so long as you have your phone or at least a passengers phone
  quebec has a similar agreement with ontario and some us states op has to pay

friend is 64 220lbs  buys a datsun 620   what did he mean by this
  my dad is 66 and nearing 350 pounds and drives a honda civic    people are just fucking odd
  this thing made my peepee very hard i fucking need one now but it seems i cant find a single one in europe
  height conscious women make no sense
  ex was 49  always wanted a lifted bro truck despite being a mega lefty borderline sjw  go to ram dealer and shes not interested in the 1500 at all only wants a 3500 dually    theory checks out anon
  same just that my car isnt lowered but has a lower roofline than the miata from factory and im one inch taller
  gf  normies get out reeeeeeeeeeeee
  gf  gfmale perhaps
a 90s caprice will be the next car i buy how can any other car compete    they cant
  it could be a roadmaster
  ehh thats fair caprices are kind of rare in my area nowadays so id take a roadmaster or even a fleetwood of similar vintage if thats whats for sale
  i think the caprice has better styling the rear end of the roadmaster seems stunted compared to the largness of every other part if the car
  not liking his taillights w i d e
  now thats a wideboi
i have a 2004 gto m6  my friend has a 2010 335i m6    what are other good options for a true manual sporty tourer for under 10k    pic is my pride and joy
  na straight 6 bmws
  put a manual in the sporty tourer you already have
  which inline 6 na do u favor    mine has the close ratio six speed manual from the corvette     a friend and i are arguing and trying to see if there are better cars out there for the price

will this thing be as capable as claimed it does have a separate frame from the body to give you some roll and flex on tough terrain even though theyre marketing it as skateboard design because commiefornians are dumb i guess    claims to have a payload of 1700lbs and hauling of 11k lbs meaning its better than a tundra off the lot and squarely competing with the silverado and f150 supposedly for 70k so similar price for a fully decked out model     doa or a major go
the frame design
  do they have many concrete facts out about this thing yet or is it all just profected figures and speculation    i cant imagine its range would be anything other than shit if you were actually towing 11000 pounds behind itnot that many people ever would
  they dont have any production models out yet just their prototype which supposedly hits these marks    the supposed 400 mile range is similar to gas trucks so id imagine it moving fully loaded would give you about half that range similar to gas trucks but youre also not losing energy in a transmission
  they might be able to pull it off with a transmission definitely not with a direct drive going down the highway with no headwind wouldnt pull a whole lot of power but accelerating 15k lbs over and over again is going to rape the battery    liions are just a really terrible choice for evs itd kind of make sense if they added a capacitor bank to regen into to take some of the strain off of the battery pack
  the supposed 400 mile range is similar to gas trucks so id imagine it moving fully loaded would give you about half that range similar to gas trucks but youre also not losing energy in a transmission      but accelerating 15k lbs over and over again is going to rape the battery    i think your loss of range under towing would be more drastic than half    the model x is the only electric car i know that has an actual certified tow rating so its the only thing i can draw actual data from but that being said they tested it pulling a 2300 pound road chief trailer and it only achieved 70 of its maximum range add to that the trailer mode disables the regenerative braking and the cruise control     also as the other poster pointed out towing at the weight would rape the battery given the draws needed to get everything going id say youd be lucky to get 3040 of the maximum range if you were pulling am 11k payload with that thing
  yee
  it looks more like crownvic frame with gaps filled than a pickup ladder frame
  double wishbone / multilink  offroad  its meant to be a plush suv   the truck bed is just for looks
  electric cars rely on very low aerodynamic drag to get any range at all a trailer is not designed to be aerodynamic and neither is the load of the trailer the range is going to be poor make fancy trailers for hippies if you want to get rich
cant find the jeep gladiator thread so here it is   what do you guys think
wow that was hard

    yfw chrysler legitimately gets people to shill their vehicles on online forums for money    op do me a favour and suck a cock with aids and then die of aids alone in an alley somewhere    k thanks
just saw a few of them today at the la auto show people seemed to be loving it looks long as fuck     funny thing is that one of them were on a lifted rotating floor and it was so long that the lady who was standing on the edge of the floor had to move out of the way each time it got near here because there wasnt enough room
  sir that language is not allowed on the official fcaendorsed thread
  op utterly blown the fuck out  take your meme cars elsewhere op
    why if anyone knows how to suck a filthy dick its chrysler your cars have been doing it for decades now
  long as shit  truck bed still only big enough to haul maybe three flattened pizza boxes
  i really wonder if these people are paid shills or if people here are stupid to do free advertising for car manufacturers under the guise of shitposting
knowing this day and age id fucking bet money its paid shills dude
  theres no single cab option so it sucks also  fca
  he doesnt want the triple  bro
  why stop there
  make the grille bigger
  jeep made their own avalanche
  no there are paid shills hyundai did it like crazy when the stinger came out and they were met with overwhelming disappointment  because /o/ fucking hated it no matter how hard they shilled    same thing goes with this fca turd no one wants to pay this much money for a v6 turd that has less payload/towing than a honda ridgeline
  imagine this thing as a goddamn limo
please tell me this thing has a nonextendedcab version
  hyundai stinger  post proof of paid shilling or stfu bus rider
  what is it with /o/ and single cabs theyre trash if you ever have more than one other person with you
  why do you drive cars with more than 2 seats
  my truck seats 5 because i take friends/family shooting regularly i could understand wanting 2 seats in a sports car but not a utility/daily vehicle
  when i go shooting with my friends we all take out jeeps  whos fucking stupid enough to go inna woods with one vehicle

those cars  that house  snap   this one is going into my poor financial sense compilation
  disgusting no v8s
  so what kind of person makes the kind of money to afford all that shit and be able to enjoy/drive them t wagefag
  owning more than 1 modified car is stupid anyways you have to drive them all otherwise its not worth owning them unless extremely rare
  overpriced accord
  i guarantee you that those are not owned by one person
  theres a difference between poor financial decisions and spending your money on what you enjoy   i very much doubt he bought those cars as an investment he bought them for pleasure and he gets more pleasure out of having four nice old cars and a small but nice house vs having a much larger house and having to make compromises on his auto collection   just seems like he has his priorities in line if hes actually spending money on things that make him happy
  one to daily one to build for track

  are you sure thats the back of the car
  this photo doesnt even do e bodies ass justice they look fucking great from behind
  nope
  hmm the fins facing forward would protect the windshield from deer or pedestrians from hitting the windshield
  no rsx rear end looks like a supra with too much plastic surgery done

what tires is this going to use i mean 10k is 5 times as much as the chiron
  i was thinking about this the other day do these things just shred tyres like a super bike or are they usually gentle on the take offs
    until i see one in a showroom its vaporware
  its fucking vaporware and a marketing meme if it comes out its not going to make 10k nm
  nothing gentle about a 060 in 19 secondstime
the sneaky cunts mean wheel torque not engine torque which is never really used by manufacturers in published figures
  im talking about the model s pretty sure its top trim puts down 1000nm or close to i know it has different driving modes but the motors must be pretty harsh on the rubber
  i dont know what i do know is that i rented a p100d for 1 week and i didnt get used to the acceleration it tickled me every single time and whenever i wasnt the one driving on every launch i was having a small panick attack   the build quality itself was surprisngly low i thought it was just rumors but i never felt like i was driving a 120kcar there arent many supercharger stations in germany one every 30kilometers or so charging took 30 minutes there and around 7 hours in normal ones
  wheel torque  so a ww2 truck with insane gearing can make 10000 nm  fucking musk
  even my shitbox puts whooping 2000nm of torks to the wheels
  5min battery life  12 mile range  i wouldnt worry about it
    maybe if you use jack as transmission
  if youre in ludicrous mode or track mode yeah youll probably find that the tires are the main limiting factor on the current gen performance teslas
  this a boosted civic can make 1000nm of wheel torque
isnt it illegal to make false performance claims
    france attempted complete takeover of nissan     what does /o/ think about this
  french government trying so hard because its the largest shareholder of renault if nissan sells much more than renault then nissan should be the top of this alliance
this timeline sucks
french gubment is already beyond hope with the way they forced psa to employ so many rapefugees until a factory had to close
  you are aware that is actual fake news
  are you aware they are rioting in the streets
nissan is pitiful and they were once considered the cool car company
you may only post itt if the manufacturer of your car has won both wrc and le mans     not so fast literally bmw
  can i shit on bmw too
peugeot  toyota  volkswagen  ford  renault    still a pretty damn big list
  won le mans does this even count its hard to lose when you are alone in class
  kek
  it wouldve won against competition before that if it didnt break half a lap before finish so its not like they were slow
  i know but their only win is like win at special olympics
  youre more likely to shit yourself into a tree
  why you so mad though
  pretty shit analogy     its more like winning the olympics when all the other athletes already went home
  its not meant to be a very exclusive list otherwise only a handful of people would be posting     it is supposed exclude a many large manufacturers along with bmw the list includes   mercedesbenz   gm   honda   nissan   fca   mazda   mitsubishi   hyundai/kia   citroen   volvo   subaru   jaguar
i have a b1 passat which is essentially a audi
3 le mans  5 wrc    toyota literally a shit
  how about winning f1
  world endurancechampionship  you won because you are the last one standing  what wrong with this
  tfw celica gt owner  should i go for st185 or st205  are the pop ups worth it br/o/s
  add parisdakar rally and it is only vw and peugeot
  thats a thread for another time 
  yup good old ferrari beating ferd
  what about touring cars and how come toyota has 0 f1 vicotires despite competing since 2002
    no one cares     and toyota hasnt been in f1 in almost a decade dummy
  no one cares  this is some next level coping
hey all my blower motor stopped working i purchased a new blower and i even replaced the blower motor resistor the other day i hit a bump and it began working for a little bit but then it stopped working the very next day im thinking theres a loose cable or something whats the best way to fix this problem and will a mechanic fix it for less than 100
  i hit a bump and it began working for a little bit but then it stopped working the very next day  this sounds like the motor brushes could be the problem do you even have a multimeter sounds like you dont and you are just guessing and changing parts a tester could show you inmediatelly where is the problem
  unbelievable 2 months of searching and i find the answer to my problem from 4chan
  climate switch and a big wallet spanking for not removing the blower and powering it so see if it worked before replacement electrical work sucks but you gotta learn it   learn voltage drop and how to back probe
when will the big grille meme end when will car designs calm down with the edges and angles and just go back to being good
  when evs become mainstream
youd buy one  if you could afford it
nope
nah i wouldnt
  yyoure just ppoor    gee where have i heard that argument before
calling others poor  posting the poorfag tesla
driving a fancy electric car in louisiana
i wouldnt ever get one
im a petrol head
no there are no chargers within a hour drive and the trees on my togue need some co2
why would i do that i could buy so many cool cars with that money
i wouldnt because i would have no way to charge it i dont have a garage or even a driveway i have to park on the street and i dont even always have a spot right in front of the house
if i wanted to be a total faggot i would get onebut im not so i wont
i seriously wouldnt even drive one if someone gifted it to me
  i wouldnt touch tesla with a barge pole there are much better bevs out there from the likes of nissan and renault
where would i take it to get serviced
4door  fake economical car  no
  i can afford it and no i wouldnt
  i dont live in poverty so no
    marketing methods are a carbon copy of each other  both overpriced for what you get  both present their products as social symbols rather than tech tools
  i cant deal with as limited range car it might make a cool se ond or 3rd vehicle if i had the money for that but if i had the money for that id get something else probably
sure id also burn giant piles of cash if i could afford it
choke on a wheelbarrow of gorilla dicks op
  no i would rather put the money towards a house then another house an infinite supply of houses
  i want to see the dumb scifi truck theyre planing
  never driven one but im into downshift rev matching and loud exhaust noise would prob be good for getting groceries and commuting in heavy traffic other than that no
  nope id buy an electric porsche rather than to buy that soulless piece of shit better yet id buy a bollinger if i could afford it
  nah if were going with the starting price id rather buy a quattro a3 sedan
the amount of cool interesting cars you could have for this price the chance of me choosing a faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot tesla is zero
  it would definitely be on my radar if i could actually afford and justify a new vehicle purchase if they can actually get the price down to 35/40k i can live with the interior dash setup but im more concerned with how appleesc tesla is with their vehicles and i know if i buy one im committing to that kind of relationship but a lot of higherend luxury vehicles have gone the same route and its not like anyone else in the auto industry is better when it comes to software im already sold on evs after living with a cheap one for over a year now and the main selling point of the model 3 is real usable power and decent/aboveaverage handling i much prefer performance over luxury features and thats hard to find in the market right now without the price skyrocketing with the new m2 starting at 60 grand i dont think there are many new under warranty cars that can compete with a model 3 when it comes to performance vs price other than maybe a gt stinger
    technology is no substitute for build quality     have you even looked at one up close theyre an absolute fucking mess
  elon pls go go post on a soilent board they all love tesla
i looked up the price of one theyre like 37500 for the standard rwd after the tax deduction  actually seems like a pretty good deal i wonder if it can do a burnout
i tried buying one and the retards couldnt do basic shit like give me a signed purchase agreement to show my credit union to get my loan approved i sent my delivery rep a nasty email and they refunded my 3500 i bought a bmw instead
if you were rich you would buy this
evs are gay they make no noise literally a souless cuck mobile
hey wondering if this bumper is ok and i wanna see if i can replace it for cheap dont know anything about cars but this mustang is pretty cheap at 5k and i wanna buy it
why would you want to buy a v6 mustang and pay 5 grand for a damaged one at that
get one at ass junkyard
  not even the 37 cyclone vee6 in the trash it goes
redpill me on diesel
what is that trick called where you poop in the top part of the toilet  the tank i mean
  upper decker
good     tough engines/last forever  good fuel economy  can run off of fryer/veggie oil  lots of torque and low end power    bad    take forever to warm up in winter  when the fuel injection system fails its expensive   diesel cars are harder to make high hp than a gasoline car    im not big on diesel cars but trucks especially 3/4 and 1 ton i prefer diesels usually
    double decker
  upper decker    imagine the puzzlement some people faced when they flush and see brown water come out
        do americans really do this
  totally theres no way people would just lie about things online
  only for shits and giggles  dont germans have some weird poop shelf in their toilets to inspect after they log out
    tldw buy a petrol
    im canadian if it helps but yeah especially bush parties here in alberta if the worst anybody wakes up to is a double decker youre doing well    overseas isnt better last time i went to germany some old lady came out of a public washroom screaming and someone smeared fucking shit everywhere in the stall
  i am not clicking on some upper decker poop scatty video
  whats this called
  hes the most redpilled man in the car world
  i dont like it when that man asks me to ring that bell and then he looks straight at me for what seems like an eternity
  stopbuyingmercedesjpeg
  that picture is fucking freaking me out
  are they shitting on him and he is tied up so he cant do anything about although i do beleive this is exactly what he wants
  yes and yes
prechamber injection  good  direct injection aids
  thats really fucked up man sometimes i wish i can be this free minded but i am just way too conservative when i think about it in the long run
  some people have always done fucked up things just focus on you
  just be yourself anon
  i dont want to be myself
  it is perfectly natural wtf fucking nazi bigot
  it is drumpft
    germans have some weird poop fetish 80 of all scat porn comes from there  brazil is the other 20
  good  can last a while if properly maintained  better fuel economy than gasoline  torque  bad  forfuckingever to get to operative temperature  when something fucks up its expensive  literally all its good for is fucking torque  no hp unless turbo/fuckall hp even with turbo  low rpm redline 4k are you fucking kiddine me  beginning to get banned/scaled back especially older diesels which means abysmal resale value  literally useless if you live even in a moderately sized city  verdict dont buy a fucking diesel unless you live in rural areas need to make very long trips or need an heavy duty vehicle
   hp unless turbo/fuckall hp even with turbo  every diesel car that isnt 50 years old has a turbo and many of the can reliable make insane power a 535d bmw can for a pretty low cost make considerably more power than an m5 while still getting 4050mpg
  dont forget japan      germans and japs are really some kinky fuckers
  wut
  how do you know so much about scat films
its a scam youll pay through the nose when the fuel pump / turbo breaks get a shitbox and convert it to lpg/cng
  that isnt 50 years old  they were selling na diesels until ten years ago not back in 1968  reliable insane power  lmao  a 535d can make more power than an m5 for a low cost while getting 40  50 mpg  i might hate bimmers but im informed enough to know just how delusional that is
  where do you think 2 girls 1 cup came from it from the brazil porn studio mfx  and yea i forgot about japan its probablymore like  40 german  40 japan  20 brazil
  yeah man so delusional no way a diesel can put down any actual power lmao  
  do that race from a roll and see what happens diesels are pigs on the highway
  drag race  lmaoing at your everything only brainlets take drag racing as a measure of anything other than i can accelerate fast on a completely straight line with no obstacles cope harder
  if driver skill was the same it would stil l bethe most likely determining factor in a race with curves and obstacles
  every single race in that video is from a rolling start what the hell man
  strokeposting  nice    it obviously puts down more power than all of those cars why do you think it couldnt beat them on a track with equally skilled drivers  this level of mental gymnastics just because you dont like diesel cars  seems like youre the one coping
  other than your awful spelling no it fucking wouldnt because diesels are heavy duty engines that would regularly get fucked on twisties and highways like they currently do    starts from a stand still  clearly a rolling start brah  pic related
  it puts down more power so it can beat all those cars on the track too  you must be 18 to post on 4channelorg
  starts from a stand still  can you point out to me exactly where in the video i linked they start from a standstill
  wtf is strokeposting
  you seem to have a shit fetish the way you pull out numbers out of your arse
  at the very beginning of every race especially evident in the third one against the benz
  a 3 series could never beat an e class or a c class on a track  why wouldnt it if it has a good suspension and a nonretarded driver it could do pretty well on a track just to clarify i never said gas engines are bad or that diesel is the best at everything but you brainlets hate diesel so much that you cant even see what happens in a very clear video
    not a shit fetish but a messing fetish which is more tame
  jesus christ man are you blind and deaf they take off from the start slowly nowhere close to full throttle go side by side and maintain a set speed then they start the race against the c class and the gtr you can even hear him honking 3 times to signal the start of the race fucking hell mate youre beyond help
  forgive me if sound quality is so shit that you cant hear anything other than the awful sound of a coal rolling engine
  you can also see it but i guess you might have eye cancer from all the straight piped diesel cars that pass you 
  because diesel engines are only good for torque torque wins acceleration races everything else wins every other race im not saying it cant do well but it cannot compete with the numbers of gasoline engines especially on the more curvier tracks where the low redline fucks diesels over
  a roll race usually 60xxxmph not 20whatever in that video
  especially on the more curvier tracks where the low redline fucks diesels over    
    god maybe i should move to where you guys live where theres a racetrack that goes all over town  i never even said that a diesel should be a track car but for a daily its great because it gets good fuel economy and it can make amazing power you dont need to be able to outcorner a caterham to have fun in a sedan with good power and just the fact that a 15k 335d can even compete with a tuned gtr should tell you all you need to know
  honestly i find that to be more of a cruise than anything no one not even the f250 is even fucking trying
  its shit even for a daily especially in bigger cities where youre not going to find much use for a low redline torquey engine and as mentioned big metropolitan areas are starting to ban them theyre literally only good for long trips or on heavy duty engines
  but do you want to be a man who gets off on being shat upon
  in bigger cities where youre not going to find much use for a low redline torquey engine  what the fuck are you talking about that sounds even more useable for a diesel than a gasoline car do you always rev your hayabusa swapped smart fortwo to 16000rpm before reaching the next red light a hundred meters up
  diesels are still just annoying to drive yes they can be fast but theyre still a diesel i can show you plenty of videos of brotrucks smoking gtrs and bmws but that doesnt change the fact that theyre shit to drive      theyre definitely going over the speed limit for that road thats realistically how quick the average ferrari or porsche drive will ever drive which is why i dont get the point of those cars on regular roads
  insecure fags using them as status symbols me and a friend have gone faster on the local downhill in a 12 clio for fucks sake
  diesel is bad because its a diesel  you do realize that thats not an actual reason them being annoying to drive is completely anecdotal and is really only your personal opinion  gas cars are still annoying to drive yes they can be fast but theyre still gasoline i can show you plenty of videos of gasoline cars smoking this or that but that doesnt change the fact that theyre shit to drive
  shit powerband  shit torqueband  smells like shit  heavy engines  get to smell vaped pig piss everytime you walk out  pigs on the highway    enough reasons to anecdotal for you
  you want a fucking anecdote i fucked your mom nigger
  ssshhh itll be okay id be upset too if i had to drive a 09l diesel every day
  resorts to insult when hes been proved wrong knowing he has no way to counterargue  glad we could come to a definite answer op if youre reading this dont buy a diesel if you dont need to do long trips haul stuff or dont want to come across as a gigantic faggot
  shit powerband  a good diesel engine pulls very well and strong from a standstill and all the way up to 200300kmh depending of course on the engine just because they have a flatter powerband not as peaky as a gas engine doesnt make it shit except in your personal opinion  shit torqueband  again not as peaky but much much stronger than any comparable gasoline car  smells like shit  good thing the exhaus comes out behind the car and not into the cabin  heavy engines  literally doesnt matter at all in a daily unless youre severely autistic  get to smell vaped pig piss everytime you walk out    pigs on the highway    this is similar or faster 100200 than a v10 m5  the m5 does 100200 in around 91 sec many of these are doing it in less than 9  
  
  bbet he couldnt do that without a turbo heh dieselfags btfo
  you know our north american naturally aspirated v8s make more torque and hp right
    drag fucking racing  do you fags just handpick the posts you want to read or did you miss the whole part where we said drag racing as a measure of anything is fucking useless
  whats your point were talking about diesel engines in a daily car not a fucking caterham you thick retard
  imho their a5 sounds better   
  op here i fucked your mom too
      closing up at the pizza place  stacys car is broken down  daniel is going to the other side of town and cant drive her home  just ask anon  eww fine  she reluctantly asks you to drive her home  anon why is your car so loud  its a race car  uhh ok  red light  chad pulls up next to you in his dads 2 liter crossover  anon i think he wants to race you you said this was a race car right  yyeah  green light  he absolutely destroys your 20 year old honda civic shitbox  internally raging  haha anon how is it a race car if its so slow  iits built for the toegay  the what  the toegay  ok anon calm down  stupid fucking chad in his dads car stacy im telling you he wouldnt stand a chance i the twisties  whats a twisty  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  whatever just pull up into the gas station up ahead i can get home from there  drop her off  as she closes the door you hear her mumble fucking weirdo  chad pulls up in his dads new crossover  you see them driving away from her house  you get home slam down 3 cans of monster and make these posts
  personally i like the straight six better but the audi does sound nice  
  you euros are really bad at diesel        
  whats this called  ten girls that want to kill themselves and one guy thats having a really good time
  wouldnt say that many people are pushing close to 500hp reliably from 3 liter yuro engines that said cummins engines are amazing absolute monster engines
dont forget swapavi that was bought and paid for online and went through a brazilian studio to scrape the streets of the favelas to find girls that hard up for paycheck
  ehh id rather have 500hp from a 6 liter gas engine especially in a car then you have that 500hp at every rpm instead of one lump
    smells like shit  subjective smells good to me  shit power and  depends on the engine and the turbo  shit torque and  again it depends plenty of petrol engines have shit torque too  heavy  yes also robust  get to smell vaped pig piss everytime you walk out  what you have a fucked up sense of smell imo catalysed petrol exhaust smells worse  pigs on the highway  the highway is literally the best place for diesel nice low rpm cruising    also do you even drive any distance its hard not to like an engine that uses half the fuel of the equivalent gas one
how did this thread go so off track   this is a scat thread guys pls keep the diesel converation to a minimum
  glow plugs snap off in prechambered head  nothing personnel
  wasted all this time to write this shitty greentext bound to become a pasta  thinks i drive a fucking 3k cvic
  the actual diesel fuel i can kinda stand but the fucking def fluid is fucking nasty it makes your skin itch and burn when it gets on you and leaves cum looking stains on your clothes     i drive a big cummins diesel truck 100 miles a day and it feels nice to get in my gas car with a non retarded power and torqueband i have no idea why youd want an engine like that in a car like others have said if anything fails there goes you half the fuel consumption savings
dieselfag here had a 64hp 19 litre sdi skoda fabiashit was 100 bucksorange and ran on everythingtook it through fieldsrallied ittowed shit and was generally an asshowever the car could slide through every corner at top speed like 60 mph on shit roads with a fucked handbrakeit was slowugly and was really front heavy but for what it was it could take turns better than any petrol car ive been inbeat out my tiburon anyway
  yet another misuse of the chad vs virgin meme
  adblue is cancer ive yet had to deal with having to put gallons of piss in my vehicle for no reason
  where i live for 300 bucks you get a module that you can change with your phone that determines how much is used you could set it to 0 use until theres an inspection and change it back to stock hell for 700 euros you can buy a total emissions delet thats not detectable during annual inspections
  diesel trucks are the way to go anyway too bad we dont get inline 6 diesels anymore
  dunno a lot of school buses ambulances and light duty heavy duty trucks are going to gas engines its pretty much cheaper to swap in a new gas engine than it is to repair a diesel itll be interesting with fords new 70l dohc that they plan on replacing the v10s with
  came here to post this absolutely based
  being proud about fueling your bus with petrol  
  hella torque
  gas is less efficient therefore more patriotic its also a v10 which is more than 6 cylinders which equals more freedom
  torque is absolutely irrelevant unless youre hauling heavy shit   what matters is horsepower torque doesnt make you accelerate faster or any other broscience shit you heard
  maybe if you didnt drive a cummins youd like diesels

good fuck twingos    ugly meme car
was it kino
  up until third stage only good things about fourth stage was t/o/ru foreeeeveeer and purple shadow while the shinigami duel is barely enough to redeem fifth stage not because it was bad fifth stage was just that fucking boring that even one of the best races of the series is barely enough to make people watch that borefest
  agreed with anon  all three first seasons were kino  but then again wangan midnight is way more kino  so theres that
up until third stag      well then should be clear enough
  confession time i couldnt get past the art style for the faces shit just made me irrationally angry
  they look too asian to be anime
  i agree lol his friend itsuki struck me as an ugly beaner and not a little nip
    at least my autism isnt alone
this show is only good because no ones done this genre really modern manga and anime are too generic so no one will try
  you dont want a new version where cartoon jailbait that are also the cars live out wacky racing adventures
  the sad part is you cant go back in time    or can you
  jap cg  jap cg from 1998  its a damn shame it would have probably looked pretty damn decent as a prebubble anime hell even earlier in the 90s would have been preferable  but the manga started in 95 making that quite impossible  are there any car animes made before the crash worth watching
  ep1  the opening scene  the 86 appearing on the fcs mirror  ep2  takumis routine  like a spark  ep3  takumi going to his first official race late  ep4  the ghost of akina going to the duel  get me power boom boom boom  the whole running in the 90s section  the whole series was overload with kino tier use of music excellent timing for everything
  can you tell me about this bubble i dont know much about anime sorry
the art style change in stage 2 was incredibly jarring coming straight from stage 1
  i think hes referring to the japanese economic bubble that crashed in the late 90s
  it was the fd and that song was no one sleep in tokyo episode 2 had both remember me for takumis routine and spark in the dark for iketanis crash episode 3 had dont stop the music imo best eurobeat song as takumi headed to the race   and lets not forget  sees gtr in rear mirror  back on the rocks back on the rocks baby
  shakotan boogie unfortunately the only english sub that exists is very very poor however
there is a live action initial d movie on netflix its pretty good if any other normies that accidentally wandered into this thread want to check it out
  its kinda shit desu stopped watching after about 20 minutes
  bunta being turned into a hateful drunk was pretty gay but the rest of it wasnt awful
only good season is season 1 but its fucking great
  the music that was played on the way to the fd race was dance around the world
  wangan midnight  i really struggled to watch it especially after he repaired the damaged car until the last 6 episodes it seemed to be pretty much pointless  initial d was way more fun
1999 crown victoria with 76k on it  love the car got it a few months ago runs smooth as butter  driving down highway with heater on  white smoke everywhere  notice heat gauge is at red line  oshitjpg  pull over and let it cool  add water into coolant tank coolant turns from red to weird brown/orange  no coolant in oil  when i started it back up runs smooth as ever  starts heating back up a few miles down the road  stop again notice heat is turned on turn it off  car stops overheating heat gauge normal  engine still runs smooth somehow    wtf is going on how fucked am i
  his heater is heating his engine instead of the cabin  i dont even
  the heater is just engine heat blown into the cabin there is no reason i could think of that the heater would cause the engine to overheat
  get a new thermostat and change your coolant
  nothing heats the engine except the engine itself i dont get what you are trying to say the heat gauge stopped going to h when i turned the heater off can this be the heater core      can it be like a leaking heater core or a bad water pump also does it sound like i have like warped heads or a fucked head gasket i fucking hope i dont    from what i know there is like a miniradiator that works to heat up the car and the heat switch turns the valve on for it without it it doesnt work so can it be that
heater control valve  leaking heater core
  from what i know there is like a miniradiator that works to heat up the car and the heat switch turns the valve on for it without it it doesnt work so can it be that  maybe ford used them on their v6s but im not 100 sure the mod motor has them
  change your coolant    you mean change my water lel  seriosly though can this also be the water pump
  idle you car for 5 minutes while its parked turn on the heater and report back what happens im curious if the problem will still occur if the car is stationary
  anything to look for when checking those       hold on if there is no heater core then how is the car cabin going to heat up is it electronic    thanks for the replies guys btw
  i would but i have work soon and i left the car at the mechanics maybe ill do it and post another thread about it tonight
  if your exhaust is blowing white smoke like what you saw then your heads and/or head gaskets are fucked if not youre ok
  it was more like the expansion tank cap for the radiator let it explode everywhere so the radiator fluid was smoking everywhere including under my car but it also came from the hood    also my engine runs smooth af so hopefully youre wrong and my gaskets and heads are good
your intake manifold is made of the cheapest chinkshit plastic in existence and has two large coolant passages running through it one at the front just under the alternator bracket with the thermostat inline and one at the back that ends in a brass nipple leading to the heater core either one of these probably either split or started leaking examine your intake and get ready to replace it
  you mean change my water lel  can this also be the water pump  gee idk does galvanic corrosion mean anything to you        it does have a heater core
also ford recommends green or gold antifreeze only depending on year in your case the green stuff i hope by red you meant golden because red is dexcool do not use that shit in engines not designed for it
you might have the defective intake manifold that model year for sure came with it stock it likely cracked and your mechanic should be able to take care of it
  heater control valve  its a vacuum powered switch that controls coolant flow to the heater core when shut heat off there isnt coolant flowing through the core when open heat on there is im both those posters btw my theory is that maybe one side isnt switching disallowing proper flow same thing a stuck thermostat might do
  addendum  most cars have coolant flowing through the core at all times ford had the genius idea to not do that which is great if you have a leaky core but they tend to have issues    a lot of brand new cars use freon to heat now
  can vouch for this i have an explorer with the mod and at first i found that my heater valve would leak if i was on an incline so i replaced it still leaked coolant and found the culprit was the passage at the rear of the intake ive overheated this bitch several times due to various issues once i first got it you will be fine but explorers have an aluminum block to go along with the heads not sure if the difference between metals can make it more likely for warping issues but i suspect it might
          intake manifold has been replaced before i got the car if it is bad it has a warranty and i know how to replace it due to prior experience will check heater core and also thermostat and thermistor thank you all for replies and have a good night       i meant cuz right now there is water in there because that was all i had on me when the radiator tank exploded on me lol
  yep some thermostats dont have a tiny hole to bleed the air out if it runs empty
stuck thermostat probably my 96 used to randomly overheat especially in the winter months
are women mechanics a myth
  no they are either ugly or have ridden the cock of every other mechanic in the shop
  they are as rare as unicorns 99 percent of the time theyre mechanics because thats the family trade
  that makes perfect sense
  ive really ever seen one in my entire life working the tow truck at the yearly hillclimb talked shit to a fiesta driver who understeered into the very first turn and was having a complete chimpout as a result
the daughter of a a family friend became a mechanic at a dealership she got harassed by the other mechanics all day long and ended up switching to the sales floor did ok at that as far as i know
  any pics of her working on a car
  girlfriend is a mechanic in the national guard     shes capable of dissembling and reassembling things but thats the extent of it     wouldnt trust her to diagnose a problem she cant talk with technical terms     mechanic no bolting and unbolting sure
  national guard  check her contact list now youre not the only man in her life trust me im a marine
  workshop banter and shittalking is part of what makes the job more bearable if she cant take a joke or banter with her coworkers she can fuckoff i highly doubt she was felt up by other mechanics on purpose but im just assuming that hell at my work i make fun of my coworkers all the time i call them whitebois while they call me sandnigger its all in healthy good fun so why is it suddenly a problem when a woman cant fucking do the same
  nope my uncles garage has a lady mechanic shes in her 30s and at the beginning when she joined she was constantly hit on by the other dudes at the shop he later had personal talk with every menemployees and the matter got solved but as expected she caught on a slight hate from them   uncle took her into the job because she had experience working with many other garages and even one of them being fully worked on by ladies
  chances are im using her moreso than shes using me    ive just assumed the worse since day one
  yikes you have a lot to figure out anon
  a better question would be do cute mechanics exist
  male ones yes  female ones probably not  t has a male one that /o/ would call cute
  faggot
  not gay just stating a fact
i know two women labourers 1 woman electrician and 1 woman hvac tech    1 labourer is really the kind of woman our toothless barefoot in wet concrete sign his wage slips with an x type nig wont even approach because she is that ugly i feel bad for her because she is actually mentally capable she works from the back of a dump truck  next labourer isnt as bad but the afformentioned males do approach her if they are new on site but she has a kind of a black mamma belt to her attitude and she puts the guys in place real fast her main skill is bending and tying rebar    the electrician came straight from school and she is about 52 and weighs about 80 lbs quickly became known as princes because she refused to do anything so the contractor put her to chisle and chase walls that were changes in the plan and she was pretty good at it so now 10 years later princess is the go to girl for change orders    a/c tech girl is just a flirt been doing it for as long as i can remember and she just takes notes from you on her clipboard while tucking the lower part of the board under her tits doesnt wear a bra and for some reason it seems cold as fuck where ever she is standing
for the most part yes in general the trades are a boys club i believe automechanic stats puts the female role at less than 1 i will say female service writers are becoming more common albeit still rare as another poster commented one needs to be able to give and take in this industry no feelings its business be ready for the banter in general there is a labor shortage in my field not enough candidates are available yet alone enough qualified candidates got a pulse you got the job being that it is a rougher job i doubt the number of women interested in the mechanic trade will increase     tfw no stacy coworker to bang on your triple bay krl
    she got the engine oil to leak out of the torsion beam    thats an impressive fuck up
  dont be rude she was menstruating
  theres an mtf mechanic that used to post on /lgbt/ all the time does that count
  ive just assumed the worse since day one  ah just how i go through life
theres a pretty hot russian titcow on /pol/ who works as a mechanic back when her instagram was public i think she had photos up of some engine repairs she was doing total thot but would still wife
  total thot but would still wife  poor husband
  woman mechanic female  so no
  my classmate i sat next to was a qt alt girl who started as a mechanic after hs  i hope youre reading this jessica
i did a 4 year apprenticeship and was a jman/redseal tech for nearly a decade    out of a class of 30 1st year has maybe 34 girls by the end of the 1st year 2 drop out because theyre ditzes 1 drops out because i didnt know i had to carry heavy things all day boys wont help me the last 1 thats actually capable gets a flock of 10 guys around her all 4 years because the sausagefest wants pussy     never worked in a garage with a female and never intend to
    probably not lots of mechanics might identify as a woman genders are socially ascribed and individually chosen and they are also fluid so you could have someone who is both a man and a woman and a mechanic or maybe one day they are a man and the next a woman
  she was probably singled out men generally take any opportunity they can to get a womans attention through any means also   i highly doubt she was felt up by other mechanics on purpose    lol
  my mom could do really basic maintainence stuff like changing a tire she was the one who taught me since she was a bit of a tomboy this sounds trivial but you would be surprised how many people cant do this i had to drive out to change a flat for my friend and his wife one night and people i speak with have to call a tow truck out to change it for them
  kek
  the real women mechanics dont voice themselves because theyre actually doing their job  the roasties you see holding a wrench up against a plastic engine cover in a photo are there for attention
    is that conventional or synthetic fluid

  chimera 300 has been in jail for 155 days  octane 45 in jail for 40 days    who and who
  theyre silencers
  why have they been in jail then i had guessed they were shitty zoomer rappers
  since 1934 you have to pay 200 on top to have the regulated firearms silencers included transferred to you and approval  the wait for approval is usually considered in jail since it can be up to 300 days    the only other way around this is illegally creating your own firearms like silencers and machineguns but no one would be stupid enough to discuss that on here
americans were a mistake

ford ranger with a ls swap
19941996 buick roadmaster chevrolet caprice or chevrolet impala ss all come with an lt1 v8 260 hp and 330 lbft of torque rwd
c5
  slower than this
  9496 roadmaster can be had for 5000 or less for a decent condition with 100k miles  syclone selling for 25k with lower miles maybe 10k for a project    lmao ok
late 90s svt lightning 54 super charged they can be had for under 12000
  the c4 corvette and early c5 probably as fast as it gets in this category thats if we are talking only stock vehicles ws6 might be close but idk exactly what years
  trans am ram air  or buy a vette maybe c4 and c5 seem to be getting cheap
  i love this      i love these also but i heard they have transmission problems is that true
  define fast most fast 90s cars get btfo by modern fwd v6 family sedans
  98 fbody with an ls1  earlier lt1 cars arent bad either
  oh wow you mean the v8 landbarge is slower than an awd 43 turbo truck that weighs like 2lbs and was built to be fast as shit im so shocked wow
  40k less too
preferably made by an american automaker  why does it matter
  because theyre easy to work on
    anything with a superchaged 3800 fun until the transmission explodes
  lincoln mark viii 8 as in the number eight
  3800 is goat

youre just tryna find the dodge daytona guy
  1996 buick park avenue ultra it must be a 1996 and it must be an ultra the 1996 is the last year of the earlier better body style but the first year to get the l67 engine 240hp there are lots of videos of them on youtube

should i get my 57 hemi tuned or get a chip
get a chip its way cheaper you can get a bag of them for fucking 99 cents
  chipping is tuning
  kindanotreally   chipping usually implies a prebaked generic tune that should work ok for most people in most conditions cheaper but less power doesnt take the full picture into account assumes all engines of a type perform exactly the same which isnt the case in real life    tuning usually implies putting the car on a dyno and adjusting the maps to match the performance of your specific engine in the conditions you usually drive it in more expensive but much better for reliability and power  another meaning for chip is some ebay chink electrical jawns that trick your maf throttle system or something else to try to get more power these shits are junk cause a lot of weird issues and anyway most recentish ecus will set codes or adapt back to the correct air/fuel ratios through longterm fuel trim
  what flavor
  57 hemi  fucking hell get it tuned properly its one of the few decent american engines and it isnt overused/overhyped nearly as much as the ls
its a na engine all thats gonna happen is changing target afratio which doesnt do shit and adjusting timing a little     why bother
    neither if its a bone stock motor youre not going to feel shit you would need supporting mods like intake cam and exhaust before youd would need a dyno tune
    this guy gets it and by the time you do all that youre better off just slapping a supercharger on it camming changes the car a bit but its not that noticeable for the price you pay to do it correctly with supporting valvetrain and dyno tuning mods
  it isnt overused/overhyped nearly as much as the ls  because its worse
in your experience what car seems to attract more dick drivers than any other for me it has to be these shits

  the cheaper tradie utes are usually the worst bt50s older 70 series landcruisers great wall anything and tritons the more expensive ones like rangers and modern hiluxes seem to have people with a cool head behind the wheel most of the time though for some bizarre reason every single amarok driver is a complete psycho just a bunch of young men with something to prove it seems theyre usually in a gigantic hurry at all hours of the day to get to a worksite because of poor time management and will tailgate and road rage at you for not going 30km/h over the speed limit circular logic you know what i mean these people dont have the iq to plan time use effectively and end up using their very limited intellectual resources on the road having a complete chimpout    strangely enough crossover drivers and luxury car drivers dont seem to be too bad theyre usually more clueless or dumb than anything else and are fairly harmless if you give them a wide berth but methhead tradies are the most downright aggressive and dangerous people on the road slow down and chill out you fuckwits maybe leave 20 minutes earlier every morning

  only uber drivers still drive escalades and yes uber drivers are the worst on the road shittiest none tlc are early 2000s maxima and altima drivers
niggers in altimas malibus and suburbans always try to fuck with me and drive like literal animals rednecks with their lifted trucks are always shit especially if theyre driving a diesel i always hate the old ladies driving ford five hundreds too ive never met a wrx owner that wasnt a prick
  i would like to think that im a decent person
  this
  you have one  i tried to buy one but they wouldnt let me
every fucking cayenne owner is an asshole no excpetions  somebody prove me wrong
  literally every vehicle that has this is driven by a woman nigger or idiot
golf 2 and iv 19 tdi
  this
  bike riders are the biggest cunts on the road    i dont live or drive in stop and go traffic so i dont care about the fags that drive up the breakdown lane on their gas powered sybians they are always assholes drive like shit get angry about fucking nothing fuck them
  after owning two falcons i totally agree
  that has to be a uniquely dutch thing  here in britbongistan v40 and ovlov drivers in general are usually pretty chill fairly skilled and notably considerate except for the ones driven by mumphomaniacs  those brainless little breederbitches think only with their ovaries    our 1 roadcancer is anything german but especially audis  angry cucks wogs and retarded mummies without exception who were dumb enough to pay extra for a shitty blingedup skoda
    autism    my question was why every one of these cars is always speeding bmws and audis arent nearly as bad as v40s overhere
nissan sentra and altima
big 3 pickemuptrucks
  what car seems to attract more dick drivers than any other  drivers of cars above 1500kg are in greater risk of being mentally deficient in my experience
newer model nissans cuz niggers drive them
  this is the same everywhere  real toolbox vehicle of choice
  lolo quite correct      gotta add in uk  bmw drivers audi little old mini drivers  usually chavs on methor any other drug and every single 18yr old kid hwho has just passed their test
  can confirm fuck ram drivers on i94 they spawn there to fuck with people
  implying every other hyundai i10 isnt driven by a retarded woman or chinese tourists
the worst by far are the x6 and merc glc
  in australia we get cunts driving these usually lowered with a bullbar and tray cab  if youre going the posted limit or even over the limit they try to overtake and race at intersections 90 of the time pretty sure 0100 kmh in them is around1213 seconds or some shit gets kind of annoying dealing with them
  hah good one havent heard that before
  crybaby whining about chad in his m5  writes like a retard having a stroke  lmao
  i like this theory    t 400hp 3300lbs
  you can find idiots in all kinds of cars but the larger ones seem to attract the most of them    but you can only wreck so many cars before you are stuck with an i10
  i think you just hate people who dont share the same views as you seems like youre the asshole here
  1500kg  basically anything that isnt an i10  these mental gymnastics  this amount of cope  because youre trying to suffocate the regret of buying a tiny kidsized car
without fail speeding tailgating dicks the modern days bmw
  i drive a 2000kg v8 jeep
  skoda octavia and superb  all the dicklets with inferiority complex larping like they drive an audi
  yeah anything audi with an s or rs badge i do enjoy humiliating anything less than an rs5 tho
  ive yet to see a fast subaru they are all just riced out overpriced trash usually owned by hard parking vapelord stancefags to get attention
  drivers of cars over 500kg are probably retarded
  tuned wrx or sti will be faster then most cars on street unless you drive tuned turbo 4banger or v8 what do you drive 
  buy audi  fucking idiot why would you pay more for a rebadged skoda  buy skoda  fucking larpers pretending to drive an audi  theres no winning is there
  tuned ecoboom stang
  there is not  so dont ever claim you have a cool car here
  for me its minivan drivers they are such fucking assholes and always going way faster than they should
  ive never actually bought a skoda or an audi though
  200306 white silverado z71s preferably with a fox sticker on the back window
  just in general  the majority of anons here have shitboxes the rest lack even that
these fuckin things
  wont be a problem for much longer
    what exactly are you driving that humiliates lets say an rs3 for example 400 bhp golf sized    just curious cause in the city theres nothing that keeps up with those little fuckers
  you forgot audi  huge inferiority complex  will try to race whenever you overtake them  ludicrous speeds with no thought spent on weather and traffic situations
  give us the italian rundown ferrari lambo alfa fiat
  fiat cucks and women driving like shit within the city but afraid to go faster than 60mph
paper license plate 4 months out of date  bumper hanging by a thread  cuts across 3 lanes at the last minute  tailgates you in gridlocked traffic  lo siento no lo siento senor
  lol  sounds accurate
  tbf im afraid of going faster than that in most fiats
  i almost get run over by white suvs fucking daily
cant believe somebody hasnt posted this yet ive never seen a single lancer on the road that isnt being driven by somebody that thinks the whole fucking street belongs to them
  3k civic with fartcans are the worst desu
  chads bmw squad vs the virgin japanese auto club
  any honda
  double for black plates
  its kinda embarrassing when my stock s2000 is looking dead sexy and some kid is revving his fart can civic next to me
    can confirm i drive a mitsubishi eclipse and the entire road belongs to me
  black older dodge rams with camper shells especially if lifted if you see one of these you can be guaranteed that it will be driving like a maniac
  i cant deal with women on the road they always drive slow and panic all the time women also tend to be little traffic police and try to slow you down if they see youre in a rush i guess they dont understand what its like to actually have important shit to do instead of driving to starcucks
biggest assholes off the road are boomers who drive a well depreciated european sports cars 996997v8 r8ferrari 355 360430599mid 00s amg and m cars most pretentious are the ferrari ones they are driving a ticking time bomb that can bankrupt them with a single loose bolt  the cars are already high mileage but they refuse to put miles on them because  it will lose its magic and depreciation is a bitch boils my blood
  hella mad
  škodas are based
    30k millionaire
  you can get that for less than 10k and still stunt harder than your corolla
  although i love bimmers and plan to buy one soon the stereotypes are unironically true as far as i can tell not sure what it is but low end bimmers attract such assholes  i live in rural bongland where its twisty blind one lane roads for miles and whenever i see a car going dangerously fast and cutting corners its a fucking low end bimmer suv mums are more of a problem though just because of how oblivious and incompetent they are
  eu here so  bmw minicoopers
  theyre good functional cars not the biggest volvo fan but they are fun to drive i see them all the time too
  subarus are filled with terrible drivers all around from shithead kids thinking they have a fast car to eco friendly lesbians tailgating 2 meters behind you or going 35 in front of you on a country road
  that can bankrupt them with a single loose bolt  nah
  show us where the ferrari touched you
  anything driven by a woman
  buttmad poorfag detected
  intense truth
    
  i cut one of those off once not on purpose but i just wasnt looking and was trying to make a turn at a bad intersection full of traffic it pulled up next to my car and a big black nigger inside was shouting at me angrily i legitimately thought he was going to pull out a gun and start shooting at me
  is it possible to order an escalade or other large suv without the privacy glass on the sides and rear
audi and cayenne soccer moms  t poland
  its because the blinkers deactivate cruise control
  ikr
heavily molested ep3s  usually with a huge wing tint a fart cannon various jap/type r stickers and a k20 numberplate  can be found driving around in vtec all the time cutting people up and tailgating until they invariably bin it and end up in a ditch  it sucks because i actually like how modded ep3s look and drive but theyre invariably driven by nonces
altimas theyre always cutting through traffic and then getting caught at every red if not running yellow lights at the last second
newer model accord coupes
  if repatriation to africa were a thing it would be full of escalades
is the 3k civic meme still relevant  ive grown an liking for these shitboxes sedan/coupe
the 3k civic is eternal
  the 3k civic is eternal  until theyre worth 2k
  3k civics will always be a good choice plenty of parts available and every gen has been fairly reliable
  so no models to avoid
  pretty much yeah although just like any car older generations are gonna have old car problems
  2006 pre facelift models had shit paint that caused rust problems every other year for that generation 20072011 is solid though  t has a 06 in the family
  20012005 models had headgasket and general quality issues i would shoot for anything from 19882000 and then 2007present the older you go the lighter and more sporty you get but also more unsafe and unrefined in terms of comfort
  some of the later after eks have issues with the automatics if the fluid isnt changed on schedule
i was searching hard and long for a winter beater i wanted something cool and fun such as an impreza or something but obviously theyre all trashed and abused by like minded retards and overpriced    so i gave up searched through the plethora of civics that were available found this 2009 civic dxg manual basic shit has heater working and a/c power windows just your basic items  it has about 206k kilometers leaf village and i was really hesitant at first  drove it around the block after meeting up with seller and i instantly bought it on the spot    the 3k civic meme is not a meme its a reality these cars last a long time and despite the high mileage it still felt like driving a new civic
  it would have to be old then the og 3k civic they stopped selling nonhybrid sedans in europe around that gen for some reason and i find the modern hatcbacks repulsive to look at even if theyre comfortable good cars and whatever
  hey the 04 and 05 were good
  no they are way overpriced cuckboxes     3k near chicago for a manual will get you a mexican trashed pos that needs all sorts of repairs you can find accords for a good price only occasionally you are better off saving a little more money and buying a mazda
  93 models had strong adhesive that literally eats the roof
accord is better bang for buck and has the same reliability just stay away from automatics in the early 2000s
    dont 8th gen civics have paint fading problems
  its a meme for a reason lad if you spend 3k on a late 90s civic with under 150k miles it can last you 10 years with minimal maintenance great option for a beater and then have a cool car that you keep in the garage and drive for enjoyment
its a lie one of the detailers at my dealership bought a 2007 honda civic with 268 000 km on it for 260 cdn the general manager prefers to unload the tradeins quickly instead of wasting time shipping them to auction for 500 profit
find a flaw
gay
circled the flaw so you can find it
slow  doesnt corner that well  very nervous at higher speeds  abysmal chassis rigidity  steering is not that good its actually quite numb    had enough or shall i go on
mr2 is vastly superior in every possible way
  should have left the second one out would probably get more yous
slow  too small  no power  sounds just as garbage as almost all other 4 bangers
  a cute miata
  snap oversteers and kills you
    were you high when you posted this    or is this just  jokes on them im only pretending to be retarded
truckdozer comes along and smashes the car and you to pieces  nothin personal kid
  im not here to get yous im here to speak the truth you deluded miatafag  miata has a shit short travel suspension and while compared to your typical shitbox it might appear it corners decently it gets obliterated by actual sport cars
  only an fwd shitbox did worse than miata in slalom  i call bullshit
i cant fucking fit in probably    stop this lanklet oppression right this instant
  doesnt corner that well  with the stock wheels/tires no  very nervous at higher speeds  wheels/tires and proper coilovers help  abysmal chassis rigidity  nbs are very rigid   steering is not that good its actually quite numb  the ones with no power steering feel really good   slow  throw a chinaturbo on it lol    its a 3k shitbox and drives like one but is also a good platform to modify also you
  with the stock wheels/tires no  wheels/tires and proper coilovers help  not really theres a limit to the chassis besides iiits good with mmmods could be said about any other car  nbs are very rigid   lol no its still a wet fucking noodle without much improvement not to mention op asked about the na  the ones with no power steering feel really good   as far as i know no power steering is even worse with longer ratio  from what i heard the car was intended with the power steering in mind and the no power steering was an afterthought  throw a chinaturbo on it lol  iiits good with mmmods    its a 3k shitbox and drives like one  this is correct and op asked about flaws so im listing them  but is also a good platform to modify  the aftermarket is vast but at the point the car becomes good you can buy something vastly superior like s2k for example
the only flaw mine has is that it doesnt have the fucking pop up head lights anymore other than that i love it
  that shit slalom speeds of mr cars and porsche  so this is the power of the so called superior engine layout kek
  if you pay the same money modifying a miata that you would pay to purchase an s2k the miata will be better in every way s2k isnt good value and is a horrible example
  the driver is a vaping gay hairdresser
  if you pay the same money modifying a miata that you would pay to purchase an s2k the miata will be better in every way    no if you mod miata to the s2k price you will end up with an unreliable piece of shit which will be heavier than the honda if you plan to make the chassis not a complete shit
  vaping    thats a stereotype applied to subaru owners    gay hairdresser    a tired but old stereotype    1/10 not original at all youll get em next time buddy
  unreliable piece of shit which will be heavier than the honda if you plan to make the chassis not a complete shit  unreliable if youre a retard you can budget an aftermarket ecu and dyno time frame rails and fender bracing dont weigh much and dont cost much either s2k is not a good value you dumb beaner
  hurr durr stock suspension is the only suspension the miata can have    if youre that afraid to make the simplest of modifications to improve your car you should just take the bus
  if you mod miata to the s2k price you will end up with an unreliable piece of shit which will be heavier than the honda    what am i reading lol you really dont need that much money to make a 1st gen miata out perform an s2k as for weight  where are you getting your figures from sounds like youre just talking out of your ass buddy
  guess what you retard miata problem lies in the double wishbone itself and modifying this costs shitload   if you replace the coilovers and lower the car that problem will actually be even worse
  shit do hatches go for alot
  no need to be racist you fucking nigger
  not anon but im high rn and that passed for an mr2 to me until i read your comment so hes probably high
  if you believe that fender bracing and frame rails will solve the wet noodle problem then i have no words you are simply mentally challenged
  thats not mine and its not a hatch its an auto konnexion fastback hardtop and they could go for around 1500
  i have no words  you dont have an argument either
  why so redundant
  do i really need to prove to you that water is wet  are you this deluded
  if you believe that fender bracing and frame rails will solve the wet noodle problem then i have no words you are simply mentally challenged    hey guys i know more about miatas than flying miata the company who has been modifying miatas since the 90s
  thats a really awful colour
  ok
  and now the wheels are terrible    is a child in charge of modifying this car
cant decide between na or nb  fug finding clean nbs is easier but na is so aesthetic
  citation needed
the original is better
  i we can leave out the bench racing  i found it to be cramped and im not even a tall or big dude my elbow would slam into the door every time i made a turn the noise was insane and i own a mazda 3 the seats arent great na8 the gas mileage isnt great either got better in my aw11 the heater sucked the ac was good though taking the top up and down was annoying needed ear plugs to drive with it down on the freeway in the city you just smell everyones exhaust and get coal rolled by diesel bros    the car would be 100 better as a normal fastback and not a convertible
  caring about gas mileage in a miata  the top going up and down in seconds is too hard
  a 18l ultra light car should get good mileage  i didnt say it was hard i said it was annoying dont misquote me
  wah stop liking what i dont like    theres only one child here
    this thing runs circles around it despite being fwd    and you get beat by a probe
  i wish someone would make a fastback with a rx7 style glass ill take the weight for the visability increase not having to deal with plexiglass and shitty seals
  y miata is better in every single aspect more powerful more reliable better suspension less leaky easier to work on cheaper and arguably the best aftermarket of any car
  primary colours and secondrate wheels are above criticism    keep yourself safe my man
  steering wheel doesnt tilt   alternator is too weak to run all electronics at the same time if your car has power windows/mirrors  cooling is not adequate for track use only does a few laps before a cool down lap is needed  dipstick is difficult to read when oil is new/light color      if youre fat then lose weight  if youre tall/lankey then change standard seat with a bucket seat  if youre 7ft take out the seat entirely and staple in some foam inserts  if 45ft of that is just legs get a removable steering wheel
  holy shit nigger you cant even troll right heres a pity you hope your day gets better
  seething
  did i hurt your feelings im sorry if i upset you anon it wasnt my intention  have a great day today
  by only 1mph and still had a better laptime
    
  same
  tires are a massive factor for which this image does not account cheap cars beget cheap stock tires
  it has worse suspension in every generation
    discarding your opinion cause youre clearly a fucking pussy if you have to wear earplugs driving it on the highway
as someone who actually owns one  open diff on most early models  shitty single stage paint on the na  alternator sucks  a lot of them have lifter tick  bad intake design makes taking the intake out to work on anything around there annoying was fixed in the 18  window tracks get dirtier more commonly than pretty much any other car
  if there are such problems with the na as this thread describes why does it have such a cult following    i thought they were obsessed over because of their exceptional handling
  because the issues are small compared to how amazing the car is as a whole
  theyre easily fixed issues and for the price you pay theyre acceptable faults
    yeah the issues really pale in comparison to how fun it is to drive and its overall really reliable and easy to work on the engine bay is really big compared to the engine too
  97 owner here    its got a cult following beacuse while its not the perfect sports car for the price its just so much fun it can take almost anything you can throw at it and ask for more most of the problems are either minor quirks or issues that can be solved with some coilovers 3/500 dollars worth of chaise bracing and forced induction for significantly cheaper than anything else on the market right now
  because none of what anon described are actual issues just annoyances which many other 90s cars also have  also my 95 came with torsen lsd stock and better intake piping than that anons 16l  i mean fuck can the guy not put a hydrogenperoxide cotton swab through his window tracks now and then its a 25 year old car
  none of this is true
          i had a mind to join the tribe of na shitposters once i saved up enough money     what is a good price point for an na where i can be somewhat confident the car isnt going to take a shit before i even get it out of the dudes driveway
  look at prices in your area on cl car gurus kbb there are a lot of tools already in place it also depends on where youre located non rusted cars will cost more when you live in the rust belt
  what is a good price point for an na where i can be somewhat confident the car isnt going to take a shit before i even get it out of the dudes driveway  its a 20 year old car you never know man people can hide shit
  unpractical roadster convertibleonly small even for being front passenger/driver
  convertibleonly  heh nothing
  convertibleonly  personal
  convertibleonly  kid
  still convertible    extremely rare japan only    still convertible
      aside from 179 roadster coupes produced in 2003 every miata ever made will leak convertibles targas and sunroofs are all for brain damaged peasants with no foresight
  mine doesnt leak
  please dont use hyperbole anon
    lmao are you faggots seriously implying cars that dont have fixed solid tops will never leak key word  will
  actually being this retarded
  what wheels i want some for my aw11
  i want answers pls
    pretty much all this    its gonna be funny when these become the new 240sx/crx and these kids ricing them out/wrecking them dwindle their numbers and youll see half decent shape stock na and nb miata going for 15000 in 10 years
  i want to know exactly what wheels these are
bampu
  there was never a factory fastback until this last generation  it was something that should have been available from the start    other than that as much as i despise convertibles i find myself having dreams of a hardtop miata every once in a while    i may eventually get one and modify it if i ever have to get yet another different car
  its still a convertible just hard top      never seen one even on internet let alone real life      still convo but hard top whats your point
    those are rotiform rocs anon
  i dont own one
  never seen one even on internet let alone real life  ive never seen one of these before so they must not exist anon 2018
    its literally the best sportscar ever made
  so what your saying is that the car is shit and mods are needed to make it good you do realise that every shitbox is the same
  that means theyre either  custom made or extremely rare which makes it unobtainable expensive irrational to buy now kindly fuck off thanks
  convertible on any car objectively makes it shit
  miata needs less mods to be good
are night driving glasses a meme or do they actually help people who have trouble driving at night due to glare/lack of depth to other cars
i only use them because they look cool
the thing to keep in mind is the advertising always assumes the user is driving in a brightly lit urban area piss tinted glasses would most likely be detrimental in a low light country backroad setting pic related are my goto driving shades 50 for a two pack havent tried anything that beats them yet oakleys meme seen on tv raybans pale in comparison
i found yellow lenses ok for flat light in skiing i mean they help a bit and you can tell but wearing them to drive seems a bit gay
just wear sunglasses also anti strong light works perfectly fine at night
i spent a lot of time looking for glasses that would break the glare of oncoming aftermarket led headlights installed in stock housings but never found anything    i did find a chinese laser pointer that i can shine in their eyes though so thats working out for me it came with safety glasses
  they help you look cool in the night
    thread theme
  i have been searching for one for a while but dont know which the right ones are  whats the specs/name for them
people like op can vote
tactical visor activated
im looking for a midsize suv that handles well in the snow and isnt slow as hell is a jeep a good choice if not any other recommendations
midsized suv  handles well    pick one
i hate fca but the grand cherokee is one of their highlights handsome design great handling actually not just for an suv decently quick too actually
  brakes are pretty shit in those things
  rav4 4runner anything chevy
  prepare for an avalanche of fca memes     dad owns a 2015 grand cherokee and its got about 57k now he drives it a lot     its been a pretty decent car so far nothing is broken or gone bad he literally reads the manual and does the maintenance recommended by jeep     although i like the durango r/t more desu handsome suv    i really like to see them
  is this the one that failed the moose test
  whats the moose test
  theres some finnish fuckers who test a cars ability to turn quickly at certain speeds basically the test is youre driving straight you swerve left then swerve back right and they measure the cars performance through that    basically the first 3 tests the jeep almost flipped over after the fca engineers adjusted some shit the car still had 2 wheels off the ground and when it landed it popped tired every time
i had a 2005 grand cherokee 47 worst car i ever had    maybe they are better now but right at about 75k miles the rear diff started to whine then tons of other stuff heads warped at about 175k miles heater core puked a little later hvac blend doors broke interior was hard plastic shit     maybe mine was bad or cursed but jeeps arent know for their last night term reliability wrangler excluded
  lets see what my dads grand cherokee does so far it has been trouble free i kinda think chrysler has gotten a bit better
chrysler tech here the grand cherokee/durango is easily in the top 5 of the vehicles we work on here    highly recommended if you can absorb the stupidly high price
  
    that test was fake news    they failed to mention it was loaded to its max capacity
  see    its in the video at 140 and every other car was tested same way and handled much better as seen around 044
  im so tempted to buy this 06 srt     graysonlinecom/lot/00019010507/motorvehiclesmotorcycles/2006jeepgrandcherokeesrt8whautomaticwagonsprtrue
weve had 4 separate safety recall notices on our 14 grand cherokee nothing has failed yet but still not a good sign biggest criticism i can level is that the gearbox is absolutely terrible at handling anything more than a gentle incline paddle shifting is essential if i could make the choice again id probably go with a subaru forester or outback mazda cx5 or volvo xc60
  do it faggot    30 mins left lmao
just get a german suv
    cx5 is garbage looks reasonable big but literally has less rear leg and headroom than a mitsubishi mirage
  strange because its an excellent gearbox the zf 8hp70 is used in just about everything around the world my dads 15 ecodiesel 8 speed wk2 handles his 2700gtm caravan pretty effortlessly
  forgot im not sure what gearbox the 36 v6 comes with maybe the 8hp70 were diesel/hemi v8 only
  chrysler tech    whats the most unreliable car in your shop the one that presents the most problems
  yeah ive got the v6 australian pricing is total shite
how would you go about organizing a twisty roadtouge street race    there seem to be a good number of car enthusiasts in the city im in based on the people that show at meets but as far as i know they only so some pulls on a straight road and thats that    i want to do initial d style races inb4 weeb on a good twisty road i enjoy driving on so far here are my thoughts  one person at the start and at the end   walkie talkies or phones for people at the end and the drivers to report for incoming cara/police  time should be after 12 or 1    the thing im worries about is that there will always be traffic even at those hours so should the race be cancelled or should the drivers continue with caution    looking for people whove done or participated in these types of races for any tips
  we do roll races around here punk
  this shit doesnt happen in real life kid anime isnt real grow the fuck up
so nobody has done this thats a big let down      go watch drifthunteralbo where japanese people say that in the past there were a lot of street races ala initial d  i mean after all the anime got its idea from somewhere
    you need people at every corner with radios needs some serious planning but its very possible find a road with 1 entrance so you can see any traffic coming in time attack or cat and mouse are the best ways to do it        gtfo newfag
  stop beeing dumb  search for a real track  socialise race with others  stay on the track    you are part of why normies hate sports car owners
  if traffic is present even after midnight then you might want to pick a different mountain pass you got the right idea though to make sure there are no cars id do the following  everyone arrives at the starting point  those who are meant to be at the end start heading there  report through walkietalkies of any incoming vehicles  once the road is clear the race can start  if the cars are coming the same direction as the racers then theres nothing to worry about  if the road is too narrow to pass each other safely make sure that nobody does and stick with initial d rules
  i dont see why that wouldnt work as long as the other people want to race i point people up to the mountain roads if they look like they would be interested in hopes that i meet them up there someday if its a road that always has traffic even at 1 in the morning you might want to find a different road because thats going to attract attention really fast
  hope    ive never hears the term cat and mouse  already finding some good videos    why would i need people on every corner if there are people at the start and end of the road and the drivers have radios as well  or is it a bad idea for the drivers to have radios
  japan  this isnt japan
  not that anon but the drivers need the radios in order to be warned about incoming cars ideally you have someone on every corner in order to keep a constant eye on the race and stop it if something goes wrong but if youre a small group you will just have to be careful and have half the group at the starting line and half the group at the finish
  just do it  
    people at corners to check for debris or oil spills or any rogue cars that slipped through the entrance communication is with the corner guys mostly only radio the drivers when an emergency happen like a car coming through corner 4 or an oil spill at 2 also they let you know how the race is going otherwise you would just see them at the start/end which is boring rule 1 do not risk anyones life whos not part of the race rule 2 have an emergency escape route in case of cops
dave ur gay fuck u and mika
  damn this is gonna be tough but sounds doable
  definitely doable remember while the larger the group is the better you also need to kick out/ban any hothead who might try to make runs with no one to make sure the road is safe and/or might try to overtake others in dangerous spots those guys only lead to trouble
    op listen to this guy everyone knows that racing can only happen on a real track and racing is only for people who can take off on open track days afford the entry cost and the extra safety equipment and i know that youre going to respond waaahh well i dont live near a track then maybe you should just try harder and get more time and money so you can be a real racer like us
  so you can be a real racer like us  i didnt know that bus racing was considered a form of racing
you should start by promptly driving off a cliff to test the mountain
this is a dumb idea its way dumber in a world where everybody has a surveillance cam in their pocket by the third event cops would be knocking on doors of everybody who showed up
  in addition  if this is what you actually want to do dont make it an event you moron just keep it between you and a friend or two playing cat and mouse and stay in your lane dont put anybody elses life in danger for your amusement
  dangerous and illegal activity  the larger the group is the better
  this is like claiming firefights in the middle east dont happen in real life and only happen in cod    not for you basement dwelling losers thats for sure
    its obvious he shouldnt advertise it however its beyond hard to stay in a lane on mountain passes even when you drive normally    are you the same guy who kept telling another anon to not buy a vintage opel and instead finance a new ford or a different faggot altogether when the fuck did /o/ turn into soccer mom central
  when the fuck did /o/ turn to soccer mom central    seriously dude im literally flabbergasted    its always been full of dipshits and bus riders but what the fuck half these dorks dont even like driving
  theyre literally fucking normies and not even of the i like cars but im more clueless than a newborn about them normies
  beyond hard to stay in a lane  im not sure where you live or what kinds of roads youre talking about most windy roads that would be fun to do this kind of activity on can easily support staying out of oncoming are you not in na
  na  lolno south italy here roads are decently maintained but a combination of lateral inclination several hard turns in a row and roads going up down faster than you can say roller coaster make it easy to slip into oncoming with atleast the wheels when you start picking up decent speed and get past 100 km/h theres so little traffic though that its basically a nonissue
  well then yeah i get it pretty roads but no space from what ive heard in that case fuck you no better than me do your best i guess canada has more land then we can use the mountain roads near me are more about carrying max speed through big sweepers coming through a corner at 100 in your lane isnt really a huge problem its more how late can you brake how little can you brake and how fast and hard are you willing to push when slipping off the road means flying through the forest and off a mountain
  the corners are good for drifting or fucking around with racing lines here and hey atleast going off the road doesnt imply bouncing off the road below that all the way to the valley or smashing through a stone wall and plummeting straight onto another road below
  youve listed most things but id be concerned with retard participants who shouldnt be there  im also not so sure you will find a good group of people who can help organize and run the comms  though i dont know the scale you are aiming for i generally dont like the idea of an organized event just because of the amount of people more people is more opportunities to fuck up and more attention  on the right road might take a while to find the risks of traffic are practically non existent and with a proper look around beforehand you can ensure the surface is safe never failed me      this is the way to go about it imo the less people the better      go watch drifthunteralbo where japanese people say that in the past there were a lot of street races ala initial d  i mean after all the anime got its idea from somewhere  either underage or born in the year 2000 the smartphone has changed everything        want to know how i know you are normies
  it does in japan  
  because you think we are trying to pass ourselves off as not normies  fuck that anon if i was a normie i would be like that other fag and tell op not to do it instead of yknow telling him to do it once a week
  trying way too hard thats how i know
  mountain roads near me  im going to assume youre either from 905 area or bc
  woooooooosh
  you can be a tryhard and not a normie as well ya know because one thing is trying too hard to fit in the other is having lurked quite enough but not long enough to shrug off retards
  youre a fag and a half
  nope ontario i say mountains i really mean hills
  doing something illegal in a large group is more dangerous because it means word can get out a lot more easily
  how would you go about organizing a twisty roadtouge street race  well you cant publish touge because the police will read the same announcement and be there to arrest everyone for street racing remember that simply attending as a part of the audience is illegal cars seized at a street race are confiscated you lose ownership of the car but any loans or debits on the car remain yours to pay off
  thats why you usually filter out the groups and kick out the attention whores and hotheads besides they know that if word got out they snitched theyd become an outcast and get punishment from any family member if the place you live in also has a car culture it generally helps as people are more understanding and wont do dumb shit like that    living in a place with those laws  jesus
just go to a racetrack its way safer and is worth the cost
  what country is this
you put way too much thought into this seriously stop watching anime/initial d its straight garbage    i was driving my car on local twisty roads early in the am on a breezy fall morning when i came across an alpine white e36 m3 we did a couple runs together and after we finished up we went our separate ways and waved each other good bye not a single word was said no instagram or facebook group bs needed just that pure shit    anything other than that is try hard tbqh unless you already have friends that are into it pic related is what i was driving
  apparently the usa its widely known many states dont allow street racing they discourage it by confiscating all cars at a street race and arresting even spectators my usa city started doing it after the popularity of those fast and the furious movies stimulated a rebellious culture the government didnt like     right now all the neighboring cities in my area regularly meet every 6 months or so in a antistreetracing conference they share ideas and unify law enforcement efforts and unify city laws although it is not racing cruising is illegal in my city and if a bunch of car enthusiasts gather together for a noncommercial unlicensed meet the police may show up to break the meet apart with the no loitering laws the city doesnt even want any hint of racing culture to exist so it stamps it out if all the little sprouts are killed there will never be any weeds growing up
  that is horrifying thats near australia levels of horryfing
do your facing on the track if you absolutely must race on the street have it be a time trial instead of having two cars going at once
  california ive never heard of anywhere doing this  i know people whove been caught doing 110 down slow roads and just lost their licenses
  do you by chance live near kent washington
 niagara/hamilton area i assume
  escarpment country  t lives on the escarpment
  i wish the sherman cut was longer and the turns bigger
  what a sickening violation of freedom and the american way
    ottawa/gatineau gatineu hills is the stomping ground when my car isnt fucked never
get a trackday pass get a stopwatch and get good faggot youre going to die  hurr hurr but i am good driver  no youre not there are very few instances where you take a car to the limit of its performance on a twisty road go on a track you lousy nigger
your best bet would be to drive with a friend switching positions and trying to keep up with the other if you have at least 2 people at the start and end to report if theres any traffic coming even better the most important thing you should remember is to always keep a safety margin driving at the limit on a mountain pass with rocks and cliffs to fall down is completely retarded but im assuming you already know that    i would like to tell you just take it to the track but its not feasible for the vast majority of people you likely have to drive a few hours to the nearest track a single track day will cost you at least 100 youll have a lot more maintenance costs etc so for someone who doesnt have money to just throw away mountain passes are the second best thing as long as you dont crash      what totalitarian third world shithole do you live in im in socialist nanny state europe and id probably get just a speeding ticket maybe get my license taken only if i seriously fucked up
  this to an extent    its all well and good to tear up a pass but you should really know how to handle a corner and more importantly how you feel about handlijng different kind of corners before you do this kind of thing otherwise you may get hurt and more importantly someone else not involved might get hurt   you arent as good as you think you are and you need that beat into you before you proceed
  dunno what youre smoking here in mo psure spectators get a 15 fine max if the cop feels like being a dick
  finally someone who wants to live in an anime  personally i follow someone while we both do the speed limit in the mountain roads and pretend like im doing double the speed and racing the person in front of me  i even make initial d music noises
  cars were born of the streets there were no tracks in the beginning tracks are unnatural before horse racing there were only wild horses
  get on this level
  youre going to have to give us a city or at least a state i believe you if its california but anywhere else im going to need to look up proof
  how can they ban cruising theyd have to be crazy specific on the law theres no way you can just ban a pack of cars driving together and following the law
  confiscating all cars at a street race  4a violation illegal search and seizure  police may show up to break the meet apart with the no loitering laws  1a violation right to assembly    i dont believe this if its true you could definitely take this to the appellate courts
  how can they ban cruising  not that poster those laws already exist in many places but werent enforced on a large scale or at all they just sit quietly on the books as with many other laws but the city council and police chief just does it if they dont fear getting voted out of office and cruising does occur if organizers apply for a public event permit from the city and if it is approved     st louis lost angeles       its banned for my entire downtown but that was due to the criminals cruising around looking for targets to snatch things from my downtown has had cruising events due to permits the city council also allows cruising on high school graduation day as there is a high school bording the downtown area    whittier california      seattles alki beach      from above url other cities near seattle copycatted the no cruising ordinance years later similar bans on cruising throughout the region have effectively broken the spirits of many law abiding citizens who would have liked to enjoy the simple pleasures of driving down a happening stretch of road on a sunny day without fear of being fined up to 250 if they have to turn around more than once to find a parking space
  here in mo psure spectators get a 15 fine max if the cop feels like being a dick    in florida spectators are charged with a moving violation street racing is illegal in florida and it is also illegal to stand on the sidelines and watch a street race being a spectator to street racing is considered a moving violation common consequences for a person watching a street race are 3 points on an individuals license which could lead to license suspension and a fine that can amount to 500
  at least thats not a criminal violation on your record in stockton california being a spectator is a criminal misdemeanor ouch that really hurts the sentence for that misdemanor can be up to six months in jail and 1000 fine        the law applies to private property too
  update us when you inevitably  a crash and die  b crash and hurt someone else  c give up your dream to imitate initial d because no one else cares or will take you seriously
  ive done something like this before you need a handful of wellorganized people to drive ahead to the finish and any important corners everyone needs an frs radio with headset capable of using privacy codes do not post anything about the route online or cops will wait for you happened once pick a meeting spot in a parking lot somewhere and go from there to the location if you have too many people or do it too often cops will show up anyway    realistically you cant do this with even a moderately sized group anymore youre best off going for occasional drives with a few close friends with social media youd pull it off once before the entire world knows what youre up to
  also dont do it at midnight or 1 low visibility is dangerous and there are more cops out looking for drunks go right before dawn
  do not post anything about the route online or cops will wait for you happened once  this is why the washington /o/ group based in the seattle does not post meet info in /o/ they have you go to the telegram group using the telegram smartphone/pc app so people can still continue to communicate with the group from a pc or smartphone    one meet was broken up by the police that showed up the police forced immediate dispersal
what sort of radio do you use  cb 27 mhz  2m 145 mhz
  literal niggers and spics destroying the cities with drug dealing and the accompanying violence  swat forcefully breaks up a car meet on the off chance theres a car accident    and this is why i say fuck the police and fuck even registering the car you plan on hooning     catch me if you can rozzers clearly im more dangerous than the scum selling crack and heroin to young whites
  privacy codes dont do diddly shit all they are is a constant tone that you can use to set a radio to reject all incoming traffic without the tone present they dont offer any kind of privacy    if youre really that worried and dont want to use phones pick up a few md380s from ebay and use them in simplex on digital mode if you dont want the police listening in real time
  oh yeah also this is illegal but nobody cares the laws never get enforced and the police probably dont know that    you could also go full retard and get actual encrypted radios but those are too expensive to be worthwhile imo  or you could just talk in code like a tacticool operating street vigilante
  this also has the benefit of way more power and antenna choice compared to frs/gmrs radios which is a godsend if youre trying to do this anywhere with hills or if you want to talk farther than a few hundred meters  you could also buy some 6 meter handhelds since literally nobody uses 6 meters and nobody would bother to listen in
    baofeng radios have plenty of range and also have antenna options they are also quite cheap at amazon
  he mentioned privacy codes so i assume hes looking for something a bit more secure than normal analog radios
  are encrypted radios legal without a license
  is street racing legal    dont get caught dumb ass
  yeah  wifi and cellphones
  youre literally using them for an illegal street race why would it fucking matter if theyre legal or not
organize online  registration with cryptocurrency for the pot and racer details like vehicle model name and all that  send out location 24 hours in advance   fwd all of this to the highway patrol and kek at all the retarded boyracers getting impounded and count my bitcoins
  street racing is a big crime but not an fcc violating federal crime  youll disappear forever if the fcc catches you broadcasting illegally
  that guy on /diy/ who got swatd after building a fm transmitter  fcc is no joke
  roll races  christ i knew /o/ was bad but i didnt think it was this bad digs and twists are the only acceptable style of street racing rolls are too fucking easy you suck
  rolls are for comparing the machines  i wouldnt call them races
  ive done this albeit less organized many times pull behind someone flash lights both bust a u turn then go
  absolutely thanks for backing me up i havent even a clue why it took this many posts to refute the faggot ass first post  here in kentucky we keep having to force roll kids to leave meets because they either take up space spectating or keep arguing over what number to take off at same for who punched it too early  there is no difficulty in it
  thanks for that awesome video
  you are clearly delusional or a newfag if you think anything like this actually happens and people get away with it too large of a group of people too many variable too many things to go wrong and its illegal so cops will probably show up pretty soon kids cant fucking drive irl initial d style racing will end in death wrecked cars or jail time or all three     stop being dumb
  holy shit speak for yourself dude this shit happens every weekend in louisville when its not raining specifically near the bullitt county border cops love it they come out and watch
  what up kent bro
  could probably get away with cellphones with a 3g connection and a voice chat app
  this shit doesnt happen in real life kid anime isnt real  unlike places in the usa japan has car enthusiast shops that remove your bumpers and fenders for replacements that are much more economical to repair replace or touch up after scrapes and contact
  what up kent bro  i wanted to show resistance by driving at night up and down the long straight streets of one of the prohibited zones west of ikea
wait until a retard dies after flying off the side of a hill and you guys are all in insanely deep shit just a weeb fantasy street race like a real american
  it does  maybe if you actually socialized with other car people instead of shitposting about cars you have never driven from the backseat of your moms minivan you would know better  touge and wangan still happens in japan and rest of the world drag races are held in every single country around the world
  is there a screencap/story of this i dont go on /diy/
  have a drone guy looking for cars bring a lot of drone batteries
  have a drone guy looking for cars  more and more municipalities and states have antidrone laws for nongovernment drones they set limits on drone range how long they can fly where they can go etc
going through this thread again i really realized that ops issue isnt how do i organize a street race but rather how do i avoid getting fucked by the local us cops who seem to have a bloodlust over street racers  like fuck actually listening to the transmissions the organizers have over walkie talkie we use that for the mafia over here not for fucking street racers
  here in america real crime isnt pursued because how else would the joo make billions a year on various drugs while simultaneously destroying the lives of the goy    so if youre dumb enough to flex your nuts youre probably best off doing it in a non registered car or bike strictly for hooning    sat state of things in the west    you learn things from coloreds in dirt bike videos where they wild out in the city with like 100 bikes all at once heard multiple times in different videos that the cops chased a particular guy because he was legit meaning registered    if youre stupid enough to ride legal youre just a potential victim to getting your bike taken and having to pay fees tickets and impound costs points on license yadda yadda    its all a bunch of bullshit     great vid on youtube of like 4 cop cars chasing a like 14 year old white kid on a grom through the suburbs then finally bump him with the car and make him fly into a ditch and then like 4 or 5 guys run up and ridicule him while im sure very roughly detaining him    all because he popped a wheelie on the road and took off the the police when they tried to pull him over and give him his probably 300 dollar ticket    4 cruisers in a low speed pursuit for a kid on a fucking moped meanwhile theres open air drug deals and rape and etc    fuck the police
  reddit spacing
  if youre not trolling then i stand corrected ive seen small little drag races happen but something like this is top large to get away with where i live you have the law on your side though which is a major limiting factor where i live they would call in helicopters for something like that
  how do i avoid getting fucked  its pretty difficult because the local city governments got together to share ideas one thing that happened was that they put up more of those bubble cameras on traffic light or light poles if the computer senses a lot of cars gathering at night it alerts the police to visit that spot     big brother computers cameras and automation shut down all the good racing spots near my location
  look i dont want to turn this political everybody but you guys cant even have a car gathering without the police breaking it up why some people are so delusional they keep saying more free than you mohammed is it coping at this point
  it will be an utter clusterufuck  even on a closed street circuit with three marshals at each corner it takes ages to respond to information  for the radios to be any use you need a repeater positioned equidistant from all nodes and high as possible for direct line of sight  and every corner will need a clear name and people trained in clear communication and use of signal flags    if you are to blockade the start and finish do so at points where diversion is possible  otherwise youll have to deal with too much traffic
  why some people are so delusional they keep saying more free than you mohammed is it coping at this point    1 out of every 200 americans lives in prison
  lmao just shoot them
  its easier for the police to fill their quotas/look like theyre doing something by going after street racers than going after more serious criminals
  different groups of people /pol/tards dont leave their homes ever they think theyre free because they dont ever deal with the police and have their meals and beds made by their mothers
  why some people are so delusional they keep saying more free than you mohammed  how interesting here is an example of how mohammed is less free in a major uprising prosperous country        chinas muslims told to share homes beds and meals with party members     according to the ruling communist partys official newspaper as of the end of september 11 million local government workers have been deployed to ethnic minorities living rooms dining areas and muslim prayer spaces not to mention at weddings funerals and other occasions once considered intimate and private the han chinese government has said this pair up and become family program is an affectionate cultural exchange    the koran demands death and revolution and is a disapproved subversive publication in china     this is how china cures muslim terrorism and puts a cohabiting cultural guide into each significant muslim home muslims refused to assimilate over the years so china lost patience and is forcing them to do so with this mandatory program complete refusal of the program results in the parents being arrested the children of those parents then are declared to legally be orphans these orphans are then settled elsewhere problematic families may get up to three cultural guides living in their home with them    its good that china takes care of orphans children who dont have parents have big setbacks freedom and compassion thats china the freedom to eat anything is also encouraged muslim families with cultural guides are not allowed to check if food is halal or not time is saved because time spent on prayer or reading the koran isnt allowed
  of everything i typed all you could assume is that im from reddit because i space my thoughts out and felt the need to post that assumption    not too bright
i have the best twisties in my area but all my friends one by one are retiring with excuses like im going to become a cop soon i cant get caught or i dont want a ticket now everyone close to me drives honda fits and basemodel imprezas might actually have to join the local gang at least they still drive sad times
  one thing that happened was that they put up more of those bubble cameras  those are usually for license plate identification      just shoot them  theyre in metal cases with armor lip blocking projectile access to the front of the lens metal cases means real bullets needed to penetrate gunfire in the city is too risky since the police will now stake out the area after any shooting of cameras and make racing impossible
  jesus christ this meme needs to die already
  complacency breeds docility    why bother risking your life when you could just pop in forza 4 drink a redbull and have the same adrenaline rush    video games porn vr etc have made society even more herded and docile than ever before and even former wild wests like the internet are slowly getting tamed every day i used to torrent literally any game and movie i could nowadays its so much harder to find it or get away with it that its just easier to buy it    same thing goes for racing even if you wear a ski mask and take off your plates theyll put together 6 hours of video surveillance to catch you coming out of your garage or identify you by a dent you claimed on your insurance 6 months ago      its sad but its just the way things are now
  wats dis about kent
  theyll put together 6 hours of video surveillance  our police dept has cooperative arrangements premade to get video surveillance footage from various malls shops and facilities that have high resolution cameras that cover part of the roadway that way even if they dont have the license plate at the scene of the crime they will follow the path of the car to see where it goes eventually it will reach a location that has a camera able to get a clean view of the license plate
      i live near the hills in the blue ridge so we have alot of good mountain pass roads we used to go to my familys cabin land and just have like 10 drivers going from top to bottom nobody ever wrecked we raced all the time for fun it wouldnt be hard to manage an underhand tournament and profit off of prize money  entry fees
  yeah thats exactly what i meant i just assumed that happens literally everywhere now
  underhanded tournament  prize money  entry fees  get the fuck out of here
how to keep people from denting your car
i dont give a shit dent my shitbox up all you like faggots
stop caring about your paint and body work and it will stop happening big part of the reason i dont fuss over my cars external appearance also laziness
  fpbp
  my dad gave me this advice when i bought a new car  park far away  if you cant park next to good looking 04 yr old cars that are driven by men  make sure the cars next to you have plenty of space to open their doors even when their owners are 300 lbs lardasses
if you care so much buy a citroën
    park in the boonies at the far end of the parking lot where no one else parks and walk a couple hundred feet to the store you fat fuck
  cars that are driven by men  this helps substantially
  this   iv been parking in the last row of every parking lot iv driven in for atleast the past 5 years and now it feels extremely uncomfortable seeing people park beside each other
get a buddy to guard your car with a shotgun while you shop
park far far away from everyone else and get exercise    buy a used car that already has 2 door dings and you might not even notice a third
i usually straddle a parking line plenty of room on both sides
protip parking adjacent to a shopping cart corral decreases your ding probability by 50
  its only a matter of time until someone keys your car though
  why would someone do that
  how to keep people from denting your car  i reduce the chance by parking next to an obstacle such as the end aisle planter where the plants grow i never park at the very end of an exposed aisle because some sloppy drivers can and do sideswipe hitandrun cars there    i also do not park next to huge boats todays driving aisles are small and the parking spaces are short because car sizes have changed since the 1980s but if some old boat from the 1980s is parked next to you it might hit the corner of your car as it backs out into the narrow aisle
  i usually straddle a parking line plenty of room on both sides  some businesses hate that if you do it at the mall or at some businesses they will call the local police to cite the car and the citation gives the store the right to have your car towed to the storage lot once cited for tow you cannot interfere with the tow getting in your and driving off is interfering with the tow and you can be personally cited for that you must wait for the tow operator to arrive and then sign off on all the paperwork and make payment for a tow which didnt physically happen and the storage at their impound lot which didnt physically happen once you pay for those things that should have happened you can then drive off
  better than a dent in my subi
the only way to be sure is to never drive it anywhere this solves two problems as well since driving your car causes unnecessary wear on many components
hide in the back seats and shoot the first person who dings your car that way youll be known around town as the guy who should not be fucked with automotively
  might as well not even one
  die in a fire
  buy a red 1958 plymouth belvedere fury i heard those cars can morph back into its original shape if damaged
i like to park in between a car that reversed in and one that didnt so that im on the passenegers side of both less chance that the doors will be opened  i never park next to any car that has visible damage or rust or is dirty and not well looked after  i never park next to any car with any sign that kids might get into it car seats those gay stickers window shades etc  i also judge based on make/model and age ill park next to anything old if its clean but never an x5 / cx5 or any other similar massive pile of shit
  park far away    very bad idea this just makes you look like a special snowflake which just attracts negative attention if youre going to drive 5 minutes to the mall then walk another 7 minutes you might as just walk the whole fucking way and leave your baby in its bubble in your garage
my truck has so many dents on it stacy is just ruining her dads bimmer by hitting it
    hes the kind of guy to wait 5 mins and then fight for a parking spot at walmart because he is too lazy to park 6 slots further away
  i dont park it anywhere other than my garage or empty lots
        patina is unironically the best exterior for a vehicle these guys get it    i dont give a fuck if you want to scrape your cars paint on my vehicles canvas
  if youre going to drive 5 minutes to the mall then walk another 7 minutes you might as just walk the whole fucking way  right because 500 feet is about equal to 3 miles
realize however much i love my car and keep it in good condition its from 2002 and daily driven life happens ill just enjoy my car as it is and fix the major things keep your car clean and well kept and youll still get the oohs and aahhs if you want them but also get to enjoy driving it     as cool as those mirror finish immaculate cars are at car shows they ultimately just get driven 3 miles down the road and stuffed in a garage until the next show
  i purposely go to the more expensive places so i can avoid those subhumans no issues finding parking either and no human trash dinging your doors       you could probably use the exercise why are you driving 3 miles to get groceries anyways
  why are you driving 3 miles to get groceries anyways  i dont live in a grocery store parking lot
  dont park next to fat ladies
    why are you driving 3 miles to get groceries anyways    2 hours of travel time just to get groceries    why dont you walk fags just realise that you can save 50 mins just by jumping into an automobile
  neither do i but most shit is within a mile and a bit       i dont walk anywhere i work like 5 minutes from home and still drive
  it would take a 2 hour round trip to walk to my nearest grocery store  plus its up a hill so fuck that shit  i love la
  nice false flag
what about paint protection films ppf these are supposed to protect against dings no
  scratches not dents
  only 140 iq post in this thread
  paintless dent repair with a dildo is the only option
saturn masterrace here who never had to stress with dents
  based
  do  park next to planters/parking lot dividers as close as possible  if forced to park between two vehicles give the drivers side of one vehicle more room than the passenger side of the other  if both vehicles have their drivers side facing your empty space either find another spot or attempt to give each side equal room  if you cannot open your door to the first point where it holds itself open without touching the other car you are too close  park near clean high end cars odds are the driver doesnt want their shit scratched either    do not  park next to people who cannot park parallel to the lines if any  park next to sport/muscle cars with massive doors  park next to stacy  park next to elderly people    t someone who has never had their shit dented
learn pdr buy the equipment and never worry for the rest of your life    if you have a nice car its inevitable ive tried everything and still got them in a shitbox none people hate wealthy people i saw one person hit it so i slammed mine into theirs its legally considered a accident so if you see the person do it get them back
   forced to park between two vehicles give the drivers side of one vehicle more room than the passenger side of the other    ive always been more worried about the passenger side doors of other cars its usually female passengers and child passengers that are swinging doors open and denting shit the only car ive ever had damaged was on right rear quarter panel where someone swung the left side passenger door of an suv out too far
  just get a car with a sofa on its side  pic related 
  lel first thing that came to my mind too
  was gonna post that rented one in the summer manual transmission with no rev counter   wtf citroen cant afford to put a rev counter in a manual car
  my car is dirty as fuck and covered in scratches from dole jockeys walking past it  the front rocker is keyed    i give so little of a fuck anymore you cant possibly understand
  there is a reason why yuropeans are called yuropoors
  based
  i would care a little less if it wasnt a lease     even though ive leased 3 cars and have never been penalized for cosmetic shit since i always grab another i still dread turn in time around 25 years in because by year one some asshole has scraped one of the back doors with his fuck you truck
  your safest bet is just avoiding the places where the animals shop at saving that 3 isnt really worth the door dings
  i live in a place where there are no higher end places unfortunately     when i lived at my parents place in fort wayne yeah i always went to target and shit     its only 1 extra
  i wish all cars had this
  there should really be some rubber padding on the bottom corner of truck doors     where i live that tends to be what gets your car
  no wonder that thing weighs 4000lbs
  park at the back people who park near the building are inherently lazy lazy people are lazy because they dont give a shit these same people are the people who will ding your car without a second thought    people who intentionally park at the back of the lot are the same as yourself they dont want their car dinged and arent likely to allow their door to be chipped by dinging your car with it    this wont stop pedestrians from doing dumb shit around your car but it does eliminate the psychological cause of dents from other cars
  ayyyyyyyyyyy
    dent their skull first
  i keep a bear in my car
  i thought i was the only one
  does he ride a bike  or is he just hairy and gay
how do we fix the 405 freeway
koyaaaaaanisqatsiiiiiiiiii
  execute the wagies
exterminate california
ive lived in socal my whole life and i always assumed that this kind of traffic was normal the pch and other beachside roads are really nice though central california in particular has some really nice twisty mountain roads
the day someone invents teleporters its going to be more revolutionary than the car the plane and the internet combined itll reduce co2 tenfolds and everyone will have a much higher percentage of arriving on time
there are over 1 million illegals registered to the dmv with a drivers license  imagine removing 1 million cars off the road in california theres still the illegals that drive without one but just think about it
  no we dont  we have straight backroads and bendy river runs  bay area and norcal have comfy mountain roads
  why is it so easy to get a license at all
  yes we do retard dont argue with me
  they have the written tests in foreign languages it kinda pisses me off
  ive lived in socal my whole life  the pch  somethings not adding up here
  the fuck no make them adapt im mad now
  pch 1 starts in san diego tho it spans all of california
  whoosh
  stop letting illegal immigrants get dl and enter your state
  how tf traffic even start    just keep driving
  person taps brakes because some asshole cuts across to exit  the 20 guys behind him tap brakes just a little bit more  the 40 guys behind them have to come to a stop because of braking a tad more than the guy in front of you
  the problem there is that they didnt just keep driving
  willingly living in commiefornia  a functioning brain    pick 1 one and only 1 one
  road signs are all in english  you can get a license without knowing english  why
  do they translate the street signs in the test  alto
i took the 405 to the 5 from la to sac on thursday we left home at 430 am 405n actually wasnt that bad we were beyond the grapevine when the sun came up    came home yesterday left sac around 330 got home at 930 and that was cause i fucked up and missed the 405s to 110 connection it used to be two lanes now its one fuck garcetti and fuck the city council    bottom line the 405 isnt bad you just gotta know when to use it
  i get it
  nuke from orbit
i fucking hate california so much  they need to be gassed
  increase gas tax until the poorfags ride the bus
  better funded public transport
  nuke it along with the whole state

  pulsar with gtr badge  this is absolutely sexy
  you dont get out much do you
  more people driving alone in their suvs need to get on a motorcycle
  looks like they stuck the r off a gtr badge on to the bottom of the normal gtir badge
  the pch
  but every time you teleportyou die
  i was thinking that too which looks pretty damn cool to be honest looks much better than what the standard pulsar got for its gtir badge
  revenue in taxes is too lucrative
  us has no official language  mad that a government issued test has multiple languages provided
  30 of 50 states recognize english as the official language  california is one of them  kys spic
  where are you in wa    i want this car so bad
  how about a not so fancy and special train that goes about 100mph parallel to the highway  unlike hsr they arent that complicated and 100 mph is more than fast enough to be faster than you would by car even without traffic
  lol
  deport those illegals
  why is it so easy to get a license at all  because of antidiscrmination lawsuits filed over and over and over and over and over until one succeeds california tried making the exam harder and even that got a discrimination lawsuit and others have posted in past threads their states couldnt make harder tests for the same reason    the antidiscrimination laws are liberally abused day in and day out to obtain special case rulings for expensive privileges social welfare without citizenship and even a drivers license when the person kept on failing
  add more lanes
  stop letting illegal immigrants get dl and enter your state    picture shows migrants crossing a riverbed at the mexicous border after getting past a line of police at the chaparral border crossing in tijuana mexico sunday nov 25 2018 as they finally reach the us through a gap activists and sympathetic people disable fences on the us side cut barbed wire fences and even throw makeshift knotted rope ladders over walls to aid migrants into the us    the mayor of tijuana has declared a humanitarian crisis in his border city and says that he has asked the united nations for aid to deal with the approximately 5000 central american migrants who have arrived in the city ap photo/ramon espinosa
  deport those illegals  its impossible to block the border in california or arizona because so many usa citizens are themselves latino and will help the illegals not only cross the border but also hide
  you mean 101
  i had to use the 405 five days a week to get to work absolute fucking aids  the job was fine but i felt like blowing my fucking brains out all day after the 2nd year dealing with that shit almost an 15 hours each way with no accidents just to go like 26 fucking miles    the way to fix it major god damn overhauls on public transportation fucking proper buses trains metrolinks etc thats the only way freeways in cali are gonna get fucking fixed
  illegals being granted dl      1 million  nypostcom/2018/04/05/californiagavedriverslicensesto1millionillegalimmigrants/        now fuck off and die you piece of shit
  unironically you cant without la being demolished the hardcore car dependence and low density will just always result in this fucking mess     car people hate it but public transit focus and high density is unironically the best solution where only enthusiast and pros who need to still drive do
  execute people who use cell phones while driving
    that would make too much sense euro    we have metrolink/surfliner to get to and from different regions la ie oc sd ventura etc and the amtrak surfliner public transit other than buses are complete trash in socal    too much corruption wasted revenue and just plain retarded people  politics is why we still have a dummy layer amount of smog floating over the greater los angeles area
  bazinga to you too and salutations fellow redditor for i understand your reference and laugh because people dont understand our joke between just us two
  cuckifornia
being stuck in traffic is part of npc protocol to make the lanesplitting minigame possible
    on a freeway like that 1 person stopping can effect 27km of traffic behind them
the only answer is to get normies to start riding motorbikes
all these people shilling for public transport    sure does smell like socialism in here you faggots
  all these people in here shilling for the one actual solution to the problem that has worked around the world     yeah what fags
  the roads you drive on are taxfunded as well so what is the difference
  1 revamp public transport especially buses  2 widen a few exit ramps in key locations  t californian    bonus round ban uber/lyft until they admit that their drivers arent independent contractors and that they should follow employer mandate
  shadilay my fellow magapede
  oh yeah because thats worked so well in the past and hasnt led solely to traffic increasing even quicker and even more severly until a few years later its clogged worse than ever before
design cities solely around cars  public transport is utterly inefficient and merely an alibi so people cant accuse you of abandoning the lower class entirely  99 of the productive employed population are forced to drive  its a freedom thing you wouldnt understand you fucking socialists
        
  there are over 1 million illegals registered to the dmv with a drivers license  thats very believable aka normal for california illegals can vote too in some states by faking documentation     antidiscrimination laws passed to protect illegal immigrants by liberal lawmakers exist for example in washington state the state law requires that the driver license process does not check for usa citizenship this wellmeaning liberal policy has a number of negative unintended consequences one is that many if not all migrants hit and run as they do pay for auto insurance
  illegals can vote too in some states by faking documentation  no they cant   antidiscrimination laws passed to protect illegal immigrants by liberal lawmakers exist  states are free to draft their own laws and legislation you got a problem with that federal cocksucker
  how do we fix the 405 freeway  as with all the other congested roadways being misused simply change the law to allow police computers to not only check for valid license plate and driver license which they can do now of course but also to check if that car on the road has current auto insurance paid up     by removing all the illegal cars congestion will be improved the roads are full of scofflaws
    this fucking boomer punctuation
  get proper driving instructions and exams before allowed a driving licence   improve the infrastructure more lanes  better
  fucking california niggers have to cope so hard  illegal immigrants decrease opportunity for the existing blacks reparations will never occur with all the illegal latino migrants straining the system for funding resources
  pch  the  nice  you clearly dont live here even pch is bad now mornings evenings even weekends it is more packed than the freeway
  fucks sake i always refer to it like that because thats what my dad always used to call it so i just assumed it wasnt such a fucking big deal to abbreviate it or refer to it like that im so fucking sorry i didnt call it by whatever name you retards deem appropriate also i go like once a month tops and whenever i do go the traffic isnt bad go fuck yourself yes i am seething xddddddd
  add more lanes
  improve public transport so it becomes a viable alternative to using the car
  leave la
if people used more motorcycle there would be less traffic
increase speed limit  force all trucks to take the most right lane  deport illegals and and everybody who tries to help them  stop building gigantic suburbs 60 miles away from next industry or office complex  leave california and a few bombs behind
the pch
  i want to split those lanes so fucking bad
  the us has no official language  yet the faa strictly enforces english as the only language of communication
couple of sweet jumps and a criss cross
  thats enforced internationally   
  have you never been to santa barbara
  go back to /pol/
  they have the written tests in foreign languages it kinda pisses me off  the key was for activists to threaten the careers of those politicians that didnt order the dol to make the tests available in multiple languages after that it is easy for activists in other states to tell their politicians to copy states like california     the copying of laws and methods from large influential states is why things that happen in california are often directly relevant to other states
  move out of california
  more lanes  better    hes literally looking at the city that proves that that isnt true but he still says it
  no stay there you fuckers keep ruining everywhere else you move to
  works in cities skylines
  is colorado infected yet    when i inevitably make my fortune in the slave trade ill probably get a vacation home there if its still fine
  traffic jam at offramp and roundabouts
      first of all next to no actual safety relevant road sign needs text and therefore translation  second im german and im allowed to drive in every country in the world even britain because traffic signs a mostly the same everywhere  you could probably too if you ever bothered to leave the usa
  they cant but they do           its been proven that they vote in large enough numbers to sway elections they are counted in congressional districts so areas with more illegals get more representation then they should get
california traffic isnt even that bad in california you can leave at 530  600 am and have an effortless commute in boston youre fucked even if you leave at 500 am
  the cleansing fires will take care of it
    bad drivers are more common than you think    let me just cut across 5 lanes without a turn signal to make my exit in 01 miles
  citizens  you seem to be under the impression that latinos cant be legitimate american citizens regardless if they were naturalized born in the us or even annexed by the us over 170 years ago
  not that guy but youre quite wrong    illegal immigrants come in and then help others illegally come in    they were never usa citizens to begin with    border states and non border states have cases of illegal immigrants being caught but unable to be deported due to politics and liberal court lawsuits staying the deportation meanwhile that very same illegal continues to campaign for no border limits and other similar issues
  remove all the spics from it
    throw a grenade at the very start of that line up    each car will explode blowing up the ones next to it    itll be just like my vidya
  yeah a buncha migrants already crossed the border    historically countries that couldnt control their borders have eventually failed economically even the usas founding fathers said control of borders was essential in maintaining a country its economy and its security
  humans are just fucking ants
make mass transportation private again    seriously imagine how many chosenites in la wouldnt bite at the chance to upend entire neighborhoods to create new private light rail lines for the opportunity to make money off their wagie peons twiceover
i get airborne on the southbound section between wilshire and santa monica kek that part of the free way has a slight left hand bend and right in the middle is a massive fucking bump anything over 80 and youre either airborne or losing control
  if for nothing else this swag af logo
  it could work imo  corporations would at least have the balls to kick all the niggers and bums off their buses and make public transit in la somewhat pleasant
  corporations would at least have the balls to kick all the niggers and bums off their buses  you will have to repeal the antidiscrimination laws to do that as a result of all the court challenges that resulted in legal decisions     will your house burn down before you succeed you would have been labeled nazi attempted rapist of high school or former coworker pedo thief etcetera all fake but enough fake evidence would be cobbled up to cripple your political attempt even though you are not a politician by poisoning your reputation no real politician will cooperate with you activists have had plenty of practice    will your kids get bullied for your actions in my city latinos were hopping mad that some illegals recently detained by ice after hiding for a long time were not granted citizenship the illegals had been successfully hiding working using social welfare and having kids born in the usa go to public school sanctuary states arent taxpayerfriendly so doxxing flyers were created showing the picture of local ice manager names of wife kids and where they work or go to school and passed out or glued up on walls the rule of law doesnt exist unless it is something they can twist to their advantage
make motorcycles mandatory by law for single person transport without luggage
  a good old thanos snap would solve the problem
  if the laurel canyon freeway was built
  japan  hong kong  public transportation works and you rarely see weird smelly niggers riding the train or metro
  transporting all of your atoms in the correct order instantly across spacetime  implying you wouldnt lose iq each time you use it
  red white and blue
  ride the train
  willingly living in california  pick none
      sorry i did leave the thread yesterday so youll have to forgive my late reply but theres a reason we dont want public transport in big cities here in the usa and thats because lack of access to transport keeps the niggers and the poors in the ghetto where they belong they can live and work in the shitty parts of the city and regular middle class folk who can afford to run a car can work in the city and nicer suburbs this socialist garbage of allowing niggers easy access to the nicer parts of america doesnt go down well with anyone except for black democrat voting tax sinks
  jews needing helot mestizo voters in bulk
  well the literal defense department is loaded to the gills with kikes who wont defend the border so i think youre out of luck burgers trump seemed like he was going to do something but apparently he is powerless or doesnt actually care     at least your muddy new majority isnt muslim   t kraut
  i would like to watch this but i will probably be under eu sharia with no internet access
  homogeneous societies  interestingly it works in düsseldorf where a lot of migrants live  with no niggers  that seems to be the issue niggers/sandniggers seem to be the main problem
  niggers/sandniggers seem to be the main problem  we all know it but were powerless to do anything about it im resigned to letting the jews be eaten alive by the diversity they insist is the answer to their insatiable appetite for wealth
  you rarely see weird smelly niggers  those countries are able to enforce their crime laws without being blockedy by anti profiling or anti discrimination laws they do have such laws but those laws are not overdone to the excess they are in the usa and some european countries    so long before the smelly people get on the bus or train they would have committed some other crimes and been caught for that
  because lack of access to transport keeps the niggers and the poors in the ghetto where they belong    this problem with public transit is widely known in the usa people in the suburbs go to work and thus neighborhoods are not as watched or homes and apartments are not populated the criminals use public transit from their slummy areas to go out to the suburbs and case the houses prowl the cars and enter places while the owners are away working    public transit buses even have bicycle racks so the criminals can put on their stolen bikes
  make it into the autobahn and let natural selection do the rest
  absolutely    colorado is getting flooded with californians who are fed up with shit like this they then do jackshit to change the habits and preferences that lead to the problems that caused them to move in the first place
  not using the before all the freeways  okay transplant dont know who you think youre fooling
  how do we fix the fact that over 20 million people drive on infrastructure that has not be substantially upgraded since the population was less than 10 million  expand the infrastructure good luck with all the nimbys who live in that area though
  you lose iq each time you   use the computer  play video games   watch tv  use social media  eat plants  etc    so what more is a teleporter
  calling pch a freeway  youre the transplant and boy does it show    t born in the city limits of los angeles
  ill have to simulate this in plague inc find out where is safe
send all nonwhites into the ocean    boom done
  whats high school like
    that traffic would be taken care of would it not
  t seething spic
  enough mass transit so everyone that doesnt actually want to be in a car can fuck off
  they just finished adding more lanes and not much happened it costed over a billion dollars
  lmao over a billion for a couple lanes lmao
  exactly this get them back on public transportation or better yet deport them
i hope all californians move to other states i enjoy hearing other states bitch and moan about them
  yea its pretty fucked up but thats how public projects go here i think the worst example of it is the bullet train theyre building which is estimated to cost 100 billion dollars or more and they dont even know if people will ride it
  at this point i wonder why they didnt build a conventinal train like 
  i think every major state/province in north america needs high speed rail nyc/gta/chicago/california more and better public transport options means more room for us on the road
  tldr    all drivers across the world drive too close to each other and cause accordion waves because of above example
  because conventional trains dont sound as sexy to the general public because amtrak has left a bad taste in their mouths also i believe los angeles metro is considering building either light rail or a subway through the sepulveda pass       totally agree i hope the slow and painful cost is outweighed by the benefits
  add more lanes
  add more lanes  the real solution is to teach drivers to drive more effectively without causing extra gridlock theres too many drivers that reduce freeway throughput its not refusing to speedbut more their use of brake lights deliberately driving in super safe mode by only starting to move after at least 2 car lengths have opened in front of them or unnecessary driving in the left lane because they enjoy having a large gap in front of them because the other drivers speed away and so many other things    driving exams dont have many requirements because of all the antidiscrimination lawsuits that get filed thats unfortunate that the road conditions are forced to become inferior
one of the things that always confuses me about california highways is weird exits with sharp curves and no deceleration lanes when you have to get people to tap their brakes to slow down approaching these bastards of course you get traffic congestion
  weird exits with sharp curves and no deceleration lanes  again lawsuits by activists and quasi ambulance chaser lawyers have a lot to do with the shaping of highways and their ramps as soon as projects are announced lawyers may contact sets of businesses and residences in the vicinity of the onramp or offramp by enlisting property owners to sign on with the lawyer lawsuits can be filed to keep on delaying the construction and demand concession payments as well as mitigation payments of which the lawyers pocket a good portion of it    almost always there will be antidiscrimination lawsuits filed setting out of court to get those cases dropped adds to the expense as an example of how extensive the topics of antidiscrimination lawsuits can be in my city a bridge was remodeled and repainted the naacp filed a discrimination lawsuit saying the new look could intimidate blacks from crossing it and therefore was discriminatory the city was told by the liberal judges ruling to provide funds to the naacp for furthering education of the black community there were some other concessions but i forgot them as a taxpayer i had to pay my part of that lawsuit cost
  you cant california is a lost cause when it comes to traffic
  sweet terrorist target bro
nuke la and sf
  the absolute state of the county of freedom
  the absolute state of the county of freedom  its the unintended consequences resulting from chronic widespread abuse of antidiscrimination laws the only way to stop it is to rewrite the laws to work in a modern world    picture car driving on the wrong side of the road to avoid the potholes is that a traffic hazard if youre speeding into a headon with the way deficit spending is going its a wonder there is infrastructure money to take care of the usas damaged roads
  only a neutron bomb can reduce the traffic to acceptable levels it actually is not that bad when it is moving not like pch/sepulveda where it takes an hour to go 55 miles every morning
  boomers had to learn punctuation spelling and grammar in school and in business it is millennials and zoomers who are not able to communicate in a coherent manner
  youre hella wrong
public transport unironically
  if they can confirm la to the bay area within 3 hours then you bet people will ride it
  pay people to work from home create multiple business and industrial areas so it doesnt saturate one area or hwy or mass cull one of the three
  add more lanes
  how do we fix the 405 freeway  ridesharing can be made easier to obtain and thus people will use it     create a free app for cellphones that links into a new open system of booking rideshare it is not a version of uber a reward system is built in to also help those with cars pay for the cars    when people need a ride they enter in pertinent info cars close by get a message that someone wants a ride if that car also has a similar destination for that prospective rider they can choose to pick up that person or not based upon the rating of that rider completions no fare rejects no complaints etc rating systems theory already exists and is better than what i describe here so refer to that similarly riders also enter into their request the minimum rating they will accept for a ride source car    it will be publically managed as an independent nonpartisan neutral agency of california it will rate both riders and ride sources with both a lifetime and floating window past 365 days past month in order to allow people enough info to allow or disallow a significant trend up or down can show there are problems    if rides can be obtained or given at will with such a system then it would reduce the number of cars on the road the only problem is the large number of people who want such a system to fail such as politicians getting kickbacks from bus companies bus employees uber/lyft corporations taxi companies etc    who knows there might even eventually be a lot of people who enter im available while at home 45 minutes before they leave to the mall thats the limit of their dawdle time if someone in the area wants a ride they will pick up after arriving at the mall and getting ready to leave but not yet leaving the person with the car might once again say im available and dawdle or loiter a bit waiting for a rider how much of a cars monthly payments can be offset by taking riders is an interesting question
  california  free  wrong in other states they at least build exits and entrances that actually work with long straight exits or at least long exits that dont require you to continuously mash pedals both directions
  i wish the fire got some northerners and richbois but there is still much more to be burned   t californian
make it so only light skinned people with green or blue eyes can drive on it
  nuke california
  might as well close it
  maybe we should just kill all the niggers instead
  start by killing everyone who refers to a freeway as the
  deliberately driving in super safe mode by only starting to move after at least 2 car lengths have opened in front of them  thats not deliberate its delayed reactions from drivers who are looking at their fucking phones
  yes this ffs
  holy fuck that fucking connection has been totally btfo  i cant believe no one noticed something was wrong when a cement truck flipped and shit it down all day the first weekend it was reduced to one lane
  oh god
  it will be inevitable
  implying that rideshare scum dont consistently make traffic worse with unnecessary driving stopping in idiotic places and not knowing where the fuck theyre going     you can make a case for rideshare reducing the need for parking thats pretty much it
  oh fuck yeah i had one of those
  i dont think its permanent theyre doing some kind of bullshit to that interchange     if youre coming down from north of lax its usually a better bet to go 405s  105e  110s though that can suck too
  yeah theyre widening it which we all know works so well  i dont even think of the 105e after about 1330 because it just becomes a parking lot
  in ca this sort of litigation game is usually played with eminent domain laws and property value issues rather than antidiscrimination lawsuits     in la an entire neighborhood century city was built up in anticipation of a freeway that never got built because if litigation now the area is constantly clogged with traffic because the nearby surface streets dont have enough capacity to support the volume of people working/shopping out there
  in ca this sort of litigation game is usually played with eminent domain laws and property value issues rather than antidiscrimination lawsuits    big projects that must be done no matter what become targets of freeding frenzy by anyone looking to make money by greenmail they file lawsuits to delay a project knowing that there is a good chance theyll be paid off just to drop the lawsuit     one major freeway interchange in los angeles by the watts area had so much lawsuit litigation that it was named after the judge harry pregerson presiding over the main lawsuit for the 110 construction otherwise the interchange would have been named the centuryharbor interchange lawsuits did shape how and where onramps and offramps were located and how many extra dollars were given to people in each area affected not only by traffic but by having a freeway block their view block off their neighborhood homeless displacement lawsuit ethnic neighborhood displacement etc watts is 61 hispanic and 37 black the freeway interchange project even had lawsuits for poor people relief aid i just feel sorry for the taxpayer that have to pay and pay and overpay everyone with their hands out for free money        picture is of this interchange add more lanes
  lawsuits did shape how and where onramps and offramps were located  is that why theres nice long modern ramps like the fivestack interchanges in texas except in one corner where theres a tight cloverleaf
  deport those illegals  the california voting population is against that over half of all californians are latino now due to the immigration and breeding rates along with large families fueled by huge amounts of social welfare    its like the detroit effect the minority race becomes the majority votes in picking liberal politicians and shaping liberal laws the laws and enforcement begins to change to reflect support and tolerance for certain criminal activities
  they can live and work in the shitty parts of the city  no they cant because theres no work for them there and therefore their condition will never improve just like it hasnt in their past isolation economists are in unanimous agreement that mobility is a necessity for growing wealth go ahead and keep isolating the lower classes if you want to prop them up on social security forever
just get a flying car bro
someone needs to create luxury public transit theres already public transit for the poor but no one in middle class or above wants to take your busses or subways     this upgraded public transportation needs three things   faster than driving   and this doesnt mean from select points it means from the moment i walk out the front door to the moment i walk into work it needs to take less time than driving   spacious and private seating  i dont care if you can cram 8 people in that same space if they stand people like their cars because they have their privacy and theyre comfortable and not dealing with crazy strangers face to face   about the same cost as driving  a single ride should be about what you would pay in gas to drive to your destination none of this 1 to ride the whole way make it 5 keeps the really poor out but keeps it cost effective for the majority of drivers       i suggest lots of small trains with lots of small stations and extensive amounts of track with ai designed routing for best speeds and automated driving so that you know exactly what time the trains are going to come and go maybe do it with individual cars that only hold ten people and each compartment has its own door and is enclosed so you dont see the other passengers
  lane spilitting motorcycle
  implying you arent losing iq being on this site  get off your high horse
  someone needs to create luxury public transit  taxpayers are already burdened with the high cost of public transit adding a low utilization feature would be a waste of taxes
  they need a better mass transit system or they need to some how get developers to build a surplus of affordable apartments near the major business/manufacturing hubs
  work from home    never going to happen to any large degree     exfrat boy business major managers and blonde fringe tough single moms hate not being able to play social dominance office politics      im resigned to letting the jews be eaten alive by the diversity they insist is the answer to their insatiable appetite for wealth    theyll just move to israel if your country allows dual citizenship and they all do except japan and a few shitholes it has been jewed    also public transportation in america will always be a mess that anyone that can afford a car will avoid because its impossible to keep clean/safe with all the niggers and spics      the literal defense department is loaded to the gills with kikes who wont defend the border so i think youre out of luck burgers    aint it the truth      you literally cant youre just a fifth column that votes to bring more of your kind in every spic neighborhood city country is a crimeridden filthy hellhole your women are short fat and ugly
  youre just a fifth column that votes to bring more of your kind in   you opinion doesnt matter because they have firm control of voting margins in many states and anyone that is effective vocally will become doxxed by the latino activists they actually try to make trouble in your personal life to make you stop opposing them    when you think about these latino methods its no wonder governments in mexico central america and south america have deaths shootings and governance problems theres been over 1000 years of latino governance history and much of it is filled with ganglike thuggery     and this type of problem was brought to the usa the shrill shouting at my city council meetings sucks so far who has been doing the shouting its always been the hispanics even the naacp liason doesnt shout or take you aside privately to threaten you to stop opposing    every spic neighborhood city country is a crimeridden filthy hellhole  its partially the reason why illegal immigration occurs they want to get away from the problems their culture and legal customs created but then they start to duplicate those problems here as they try to grab unequal shares of prosperity from the companies communities social welfare programs and market     liberal activists dont care about that though problems and funding are problems for other people to worry about they only care about spending as much funding as they can force the system to spend
  build another 405 above it
  no they cant because theres no work for them there and therefore their condition will never improve  thats not my problem if they wanted to improve their situation they would do something about it however theyve had a subsidised existence for so long that theyre used to not having to work to survive like normal people  go ahead and keep isolating the lower classes if you want to prop them up on social security forever  thats the point of voting in a republican government america is sick of paying out gibs for the niggers and the poors and were sick of this lefty shit about propping up the lower class    the whole class divide consists of two groups of people  those who are willing to work and those who dont want to work its really that simple
  too bad for you then there are so many overlapping antidiscrimination laws on the books that you cannot hope to repeal them all real people will continue to come to the usa to receive an opportunity for a better life
  build another 405 above it  it cant be done because the 405 runs into other freeways
  central california in particular has some really nice twisty mountain roads  the seirra foothills just east of the central valley has the really nice twisty mountain roads you can just drive along these foothill hwy/roads for like 1000 miles they are the funnnest roads i have ever driven when i was working out there for a month my tire was making a wierd lump noise and i was always worried it was gonna blow out when smashing through those roads i almost never saw a cop on those roads and they were empty
  special train parallel to the highway  it would cost a trillion dollars to buy all that property
i was down in la for a month working a job and had a hotel room 10miles from my jobsite which was about a 90minute commute each way on my day off i went for a leasurely meander on my bike and ended up at my jobsite in about an hour i realized i could easily made it there in about 3040 minutes if i just rode my bike there in the mornings ahahahahaha  buuutttttttt i had a pickup truck full of work crap
  an example of 500 feet of bad road out of the millions and millions of miles of perfectly fine roads  its not that big of a deal
  cars coming head on is scary enough you dont know if theyre on drugs or drunk or tired or if its some nutjob
  wrong there is no such thing as cant
  wrong there is no such thing as cant  your line is very close to how many liberal spending plans start out its the activist liberal viewpoint where money is infinite and its all those mean people who refuse to spend it that are the real problem    in a practical taxpayer sense look at the map where 405 meanders you will the number of interchanges that need modification and the side streets that take up the congestion increase     now if you had qualified your initial statement of making 405 a multilevel freeway with the expenses paid by taxes upon those who use the freeway then okay every car that gets onto the freeway will need to have a rfid transponder cars without transponders will pay 2x rate to encourage people to get transponders basic rate to use any freeway in los angeles county will then be 5 to 10 per mile in order to pay off the right of way costs lawsuit costs bribery costs corruption costs nepotism costs crony costs construction costs infrastructure problems feeder and off ramp problems and side street reconstruction problems    so i propose a 405 doubledecker with mandatory charge for all los angeles county freeway users of 5 to 10 per mile you better not say cant
  you can make a case for rideshare reducing the need for parking  some cities try to encourage or even force ridesharing alternatives simply by reducing the number of parking spaces that are free
  at 510 per mile you wouldnt need to build out a second layer in the first place freeway congestion would disappear immediately unfortunately the surface streets would turn into a gridlocked hellscape     t drives 300 miles of la freeway per week
  retard
  firebombing
deportations
  at 510 per mile you wouldnt need to build out a second layer in the first place  tolls arent done to taxis buses van pools company buses and tesla cars so this encourages more efficient use of freeways 300 miles commute per week can still be zero tolls but people need incentive to find people to commute in a van pool
  i have a different idea  let a bunch of buisnesses cooperatr to fund the railline and only allow people working in these companies to use this line  or have special cars on the train sponsored by different companies wich are for empoyees only  the companies would benefit as it makes them a lot more attractive for qualified personal to work at they could get away with paying employees slightly less and workers could use the train free of degenerates as an alternative to waiting traffic jams
  make it based on a yearly subscribtion with single payments in advance and all this scum cant afford it
  it would cost significantly less than adding even more lanes
  then it is your fucking problem deal with a godawful traffic in your shithole because you guys let them in
  because you guys let them in  you mean because trump let them in it seems hes only paying lip service to keeping them out therefore they get infinite tries and once inside they are in sanctuary zone protected by relatives and able to apply for social welfare without citizenship after a period of time to develop a utility bill at an address boom shakala boom
  do you feel that this causes you a negative affect perosnaly if so how
  um do you live in cali  if yes have you been paying attention to all the illegals here  like years before trump 
  costed
  the nation will be economically destroyed before that happens the deficit spending to cover all the expensive social welfare costs keeps ballooning the national debt at some point the taxes will go to paying the interest instead of paying for maintenance and the infrastructure will then decline drastically
  kick out the mexicans
  its modeled wrong more lanes typically means more traffic and congestion
45 minutes to travel 12 miles    every day
  bruh they cant vote and it has been proven many times the right would be all over it if it was true
  lol youre like a child
  hes alphonse copycat he ignores data facts and the many times hes proven wrong in threads its much the blm tactic of thick skin denial they demand proof you prove it in front of blm alphonse and one minute later he is repeating the same false argument as if you had never proven it these people are sociopaths they dont cure problems
    move away
  you cant even read the road signs on the test anyways the dmv printers are shit you just guess by the shape or something  was driving my cousin to get their permit and afterwards they showed me the test  though that was a few years ago something makes me think they still havent updated any machines probably still running on windows xp too
say something nice about this car
its not a juke
it can carry several 5thousand milliliter 5 liter roundbottom boilingflasks
tent was based
  get rid of those slits above the grille and delete the top lights instantly goes from bad to sort of okay
it was a forward thinking design
  it is the danger
breaking bad just wouldnt have been the same without it
  it was the aztek that made breaking bad tolerable  can relate its the ultimate comfy machine
  t rcr viewer
the center council is also a detachable cooler
  le funnay voice  so you can take your bullshit with you
  it was about 20 years ahead of its time
  it doesnt look too bad these days compared to modern ugly as fuck crossovers
  it was the best car ever made its getting more and more difficult to find them in mint condition but when i do i buy them
  well its pretty sexy compared to a new civic
  you are crazy
  its not a juke its not a new prius among other things its not a new japanese car
  absolute madman i collect grand prixs instead
  i think you have a problem   im curious though what is it like owning two of the exact same car
  should i get a gtp or gxp
  i unironically think its a good looking car
  not a single good thing i can think of ugly and awful pile of shit still one of the ugliest cars of all time
  if you can afford them the gxp theyre the ones that will be actually worth something    t someone who bought a g8 gxp for 22k 4 years ago and had someone offer me 30k for it
  it would have been great with an aggressive front and the back lights forming a slim line across the back like a new renault megan the rear looks fantastic from the side in a retro kind of way like in     a flat / rectangle front with a bullbar like pic related would have been so much better
  lose those side pipes and it would look pretty good
  feels like you can do anything to one or the other and not feel bad about it    t own 3x stis
  it was ahead of its time
  the grand prix gxp is an op shitbox the 4t65e is practicality made of glass and will grenade under the abuse of an l67 why gun would even consider mating an ls3 to one is beyond me if u r gunna pay to get a grand prix buy a late model 4th gen ls car or an 04 gto considerably better vehicles all around for the money
  it would look much better without the turn indicators and the weird upper grille  can someone shoop it out to confirm
all irony aside its not the worst looking car out there and its pretty practical too
they should have freeze design department in 20s or 30s    also vintage cars wallpaper thread
  could you even imagine if cars never upgraded on the exterior    there would be motherfuckers stancing model ts and benzos instead of civics and miatas
  lol
  that looks so cool fixed head
id be happy going back to the 1960s    get the donald to toss out cafe regulations and this can be more real than anime catgirls
  modern cars have at least 4x the power and 2x the width of tire  it looks really weird to have an old style of body with that
  fucking hell that thing has presence
  youre gonna miss the bus dipshit
wew lad
  posts a ponton body  yea whatever retard
  le boarn in wrog geneartion thred xddddd
  that picture just captures it all doesnt it    air so dirty and polluted by industrial emissions that everyone alive in that time period has lungs covered in coal and blood full of tetraethylead  dreary look of a city already suffering from the effects of urban rot    and yet     the most dapper man in town driving around in a car more dashing than should be legal    how did cadillac designers get everything so right for the coupe deville    that image is 10/10 americana
  modern classic segment  does 060 in 45 seconds     also you dont need fast cars to enjoy driving
  and the gucci gang strikes again
    also this 
  kek
  imagine a tesla that looked like a duesenberg
  wow barges really can look good
  1929 crash took out few good manufacturers sad
you gotta love being white
  them damn duke boys
  great minds think alike fuck cafe
  smogged up shithole  great minds
  heres your coupe deville br/o/
  thats the only way i would buy one    instead since nobody offers the car i want im building my own ive got a flathead i8 touring car body and enough parts ive sourced over years of scrounging to build my own car my way
ww2 ruined car design stuff was getting interesting but then car production had to halt at the end of the war all the car companies just had to produce the cheapest plainest things that were fast to make and get out of the factory
  this prediction was spot on
  damn grandpa is that your walker over there careful  really though thats a cool issue
  this was my fathers first car in light blue he tells me it had 400 horsepower
dont mind me lads just the absolute peak of automotive aesthetic design passing through
  that looks like the corvettes autistic cousin
  not with that misaligned bumper
  a p e x s e a l s   p  e  x  s  e  a  l  s
    imagine being stupid rich
          notice that the front wheels sit in front of the engine as opposed to midship like they switched to in the 30s
   so dirty and polluted by industrial emissions that everyone alive in that time period has lungs covered in coal and blood full of tetraethylead    kek
absolute perfection regardless of its historical context
  bruh
  fucking cool
  tfw you will never get to drive a skyscraper  feels bad man
  whos in the trunk
  those body lines    cadillac actually used to make good looking cars what the fuck happened
    its midcentury modern all right    not as class as 
  they are still using similar design language
  kek
  yes and the interior space is truly terrible in cars like that     i drive a 30s truck on occasion and i have to plan braking in advance since i cant reach both the gas and brake without moving my leg in general its fucking cramped
  probably because people were absolute manlets 80 years ago
  still do ever look at the ctsv wagon
  that sounds sick as hell dude
  pic related is the front end
  gaudy dog shit
  even got the engine already may bolt an m22 to it though
    the average height of a man hasnt gone up that much like 3 inch difference at best estimates muscle mass and especially fat is very different know though
  probably the most american photo i have seen
  probably the most american photo i have seen
how do people find spare parts for 19201940s cars just how hard is it and how expensive i imagine its easier witnessing aliens than finding some small piece of chrome trim lmao
  their new cars arent too bad looking and have angular body lines if anything probably the lack of notchbacks and distinguishable trunk lines are to blame
  we exchanged the lead for xenoestrogens in our blood lead was better
  nah
  yeah which leads me to the conclusion that shitty interior space was normal back then
  if you are reading me anon please post your marvel on o/
  based and true
you could get a kit car  t burton 2cv
    thats actually not awful looking its too bad its still fwd but out of all retro styled cars that one isnt bad
  kek
  damn wish i was in that cadillac
powerful
is it the 4 banger
  4 banger  zero banger by the looks of it
moms equinox with ecotec grenades itself cause lol timing jumped  dads silverado eats 2 quarts every 1000 miles   complaining to me on facebook to come over and help them fix their cars
  its probably whatever the base model is because of all the black plastic and halogen lights
  your retarded family should have bought fords lmao
  dummy gauges  cab off filter replacements  2000 driveshaft bearings  ebs shitting themselves at 100k miles
  cound  hn  eoad  vead  y are people still buying gms garbage after 2009
  needing gauges to drive  cant wrench  too poor  cant afford basic maintenance  lmao
  cab off filter replacements  are you the tard who cant figure out how to change the fuel filter
  anything other then gm is preferable
  uhh tthat cant be rright chevy has earned jd powers reward in dependability and initial quality for their trucks and suvs year after year ddont believe the fake news      cant afford basic maintenance  this i mean call it anecdotal but my uncle beat to shit 2012 f150 with the 35l ecoboost already surpassed 155xxx miles already and he said he always gives it the proper maintenance hell theres a video on youtube with the same truck that got over 200k miles     however im clueless when it comes to this engine i dont know if the engine shitting the bed early is owners negligence or if its actually fords fault
  delete this right now
  chevy
  ecoboost failing really only happened to the now replaced 16 and 23 the discontinued 16 has a head design with poor coolant flow that they solved by having it go into limp mode early post software fix theyre rock solid too the 23 just had idiots putting on wrong head gaskets    outside of those two instances its almost always negligence killing the ecoboosts
  it seems normalfags shouldnt be sold turbocharged engines unless on a enthusiast platform then again the average person today neglects to change their oil iregardless of whats under the hood
  you gotta be a tard to buy anything from this company       a truck is supposed to be beat on and stay reliable thats why trucks are supposed to use lazy v8s
    electronics are more reliable    they are so reliable that you cant even pull a publicity stunt without the vehicle going into lock down mode
im actually curious to why it broke down the current 53s and 62s are rock solid engines and theyre still using the old transmissions electrical
allegedly the driver accidentally initiated a software update can anyone who works on or owns one confirm if these can be updated via wifi or perhaps the onstar network seems fishy
    thats why trucks are supposed to use lazy v8s    hino ud fuso and isuzu all have 4 cylinder engines that make your v8s look unreliable
  thats why the isuzu i drive for work to haul thousands of pounds in merchandise is a gasoline v8 because its so unreliable
itt chebby and ferd faggots compete to see who can be the biggest cucks
    gm is only good at making naturally aspirated v8s everything else is shit
isnt the colorado a rebadged isuzu is it actually reliable or is it trash like this
  tell em switch to 10w30 and stop buying oil from dollar general
  meanwhile dodge owners try to forget theyre driving fiats
    thats a silverado
  the isuzu made duramax is technically the least reliable out of the big 3s diesels our fuso canter work truck was the worst thing ever made       almost 1000 lb/ft pickup truck  fiat
  yes im asking about the colorado
tfw my first gen avalanche is invincible  176k miles and only a few check engine codes  tfw ive already saved up to have the engine and transmission rebuilt when it comes time  but muh new car reliability
cix  ht  egain  vony  y
    no its a good vehicle specially the diesel ver
  the 28 diesel can be a fucking nightmare if you get a lemon or if one of the million sensors fails plus the 300hp v6 version is pretty far from fast and the diesel is even slower
    you dont buy a diesel car for speed specially truck all you want is torcc
  all torque and no hp is useless in the real world
    depends diesel ver aint all that underpowered        same engine btw
  i do their oil i use valvoline maxlife full synth every 3000 miles and i make sure to remind them the equinox is kill but hopefully i can convince my dad to stay up with religious oil changes and to check his level every week or two
        thats all cool anecdotes and all but chevy statistically is one of the most reliable manufacturers out there
  wow so much pride for piles of plastic
    statistically its not    statistically
  needing gauges to drive  gauges arent for driving  theyre for knowing when you have low oil pressure at idle instead of having the idiot light that only comes on at 0 psi and your engine is already ruined
  im not involved in pointless fanboyism    actually statistically they are i dont feel like posting the data though
  they are gms favorite so they do tend to get more money publicity ect   helps them make better vehicles cause they get more money
    autistic nigger shill
  why would you change full synthetic every 3k miles what filters do you even use
i got a buddy thats only owned a 4th gen camaro and trans am that now dds a focus st    no matter what i say to him all he cares about is hp doesnt matter if the rest of the care is pile of shit if he can race other nerds from red light to red light on his way to work and win its all he cares about big time gm fanboy even though he works for ford
  well thats all that matters in the real world its not like you can use more than 20 of any cars handling properties on public roads anyways
  why does the fact that chevy make reliable cars trigger you so who are you shilling for sperg
    suck my nuttz and likk my azzz boi
  um no sweetie this is the top of the line trail boss
  holy shit that is one swollen piece of crap    someone should euthanize chevys design team
  dodge is a division of chrysler fiat owns chrysler if you really wanna trigger a dodge cummins owner tell them they own a six cylinder fiat lol
  but that would make them even more retarded
  who would spend 50k on something so ugly
  sweatyposting
  why would you keep fresh oil in oil burning shitboxes   i could just top it off but i cant trust my father to do even that this ensures he doesnt blow up his shiterado
  first glance think thats some colorado  its the new silverado
  fine but by that metric a veyron is a vw and a jaguar or land rover is a tata
  
  hopefully gms new design language combined with them flipping off america will ruin them
  that looks sick ill have two please
  nothing wrong with that 4th gens have reliable horsepower whats not to love
  guy at work is one of those buy american not jap crap retards and his cruze just threw a rod at 65k  you know what the best part is i picked him up on the side of the road in an rx7 with 155k on the engine
  holy fuck i just busted out laughing that looks so pathetically bad
  yes those are both accurate and while not literally the same vehicles the mother company will apply their own way of management which can and does affect the end product
  kek
  ls1s have a 200k lifespan for the most part  they arent super robust  compared to the later ls2/3
  i like to think thats what the joke was but they probably have a ford ranger
  ford ranger is the best vehicle is existence retarded nigger
purpose of a truck is to haul things in your truck bed  sacrifice truck bed to make truck more like car gimping its purpose  people eat this shit up    i dont understand
  it looks like it got stung by a swarm of bees
my wife drives a 2010 gmc terrain  help
  the old ford triton v8 was a pretty crappy engine same power as ls1 but a lot heavier
  constantly  having  every  vehicle  recalled  over  lousy  engineering  techniques 
blaming tariffs on gm collapse  blaming trump on gm collapse  blaming the consumers on gm tax  blaming the media on gm collapse  why does no one blame gms collapse on gm and their horrible design that has lead to a complete loss of sales
  i do
  gm was looking so good with the new alpha platform camaros were finally faster than mustangs and you could buy a manual turbo cadillac ats that had the same handling as a bmw 3 series i guess that wasnt enough to sell cars though so they had to try and revolutionize their styling and majorly fucked up combined with how the media is treating their failures it definitely seems like their going under even ford is doing better and ford is not doing well
  cracked  head  every  valve  rusted  oil  leaking  engine  trouble
  just look at these numbers im far from a ford homer fuck them but chevy is a complete shitshow its not like ford naturally has always had higher sales the camaro used to outsell it
  what the hell happened in 2015
  new mustang was actually decent
  decent or it came with a 4 banger that people could actually afford you know because normal people dont want 60k v8s but still want nice looking sedans
  i think a lot of this is because the new mustang looked so different than the previous generation even though it also had drastically different engine options and suspension the fact that you could instantly tell that it was the new mustang is what mattered to people buying the cars the new camaro looked kind of different than the previous generation but it didnt have that major design change that showed people that youre driving the new camaro aesthetics matter and chevy failed to majorly overhaul the camaro design which shows in those numbers
  people buy muscle cars
  when your flagship car is shit people look down on the whole brand
  well it looked a lot better for starters
    iregardless
  its styled like a foreign midsize/compact truckfuck this gay fucking earth and fuck gm pic related my truck a real american truck from the days of gm not being gayer than aids
  the 36s are shit but a 20 year old truck with leaking valve covers and oil pan tends to do that
  g o u r m e t p o p c o r n
  gm and their horrible design that has lead to a complete loss of sales  cool theory but statistically gm is selling record number of vehicles they also have one of the highest reliability numbers in the industry people buy gm because they want quality products that dont break down the reason gm is downsizing just like other companies across industries is because the economy is about to hit the shitter
  people buy gm because they want quality products that dont break down  hahahahahaha
  they also have one of the highest reliability numbers in the industry  what fucking planet are you living on
  be man  dont know how to put oil in car  are my fellow amerifats really this pathetic
  someone who attended said it was the 52l v8 if thats true then thats even more pathetic
  the chassis maybe though more likely a holdover from daimler chrysler but cummins is its own company
  anon has won best in class for initial shilling quality and six month shitposting reliability from jd power and associates for ten years running    chevy find new roads
bought a new 2018 silverado this summer  gm now on the verge of bankruptcy again and shit like this happening  am i gonna be okay guys  the 51 is pretty solid isnt it
  i wouldve had waved at him as i drove by
  mfw normies will never know the joy of driving an unkillable old chebby shitbox  why live
  sure it is just visit your nearest dealership for help oh they went bankrupt
  just keep maintenance up on it and dont do stupid shit with it
  yes my father pays everyone else to do anything with his car
  you shud becum a engleesh teecher   go on slave fix my post
  get swole chebby
  family comes into money and decides everyone gets a new car  everyone buying 50k suburbans and silverados with shit like builtin wifi for your car  just want a civic to get to work and back  anon why arent you buying american do you hate america  try to convince me to get an equinox because bigger is better
  your family is based shame on you a silverado or suburban holds its value better than a civic and is more practical
  nice one
  did that truck had too much gourmet popcorn
buying new  driving with a bunch of annoying drunks in my car  going to the track during heavy rain
listening to /o/
leaving my house
eating an entire crave case by myself    never again
buying a clean title car that had frame damage but the insurance repaired it so it wasnt considered rebuilt
  buying new  i bought a new car and i know why you would say that but consider this  /o/utists stop buying new cars  shit like the brz m2 wrx 370z miata have their sales plummet  toyota bmw nissan and mazda axe their sports cars and focus on cuckovers  used car market gets flooded with cuckovers something like a beat to shit miata now goes for 10000 usd minimum because of their rarity  /o/ bitches until the end of time that there are no good used cars and that their forced to drive a cuckover
using oil other than factory recommended
  i bought a fully loaded fiesta st for 23k usd you know what my reward was for supporting the fun car industry ford cancelling all cars in north america and giving us a bloated edge st monstrosity instead i still love my car but paying extra to vote with my wallet was dumb
buying an automatic
    insurance paid for the repairs whatever hack shop the cars owner took it to did the work
  because for every one of you theres twenty other poorfags like anon that dont buy new because of them now the pool of fun cars in america grows even thinner and because theyll continue to have that mindset itll eventually run completely out
cleaning my rectum with axe body wash
  yea ofc   oh well i had a different shop electronically scan it and shit and they said to perfectly fine
going on /o/ thinking ill be met by insight and entertainment instead of just a big pile of shitflinging retards
    these but preironically
  by some unseen force i seem to notice the shitposting on this board moreso then others /o/ is a special kind of retarded
  on the bright side you got a new car before they stopped making them i bought a new fiesta too and i realized if i waited another year or two to go car buying id be stuck choosing which cuckuv to buy
  maybe your expectations for content are higher if the board has an actual topic instead of just international or random some of the smaller topical boards are much higher quality though
driving to girlfriends house in torrential rain  lives in the middle of nowhere so driving on badly maintained country lanes  driven this road hundreds of times know it like the back of my hand  get overconfident and dont slow as much as i should  back end lets go in the middle of a chicane type turn  manage to keep some sort of control but someone coming the other way in the right lane  overcorrect and steer into a ditch at the side of the road because i panicked and didnt wanna hit them  car is fucked  entirely my fault feels bad knowing that im that much of a retard though never making that mistake again
owning anything past the year 2000     drive by wire rev hang emissions standards 20 inch wheels modern pedestrian and safety regulations have ruined cars with domestic manufacturers cancelling all their cars and the overwhelming majority of vehicles for sale today are crossovers and full size trucks there is no reason to buy anything new     electric bloated npc mobiles are coming whether we like it or not and the automotive hobby is starting its slow decline into obscurity
rebuilding a shit box  what a waste i put 4k into the engine clutch transmission diff and brakes but its still a shit box i wonder if i could even get 1k for it i couldve sold it for scrap and got at least 300 when it was fucked up
    i feel like ive actually learned something       what defines quality    for the most part /o/ is on topic our shitposting usually manages to be on topic rather than regurgitated /pol/ shit flinging which plagues other boards
driving without working headlights before it gets dark and having to leave my car in the parking lot over night and get a ride back
bought a fucking 3000 moped  bought a fucking 700 bicycle
  driving through a large puddle with no air intake  dehydrolocking it and driving it home with mud in the oil
  shit that never happened
begin taking the car apart before checking if the parts department has the parts in stock  still did this today because why the fuck would the advisor book an appointment and take the keys without checking stock  trusting advisors  using 12 point sockets on rusty 6 point nuts or bolts
  fuck this hurts
  forgetting to put the gas cap on for 70km parking the car and finding out 3 days later  leaving bike outside  drifting the about 57 ton winch at the local airfield  just driving to the gas station and anding up driving through 4 different countries  fapping at 200km/h
  aside from the memery i have a good reason to not own any new cars  i live in a good neighborhood or at least i did until facebook and tesla moved into my city and made my neighborhood a target because now our houses are worth a million dollars and mine is in a prime location because i live smack dab in between the gateways to take you anywhere you want in sf bay  last week someone came through and used a tool to unlock and get into cars in my street to steal shit and they only got into much newer cars my car is a 2008 civic si so i guess i missed the cut for cars new enough for the remote exploit to work on
  drive by wire  not a thing
  infiniti makes cars where the steering wheel is literally not connected to the steering rack pretty much all throttles are electronic now brake by wire is becoming more common
  infinity made cars with drive by wire not anymore the system was a complete failure and no one would suggest it due to the obvious security flaw even a similar thing is happening with the ebrake    the reason for the throttle to be electronic was because this actually reduced the chance of the wire getting stuck in wide open and because this allowed if used with good parts and tuned properly to have better throttle response and better fuel injection than using a cable link
  what u think there was some kind of manual cable attached to injectors in the first place     reason theyd get stuck is because normalfags stopped doing easy ass regular mainenance and instead throw it at the dealer whenever a dash light pops up
  its called a 500 truck and zero fucks
  the injectors just inject based on the airflow if the cable gets stuck wide open the engine isnt gonna throttle down its not 1 in a million to see a car with a stuck cable open
  buying a new car from a dealer   i got fucked over with interest never again
  yeah its not 1 in a million because nobody fucking checks their shit its a selfperpetuating problem because consumers stop doing it so car companies gotta make it unfuckable which leads to less people knowing how to unfuck the fuckable ones the cycle continues etc     i dont disagree with you that they are better for the general public but these cyclical problems are extremely pervasive in the car industry and its the whole responsibility of both consumers and corporations to fix it seeing as how these cyclical problems get progressively worse with time i fear that they will never be fixed car enthusiasts 50 years in the future will either not exist or have to cling to deteriorating examples of decent practices that stopped being practiced a couple years ago
  i do agree that more diy culture will make everything better but i just wanted to point out steer by wire is a failed concept and electronic steering means having an electronic fluid pump that takes less power away from the engine and you can modify it to have almost no energy at all making your car feel more connected to the road its an improvement in every way just like electronic fans on the radiator and electronic oil pumps the main advantage of the electronic throttle is actually the increased fuel efficiency
  yeah thats true didnt know about the electric steering detune tho i thought by now almost all manufacturers had their stock ecus pretty much walled off from anyone without a service technician username and password lol
  its the reason why the new mustangs allow to set the steering settings    if it was by me i would have a god damn 800 kg miata with no power steering at all but if you have to have power steering electric power steering lets you set any option you want same with adaptive suspension
drove car over black ice doing 80  sent car into somersaults      in my defense i live in arizona i thought this shit was just an air freshener not a vehicle destroyer
  ha that miata would be nice ive gotten to drive my grandpas 84 crx and i could turn from lock to lock while stationary with the same amount of effort in my 2002 maxima    as disappointing as the total computerization of cars is at least selftunability is becoming more popular seeing as its better than standard shitbox handling no matter what
  i learnt something useful in auto school that was when you learn to work with computers they are almost always a positive sure computers and sensors everywhere break easily and are a bitch to fix but their purpose is to make corrections faster and make the drive comfier and better while also making the car safer    i just wish we could go back to super light cars 70s kei cars had about 700kg or less weight underpowered but still had very little weight
  yeah computers are definitely better i like to call myself a purist in that i dream of building a completely analog car someday another dream build on my list would be basically just a tube chassis and a drivetrain as a lightweight trackonly beast im still relatively young so i think ill eventually have the time and resources to do some of this but first i have to upgrade to a better job that allows for more disposable income lol
  letting drinks into your car  not just letting them suffer for their stupid decisions and driving home safely before they get on the road  not getting home with a puke free car    topkek
  the fuck just keep droving straight and coast
  for the most part /o/ is on topic our shitposting usually manages to be on topic rather than regurgitated /pol/ shit flinging which plagues other boards  m8 do you even fucking browse
  letting my brother borrow my car    it had a fucking pristine trunk liner and the cunt borrowed it for a week neglecting to tell me hed put his old gearbox in the trunk when i get it back the carpets all fucked and the plastic covering the lid is all scratched to fuck    this was 3 years ago and it still makes me angry when i think about it
  once you understand the basics of computer everything is a lot easier but there isnt really anything purist that has no downsizes injection and computers replaced carbs to have better performance mpg better options when turboing and specially with the platinum spark timing of distributor cars more reliability    the ideal reliable cars would be one in which the only computer system would be with injection and spark timing and essential engine parts but then you would miss on things like adaptive suspension auto climate control advanced alarms that know when to turn on and off locks that unlocks the car when you are getting near it etc    as for the issue with most modern cars shitty visibility and weight its due to the laws regarding crash testing making them shitty they are safe sure but if you hate the modern look and weight of them thats the main thing to blame
  i get that it makes more and more reliable power i just like the idea of being able to make it all work mechanically instead of electronically i figured out that i like the process of researching/engineering/building/putting stuff together better than i like the end result once the novelty of the new thing has worn away     as for the tube frame chasis its another thing i just think would be really cool and it would be fulfilling to build it from scratch and see it work plus being fun to drive
  with computers i get it they are awfuly reliable specially computers for engines even euroshit ones are sealed and its very infamous if a car comes up with a faulty ecu most of the issues originate from the cables and the sensors every technician for modern cars will always tell you to assume the computer is last to break since its not only harder for it to break unless in case of a flood or an emp discharge or shit like that but also because of how expensive it is
buying a used vehicle without properly inspecting it or test driving it    this was before a lube shop job lots of athome automotive work weekend work at a proper shop and first year automotive second vehicle gmc sonoma didnt thoroughly inspect the vehicle everything imaginable besides the motor itself shit the bed shoulve kept my civic for another year
  just fucking end this planet  electronically controlled everything
  just driving to the gas station and anding up driving through 4 different countries  give story faggot
  i ran over it while passing
  just because they stopped doing it doesnt mean those cars magically dont exist anymore
  no but it means the steer by wire isnt a thing anymore its a failed concept its not common and its not being made
  have owned 9 cars  have never owned a car made after 1999
  buying a jeep twice
  are you really complaining that you house is valued in the millions
  shouldve bought a ranger dumb nigger
  be buying first car  dealer is a family friend  shows me a car with low miles and a clean carfax that just came in  its bumper is sticking out at the fender  dont worry about that well fix it for you just sign here  buy car  1 week later it pops back out  another body shop tells me it has an aftermarket bumper and frame damage    im never trusting a dealer ever again
bought new 2016 mazda 6 with 6speed  clutch fails at 14k  not covered by warranty of course  first dealership doesnt have anyone trained to work on a manual transmission because they dont sell them  have to go next town over    back to driving my miata with almost 200k miles the only thing i can apparently count on while i wait for the rare as fuck oem clutch to arrive i bought new because i wanted to drive something i wouldnt have to wrench on a while if anything on it fails again that isnt covered fuck the warranty im just doing everything myself fluids clutches belts alternators body panels everything just like ive had to do for the past 14 years im mad never buying new again
my biggest regret was 4 years ago not picking up a 2009 pontiac g8 gxp with 67000 on it for 20000    that same car right now would easily go for closer to 30k with even higher mileage    fucking christ
  valid
i just dreamt i was driving down a mountain at night in a snowstorm and my headlights didnt work  do you ever have /o/ dreams
  i had a false awakening that took place in my car the other day first time one ever took place outside my room  it felt so real everything about it was real the frigid temperature the darkness of night seeing my breath it was terrifying as i had thought i somehow managed to sleep walk to it and was about to drive off in such a state fortunately i awoke for real comfortably in my bed but it was quite the experience
  after a good ride out on the trails all i can dream about is the feeling of gliding through a trail it almost feels like flying also whenever i get done done riding i find myself looking at the dirt banks on the side of the road and how id like to climb them
  i have panic dreams about starting my truck up for the first time once im done rebuilding it and something going horribly wrong because i forgot an important step in the process maybe thats why i havent finished it yet
  dreaming of taking baby for a ride
  brakes in my car are garbage  have dream that for whatever reason im working on my car in my garage  brand new calipers hawk pads and almost mirror clean rotors  feel genuinely happy   wake up still happy  remember that i dont have a garage
i mostly have car crash dreams or dreams where i kill both me and my ex by losing traction and flipping us into a canyon
  i dream that maybe once i will have a gf sitting there on a passengers seat  on the one hand i like driving pointlessly alone round my city at nights on the other hand it makes me depressed as fuck seeing lit up rooms of houses people having someone to spend an evening with and then a look on my passengers seat empty forever
  occasionally have dreams where i am driving a car almost always it ends in a nightmare type situation either the brakes dont work or i turn the steering wheel and the car refuses to turn
find a flaw
its overrated  iits shit my 1993 mx5 rustbucket is better becuse uhhhh reddit said it was
more expensive and slower than leaf springs
  shit interior  slow stock  expensive for what it is  massive thief magnet  even bigger cop magnet  shitty electrics   shitty hicas   only comes with a green afm  ceramic and not steel turbos  heavy
  but can it gutterdrive
not op but dumping my skyline/gtr folder
boomers be like
find a flaw  its nipshit
  nissan  that wasnt hard
  at least post a higher res pic
  thats the highest resolution available from the site i downloaded it from
  no you just suck at using the internet
  sure
  yeah sure
    have fun and thats not a group 5 skyline this is
  this
  i remember this car with cat in pic
  youre thinking about this
  fat overpriced
  terrible budget suspension  budget electronics   rust rust and rust
  easy  its a fucking nissan
tfw r33 is actually growing on me    i might actually look at importing one in the next few years r34 is just too damn expensive to even consider unless you have money to blow
  r33 is basically a r34 since they ran out of budget when they were building the 34 originally the 34 was going to be a v6    either way gtrs are fucking gay as aids
want a flaw start with the nissan corporate board they chose to kill off the z32 and then ignore the us market until 2003 when they decided to jam a fucking v6 in an ugly rounded clump and serve it to us called the g35 how about that    even with the financial problems of the mid 90s those fuckers could have set the r34 up for the us market and it would have sold
  jdm
in initial d how come the other cars can keep up with the gtr i thought they were like 600 hp monsters
  the r32 was great for its time then in typical nissan fashion they produce the car for 15 years with small updates
  its not this
  not imported to usa
    theyre old with old car issues from what ive experienced so far
  forget pic
  burger fanbase
  worlds most boyish car  with the wrx probably
  find a flaw  its made by nissan
where is our scum poster when you need him
  rust  then move out of the rust belt
no scum yet
  front brakes overheat on the touge  hicas is too spooky
  suck my toe gay
  not sold in usa
  the r32 is over 25 years old the r33 is just about to turn 25 years old and the r34 a while to go so you can get one if you arent minimum wage cuck/neet also if you arent impatient and can wait a bit for the r34
  awd  heavy as shit    thats about it
  why would i want one  theyre overpriced
  just for you anon
  nice celica faggot
  that livery
  its late 90s as fuck
r33  r32 r34
  first model r33s nongtrs are legal to import and r33 gtrs built between 1 january 1996 and 30 june 1998 are legal to import through a registered importer as long as the modifications necessary are done passenger airbag and catalytic converter etc
  i found another flaw  you
  okay now this epic
  its explained many times each race they usually win on the straights but takumi and keisuke usually outskill the opponent pull off a particularly unexpected and great move or in takumis case very very good luck during the project d part of the manga
  late 90s    its an actual livery from a group a car that participated in jtc
  overpriced if youre poor yes    in initial d how come the other cars can keep up with the gtr  in initial d    because its a cartoon and youre dumb
  what are those wheels on the white car to the right
r32 gtrs used to be 20000cad to import when i was in highschool and now that amerifats have them they cost 40000 theres your flaw
heavy ass curb weight
    fucking this when i was in high school bnr32 were 12k and a clean gtst was about 6k when i was 21ish i bought a 1990 gtst manual trans engine freshly rebuilt pulled like a motherfucker for 4500 cad now that the fucking yanks got them good luck finding a gtst under 10k or a gtr under 25k unless it needs work    im still savouring the fact you can get a r34 gtt w/ rb25 neo and manual trans for under 15k once the yanks can get those up goes the price
    not when its making nearly 320hp bare stock dont forget pifat 1992 50 rustang made only 206hp stock from a v8
  just stop being poor lmao retard
    so why did bnr32 destroy every single model that competed with them in early 90s bathurst races    lets not forget bnr32 kept winning race after race and they eventually said either the skylines got air/throttle restriction to race with other models or they have to get their own class to race in to not outright win only when the abortion called the r33 came out did porsche and everyone start beating them
    poor like you americans when you came up here to canada in 2014 to buy our rusted out 250000km sloppy seconds 1989 skylines for 5x what theyre worth
  is this the only argument you have  it won some races decades ago  so   lots of cars have done that doesnt make them good cars doesnt even mean anything to people who drive them stock on the street  honda civics have won races too are they epic cars to you
  i remember the happy times of cheap imported 180sxs r32 gtsts gtrs and evos fuck murica
  sorry dude but i got mine from japan and it had a confirmed 77000 kms on it   feels good to have expendable income lmao
    it was still 320hp stock in 1989 could corner better than anything american could still has a huge aftermarket and literally the only flaw was the stock oil pump was weak once you started making more power but surprise theres dozens of aftermarket oil pumps    name a american sportscar made from 19891994 that made more than 320hp factory and handled as good 50 foxbody mustang were a piece of shit that made only 206 hp stock from a 50 and couldnt turn worth a fuck early 90s camaro made only 210hp and couldnt turn worth a fiddlers fuck
  this amount of delusion
  not an argument  lmao dude just stop posting ok
    20052010 were some of the best years everything was cheap since it was only us canadians and aussies/nz importing stuff        cool doesnt mean you fucking yanks didnt have how many crushed from illegally importing them prior and ruin everything good and of course it has stickers on it
    so whats your counter argument i stated mine bnr32 won a shitload of races for their time in 19891995 theyre still immensely popular and could outhandle/outpower nearly all other makes for their time     are you mad even a dinky 1992 180sx with a sr20det little 4 banger made 204hp while a 1992 foxbody 50 boat anchor v8 made 206hp
  poor canadian continues to melt down  lmao i feel sorry for you dude
  you argument is that i won races decades ago  so did honda civics and corolla  so did mustangs and shit who cares  we live in 2018 we dont live in 1989
  i could make payments on an import right now but i prefer to pay outright and i already own 2 shitboxes
  cool dude keep coping lmao
    not really i have 2 jdm vehicles i imported from auction myself for balls cheap before you fuckers can get them         so what american vehicle from 19891994 compares in both power and handling you americans hold on to your golden years of muscle cars from 19651975 so hard that i think its not far out bnr32 get so much love
  rip me
  its not 19891994  honda civics make over 300hp easy  most 4cyls can be modded to 1000hp  in 2018   lt engines in trucks make better power    2018  0  1  8
  whatchu got
dont know if i should blow my cash on a 95 r33 gtr or a 95 supra rz both are roughly 30k including import fees neither are unmodified
  slaps your ass  wat do
  slaps your ass even harder  wat do now
  id go gtr personally but 2jz is the more reliable powerplant and more reliable powerplant if you wanna make big numbers
    ill give you an example    the imported ford sierra was renamed the merkur xr4ti as an american car brand and given the ford 23t ohc this engine is not as potent as the cosworth 20 but all cosworth 3dr parts will bolt on and many parts have been imported stateside to convert the xr4s to cosworth replicas including the engine and drivetrain in motorsport during the late eighties and early nineties both the sierra cosworth and gtr fought for pole position constantly in contrast to the gtr the inexpensive xr4s stateside can be had as cheap as one or two thousand dollars    now go sit in the corner dumbass
  the funny thing was before americans were able to import them you were able to get a really nice r32 gtr anywhere from 812k the fangirls ruined the pricing on them
  watch it continue to spin out and consider myself lucky it didnt completely take me out as it spun past
  its a unicorn anon there are only 7 red kenmeris out from the factory unless its not repainted its a real unicorn  priced at 1 mil dollar  yeah
  kenmeri gtr to make myself clear
    ill take i do not understand supply and demand for 500 alex    as popularity for finite resources increases so will the price maybe 1/2 to 3/5ths or so of r32s made 30 years ago still exist and the number only ever goes down im sorry youre too poor to get in the game now should have pulled that trigger when you could afford to only hope now is to up your financial game and not be a broke pile of shit your precieved value in your mind of what it should be worth is not what it is worth you are not an official source your opinion means zero it is worth what the market will bear your feelings dont matter the market speaks and it says you cant be a poor now so get off your ass and stop being poor
  slower on a straight line you mean  the corvette would get slaughtered in you know any circuit with turns
  1 gonna have to ask you to stop projecting  2 i never said anything was wrong with the price unless its a barrel scraper in canada or the states  3 prices have plateaued since 2013 and have began to decrease next up r34 and supra price boom  4 other skylines supras s15s and all other memetier cars are already being adjusted for market value their pricing wont change when buying if you import yourself   5 you fell for the buy stateside meme if youre paying over 30k for a barrel scraping skyline you should have absolutely no problem finding a 2025k clean gtr same goes for a supra rx7 etc  6 if youre too dumb to import yes you deserve to be shunned for buying overpriced stateside car    t buying another r33 this summer
    i also would like to add a few inside secrets to this market since you seem to be projecting a ton and failing to understand the inner workings ill start off with the main point of it people who want these cars either   a dont import they buy through a stateside import dealer which usually adds a 515k markup to their cars most guys you see at a hardpark with a jdm car buy them this way so the golden rule is dont buy stateside unless you want to skip the middle man and the hassle  b they cant afford them  c theyre scared of the logistics rhd reliability parts sourcing expenses paperwork theft etc   d grow out of it   e they dont care enough and think its a waste  f they have no clue what theyre saying or doing     dont buy stateside unless you want a really clean specimen or are retarded enough to pay a markup for a pig with lipstick    it is cheaper to import a 300zx twin turbo and fd rx7 full stop then buy one stateside off craigslist or dealers in my experience theyre almost always cleaner and importers make little profit doing this  cheap shitboxes like civics or mr2s dont bother unless you really want rhd or a specific model  first gen stis are quick money in canada and soon to be in the us first wrxs are here little to no markup in japan same with silvias and 180sxs  skylines r32 and 33 no matter the model and mk4 supras are cheaper in japan compared to the us dealer prices especially jdm supras buy them before the dealer boom in the coming months compared to usdm supras you can get fully built ones for 3033k and sometimes under compared to 40k usdm actual shitbox cars dealerships are asking anywhere between 5080k for a jdm supra which they bought for 2545k in japan the real price hikes are stateside dealers thats where a ton of the extra cost comes in you should have no problem finding a gtr or a supra for anywhere between 1528k if you do it yourself 4070k for some stupid clean ones
  do you even initial d a nightkids sticker would have been infinitely more appropriate the fujiwara sticker makes you look like a try hard  super nice gtr though especially the blitz wheels
  nissan is best company of the 90s there is no doubt skyline 300zx silvia etc  lot of people butthurt about it aussies crying their v8s got btfo at bathurst amerilards salty they couldnt get skylines eurofags buttblasted that a company like nissan can btfo their expensive germtrash then modern day nissan makes the gtr and btfos everyone again porsche literally cried that nissan faked the nurburgring time of the gtr when it first came out then the gtr shits all over all amerilard cars that need 25l to beat a 38l tt  not to mention in niggerstan america lot of black people drive nissan so the white males on this board are butthurt their wifes boyfriends drive nissan remember to say god bless you nissan before you go to sleep every night
  baste scumposter
   comes with a green afm  the fuck are you talking about
  this european car was sold in the us market as a single use model with an inferior engine than its euro counterpart but people modify them so that makes it an american equivalent   holy shit man
  then why is it faster around the nurburgring
  filename  not original scumposter
  that doesnt have leaf springs you fucking moron
attracts attention from all the wrong people    police p platers bogans weaboos    nissan cheaped out and only put a little six cylinder in it because the japs always cheap out on engines
  it does the c5 c6 and c7 all have them what planet are you on
  nurburgring has lot of straights raw horsepower is a no brainer for those
  on any circuit with turns  his advanced awd gets btfo by leaf springs anyway
  te37s you blithering idiot
  youre a retard    same retard
  the fuck is this then
  slower than 2 fwd shitboxes  
  but everyone in nightkids is a tosser   i enjoy the aesthetic of the fujiwara tofu store sticker where its at   plus you know bunta wishes he had an r32 gtr
  thread
  2 minutes in and the driver of the gtr has never driven on that circuit nice work in proving your point moron
  the merkur xr4ti came before the cosworth andy rouse imported one and won the btcc championship
  modified hondas vs oem gtr  its like pottery
  all true coming from an owner but what it does a bit more than other imports is capture the imagination of generations of people    r32 dominating group a days    r33 being the fastest production car for a moment in 1995    r34 being the apple of kids eyes in gran turismo need for speed and the fast and furious where they progressed from the idea of building legos to building their modified tuner car    no other import captured that basic idea over such a long period like the gtr did
i see a lot of videos of people drifting their skylines but isnt the gtr awd
  with the r32 theres a fuse you can pull to disengage the front and make it rwd or people wire it to an in cabin switch
  r33 being the fastest production car for a moment in 1995  lol are people this delusional
  not leaf springs
  front axle delete /fuse removal depending on model 
  feels good to have expendable income lmao  not a vspec ii
  nobody cares about australians
  thanks you absolute imbecile
whats that one replacement part for your shitbox youve been unable to find
  a car
wheel hubs  lsd from the facelifted turbo model  uncracked dash
  the midpipe between the exhaust manifold and catback
transmission rebuild kits for the weirdass toyota tercel 4wd wagons i dont need it but id like to have one when i plan on restoring it
  factory oem roof racks for my 5th gen accord wagon ebay has them but i dont want to pay 400 for shipping from japan i want to pay 10 at picknpull    the only problem is very single time i find a set at picknpull some nigger has come along and tried to pull them off theyre bolted down with hex screws and somebody has always cracked the mounting points in half i always find the cover piece shattered or bent on the ground with screwdriver marks all over the roof where they have been trying to pop the racks off    who is fucking doing this who is so obsessed with 9497 honda roof racks but yet cannot figure out how to remove them and instead just breaks them and trashes them like a goddamn nigger     rrrerrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeereeerrrrrrerrrerrrrreeeeeeeeeeee    the only logical answer to this is that somebody is deliberately cutting existing supply maybe they are the ebay seller but then why wouldnt they just take the racks and sell them    the only other answers are niggers or drunk mexicans who think it would great on their ford windstar
lighter control arms   fuck you i aint paying 350
  i feel you on the ebay part im looking for the front grilles from a 9496 grand prix on ebay and the one person selling a pair wants 70 each fuck that i have yet to find them at a junkyard too
last factory black solstice soft top was sold years ago  afraid if i dont buy a somewhatused spare now ill never find one when i need one
mfw have ferd ranger  never been able to not find parts
cylinders are fucked up on one of my bikes and theyre nsc plated aluminum so having them replated is more expensive than i am willing to pay im just waiting for someone else to crash and total another bike like it so i can hopefully get a good engine from them bad part is this model was only made for 2 years so its not easy to find a good engine
  good quality control arms 100 dollars   adjustable light control arms 450 dollars  lower control arms 50 bucks  lighter lower control arms 500 bucks
  the cash i spent on that stupid shitbox
  i know that feel it took me two fucking years of watching multiple pickaparts like a hawk to get a goddamn cup holder
  a gf for the passenger seat
amount in stock backordered
  whats the bike
    what car    lucky man
be me  have aw11  put 3sgte into it  gen 4 from a calfina  i have a hard time finding goddamn anything for it
  whatever part it is that will make my service stabilitrak message go away
no org org    snowrollin when edition
the cumhoes are getting worn thinking of getting some achilles desert hawk mts anyone here had experience with them local repco dealer swears by them
  almost bought a 70 series troopie 4k with 480000km came with bench seats 6 spare tyres bull bar brush bar and roof rack only thing was it was petrol
  they look rad thats all that matters
  they are dogshit in sand though might be doing a 598km trip through sand in january wondering if i should get mts or ats
    neither m/t or a/t are really great in sand i think it would come down to the actual make/model of the tire    m/t are designed to clean out their sipes by spinning and eventually youll hit a patch thats hard enough for the tires to grip    with sand this just digs you in deeper    if anything id say a/t are better because the treads arent as deep meaning you wont dig yourself in as quickly most important things are pressure and momentum dont slow down or gun it and get your tire pressure as low as possible to increase your footprint
  at are way more effective in sand the only time i have ever gotten close to getting stuck was trying to reverse up a small sand hill in my cruiser with the mt kummies and its been through mud ruts up to the axles no probs
    kangz    i wish we could get that stuff here in canada there is literally no affordable offroad gear here everything costs fucking thousands upon thousands of dollars thats why no one here has a nice offroad rig theyre always busted shitbox cherokees with rust the parts on them cost 5x what the vehicle does
  eh kings are just cheap chinese shit rebranded through a few companies here a decent quality roof top tent would set you back 2k mine was 830 with the awning used it about 20 times and things are falling apart the zippers for the black cover are fucked to the point that i need to use needle nose pliers to zip stuff up and down not fun when you have to open doors the tailgate and stand on the wheels to get to certain sections that 6 inch foam mattress though comfy af
  ill add my brother in laws kangs awning broke from a wind gust the first time he used it and their led lights are hideously dogshit 4wdsupacentre are so incompetent that they sent me out the wrong roof rack mounts and never asked for them back
  ps if anyone wants roof rack mounts for a 150 prado hit me up 20 brand new
    love these mad cunts
off road trip today
who else /home on the range/ here
  ayyyy im packed up and heading out for one of those tmrw good stuff  where yall at

  theres plenty in va just gotta know where to go
  it really came in
  this nigga went wheeling in silent hill
  but their so far away
  shiiit nigga im in 7cities area im heading out in the morning usually a solid 4 hrs for me to get anywhere good
  damn i though i had it bad but arent also places in appalachia impassible until the spring due to snow
  some areas are a bit harder to get to but not impossible just go with friends   theres some parts that are closed behind a gate ports of the year though but still a fair amount of other options
  so i just got to use more skinny pedal in the winter sounds mint funny thing is i was out there about a month ago with some other car people but we never hit any trails we just drove fast up and down rt 33
  im taking a buddy up tmrw hes wanting to get into offroading n such so ima take him to some easy trails im sure ill get a few good pics for yall
  i am interested in getting a off roader i am interested in a 97 wrangler for 6900 which is for sale near me or a samurai which i cant find  would you be patient and wait for a samurai to come available or go for the wrangler
    22 year old jeep for 6900    what the actual fuck
  small town used car dealership my man its a shame
  then you need to look elsewhere thats a ripoff by at least 100    even a good condition one should be half that cost no exceptions
  i found one for 1500 the poster says it runs but she seems to be a basic so i doubt itll last     or one thats a couple hours away for 4500 with 203000 miles
  the owner just got back to me turns out her son died in another car and they want the jeep gone because of the memories
    this post has been flagged for removal    lolwut    also there are a ton of old wranglers out there hunt around and eventually youll find one worth spending money on    dont get a boner and buy the closest thing to you these vehicles are notoriously rusty and you need to do a thorough check before buying it    check under the carpets in the front the floor pans will rust through like crazy friend put his foot through the floor of a wrangler once the owner had left the drain plugs out and water just kept getting in and rotting it for years
  ayyy
  jokes on her i took a screen shot
  so one should only pay 3450 for a wrangler what if its right hand drive does that affect anything
mfw will be back in glorious m o a b in less than 6 months  finally my dudes i will be free to live again
  tfw good offroad spots but theyre off limits and have trail cams

  when will cl do something about these obvious scams
  if only the was a way to report a post hmmmmm
  there u get the point nigga
taking my buddy on his first camping and offroad trip im sitting here having my coffee and text him about his status   nigga slept through his alarm / day is starting off great
    right because reporting these posts has been so successful  these scams have been going on for years theyre easy to spot and flagging them has done nothing
  u should probably back trace um and kill them
  they took it down
  the magical dust that makes everywhere offroad my upside down fren
  you could i dont know buy a regular tent and stop being a tryhard
    same thing sailing with normies    you tell everyone you are leaving at daybreak to get to your destination before dusk and they wake up at 730 when it gets too rough to even make breakfast
  the p38 range rover is notoriously unreliable while a 100 series land cruiser is the opposite
  this thread sucks op  goddammit you faggots are a true disappointment sometimes
luckily my winch survived its first test      no u
  snowrollin when edition    today and my new doggo got to experience snow for the first time 
  whats the point of the light bar if you dont even use it in a situation like that light bars are the worst mod tbqhf and i like your taco a lot i just reckon llight bars are gay
    there are beaners in colorado oh no
  nice 4runner bro
why is it so hard to find an unmolested samurai in canada
  why would i have it on when the vehicle is still and im about to set up and use the winch plenty of light for just getting that done no point drawing more power than necessary    and yes its a nice tacoma    and also fuck you tay i know its you
  i cant even find a samurai here in the midwest
    this its just a filthy dirt patch outside now i hate this every year we get teased with a bit of snow and i get excited to use my 4wd    then they take it awayand we have a brown christmas all we get is salty roads and cold rain that doesnt quite freeze        sorry to disappoint man we shouldve realized this thread was all about you         is it even possible to find a samurai in canada i live in onterrible ive seen one in my entire life and it was stripped out/bombed out/lifted to shit and on a trailer clearly not road legal
  is norway just one giant bog that sometimes has parts hard enough that you can drive cars on
  i feel you the only off roader i can find is a haunted wrangler
  what made you think that    my part of the country has a lot of marshes and they are some of the trickiest things to get through    the photo you replied to is a wintertime slope used by the piste groomers as a transportslope and not really driven was hoping it was still frozen but the last two days of rain  abovefreezing temps had it soft again while the little snow ontop made the surface hard to read
      tfw my literal desert has more snow than norway and canada     the tides have turned faggots enjoy your sandstorms and tumbleweeds
    tfw youre canadian and all you really have are sandpeople and legalweed
  u kidding bro hella
      i was watching alaska state troopers on natgeo and was surprised at how many fuckin beandips they have all the way up there     mexicans truly are a disease they infect every inch of this continent
how good would pic related 2008 chevy express 3500 be offroad with a lift some larger all terrain tires a higher final drive and a real limited slip diff its 2wd just want to do some remote camping on forest service roads in the west is the wheelbase too long
  yep pretty sure the reason everything is so fucking strict with offroading here in socal is because the guacamole goblins would just fucking trash any offroad path to hell and back if it wasnt in a designated offroad area i hate beaners so damn much plus they just destroy any vehicle they get their hands on
  dont forget wherever they go they dump fuckin trash which is why so many trails and areas are closed off
bump
currently 265/75/16  how much bigger of a tire would make this look more proportionate i feel like they look to small compared to the size body
  285/75r16 perhaps
  4415s
spamming a few pics from taking my buddy up to his first trail was a pretty ok trip he didnt break anything but did get a lil air on one of the last woopdie doos hes still getting the hang of hill decent
  was a lot more moist than we thought   so was a bit snoty in some areas
do i drop 800 on skidplates for my daily
  scenery was pretty great though nice chill in the air and pretty clear view
  for just a phone i thought this pic turned out well
  more cuteness
  all in all it was pretty ok trip he enjoyed it and is excited to get out and do more trails n shit feels good man
  i think next we will do a road trip down to another state was eyeballing a place in n caroline
  sure
  peters mill run minty ive been down that trail a few times
  it was fun would do again super quiet and relaxing ride
  whats a good vehicle to start off roading with fucking toyota tax and wrangler tax are killer in the northeast anybody have any ideas i dont want to spend too much money the vehicle will primarily be used for commuting to work and with the snow coming i need 4 wheel drive open to suggestions but id like to avoid a v8 if possible
  id suggest a toyota or a wrangler but if possible anything with a v8
  
  ill check it out im a brainlet when it comes to tires/size/fitting thanks
  whats your budget look like everybody and their mother drives an suv for the winter in the northeast so you can either buy a rust free vehicle or you can buy an offroad capable suv but you cant have both on a budget at least im in ma and i got my colorado for just under 10k with 95k on the clock and minimal rust but it needed a decent bit of work to be an alright off roader     straight up ignore all the wranglers anything older than a jk is probably a rust bucket up here unfortunately ignore the discoverys those have bad rust problems if you can find a clean cat eye silverado that hasnt been used to plow that might be your best bet infinite aftermarket parts for those things it might be tough to find a clean cherokee but definitely not impossible but read up on some of the forums about those because i guess theres certain rear axle and transfer case combos that are desirable and some that arent so much     my sleeper pick would be a nissan xterra honestly but they did sell 2wd models so double check the seller isnt a dummy and listed it wrong
  if you can find one the old first gen rams are hard to beat
  no thanks id prefer something thats good
  xj you big dummy
  basement budget tier 2nd gen montero r50 pathfinder xj cherokee   ground floor tier 3rd gen montero xterra
  good response
  wont make it any less of a piece of shit chevy
  i actually bought it because my favorite hobby is replacing every fucking ac and heat component every other week
    my only recommendation is go tall not wide with tires    used to have 33x125 because thats what everyone was using and wondered why is car so slow wobbly and shitty to drive
    its always more fun with a group in my opinion
  this 235/85r16s or 255/85r16
    planning a night run for the geminids meteor shower on the 13th14th suppose to be a good one this year
  if you knew what a good 4x4 was you wouldnt be here asking 4chan now would you

it is illegal for a manufacturer to dictate you get routine service through them to maintain your warranty unless that service is offered for free this is clearly explained in the magnusonmoss warranty act    if the manufacturer of your car has told you that getting oil changes done at other locations or even doing it yourself will void your warranty they have violated this federal law each violation carries a civil fine of 10k    you can report them to the federal trade commission by calling 877 ftchelp    the federal trade commission does not open individual cases but instead looks at the volume of complaints they get and if theres numerous people reporting the same complaint will investigate    if you have been similarly violated by the manufacture of your vehicle its quick and easy to report them
  lets not forget their ceo is in jail
  buying a car that still has warranty
  lets hope that faggot stays gone 400z when
ive seen lots of people post that changing your own oil will void your warranty
  well yes it needs to be serviced by a licensed mechanic to preserve that warranty
  i dont believe that is true   exactly what license does that quickie lube employee have
    an independent mechanic a retail chain shop or even you yourself can do routine maintenance and repairs on your vehicle in fact the magnusonmoss warranty act which is enforced by the ftc makes it illegal for manufacturers or dealers to claim that your warranty is void or to deny coverage under your warranty simply because someone other than the dealer did the work the manufacturer or dealer can however require consumers to use select repair facilities if the repair services are provided to consumers free of charge under the warranty  you yourself can do routine maintenance      theres you a gov source
  i know nissan has been telling people this but any manufacturer that does so should be reported to the ftc theyre trying to rip people off by convincing them they have to go to the stealership when they dont
  do you have receipts i work for ininitit nissan  have seen numerous engines covered under warranty as long as receipts are produced the only people who get fucked are the  its a lease i dont have to change the oil dipshits
  no sir the dealership has offered the first 2 oily changes for free and as such can require me to get them there ill be getting my second oil change soon after that is when it will be an issue and yes i will be keeping receipts    as for nissan the reason i was talking to them in the first place is all the little things that have had to be fixed in the first few thousand miles its close to qualifying for my states lemon laws during conversations with them several reps told me that nissan takes into account who does service on the vehicle when they decide whether to honor warranty or not this is illegal another rep flat out told me that changing my own oil would invalidate my warranty also illegal i believe these should carry a 10k per incident if i read the act correctly i have already filed a complaint with the ftc and am urging anyone who has been similarly misled by any manufacturer not just nissan to do the same ive also just sent an email to clark howard if youre not familiar he runs a nationally syndicated radio show where he calls companies out on bullshit like this    ive heard for years from random people that some brands require you to get service from them to maintain your warranty thats bullshit yes keep your records so you can prove service was done but companies like nissan are intentionally misleading people and deserve to be called out on it     also they sell shit cars
  dubs of truth
is there a more reviled car company seriously asking  even the russians have better build quality  their transmissions are universally hated and fail  they have unethical business practices all the way to the top  their vehicles dont feel good

buys jeep gladiator  i cant wait for my wifes boyfriend to borrow this so they can go to his dads lakehouse for spring break what an investment
  its for those people that wanted a jeep but couldnt compromise of storage and seating so they went with a tacoma
their plan is to replace all their failing products with jeep branded equivalents since jeeps are selling despite being the worst built cars on the road    even /o/ has jeep defenders
  people like jeeps  people like trucks
between people spending 80000 on pickup trucks now and modding out their pavement queen wranglers this thing is the intersection of automotive posers itll sell like hotcakes

  baste
  using  to reply  not using greentext right
  nothing about that suburban warrior is based bud
why the fuck does it have to look like a wrangler with a truck bed  why not just make a comanche or j10 successor
  not knowing youre getting counter trolled false flagged pretending to not understand
20065252  mearly pretending to be tardid  nice dc
  oof i got bamboozled i think am kms now
  cheaper to make
  make your own comanche itll be better than any shitty fiat jeep made today
if it came in a single cab or extended cab design id probably buy one if i could afford it desu
  sorry but youre just poor
  ok lake a pic with 1600 pounds in the back
  why would they make this  because they will sell them as quickly as they can make them
  its a wrangler with a bed what the fuck is the problem
  this  i worked at a car wash for awhile and maybe 1/4 of the cars that come through are wranglers a fuckload of wranglers driven by middle aged people who want a jeep for the off chance theyll drive a gravel road once or need to traverse 2 of snow in the winter but decided the cherokee isnt hardcore enough to put their gay spartan sticker on    or base model jks driven by 1822 year old fairly attractive redneck girls who work at coffee stands    the new gladiator looks breddy cool tho
  add to it that this thing will make fca a shit load of money wranglers already have an amazing profit margin in comparison to most other vehicles its even higher than crossovers     this thing will be the same way the profit fca will clear per unit will be fantastic and th4e aftermarket that will spring up around them will make fucking millions
  gotta have the srt style hood bro    hows your 124 treating you btw lpg
  fantastic the modding has begun i got a premod dyno run last month once i get done everything i wanna get done ill roll it again and post the gains along what i did and how much it cost
  the problem here is that this garbage is expensive
  i was really hoping for a 2 door option but i doubt that happens because they developed an entirely new frame for the pickup
  no single cab configuration    just end me now laddies
  why would they make this  worked for landrover
  thats actually the chrysler marque jeep is like 4 from the bottom    99 of fcas shitscore atm is due to the 24l multiair between faulty thermostats crap ignition coil boots and burning 2x the oil of a rotary its a garbage pos
worked for toyota too why wouldnt they make it
  it looks fucking stupid and gay    thats based but it still looks fucking stupid and gay
  little boxes on the hillside  little boxes made of ticky tacky1  little boxes on the hillside  little boxes all the same  theres a green one and a pink one   and a blue one and a yellow one  and theyre all made out of ticky tacky  and they all look just the same
why is it so long whats the breakover angle on that abomination
  if it wasnt an fca product and had a decent engine id drive the fuck out of it however since it is and it doesnt ill stick with my 40 comanche
  i cant drive
  underrated
  lol no on c
this is why i fucking despise teslas and autonomous carsit gives shitty drivers an excuse to not pay attention
  in which the officers had to outsmart the vehicles autopilot system  you mean getting in front of it and gently apply the brakes because it has adaptive cruise control does that count as outsmarting something in california
  this is dangerous this is unacceptable what about the safety of the children   we have to make all cars auto driving cars and we must ban auto driving technology from private usage
  now imagine what would have happened if that drunk guy fell asleep in a nonselfdriving car
  drunk fucktard crashed and died  an improvement
  asnd what about the bus full of nuns he crashed into
  even better

  oh no no no no
  nun soup
  why didnt the police just detonate a nuclear missile in the atmosphere to shut down the tesla
see car i like on dealer site  send inquiry asking if its available at specific location  they say yes ask if i wanna come test drive  say sure schedule it for after work that day  get out of work call and confirm that its still available provide specific stock number   they say yes confirm location i have is correct  get to dealer  give sales rep stock number   thats in our other location lol but would you be interested in these shitty cars you werent looking for  say no thanks and leave immediately    why do they do this who the fuck goes on with a different car purchase after being lied to like that
  consider the fact that most people out there are so weak minded and weak willed that they actually do fall for that shit constantly suckers born every second
  mfw when people actually go to dealerships not knowing what they want its like they want buyers remorse
itt shit normies say about cars  ill start  why dont you just shift into 5th gear so you dont have to shift all the time
  i have never heard this shit in my life
you dont have to let it warm up you plugged it in last night
  not having enough torque to do this    
why do you drive that garbage you can trade it in for much better
bikes are too dangerous
driving with my father  you dont need the clutch to shift  zzrrrrrrcheeeeecch  see  mfw
your car is so old  why dont you lease a new one
  literally never heard  but i have one  why dont you just skip gears bro  cause i wanna engine brake and i like shifting and i wanna preserve my brakes and its my fucking car retard fuck off
so why dont you have gf
when are you going to buy something that isnt a piece of shit  can you see anything sitting so low like that  why dont you just take it to a shop  once i was taking someone around in my car and she saw me use the cars handbrake at a gas station so she took it upon herself to reach over and release the handbrake as soon as she got into the car the rest of the day and it drove me crazy internally
duuhhh sell your car that 300 dollar repair once a year justifies monthly payments for a new one its junk words words words
  why are you such a pussy bitch that you cant tell a woman not to touch your handbrake
  i did but this isnt a thread about putting bitches in their place its about the weird shit that normies do
yooooo
  your wheel look wired
you need to get snow tires for your car  why dont you get just get a car with 4wd thats what i have  meanwhile their tires look like this
what do you mean you dont want drive by wire hell
  homemade hoosiers    based and redpilled
dude why do you like cars dont you know thats a 5000 pound death box humans arent meant to drive cars if you dont own a self driving car thats so problematic
i only pay 300 a month for 96 months for my c300
  downshifting to preserve the brakes    yeah put strain on the 2000 gearbox mate not the 50 discs
  when i downshift to slow down i do it into 4th and 3rd gears that are otherwise never used for normal driving so no im not worried  also the wear is negligible  i know not a singular person that had to change their tranny because of using it too much
  my clutch gave out a couple of years ago on my 97 honda accord and i drove that thing 20 miles home with no clutch worked like a dream
post justed cars  aston martin made this for 16 years  fucking why
what a waste of resources
  fucking why    wouldnt the workers just set the factory on fire if they didnt
  ngl i would
its a big old yacht and it looks sleek and awesome what are you on about   which one are you  a autistic  b retarded  c blind  d all of the above
  that car looks like autistic and retarded only the blind could like it
  why not
1992 aston martin virage coupé 310  looks like a cool car in cyberpunk setting  if you could paint it black add black windows and made it purple glow it would be perfect
  they made this too lmao
that looks awesome youre just a dumb peasant
  in all seriousness what the fuck were they thinking why did this happen
  they had to make that to meet average manufacturer mpg for some euro country    the lagonda was fueled by pure columbian cocaine
  because clearly it was a commercial success for 16 years
    wtf
  the outside of the car is beautiful in its own ugly way its the interior that was just too fucking cheap and rediculous looking to be taken seriously     that is a good looking car
  sweet fiesta
  yeah interior is atrocious for a car that was so expensive   but its just like modern taraf its something for rich people to waste money on  at least lagonda looked cool and innovative taraf looks like ford focus lmao
  british reliability and shitloads of electronics  literally nothing could go wrong right
  then they made this to redeem it
the lagonda and the arabs that bought them kept aston martin afloat
    they would probably stab you with an illegal spoon or sum
  its a toyota iq if that makes it any better it doesnt
  i feel like this was designed by some guy who was given a drawing of an 70/80s american landbarge and told to design a car like that    looks like one of those really ugly chicks who tries to cover it up with a 1/4 of makeup but still looks ugly af
  well they didnt really make it so much as they slapped an aston logo on it to meet fuel efficiency quotas this is honestly legendary and i dont even like bong cars
any of you americans know the paint code for this blue ford according to imcdb the car is a 1972 ford custom 500
1972 blues
  thanks for that i found something similar but i cant tell which one of those was used on the car looks kind of close to the grabber blue on the swatch but the car looks like it could be metallic in the movie
  grabber blue would be prettiest but bright blue metallic 3077 is what i think it is
    i doubt its grabber blue my best guess would be the bright blue metallic the paint as too much of a sheen for it to be anything other than a metalliic    now knowing those names id suggest googling them to see the best match on cars in better quality
    thanks anons looks like bright blue metallic 3077 is most likely what it is ill pick up half a litre tomorrow and see what it looks like

for ignition switch anon in previous thread these sites are very fucking handy especially for people who wont buy service manuals or parts books check torrent sites for manuals and the carl salter site free no malware ive used it many years         pic shows example fz switch if op drills out the two top rivets which hold the mechanical part of the lock to the electrical part of the switch he should be able to manipulate the switch if he can get to the bolts holding the switch remove them and disconnect the switch since the keyswitch is junk no harm done drilling the rivets    the best way to drill solid rivets is center punch the center of the rivet so your drill bit doesnt walk away from center drill a pilot hole about 1/8 i keep a pack of cobalt alloy drill bits for pilot holes then drill to outside diameter of rivet     for maximum happiness learn to use brand specific forums for mechanical and electrical info /dbt/ is not much of a resource nor can it ever be

how to install grip heater elements will heat shrink / a few layers of electrical tape on the clutch side no throttle tube for thermal insulation be equivalent roughly to the throttle tube on the other side     also tips for wiring looking for a switched live near the headlight assembly would the horn work cant be bothered with a relay
  nice opinion
   250 which looks like the same exact bike for 1500 delivered  link please    you really want a link to a chinese 1500 dual sport before i say anything else just open your local craigslist and have a look at what you could buy for around 1500 used that isnt chinese    now that youve done that google hawk 250 and see that you can actually order this chineseum deathtrap from walmartcom and newegg      on another note this time of year sucks cock for riding in general in massachusetts literally every single day thats above 35 degrees is pouring rain but all the hunting trails are open now so theres way more opportunities for me exhaust myself trying to keep my 400lb fart machine upright with these whack ass tires still really fun still love the bike still wish i owned a car      how to install grip heater elements    honestly just save yourself the trouble and bike a set of oxford heated grips used on ebay i did that last winter and got some for 40 and they were okay but the grip feel is trash and they feel bulky as shit compared to normal ass grips also the tops of your hands still get cold as fuck  i cut the wires off and threw them in the trash when it got warm out again      join me in the war agianst winter fuck this rainy bullshit    be grateful its not ice and snow ya cunt
  thanks butthurt weeb fag
  be grateful its not ice and snow ya cunt  thats true last year was a fucking nightmare and i nearly ended up in a canal
  you would love to put stickers on your nobike dont lie to yourself
  what   using the grip heater elements you can use your own existing grips thus same feel as before heaters installed plus theyre thinner than actual heated grips  most use a plastic inner ring for thermal insulation and are therefore much thicker than just plain grips on handlebars
  hurr i am a degenerate weeb faggot and everyone who isnt doesnt own a bike  kys germ
  using the grip heater elements you can use your own existing grips  have fun getting them over the bar  have fun with wasting battery power due to inefficient heating

my steering feels kinda bad is it because of my worn steering bearings
  define bad
  could also be low tire pressure
  it goes straight when i take my hands off the bars the bars look straight they dont wobble at all but they dont feel right something feels off    i know my steering bearings are on the way out but im too poor to replace them atm    im worried ive damaged my steering doing bad wheelies which is why i needed conformation      might be havent done tyres for almost 3 months
  dont tell us what its doing right tell us whats wrong
  it doesnt feel right and im too inexperienced to know quite what i am feeling my arms are getting seemingly tired from steering when before they never used to albeit its quite slight    feels like maybe the bars are bent but nothing other than just how i feel indicates that they are
tfw youll never go shitbiking with onsa  tfw youll never be 2 dimensional relevant hero in the bakuon universe
  elevate the front wheel and move the bars side to side if it isnt easy and smooth from lock to lock yea the bearings are probably fucked
  i mean i know theyre fucked i was already told by a mechanic haha  i was wondering if all my problems were just the bearings
  thats what dreams are for my friend
tfw the crf450l didnt come out ten years ago so i cant get one cheap off craigslist
  it has been 20s30s for the past week but today was 65 so i went for a blessed rip
  other dual sports have existed for more than 10 years why not get one of them
        tfw 50 f in michigan today  out riding dirt for four hours  only started raining on the way home
  priorities list is  1 fuel injection  2 power  which magically disqualifies the newer 250 dualsports and the older 650 dualsports  if the dr650 was fuel injected i would get one in a heartbeat

  how to install grip heater elements  not worth it    complete oxford grips  35eur    elements  5eur heaters  10eur new grips  1eur heatshrink  5eur real switch fuse holder wiring  5eur varios bits glue smaller heatshrink zipties relay for ignition on  and you still get ugly exit wires and suboptimal power control    single layer of heavy duty glue coated heatshrink wasnt enough  throttle is hot clutch barely different than cold id say gluing actual piece of plastic tubing would work    but the other issue is grip thickness if you dont install them chinesium way over grips and thin heatshrink on top there are only few thin and soft grip materials
  my carbed shitbikes have to deal with a temp range of 5 to 35 degrees celsius and are ok
  well fuggit big bore dr650 tractor time
  price difference is bigger than you say  i got the elements 3pos switch wiring heatshrink and elec tape for 4 on ebay and i wont need new grips if i can successfully remove my existing ones without damaging them     i accept they probably wont be as good as oxford heated grips but when it only cost me 4 for the lot its worth a try surely
this is the most perfect handlebars and display ive ever seen
  how the fuck did you find such a mint condition zxr400 in the uk and why did you destroy it you fucker
  its not destroyed its in perfect condition
spend all year perfecting my wheelie technique  one day my old man is following me from behind  road was empty   pull the perfect longest wheelie ive done in front of him  get a text later that night saying hes disappointed and that im not a circus act and should quit it
  only showing the non dropped side  nice try you slippery sheep shagger
  how much do you want for your zxr400 and how much might it cost me to fix your damage
  im not welsh     how much would you pay for it  crash was last year and the all damaged parts rash on fairing indicator mirror alternator cover were replaced months ago
  inefficient heating  have fun pushing your bike though  since youre already dead set on doing a wacky hackjob for literally no upsides have fun i guess
  ideally id have it for free why cant you move on and get a zx10r or something
  you dropped it in wales and were tainted with their sheep shagging miasma
can anyone tell me what bike this is
  looks like a cbr1000rr to me
  0911 cbr1k rr
  every video on how to winterize your bike is filled with californians southerners australians and new zealanders telling people to toughen up  just dont ride when it snows  are these people stupid or do they genuinely not understand how ice works
  just get studs bro   works for my dirt bike lmao
whats the best cheap under 3 grand lowermid cc bike thats track capable with as few modifications as possible i want it to be good stock because i plan on upgrading to a bigger/newer bike so it makes no sense to dump 1000 into suspension mods for a bike that ill sell in a year or two like i would on an sv650 which was my original plan do i just get whichever early2000s japanese 600 i can find in good shape or something
whats a good beginner stunt bike to practise wheelies stoppies and other hooligan things    just some shitty 500 r6 on ebay
  an r6 i believe will be perfectly good its visuals also are far ahead for the time compared to other bike companies
  takes his superbike to the motorcross track  i would love to try a couple laps of that
  i would use an old two stroke dirt bike if your area allows for it dont have to worry about oil starvation or it getting banged up really just some bark busters skid plates and a expansion chamber guard is all the protection youll need
is there a feeling greater than fresh oil    fresh brake fluid    new exhaust feels    also why did nobody tell me motul is the best smelling oil on earth
  the only aversion i have to such a sensible idea is specificity i figured if i learn on the type of bike i primary ill get good at stunting on that type of bike    although if theres carry over from wheelieing dirt bikes to super sports i suppose its a good idea
  probably r6    other contender zx6r 636
rode the v4 2up for the past two weeks with the lady and it actually did pretty well right side passenger peg doesnt fit because the header is in the way so she put her foot on the rearset heel guard heat surprisingly was never a problem helped that she only weighs like 110lbs so it didnt fuck up handling too much
  did you get a tune on the bike yet did you buy any v4 parts on black friday
  it is a different feel bike to bike due to suspension weight gearing power ergonomics 2t vs 4t once you can wheelie one bike you can realistically do them all
    no tune yet nothing available yet as far as i know she actually runs really well without it just very sluggish and shitty while its warming up didnt buy anything for black friday since all i really need/want now is a belly pan which afix moto is gonna make me a somewhat custom one akra pan with no cutouts and a tank extension i will also be getting from afix im going out to sea soon so i will buy those things when i return

pantsu recommendation please     i wanted to get dainese mig which are currently for 199 on revzilla but they dont have my size my other choice is dainese drake air bcoz i could find size for me/
  just wear some levis and stop being such a paranoid faggot    git gud and you dont need speshul pantsu with built in diapers and ouchieguards
  so she put her foot on the rearset heel guard  that sounds like a good way to lose a foot theres nothing stopping it from sliding into the tire
    uhhh what how would the tire take off the foot shes tiny and at the most her boot would kick the tire if she somehow swung her foot way back if her foot slipped it would just be to the outside since the pressure isnt being applying rearward she did put her boot up against the header at one point but didnt really notice anything we didnt know until we got off and she had a little burn mark on it
  what are you retarded or just baiting me
  zx6rr  not the 636 the homologation 600 made in the earlymid 2000s

can anyone identify what year this r1 is buddy just sent me a pic of his bosss bike that im about to go buy   sorry for the shit pics but i wont be able to go look at it in person for a week to figure this out for myself
  here is another pic maybe it will help
  why would u want to buy this deathtrap
  im such a virgin
  its 600 bucks it looks rough but it just needs some love its not crashed his boss took it appart to replace the wiring harness and then he was diagnosed with cancer so that bike has been sitting in pieces for a year
  oh nice
  ok from here it looks like it was crashed or something the pic is a mess it looks like 20042012 maybe
    i think in the 0507 range
/dbt/ post your holiday deals    i grabbed this new bike and payed 6873 cash after a trade in with my 13 hd softail    ordered an austin racing gp3 exhaust and a gp1r can for 742 shipped as their us distributor is having a 10 promo for ar pipes  this deal should still be live should be easy enough to google their us distributor    ktm heated grips powerbronze wind deflector rg radiator guard evotech crash sliders all at lower than msrp from ebay    trex racing for the axle sliders and case covers at 10 off during thanksgiving
  tank extension    ok jorge    also hate that that undertail still
    i mostly just want one because i think it looks super cool the aesthetic ive always wanted for my v4 is a trackbike thats street legal which is why i wanted a gp style exhaust instead of something more elegant or flowing with the lines love the rugged and performance focused look of track bikes
    this is what the afix extension looks like thinking of getting it painted in schweet american flag livery for ultimate tackiness
  ya thats what i was thinking    im guessing its a 2005 because of the under tail exhaust   thanks guys once i get it ill take some pics of it once its mine i was told its not crashed
  are you getting grips that integrate with the main control unit thingy if you get the ones with the separate control box that mounts on the bars remember to turn it off when the engines off strangely they dont seem to start heating up until the engine is running but dont auto shut off no idea how theyre wired up as i didnt fit them anyone know of a way i could make them only powered when the engine is running    what fairing are you getting the ones that look like theyd actually do something are massive and dorky the small ones are okay aesthetically but look pointless    my next purchase should probably be some crash protection for when i eventually drop it then i want to get an exhaust hanger to ditch the pillion pegs and try and find a rear seat hard replacement with some extra storage under it
  wire the switch of grips to the ignition so when its off grips are off but when its on u can still turn grips switch off
  not the 1290  ya fucked up
  i havent actually tried turning them on without the ignition on but i wouldnt be surprised if theyre already wired up that way the thing is that doesnt stop them running down the battery if the ignition is on but the engine isnt running
  why would u keep ur ignition on when ur bike isnt running the lights are gonna drain ur battery as well
  also if u remember to turn the grips switch off every time ur not using them then its not a issue anyway anon u cant have everything to be foul proof only bcoz ur too lazy to remember to turn things off
  how can you tell
  replied to the wrong person    meant for 
  park bike somewhere  kid comes and pushes buttons  turns on your grips  you come back to bike later and battery is flat  its not just you that you have to worrk about    park bike  bird comes and lands on bars  turns on grips  battery dies
      0406 the tail light is the giveaway the 0708 have a narrower light
  is it not the headlight doesnt match the 790 and from previous photos posted im pretty sure it had the single sided swingarm      the lights dont use anywhere near as much power as the grips there are times when i want to stop the engine but keep the lights and/or screen on ive only had it run the battery down enough that the bike wouldnt start once when i left it for 10 minutes it could take even less time than that but i dont want to test it      no one is perfect we all forget things now and then wanting to make something fool proof is not a bad thing        how can i tell what
  thats why u wire it to the ignition key unless u leave ur bike unattended with keys in
  ok so how do u want the grips to know u arent using them if ur not going to use the switch explain to me which magical device will be able to turn them off whenever u want them to be on
    to turn them off whenever u want them to be on  off
  most bikes use 1 or 2 60w halogen headlights heated grips are usually like 40w or so on full power if you have leds then yeah they wont use as much power but traditional headlights will use much more power than grips
  they dont need to know that im not using them i want them to know when the engine is running some parts of the bike must know this      theyre led      pretty sure thats how theyre wired up and some random kid/bird cant turn them on when its parked up and the key is out
  im going to tell u this for the third time when the key is off the battery isnt giving the grips power so they are not draining it yes there are parts of the bike that have power only when the engine is running but since u cant even understand the easier installation method dont try it urself
  and im going to tell you again there are times when the ignition is on but the engine isnt running during those times the grips will stay on and will run the battery down and its not about being too lazy to turn them off but simply forgetting
is it wrong for you and your best friend to have matching bike
  kid/bird cant turn them on when its parked up and the key is out    there are times when the ignition is on but the engine isnt running  majke sure those times arent longer than 10min your bikes display drains more battery than the grips
  pretty sure it doesnt ive had the display and lights on no way to turn either off when the ignition is on for perhaps half an hour before without the engine running     majke sure those times arent longer than 10min  i dont know exactly how long it can run without killing the battery especially as it has like 4 different heat levels and im not going to test it to find out as such i turn off the grips as soon as the engine stops however being human there will no doubt be a time where i forget to do so
  its okay anon he just loves you and doesnt want to see anything bad happen to you  im sure he appreciated it a little anyway though
  do a wheelie up the driveway every time i go to parents house  they dont even look anymore  stoppies scare the shit out of mom tho
using the rear brake ever
  dont get a r6 that is older than 2003 or you will get btfo    they come with a engine problem from the factory where the cylinders can easily crack after a certain amount of mileage     and they way the engine has built its not an easy fix and its expensive as shit  i learned the hard way
  if you never ride in the rain dont take many corners and dont do much low speed riding then i guess youll be fine without a rear brake also its easier to hold the rear brake than the front when stopped on a hill
  wearing out only ur front disc and disc pads
  the only times i ever use the front brake is for emergency stops or when im stopped at a street light
      are you daft or something
    i ride in the rain all the time take plenty of corners on the track and ride at slow speeds all without using the rear brake then again i am on a sportbike with performance brakes/tires so it will lift the rear before the front tire ever runs out of braking power/locks not sure why you need it when taking corners unless youre doing fancy backing it in shit which only very experienced riders do and definitely shouldnt be doing on the street    i guess it changes depending on what kind of bike youre on i know cruisers and dual sports use the rear all the fucking time    definitely agree with hills though my rear brake had a leaking piston seal and lost all pressure navigating downtown seattle hills with just the front brake was fucking cancer
  this
  same  engine braking stronk
  how else are you going to get rhe ass out in turns
post you are bike
is the link to the map broken i cant get on it
  based fellow aprilia fag
  not sure why you need it when taking corners  corners on a road are very different to those on a track if its not a well known road theres always the chance that youre coming in too hot and need to adjust speed as youre initiating the turn or even mid turn and doing so with the front brake isnt such a good idea    for low speed riding im talking about stuff where youll be slipping the clutch in first gear and potentially coming to a stop using the rear brake to come to a stop is smoother than the front brake less dive and doesnt affect steering as much and is easier to modulate to control speed filtering through traffic its a must have but thats not such a concern for most americans
  i am bike
  that frame nice looking bike anon
  should have gotten a dr350
  inb4 retarded old boomer in a hardly ableson  i have an oil leak not surprised that has to be addressed and a tuneup thats got to be done
  kill yourself
first moto project does this seem like enough material to keep my fork lowers/front wheel from flying off the first time this thing goes airborne it had 1 hole about half the diameter of each when i started
  no one should ever buy one of those abominations
    i own four of them
  sick fuck  probably takes 4 to make one run
  sorry to hear
  making the same mistake 4 times
  imagine being this shit
  nope im just not a shit mechanic      your loss more of them for me ask bairdo about the time i had to start my bike to bring him some tools to work on his bike while in the middle of a huge ride      nobike
  no one questioned your mechanic skills  youd have to be good to own those shit bikes
  tripfag  owns suzuki  4 of them  you are either the most /o/ user or just ebin trolle
    they arent too different if you trail brake which should be done all the time on both the track and street that way if you come in too hot you can just stay on the brakes harder than usual and stay planted using the rear brake to tighten up a line is possible but requires a lot of finesse most riders who find themselves accidentally coming in too hot on the street dont have    ive never had any issues with stopping on the front and it not being smooth i also thinking modulating front brake is substantially easier than modulating rear brake as your fingers have much more dexterity than your foot but like i said with cruisers and some other kinds of bikes with big thumpy motors or just one injector per cylinder typically means sloppy low rpm fueling you use a lot more rear brake theres nothing i do on my sportbike that i cant do with the front brake and often using the front brake is a better choice trail braking is substantially better/safer than the approach of doing all of your braking before the corner and using the rear to tighten it up if youre still too hot
  here is two of mine tripfaggot      
  awh geez you own an aprilla and a bmw i should totally suck your cock because youre so very much cool and amazing and all of the cool motorcycle and shit
  now ur getting it
  heey some friends and i are going to be doing either the idaho bdr or the oregon bdr soon    you coming hit up wombatanon and tell him impact sent you
  stay out of my state shitzuki fag

ywn have a 165 kg 2 stroke sportbike with 70 hp  why even live
  360lbs  70hp  my my dirt bike does better than that
  yeah the heated grips are the ones that are integrated to the main controls     pic related is the wind deflector that i will be using im only 56 so this screen should be enough to cover me for the most part    for crash protection i would suggest getting the trex racing kit as it is the most cheapest one that have a good reputation for their quality products if you got more cash to thow then i suggest getting the evotech crash protector as its the only one that uses three mounting points and from what i read having that much mounting points lessen the stress on the frame when an impact occurs and prevents warping on the bike frame      sorry to break it to you but i have the 18 ktm 1290 sdr      took a while to reply as my phones connection is blocked on this site

  this is better
  justducatithings
  how did u know
  i use it all the time on my sportbike very lightly in conjunction with using the front just so im used to the feeling of using it in case i ever really need that extra breaking power  id happily just use the front break all day but thats lazy riding
  tfw i rarely use the front brake
  two wheel fags dont ride all winter long  lmao

  3pos switch wiring heatshrink and elec tape for 4 on ebay  if you dont install seperate wire from battery at leas add a fuse    and because of tickness of stock grips dont try to install them under them i had to buy extra soft/thing grips or two throttle grips to accomodate one layer of heavy duty heatshrink on clutch side tube and its still much colder
  thats alright raimusenpai will always be there
  what you could buy for around 1500  barely no road legal bikes mx and enduro bikes older than 2010 will need 2k rebuilds    mind you i filtered them by 200500cc there are few cheap pigfat 600ccs but i already have one
  forget road legal just run from the cops if anyone tries to stop you
  link me your craigslist theres always some
  cute tin    i like ur feminine knee
  my suspension is so shit that if i start braking without engaging rear brake first i sometimes bottom out the forks
  get a head cam so we can laugh when you bin it on a roundabout
  give it a shot   
  depends on the motorcycle but relatively few motorcycles die of wear most die of owner neglect sitting in a shed until they turn to shit the best thing you can do to keep a motorcycle fit for service is ride it    150k km isnt shit its common for modern bikes to do well over 150k miles with little fuss a thorough inspection prior to purchase should catch anything that matters if you really want to cover your arse perform a compression test or have a shop do it and inspect the spark plugs since theyll be pulled for the task
  still really fun still love the bike still wish i owned a car    thats the spirit i was car/truck free for ten years and rode in all weathers sometimes it sucks but it toughens your mindset and youll ride a lot more miles than fairweather pussies
  find yourself a preferably factory service manual and inspect the bearings if in doubt but neck bearings never turn a full revolution in use and dont tend to wear out on modern street bikes read up not here places with more info i aint typing the internet for an ephemeral thread on how to troubleshoot handling problems     motorcycle front ends can get slightly out of alignment but are easy to sort out yourself make sure tire pressures are correct as others mentioned    if you are unwittingly gripping the bars harder than necessary that will tire your arms
  mechanic here the suggestion to add a fuse is a damn good idea but fuses are shit compared to circuit breakers because breakers reset while fuses dont replace themselves if you short a wire while riding you can fix it on the spot and return to service without having to carry or find a fuse    you can buy inline plastic blade fuse holders and insert blade style circuit breakers you may have to trim the fuse holder with a hobby knife to clear the breaker but thats easy    get a tube of dielectric grease from your auto store or online a dab in your fuse holder and on any plug connection relay socket etc keeps out moisture and prevents corrosion it also makes connectors easy to unplug    glass fuses are the devil avoid    if youve a piece of wire coat hanger or similar to work between grip and bar do that then squirt a strong soap solution into the gap and work it around until you free the grip soap washes off oil not nearly as well
  that should be fine because the holes are staggered   i like those little magnetic vee blocks
  that was easy    
im gonna get a vstrom as my first bike and have been having a look online obviously you can only learn so much from the advertisement but does anything seem immediately wrong with this 
cbt rebooked going to be doing it this weekend saturday hope ill be sufficiently prepared by then
  how did you fail your cbt
  guarantee he dropped the bike
  dirty belly maybe from commuting or travelling in the wet might be quite a bit of surface rust under her depending on how autistic you are that might be an issue    full service history and im guessing some amount of dealer protection though so should be okay bit expensive given the condition and miles though
got my car license today guess im officially a cager now recommend me a car for someone who hates driving and will only use it below 35f
  renault clio
  i didnt fail it haha it got moved forward it was going to be on the 29th but suddenly its going to be this weekend instructor had a free slot and offered me it which is pretty exciting and pretty sudden realise i didnt clarify that
  im in the states
    get a van or flat bed truck so youve got an excuse to buy a mx or track only bike
  that being said i failed my car driving test four times and still havent passed that so i am provably a retard still
  what preparation do you need to do    tfw my cbt was one of the most stressful experiences in my adult life
  i was going to say if you can ride a bicycle and drive a car its a piece of piss but good luck try not to ride into an oncoming vehicle
  well then the equivalent something cheap which is popular so youll have no problem getting replacement parts
    how good are you at cycling if the answer is ok or better youve already passed just listen to what they say and do it also dont drop the bike at all costs and get on with your instructor how much they like you is more important than how you ride
  clothing gear im pretty anxious about turning up and being bollocked for not having the right clothes definitely need some new sturdy shoes good socks maybe some new denimwear to keep on the safe side      can definitely ride a bicycle didnt imagine that would help but nice to know it will  also dont drop the bike at all costs and get on with your instructor  alright will keep that in mind thanks
  my riding school place supplied gear you sure yours doesnt    you balance a motorcycle the same way you balance/steer a bicycle so yeah it helps
  la creatura/10
  they said they can provide helmet and gloves so i guess i got that covered just clothing really
whats the best bike out at moment im very rich and buy a new one every month
  maybe learn about how shitty the bikes are pic related are common vstrom issues
  jeans thick jacket and your sturdiest footwear then youll be out on the bike for quite a while during the road section of the course so i would dress warm time of year plus wind chill will have your nipples erect pretty quickly

  sheeeet i dont need another bike anon i must ride more why you do this to meeeeee _
  cb650f
  looks like a pretty good option if you want a small dual sport though    whats riding like in latvia do you have a lot of access to off road areas
  stop it
buying a used bike sight unseen    talk me out of it
  do it
why is my airbox leaking liters of gasoline
  you wont
  because the airbox isnt supposed to hold gasoline anon
  well how did it even get there in the first place the tank above it isnt leaking and the tubes are all fine
  filled up at the wrong hole
  carbs because they might be overfeling causing gas to overflow from the airbox
  stuck float on the carb youll need to drain your oil too because it likely filled the cylinder then the case
  as long as you dont get retarded and rip up nature parks there are lots of state owned forests you can ride whatever    also most land over gas pipes and under bigger powerlines are owned by big companies that dont care usually its derelict territory anyway    only problem its mostly flat here so anything more hilly rivers with sandstone canyons and such are almost always a protected nature park  cant leave officially marked road so we to stick to muddy access roads and bogs where one can fuck around to hearts content    something like pic related for miles and miles until a river railroad or too deep of a mud makes you go around some parts of it are clean white sand so it feels like conquering dunes in dakar lol
  if you have carbs and the float valve leaks and/or your petcock leaks the float will overflow and the gas will flow out the overflow tube but the overflow tube is always blocked or fucked in some way so if the carb tilts towards the engine it will flow into the engine and around the rings and thin your oil until the bearings die or if the carb tilts away from the head it will just fill your airbox

  wtf is reddit heres an unfortunate fact that we are only starting to realize sports cars are slowly becoming less popular and suvs are quickly becoming more popular people who 10 years ago wanted to be seen in the new cool hip sports car now want to be seen in the latest suv
  its been way more than 10 years mate who do you think are pushing for sports cars internally marketing fuck no its the engineers whore working on them and not much else
     mate is this the end of the sports car for the masses

  i find it worrying that shit like the urus exists    it seems like suvs are now halo cars for some reason which is utterly retarded if youre an enthusiast    the people with money women want suvs though so were screwed

a few days ago my 2003 330i was taking a long time to start and the check engine light came on i check the code and it was for camshaft position sensor a bank 1 i ordered the part immedietly ive continued driving it and it hasnt had long starts or the check engine light come back on was it just a fluke i would normally say so but it was taking a long time to turn over which is a symptom of a bad camshaft position sensor should i still change it or just hold on to the part thoughts
keep the part in the trunk and get ready to replace it on the side of the road soon
  really i mean i can do it as soon as it comes in the mail but if it was potentially a fluke ill keep running it till it dies then swap it if it goes bad its still drive able with a potential loss in power
it will die slowly just change it
  cam and crank sensors are notorious for hit and miss failure only during the exact right wrong conditions replace it if it acts up again after replacement be ready to chase wires

    i should clarify stupid reliable if you get it with a 5sp transmission the original hyundai autos were pretty shit

cute dog op got any more pics
going for a ride with my buddy  hes in the seat  now the floor  now the seat  now by the door  now my lap  now the front panel  now the floor  now the seat  now the floor    man dogs cant keep their balance for shit inside cars
  wait i thought a good boy in your car was a hand job given by an old lady
pyrenees doesnt like to ride innatruck  pyrenees hates to ride innatruck  pyrenees hates it so much last time i tried get him innatruck he slipped his leash and sprinted down the street to the neighbors house to eat his dogs food and hide    how do i make my dog like to ride in the car guise
  sure buddy just rescued it found in the woods near my mothers workplace
  dogs are not that fragile
  let him drive so he can get used to the car    
  looks like a real good boi
see this thread  a minute later find this stray dog  im busy slinging pizza for work    somebody fucked up using something as a leash that isnt a leash no tag either
  last night he swallowed every drop
    looks like you have a new companion bro take him on pizza runs and people will tip you twice as much everyone loves a dog especially girls theyll think its quirky and fun and tip you even more plus you can just feed him chicken wings people wont notice if theres one or two missing from the box realistically a dog fed on pizza and wings and dipping sauce would probably be pretty healthy all that grease would be good for their coat to keep it shiny and the protein would keep them lean the dairy would make their bones nice and strong too
  never the only kind of bitch i let in my car is the kind you find on tinder
what kind of dog should i get guys should i adopt one from the pound or go to a breeder id feel like kind of a dick not adopting one theres so many that need good homes
he knows hes not supposed to be in the front seat
  we dont need to hear about the twinks you shag you fucking homo take it over to that shithole 4chan
    ur dog has a beard
    alphonse please were talking about dogs not niggers
  never  but sometimes stray cats got up in there before i got around to replacing the transmission cover
  of course hes a fucking tanny lol
  problem is i have three dogs at home hes still hanging around the store though and ill be here until at least midnight
  and sadly not the only one the internet is just too tempting for the mentally ill seeking attention
    he can be the store dog health department would probably love it since hell keep pests like rats away if i was a health inspector id demand that every restaurant have cats and dogs in the kitchen near the ingredients it just makes sense a dogs mouth is cleaner than a humans and cats are always cleaning themselves too so its not like its a hygiene issue
  this is just sad
  so do i
  ment for  
  illiterate lol    nice projection lol    i live my life to please others  poor kid lol
  i refuse to believe this his him but this is consistent with the pictures he has posted
  nice insecurity lol
  it is legitimately him someone caught him shitposting in a /fa/ thread and he forgot to take his name off    he is literally an underage gay nigger furry    rev up those gas chambers
  when one of the previous owners had it i somehow found dog hair in the fucking intake
  stop pushing my shit in (((  lol
  ive been here since the beginning of this nightmare i know all too well how much of a gay furry he is
  when id go with my dad on the highway to see my stepmom on the weekends we had a german shepherd chow mix who would stick her head up the middle between ours was cute
  u mad
  put him in a kennel kennel in the truck hes probably carsick needs some experience to get over that stop if hes panicking and destroying the cage and/or his paws
  argh alphonse wont stop pushing my shit in after 4 years ___ 11 make it stop  that wasnt me it was corey havent seen him long time    me llove corey long time
  if you go looking around to different pound you could select a young and cute one everybody wins
last time was when my cat had a stroke a month ago and his rear half became paralyzed and i discovered this when he drug himself down the stairs to come meow at me i had to drive him to the animal hospital three towns over because none by me were open   he didnt make any noise on the way back big boye was only three years old and i was looking forward to many more miss him every day
  nice insecurity lol
  why are you giving him attention
  nnice projection  has baby plue painted nails and estrogen riddled male body  
  its just banter cant take the heat get out of the kitchen lmao
  i wouldnt want him to have a withdrawal spergout
  retard still illiterate  meltdown lol
    also this   its shitposting u super serious faggot
  today new zealand tomorrow the world
  a car wash in my neighborhood has a doggo a dry cleaner used to have a doggo but hes rip

  lmfao    rekt by life itself
i dont know couple of weeks heres a flock of doggers in a shitbox
  cute doggies
  2014 going out to get gasoline and tacos
cant believe you tards are still driving your shitty miatas when we all know the most practical powerful daily driver    44 second 060 in a luxury suv  sport suspension great track car  keeps pace with mustangs 475 hp and 470 lbft   tows over 25 tons plenty of suv trunk space    give me one good reason why youre still driving your german shitbox when you could be in a piece of genuine american engineering
not sold in my country also here burger cars are unreliable shit heaps or boomermobiles
  dont these things command prices well above their msrp even used
    i drive a 1990 accord with 230000 miles i got for free     i have no monthly loan/lease payment  insurance is dirt cheap and its been a great reliable car   i dont like monthly payments and i like owning things outright  all of my experiences with american engineering have been unpleasant i dont know why we cant design something quite as well as the japanese    i know this is a bait thread too  but im going to keep listing reasons like fuel economy  the fact that i dont need that many seats or cargo room and i prefer the lower seating position and stability offered by a sedan
  fca  unsafe as fuck easy to flip over    expensive  very fucking heavy  cant keep up with any modern sports car on twisty roads due to the above statements
  no the 707hp trackhawks are going for 80k us new which is a pretty good amount of performance for the money
nigga u gay
  the trackhawk is quicker around a track than the stinger and the 86 thats more than fast enough for a family hauler
  based cb7 owner    i miss my 93 se sedan but i like my benz better
  they fixed the rollover issue a while ago not even the same body style
  an 80000 suv is faster than a 25000 brz  i fucking hope so
  shitty econobox detected this board is for real cars
  implying anyone on this board actually owns a car  were all busriders here
  80k gets you some car based transverse crossover if you decide to go german
  nigger rims  try again when theres actually some rubber on those monstrosities
  i dont like big cars with no steering response and automatic transmission and if i want a couch on wheels im buying a land cruiser/tahoe
  grapes soured
shilling
  the explorer sport is a more economical choice if youre really trying to dd a gofast suv    also mustangs are going to go a lot faster with 460 hp than a jeep with 475hp
cucks your tesla off the line  muh instant torque    
  his new bloatcar of choice isnt the audi allroad quattro  do you even fun the whole mercedes brand save for a couple of summit cars has been one big line of fleet vehicles and the gla
  what are you on about you mong heres a real truck
  w124 is a unibody frame how would you even go about doing that
    weld the entire unibody onto a stripped truck frame
  or maybe am a rarted
  shit tier fca build quality ignoring engine  terrible fuel economy even by burger standards  interior is terrible like all chrysler and jeep products
  you take a truck and pull the cab and bed off and bolt the car to the frame and make a custom steering shaft to fit
  if i wanted a fast unreliable fca suv id get a stelvio quadrifoglio
  this     i drive a 95 corolla dx 215000 miles accidentally ran the car while it was extremely low on oil for a month and the fucker didnt even run any differently filled it up and it still works just fine     try that with a euro or americunt shitbarge i dare you
  starting at 80k  lmao
  implying half the cars on the road are even serviced at proper intervals and arent actually owned by oblivious spergs    nice smug photo idiot
    jeep is overpriced as fuck in the uk i would love a proper jeep but i am not paying range rover money for one
implying jeepbuick
  but the 300 is unironically comfy and has available awd
  aerodynamics of a brick covered in shit  typical mommymobile seating position  no thanks ill take a real performance vehicle
      03 focus reporting in damn thing wont die     cel is for an o2 sensor which has already been fixed just didnt take another picture     fuck paying huge monthly payments for a daily driver
  agreed     mfw i find out my friend is paying 230 every two weeks for his ugly ass volvo  plus like 500 a month in insurance   my bike was 2k insurance is a joke its so cheap   also my corolla is fucking cost free and will be for another 100k miles probably 20 years since i never drive the thing    fucking hell
  nice opel
i have some friends up north who are getting their cars and bikes locked up for the snow season could anything particularly bad happen if they brought their bikes into their houses for the winter
drain the gas or run it till it dies youll be ok    its a fire hazard according to the law im sure but its safe
  are you seriously such a beta faggot that youre asking /o/ for permission to put your own belongings inside your own home     holy shit dude get help
  if your house burns down or something your insurance wont cover it because you have a vehicle inside
  well if he doesnt set his house on fire he should be fine
  canada fag here and i was just thinking about bringing my bike into my kitchen  i live in a small condo with no garage and feel bad for my bike sitting outside 
hot hatch is low priority  if you are someone who would actually buy a new one let mazda know    personally i dont see what the problem would be to drop the turbo in the awd version and slap a speed badge on it
  bbut muh mazda is the only company that cares about you       im kinda tired of the mazda fanboys and shills desu the miata is good but the 3 and the 6 is no different that its competitors
  mazda6 will be rwd based in its next iteration
  modern economy sedan  rwd based  i dont believe it
  the 3 and 6 are more aesthetically handsome than all their competitors but you are correct in general sentiment hyundai is picking up where mazda left off at this point as far as fun small cars
market is over saturated   you got the golf focus civic and now gookshit  mazda would just get a tiny slither of that pie  not really worth it on their part   just buy a miata
  you got the golf focus civic and now gookshit  so true which is why it really surprises me that mercedes has the a35 coming out for 50k this really doesnt seem like their market especially given that their car is no better than the golf r
  they could make a new speed miata or destroy toyobaru by developing an affordable sports coupe thats speedy
  why bother hot hatches are rice garbage turbo your own mazda3
  do we know how the new engine will take to forced induction
    but they literally already make all the parts that all fit together they make an awd mazda3 and they said their turbo engine will fit its not a whole new car its a trim p as ckage they could do small volume at a premium      the compression ignition engine comes with a small supercharger already im not sure upping it would be a good idea however that engine actually comes later the new mazda3 will have a number of engine choices which is not having the turbo as one of them makes no sense to me
  discussion about a new model / fanboyism  just like ignore the thread dufus
  awdturbo in a hatch  40000 according to most brands id kinda rather have an awd hatch for half that and turbo it myself
mazda charges almost hot hatch prices for its tarted up mazda 3 gts buddy of mine paid 27k for his car when base model wrxs gti and sts are only a few grand more    unless you shell out for the companys one and only sportscar you arent getting a fast or fun experience the days of multiple sporty fun offerings are dead welcome to the enthusiast nightmare companies like toyota have all the money in the world to develop things like the sfr and new mr2 but just refuse to do so
  nobody would buy them coupes on their own are dying at every brand from expensive luxury coupes to shitty sporty car coupesthey did make the lexus lc but even that is the selling at any volume
    yeah blame women and immigrants but mostly women the number of women in the workforce and thusly driving has increased drastically over the last 40 years outpacing infrastructure and resulting in much more congestion which makes people want taller more isolated vehicles it is all the womans fault
your cunt  what are some brandings/models that completelly failed when translated  some examples from spain  mitsubishi pajero mitsubishi fapper in spanish  mazda laputa  mazda thebitch  kia borrego  kia sheeple/dumbass
  pretty much any asian random letter combination with no real meaning name
  hyundai getz  hyundai sperm in hungarian  thats why its called get here
mitsubishi starrion    mitsubishi are so autistically japanese it produces some good fuck ups
    nissan pathfinder r3mr    just a mid trim diesel suv
  heh aye it either sounds like a lisped stallion or a lisped constellation called star lion
    from what i understand the mitsu exec was telling the american marketer that it was called the stallion but with shingos jap accent surf board ken thought he really meant starrion
  sounds about right
vw jetta brazil  vw vento argentina    jetta is pronounced yeta in argentina which is a common word for bad luck
  lmao    must be hilarious in english class when they teach the 3rd person of get
  sweden  honda fitta  honda cunt    it was named honda jazz instead
  pretty sure they renamed opel ascona in portugal for the same reason lol
vw touareg  named after a nomadic group of africans that are now known for gunrunning drug smuggling and people trafficking
  how is that a fail  also pretty sure everyone thinks of the ancient tuaregs not the modern ones
  i know this isnt a bad translation but its still a fucking stupid name anywhere
  everyone thinks of the ancient cultured africans    not on /o/ they dont
audi etron    étron in french mean turd
  what about the toyota mr2  i heard saying it out loud in french is a play of words
  its with one r starion like star    buick encore  buick again in french most likely referred to the amount of times it spents at the mechanic  buick estate  buick summer in italian you dont think landbarge station wagon when you think summer trust me  chevrolet el camino  chevrolet the chimney in some italian dialects name definitely fits with some models  chevrolet cavalier  chevrolet knight in some latin languages and dialects not what youd name a shitbox like the cavalier  chevrolet beretta  chevrolet sausages or chevrolet 9 millimiters since theres a sausage factory and a gun factory that share the same name  chevrolet viva  chevrolet alive or chevrolet lively which it was anything but  ford escord  literally ford prostitute
maseratti quattroporte  maseratti fourdoor  ferrari laferrari  being this redundant    chevrolet beretta  must be the perfect car for american school students
  yeah mr2 sounds like et merde wich like saying oh shit in english
  the laferrari honestly pisses me off enzo ferrari famously told henry ford ii you can buy a ferrari but not the ferrari which is la ferrari in italian  60 years later and ferrari names one of their cars like that now you can buy the ferrari because who the fuck cares about history and heritage amirite
  ferrari is dead
  buick lacrosse québec french for ripoff or jerking off    merdeux local expression for lucky

  suce mon cock doug
want a new bike preferably a power cruiser or something that can rival a 650 class bike perfomancewise oryknowa 650 class bike
    yamaha v max  ducati daivel  harley vrod    all of those bikes are stupid expensive and only go fast in a straight line
rocket 3  suzuki boss
  ducati monster
indian scout tops out at 125 goes 060 in 37 has good handling and is fun
burger time    650 super comfy heated seat and grips great mileage tons of storage space
im kinda waiting out on hondas new cbr650r when it releases before i decide on a brand new bike
  rocket 3
  xsr 700
yamaha xvs vstar/drag star 650    cheap and reliable also pretty fun to ride
  ducati monster 797
    the 797 monster is the farthest removed from a cruiser from all the 650 bikes in terms of ergonomics even the ninja 650 has a more relaxed riding position
  buy the monster
  perfomancewise  youve got to be more specific melanin infested individual one could argue that 600s are more performance oriented than 1000s because they have a higher cornering speed disregarding the fact that 1000s have much more benefit of late braking and have enough power to overcome that  cornering  lmao most cruisers are groundclearancelet  cornering speed  tyres etc can help  slow speed shit  fairly difficult on a cruiser as they tend to be relatively heavy on the other hand they tend to have heaps of torks and that can help at slower speeds  straight line  the long wheelbase can help in straight line speed if youre not having a harley death wobble that is  a suzuki intruder m1800r could be a nice option although fairly heavy at 320kg dry it does have 125hp and 160 nm  get a rocket 3 with /acoupleofsimplemods/ and youll have 250hp  if youre willing to go forced induction the sky is the limit
  honda magna is superior to those for op its faster than a vrod handles better than a vmax and vrod and is pretty cheap
  straight garbage bikes for posers
  31 of clearance is fine enough for my cornering 
  ive been waiting for a new 600rr but i wouldnt mind getting a 650r if it looks like that
  600s are ded  
  guess im getting a 650r next year

  tfw no bugeye wagon who is driven by qt
    too real
lmao pleb status what should i do to this bad bitch
    dont destroy it
  yeah so far i havent done a single thing to it except took the hideous plateholder off the front i have an extremely low budget but what can i do to make it faster stock this thing actually has a good bit of torque it seems to be geared pretty low so takeoff is fun but thats about it its got the f22 non vtec
ugh i can kinda see why subaru mazda and civic shilling is so prominent here
  the mercedes isnt mine
  please if all of us posted ford gm and chystler or even volvo bmw and volkswagen you would have said the same thing you dip
  is that the legendary 3k civic
  shut up faggot
  issa 300 civic

monday to friday  saturday and sunday
  dont make me get the bread
this is my shitbox
          i love the older subarus id buy one if i didnt have so much money sunk into my daily/project    heres my shitbox
its okay    closest thing to a straight upgrade would be an s13 but theyve all been thrashed
it is truly scum the trunk lock broke and it wont let me in
  theres a tab that locks the trunk release in the car out if your key works fine then that tab got tripped feel around on the latch mechanism for it
since there is snow here already it sits in garage mainly i drive my winter beater for now
  key was working and now its not from what ive read its the valet lock the tab youre talking about that can slip down far enough to stop the key from opening it that or its straight broke from shutting to hard struts need gas or replacement
  heres the mentioned shitbox
slow as shit but its my bb

  you cant knock peoples automotive choices when you drive a dyke car
  strong words coming from an impreza
  now for 2700 worth of mods
  im a dude but whatevs    dont care still awd
  precisely why i said you ought to rethink what youre saying here    youre a dude who bought a cuckmobile    i bet you have black rimmed glasses and a onions beard too lol
  yeah but the lamest awd car out there    his car isnt rwd 95 of the time  lmao
  basedboy beard but onions are just as repulsive as your impreza
  lmao why cant you type     s o y  o  y
  so far im in  300 purchase price   335 registration owed back fees fucking california  97 speed sensor  95 smog failed once for timing  20 stereo  90 speakers  100 general maintenance and small repairs  have some more things to fix but still solid shitbox for the price i suppose i do wish it were manual tho
  precisely why i said you ought to rethink what youre saying here  rethink what that i bought the cheapest possible new awd vehicle on the market with lots of cargo room no driving nannies or other electronic shit to worry about breaking 5 years down the line because i buy based on features    youre a dude who bought a cuckmobile  i bet you have black rimmed glasses and a onions beard too lol  please do tell me how your wifes mocha colored son is doing because youre clearly describing yourself
  still got me through the last winter storm
  no sir i have a w220 with no pipes its loud and agressive and fun plenty of trunk space and interior room    doublekek at the mocha colored son joke lol thats literally the group you put yourself in when you bought that tampon of an automobile
  he needs an awd car to drive in snow
  well the leave the cuck shit out of it then i dont need a v8 straight piped car as a substitute for manliness
  i dont know what kind of car enthusiast could go through with buying an impreza and maintain enough of a straight face to post about it on /o/ of all places that is a rental car for the snowbelt the only time an impreza will turn heads is when pedestrians hear the cry for mercy as the vapid wheezing 4cylinder tries to push its one and only horsepower through the cvt
  neither do i i also own a little soft roader tribute and a nice last gen stratus r/t coupe    you done goofed buying that subie
  ouch fukkin rekt
  not living in america  making me confused as to why theres no footprints near the driver door
  who says i need to own a car enthusiast car to be an enthusiast i still have a life outside of gushing over supras evos porsches you know and its practical enough for me and thats what matters /o/tists will be /o/tists i guess
feels bad not driving a fun car anymore but i love this truck
  youre the one that came in here swinging dick about your superior awd impreza lmao dont get your panties in a bunch
  i just dont like fwd rwd and awd are fine in my book
  cool story bro next time dont expect to go far by bragging about some shitty base impreza
  who gives a fuck about your book though    you were expecting a bunch of subaru fags to pat you on the back for your base model dykemobile    well see you in three months with a set of 18 inch wheels on it asking about exhausts
  there is a car scene surprising amount of jdm car fans here aswell but its mostly euro sports cars and bmw and mercs  its pretty cheap to get a respray here ill get it in my local skoda service when i go and do the regular service aswell replace the headlight
v6 mustangs get all the big fat american women on my big fat american penis
  based
beep beep imma jeep
  so pretty
    you were expecting a bunch of subaru fags to pat you on the back for your base model dykemobile    i want nothing from wrx people since they hate me for driving this thing to the point of cutting dangerously close to me on the highway happened 3 time already i am a little biased though since this is the first car i bought that wasnt a rustbucket from the 90s and giving it more credit than it deserves itll die down
  thank you i really like it it just needs some nice 18 or 19 wheels plan on getting a set after the winter these 16s look like ass
  would look great with the wheels bmw made optional on the lci e90 328s 18 i think lots of spokes looks really cool glad youre enjoying it 
also just bought a cl500
  is it either of these styles ive seen the m sport wheels i think they look pretty decent i think ill go for something oem or with an oem look something thats obviously nice looking but nothing too flashy and thanks its a fun little car
  fucking checked nice digits  i also love the look of the m3 competition wheels
  i saw that in another thread fucking nice car congrats on the purchase
    hey sup
henlo
  tfw want an m3 but too spooked of engine problems
    i like this
      lmao i love it
  i didnt know my dad posted to 4chan
  i dont know what the failure rate was but it was like sub 1 low if youre that spooked a set of aftermarket bearings is 600 burger coupons and maybe another couple grand for a shop to install them if you dont want to hardly a big deal in the long run if you keep the car     im at 60k now and havent had an issue in my 20k miles of ownership if i supercharge it ill throw in new bearings but until then im not stressin

my entirly street legal whip
  such an ugly car
  headlights signals and tail lights
  entirely street legal
  whooshd me do you really ride it on the street how hard would it be to get a kit or something to make it legit street legal
  just playing around i ride a mile or so on the road to get to the desert more bikes and side by sides are seen on those roads then cars
  ahh gotcha here in florida there is next to no where to ride motocross bikes bums me out cause i used to love riding when i was younger closest place is busy as shit and 50 a day per person or theres a track thats 15 a person per day  100 pass per year per person dumb as shit
  sucks to hear about that nobody really cares to much about anyhting here in nevada plus most of it is blm land where anyone does anything
  thats kickass i wish i lived over there i love watching the buggies and trucks go through the desert / dunes kind of want to make one just for the hell of it and maybe jump some train tracks lol
  theres plenty of dumb shit to jump/crash into here i would know so if you ever get the chance check it out
  its a fun basher hopefully upgrading to a supra rz or r32/r33 gtr this summer depending on model year
  will do man all i got to crash into here in fl is grandmas and gators

shes a good boat
  replies to a wagon  calls it a sedan  are coupefags usually this braindamaged
  its the xlt trim so its got the 40 v6 but its a stock 2001
can they compete
  they havent sold out yet
  disgusting
  the 812 looks like a slightly wrong and fatter viper
  depends especially since ferrari is not concerned with selling cars but selling the brand  but im pretty sure everytime they make a new car or update one theres always going to be a rich guy wholl buy it
consider this ferraris arent faster they arent more reliable and they dont have better interiors than their competition  other sports cars in the same price bracket dunk hard on them in every way except the one thing ferrari does have looks and the brand  name something gayer than paying for looks and brand
protip you cant
four doors  high beltline  not electric
mazda is ugly
  literally the only japanese brand that isnt outright repulsive visually ie toyota honda etc ugly
  what in fuck is that c pillar
  torsion beam
  its actually really grown on me i like it
  i test drove one of those it drove wonderfully but i couldnt see shit so i didnt buy it
if you feel like contemplating suicide go onto balognik and read the paid article about it and the comments
  no you didnt
everyone is saying the sedan looks good and the hatchback looks like shit this was also my first reaction however after really looking them over and sleeping on it heres what i think  1 the sedan is actually really mundane and will not stand the test of time in terms of its styling its boring  2 the hatchback is different it has to rest on the pallet for a minute and then you start to appreciate it more i think its going to do very well and be considered great looking for years to come
  thats a toyota
  hopefully for the face lift theyll make the c pillar smaller and the rear window bigger  maybe shove the 25t in the engine bay and pair it with the manual
it fucking looks like a shitting dog
  ugly  slow  not german  2/10 would not buy
    the big c pillar would have looked better if they stretched the black spoiler over it  it would have been nearly perfect then  so thats a super easy fix they could fix in a facelift    the way the rear tapers in looks more like a computer designed it than a person im sure its aerodynamic but it looks terrible at certain angles
  giant fucking c pillar  i cant see shit out of this thing
mazda is the most redpilled japanese brand
  nice minivan bro
does this mean even less rear legroom than before ffs just make it a 2 door and call it a brerra or what ever the fuck alfa it is trying to copy
  those windows
  has the visibility of a panel van
  new corolla looks better
  so much this    the corolla styling seems more fun to me and is probably better than the 3
  side impact standards  less glass theres no way around it
it looks like an ugly as fuck version of a 10 year old alfa kodo design is fucking shit      i dont think theyd make it smaller than it already is this one has a longer wheelbase so nonmidgets may be able to fit      hilarious how mazda went torsion beam when you can get a hyundai hatch with multilink now
  theyll regret it   i bet after 2 or three years theyll change it to multilink or something
mazda feel alive
  they said themselves that it was a design choice high chance its just sheet metal where a window should be
  not german  thats a pro
  not gonna happen you want multi link you pay extra for the awd model
  its not an rx9
torsion beam    mazda claims the torsion beam will reduce wind noise and ride smoother over a broader range of surfaces ive no doubt the majority of customers would prefer this if true the real question is will matter driving down a twisty country road or will it make no difference at all
  the real question is will matter driving down a twisty country road or will it make no difference at all  good point il definitely be test driving 2019 mazda 3 when they hit dealers so that i can compare it to my 2018 mazda 3 that has rear multilink hopefully they didnt completely ruin the driving experience with the torsion beam
ill stick with my 15 hatch
  marketing team is denying the truth and engineering principles    wew lad a torsion beam is now more comfortable and capable of two indipendent wheels with multilink suspension
  incorrectly named  is pretty much a tiny cuv  needlessly huge c pillar  unnecessary sloping belt line  tiny rear passenger window and door  small boot and lack of leg room  fuckery with the stills to try and hide the cars bulk  bulky and disproportionate bonnet  unresolved and out of place rear styling    yea but the way the are headed their goose is cooked
  theyre claim is tunable to handle broader range of surfaces do you care to articulate a counter point
  you are a manlet though so your opinion is meaningless
  mah dick
  nice cuv there faggot
  super thicc
  sedan is superior
  its marketing    two independent wheels are better than two wheels fixed to a rear beam which lets you feel every pothole and irregularity even if one wheel passes over them
  2 doors are for fags
  its obviously not going to be that bad
  im inclined to agree but what im saying is can you provide an engineering level explanation to your argument the sprung weight isnt changing but the unsprung weight is going up right do you have any evidence there is no advantage to ride from this and lets not forget half their argument is wind noise reduction ive owned torsion beam cars that werent bad and id like to see actual reviews of this one before condemning it
  its a prison and so is that mazda 3
  not electric  oh fuck off
  only if youre a fucking weeaboo fag desu senpai
found it
  you guys keep saying this but sometimes i like to fold the seats down and have stuff back there that i dont want everyone to be able to readily see this is a plus to me what are you worried about the children having a good view
  pretty decent design but its fucking huge
  i wanna see an awd mazda 2 with 25l skyactivx
  see    its almost as bad as the camaro in terms of blind spot nonvisibility i wouldnt be surprised of blind spot cameras and monitoring systems become mandated in a few years
  awd models will be offer world wide  finally the mazda 2/3/6 equivalents in japan already have stickshift awd and diesel options north america only gets automatic gas and fwd options
  north america gets manual option always has from mazda
  skyactivx    thats the thing i am looking forward the most if it turns out to be decent and actually manages to save fuel it proves that the combustion engine is not at its end and electric cars are nothing more than a political driven meme
  sorry i shouldve clarified on that point  canada lost the manual option for the mazda 6 this year im not sure if its still offered in the us either the mazda 3 and mazda 2 sedan rebadged as the toyota yaris sedan but weirdly they have their own toyotadeveloped yaris hatchback instead of rebadging the mazda 2 hatch still have manual transmissions still no diesel or awd unfortunately
  youre right why would the person driving the car ever want to see out of the car
what other cars in its class currently employ torsion beam does civic corolla etc have it
  well not same class but the fiesta st has torsion beam
  also renault megan and citroen c4 still uses them vw used them up to the golf 4
torsion beam  fuck normies
  multi link is still available as an option with awd
  veloster uses it
  personally i like it but you asked to find a flaw so rearward visibility is next to zero
  a fucking brera
suv
  small wheel wells  looks like you are watching a 1080 video on a 1440 screen  looks like a crossover but they are calling it a hatchback  2900 lbs on a ff vehicle  c pillar  designed for the family man again
   lbs on a ff vehicle  what are minivans  what is cadillac in the 80s and 90s  what is the oldsmobile toronado  literally irrelevant
  aint care literally the only company offering manual with awd and a proper inline 4    seriously considering to get one as a daily
    everything looks like a bug now like corrupters off command and conquer or something
    you can see out the back in terms of who is coming up on your ass just fine and back up cameras are already mandated  mazda has had blind spot monitoring for years and if you know how to use your mirrors properly you dont have to turn your head around backwards to check which is dangerous anyway  drivers field of view is unaffected by cpillar  fuck backseat visibility anyway doesnt matter and the cloistered rear only makes it harder for thiefs to see into the rear    you bunch have a lot of unjustified armchair rage
  fat _______  this  is   the flaw
i only buy my gas off the native reserve its sooo much cheaper and it doesnt even hurt your car
put a paper coffee filter in your pour spout this will filter out the crap making every fill with gas pure
  is it gonna filter out the watered down gas that the bushman put in there
i live where theres tons of native reserves if a white person stops at one they will not serve you and they tell you to get the fuck out actually ive been to one where they actually served us but it was fucking disgusting  avoid nates like the plague i know better than anyone
  what country
  canada
  did you pay tax
  which province i thought whites werent allowed to just cruise through reserves
  ontario near grand bend
  hmm im in lethbridge the blood reserve is really close but ive never been through it though they have a big no trespassing sign on the roads in so ive just avoided it
  some highways run through reshurves and injun towns that you can technically stop at usually its no whites on their rez and they have their own police to enforce it i hear its a nasty fine if you get caught or worse if the prarienigs find you first
buddy buys native smokes hes always sick
  just like being a cowboy in the old wild west   on a serious note this thread prompted me to do some reading on the reserves shit seems fucked 80 unemployment on some of them all living in nasty trailers or shacks pretty much like a 3rd world country
  probably closer to 98 unemployment for those who dont work at the casinos the government pays them well enough that they dont really need to work their houses are nice when the government gives it to them for free but they trash the fuck out of them
  sure if you want your fucking gas cut with rusty water and sand    i once bought premium from a no name gas station whose card reader handled the trasaction as an account transfer rather than a cc purchase anyway ended up with a worse milage than regular gas from the chain stations and a nasty fuel filter
going to japan next year anyone got a good source on ways to find drift events/car meetups i have tried to find shit but its all in moon runes

is buying a car right after getting a promotion immature im finally working for a good company and im getting a relatively substantial promotion and was already thinking about getting a new car but at the same time i dont want to communicate immaturity to upper management small company im planning to trade in my 2015 ex civic coupe for a 2018 lt v6 camaro im in socal so a v8 is not justified by any means
get the turbo 4 banger
  nobody gives a damn and if they do fuck em its about what you like
only if you dont already own a home
  whats the real difference in terms of performance and gas mileage
  i am renting but definitely cannot afford a house in my area oneday though
  seems like a waste to get a car only three years newer  probably should have kept your old car longer but if you can afford it why not      this right here  if you dont have a home you cant afford it
buy a weekend car anything but an american turd like the one in your pic and keep driving your civic to work
why even get a muscle car if youre not going to get a v8
  but you can afford to keep buying depreciating assists     good goy
  my car payments will be about the same and the dealer will let me break even on my trade in i understand the overall debt is higher but i will actually be really happy with my car i want something a little different than what i have been driving eco 4 bangers and these cars make a general commute more enjoyable
keep in mind if youre a it worker theres thousands of people willing and waiting to do your job for less
  commiefornian cuck  is too stupid to see the merits of a v8    pottery
   you  but you can afford to keep buying depreciating assists     good goy  im going to need to add another 50k to my salary to get a mortgage within 30 miles of my job im renting roughly 10 miles away thats relatively affordable
   you op   cuck   too stupid to see the merits of a v8    pottery  v8s are awesome but because of my general commute and the surrounding counties i wouldnt be able to open it up and the gas mileage is not ideal at that point to justify for me at least
  2015 ex civic coupe  thats damn near still new just keep it for now
  lmao 50k more in your salary to get a house assuming you are currently spending all your money and 50k all on taxed at 25 based on monthly payment would be a 650000 dollar mortgage what 30 mile radius has only half million dollar houses and above
      how are you making such a mess with these fucking replies
desu im getting something nice to have along side my 1k cavalier once i get promoted dont see a problem with it
  if your car affects peoples first impression of you its not timing but type that will make the impact camaro says one thing a sedan says another   also cheapass vs quality brand   i think its fine to put an impression in peoples minds their resulting behavior will be impacted from what ive seen
dont trade in your daily commuter    grow up and save for that weekend car
  are you serious california is crazy
  im in socal so a v8 is not justified by any means  just admit your a poorfag or a bitch
  youre financially retarded its one thing to go from a 3k beater to a newer car but your situation lol management will love it knowing youre a slave to them to read the book rich dad poor dad enjoy the rat race
  go into debt for no reason  go into debt for a camero  go into debt for a v6 camero  anon if youre going to make a bad decision go all in on it dont trade in your daily driver whatever you do i traded in my 97 tdi passat years ago for a fun car and i regret it to this day that fucking passat got amazing mileage and i ended up selling the other car a few years later anyway
  flyover detected
  youre financially retarded its one thing to go from a 3k beater to a newer car but your situation lol management will love it knowing youre a slave to them to read the book rich dad poor dad enjoy the rat race    we you give me more detail on why its a bad idea what if im able to pay off the balance of the car in 2 years im not sure how that would make me a slave to my company theres an extremely robust job market in my area that can change and im planning to own my llc while working my current company and that will net me more cash i understand its not a necessity but its a toy and something will always remind me of my progress my current car feels like a girlfriend i settled for its hard to explain
  keep current car  buy motorbike  relatively cheap the highest end supersports go for about 2030k new thats supercar level performance  commute becomes 1000x more fun  new thing to do on the weekend  car for going shopping  its a win win
  is buying a car right after getting a promotion immature    i think you should stick with your current car until you verify to yourself that you are handling the added responsibilities furthermore the promotion may come with bigger problems to cure when you are stable at work then you can risk having more debt    remember that there is gm buy power to give additional discounts on a camaro use that to build up your power delaying your purchase lets you build up your power    its more like patience will let you have the next gen advanced systems in the car we at the cusp of a few more significant changes and make sure any care you get has port injection and isnt purely direct injection
  just give want you want seriously   your personal vehicle is one of the only places you are allowed to have done personality just dont look like a douche by which i mean a ricer or brodozer
  this is the only post in this thread you should listen to op wait a few months or even a year or two it can only help you
  this gen v6 camaro makes more hp than the previous gens v8 its a fast fucking car no matter how you look at it
  ok but theres still no reason to ever choose the smaller less reliable engine in a car that fat
  no it is a chadmove dont be a beta cuck
  nope this gen v6 makes 335 hp last gen v8 makes 426 and 420 torque youre thinking of a 4th gen i know because i drive a last gen v8 a 2010 ss the new gen ss cars are faster than me but i still dust all current gen v6s ive raced
  ive not heard anything about that engine being less reliable the v6 gets such realistic shit gas mileage the v8 is probably just impractical for the dudes daily driver i can understand not buying the 4 banger turbo in a camaro but the v6 is a decent option
  i searched and said it made 400 hp so yeah youre right it is a little more
    might as well get a v6 camry
post your w126 or older mercedes this is my recently acquired 85 mb 280se boy i love these cars but this is just the start to my ownership so any owners or enthusiasts please give some advice not just for me but anyone thinking of buying one of these what to look for what to avoid and oh god if anyone has wiring diagrams or service manuals please share
  crashed my 1984 300d i bought at 16 and drove for 4 years 2 months ago favorite car out of 10 2 of which were wrxs
  posting my 1982 sl 380
 oh man so it was a write off id really love to own a 300d but everythings scarce in nz
      if you buy one be ready for  old rotten vacuum lines  mechanical fuel injection     what to look for  one thats already been converted to a double timing chain  rust right in front of the rear wheel wheels near the bottom
        only hate myself a little so far
  beautiful car i havent been in one since i was 17 had a girlfriend whose mom owned one and we went for a drive never got behind the wheel but holy shit i was impressed by that car at the time
  well i put 15k miles on it bought it for 2200 and put about 1000 in parts into it so if thats a right off then ya sold it for 700 to the same guy i bought my first one from ive owened 5 diesel mercs
  the 380/560 sl along with the 560 sec are my favorite mercs from that era
  doing a rear main seal is a piece of cake with these
  this guy knows     i bought this last year and year little issues but otherwise fucking gorgeous and built like a panzer
my 1980 300d nonturbo comfy af but also really slow i rather enjoy driving it
petrol powered  cringe and devoid of point
my w124 is a 93    damn nice looking cars though anons
i previously had a w124 300d and 190e 26 the diesel was very reliable while the petrol engine had all kinds of vacuum leaks ecu and ignition problems    ive been thinking about buying a 300e 280300se or another 190e 26 then converting it to efi with wasted spark ignition and running it on e85
fellow kings     my 85 300d turbo
  very clean    but lets get a better look at you anon
  my cover is blown
  no my cover is blown
  ah screw it
diesel gang  i  e  s  e  l    g  a  n  g  mine is a 300d turbo
porsche 996 tier  stop ruining the best car in the world porsche
whats supposed to be your point every single porsche looks exactly the same
  except the ass gets fatter
implying the 991 was good
    the 992 just looks more streamlined version of the 991
  quite pugent sweetie
  disliking the 996    elender bauer
the 996 was the best looking porsche dick lovers refuse to admit this
  it has muffin top now
  someone shoop the headlights and make them round thus achieving the best looking 991 ever
    headlight cover mod intensifies
    honestly the egg headlights look great on the wide body 996s with thick turbo style bumpers
  this man speaks the truth the 997 gts is the best looking porsche ever made
i kinda dig the new looks although the differences are neglectable but 55 kilos more than the previous generation in a few generations porsches will weight more than landbarges
fake  exhaust  tips    
the side profile looks better the windshield to taillight line is much sleeker its a shame its not all the way down to the rear bumper but given regulations i think its the best they can do
  muffin  it is bigger now
  thanks to lexus isf for being a pioneer of fake exhaust
is there any streetlegal car that can hold a candle to the gt2 rs
  who the fuck uses candles lol
  3k civic with a few simple mods
  who tf stil using candles hahahaha like nigga just turn on the lights hahahahaha
a tesla suv would smoke that boomer car lmao
  an atom v8
gt1
my car
or this fiat 500 i test drove the other day had 34 hp
a messerschmitt with an ls swap
  34hp  damn how many pounds of boost was that thing running
  aventador svj        bunch of hypercars
  why couldnt they have just painted the whole car
post yfw the gtr will eventually be replaced by the a fucking leaf
  pepper your angus my frann cuz its coming
  
  im excited for the future of performance cars and the future is all electric baby anyone who doesnt like electric cars is just a poser who treats cars as fashion accessories
  electric performance cars are cool and seeing more companies roll them out over the next 5 years will be exciting most of the electric hate here is just tesla hate because of the insufferable fanbase imo
  anyone who doesnt like electric cars is just a poser who treats cars as fashion accessories  but electric cars are literally in fashion  i dont like electric cars for the same reason i dont like automatic transmissions shifting gears is a huge part of driving and an ice sound feel smell and power band is another huge part of driving im not concerned with performance on paper im concerned with driving experience
  really hope therell be a leaf gt in super gt 300
  lol no i just hate souless go karts
hey /o/ i need some help from americans  my grandmother her knees are damaged and she needs one of those fatmobile scooters  can i get some pointers on what to look at when i choose a model she will receive money from the state so i guess we dont have to cheapout    thanks guys
tbh senpai theyre pretty much all the same
  im sure a good turning radius is a big selling point on these things    idk fuck man battery life tire size and replacement tire cost a basket on the front so she can put her yappy little dog and bottles of pills in it
  are these rwd they look like they would be fun to throw around some corners
  turning radius and battery life makes a lot of sense thanks man
  theres a dude that lives by me that drives this thing around in traffic like its a motorcycle
  a guy i know in my town has one and he drives it drunk everywhere he lived in my buddys apartment and one day he flipped it and shit his pants in the lobby and we had to drag him out of the way of the door
  the fastest they go is a slow walking pace
get a 3 wheeled one everyone thinks that 4 wheels are better but youll have much less room for your feet
  dont forget weight those things can be heavy as fuck depending on battery and weight capacity
need help and feed back rough idle    heres a mistery for yall to solve     2011 smart fortwo  rough idle it started idling rough a while back and after turning it off then back on it would run normal     i made a trip out of town twice and the only thing it did was some transmission reteach other than that nothing out of the usual    car has 112k miles on it    so this halloween i was in some parking garage with some chick she backed up into a pole but the car was okay mechanically and cosmetically i drove home after some drinks and went to started up in the morning for work and there was the rough idle i just simply though i would do a power cycle and it would fix the problem     the car ran and drove fine until i made it home     i had suspect that it was the ignition coils since a year prior so i swapped them 3 from a salvage at a junk yard the car was newer    i swapped out the map sensor nothing    i checked the spark plugs nothing    check for vacuum leaks nothing     check injectors theyre fine     i did pull the cable to cylinder 3 and it rough idles the same however it runs horrible when i pull out any other ignition coil cylinder 2 is the culprit     i checked for compression its all normal i took off the oil cap to feel any leaks from the cylinder or wtvr its okay and cant feel any pressure or air coming out pulled the oil dipstick no smoke     ive replaced the map sensor nothing    the car starts fine and accelerates when you first start it but the goes back to that rough idle and hesitation does it quicker if i let it idle as opposed to putting it in d and taking off like mad     im about to remove the muffler manifold or the o2 sensor to see if the catalytic converter is clogged but would that cause a misfire in that particular cylinder     what about egr valve wouldnt that cause it to run rough right after starting    oh yeah ive scanned for codes inb4 oh thats the problem you bought a smart car
  honestly at this poibt just get a new car not even memeing
yo op check the idle air control valve its some pcv part or its probably a clogged fuel filter and youre getting predetonation causing the rough idle on startup  i had the same problem on my acura all i do is just turn the key to engine on 2 so the gas goes past the fuel filter and then i turn it on after 1015 seconds  mine when it was turned off warm and started again it would just misfire until it died unless you gave it gas so in the end it was the fuel filter i had replaced the idlecontrol valve but it didnt do shit
i checked the pcv valve its clean actually no idle air control valve just the throttle body and map sensor as far as intake goes i have not changed the fuel filter is that really a thing that could cause it to rough idle seconds after start up
  i did pull the cable to cylinder 3 and it rough idles the same  this would indicate that cylinder 3 is misfiring or otherwise not working nice
had an issue similar in my old xb the car needed to relearn to idle after i changed the head gasket and alternator i just started the car ant touched nothing for 1015 minutes and after the idle was fine try this and if it doesnt work your only out 15 minutes
  disconnect the battery for like 5 minutes before you do this causes a soft reset of all the adaptive trims
the face of american power
actually looks better than the current silverado
  symmetry is to far off on that grill line no way this sees final design approval it looks as retarded as mid to late 2000s rams
  disagree
  jesus christ what the fuck is that
gm stackables
range rover
crack  sip  ahh now sorry man but thats going to be a b i g y i k e s from me
another /o/ edit becomes reality
  the big grill and square headlights reminds me of this with the chevrolet bar being the flat front part of the hood the turn signals being on the top as opposed to underneath the headlights and the mini grill are just retro redesign elements
  official gm media bro
  whyd they duck up and have the indicators up top looks like shit but wasnt there an early 60s truck that had them like that looks bad on a square bodied design like this though
  rip
and this here is our sons room  hes quite a car enthusiast
i like chevy
  id run that shit
  not a single car part in sight  /o/  pick one
   a single car part in sight    sounds like /o/ to me
  is that the fucking ogre cave
pretty new to kit cars and i wanna know more most kit cars i see are replicas of super cars but are there any other ones that are pretty interesting how would i go about purchasing one of these lego vehicles for myself
ill pay that bit extra that they put my car together thanks
locost 7 seems cool
  meet your new car waifu original body design tube chassis mid engine rear drive subaru powered under 2000lbs
  buy an ultima kit or an ultima car      my favorite looks wise was jon olssons he had 3 different looks with it and i think he put the gallardos v10 in his
there was one for sale less than 15km away for 12500  only 30 are made
what are some kit cars that let you essentially build your own version of a classic sports car i know about the lancia stratos kit car what else is there
2x literbike engines  awd  550kg  back when literbikes made only 150hp    an updated version with 400hp would be insane
    only 30 are made  that was 30 too many what an eyesore
  putting some racing livery on it made it go from fugly kitcar to road legal lmp looks great
  mid engined ls powered supercar for 30k  completely unburdened by us or any safety regulations  factory five gtm
  ywn daily a kitcar
  i just wanna drive that frame around no need for the body
whats the most accurate corvette c1 5861 kit
  and lets not forget  miata door handles
  iirc it uses a miata chassis as well
  am i doin it right
  but are there any other ones that are pretty interesting  depends on what youre looking for kit car builds usually fall into 3 subgroups historical replicas dedicated track vehicles and otherwise original designs       how would i go about purchasing one of these lego vehicles for myself  again it depends on how you want to go about it some kits utilize a unique chassis/frame structure while others use a donor car like a fiero camaro or 911     i suggest doing some research into the kind of kit you want to build then contacting manufacturers to see what they have available and study how the customers have come along with their builds of that car
  just get an aerial atom
  so basically what we wanted the brz to be
  this factory five or factory nothing
  no youre thinking of the exocet using miata engine and suspension bits the 818s frame is tube and it uses impreza lower control arms
  street legality will depend on where you live but theres plenty of 400kg kit cars with street bike engines from tracking silvercar etc        
  the 818 is a pretty nondailyable 2seat death trap opposite of the brz it does have a front crash structure but thats not saying much
  based dad poster
wombat aka humbug miniature hummer/jeep lookalike kit for a beetle
  why is factory 5 so fucking good
  looks like a plastic kids car made to resemble a rolls royce or some shit
tfw no lil big rig
wish i had the free time to build one
  i really want one of these but i know im going to crash it and die
id like to do an ls9 slc superlite some day supposed to be very user friendly
  i want one of these but make the body look like the ford rs200 use a trashed focus rs as a donor engine/drivetrain but backwards and call it the rs230
  how much does it cost to get you to find your own thread
at first i thought i wanted a miat but now i think i want an exocet that looks hilarious to drive
  that frame looks like it could barely support the driver
  where the fuck is that exhaust going
  i want some madman to put a w8 mated to a porsche 6speed in it
  racecarreplicas a subsidiary of slc who make  which is a legit kit car that can and has been configured from street to gt3 make some really cool kits like ford gt40 and porsche 917 among many others
  one bathtub please
  the japanese one based on a nd the mitsuoka rockstar 1
  but thats not a c1
  thats probably the point
is it kino
  its basically a gen 2 lumina with a nicer interior take from that what you will
  yeah if your 70 years old
  based and mauspilled    not based
hey /o/  i have a 199x unsure of exact model year possibly 1996 honda accord at my disposal to my knowledge it was last driven regularly in 2013 has been driven once or twice since then to see if it still worked it runs and maybe needs a brake job i have very little mechanical knowledge so i am probably wrong on that but the last time i drove it it was ok    what is the best thing i can do with this car ive been thinking of either using it as a winter beater or fixing it up with a friend and selling it dont have any other info vin odo reading  of owners but i will go to check it out tomorrow
bump
    not a bad car to daily if you want to sell it especially in ontario you could probably get 2500 for it from a brown guy or asian    10th vin digit is the year u is 1996 v is 1997 w is 1998 etc
  i already have a daily 2011 fusion so i dont really need a daily also imo the green doesnt look too good    2500 in my pocket sounds great though the car is parked at my uncles so i will get the vin tomorrow and do a vin check
  sell the fusion and daily the accord save money buy a fun car for yourself
  i like the fusion more than this car and cant afford a for fun car as much as i would love to have one
  well sell whichever one will make you more money i think everyone needs a fun car in their life
what is the best thing i can do with this car  change the air filter fuel filter oil transmission fluid and spray it with fluid film
wtf when did they change the tail lights to look like a civics
  sell fusion  do couple simple mods to accord with cash
anyone else like 90s american sedans   it seems they hit a sweet spot in terms of design but sadly they quickly resumed making ugly cars
  nope most of them suffered melted jellybean worse than jap sedans
nah they were generally the ugliest cars of the entire decade
  they looked like melted soap and having two more doors didnt help matters atleast their coupè variants if they had one made the problem less evident
  nah they were generally the ugliest cars of the entire decade    this    80s90s mustangs    fucking ugly
  thinking the foxbody mustang was ugly  and dont say you meant the sn95 because that wasnt produced until 1994 not in the 1980s
itt seething europoors and nipshitters
  foxbodies are the ugliest mustangs of all but sn95 is olev
  you
  people unironically like how foxbodies look  lmao only mustang that rivals it in ugly is the 7173 landbarge
  the foxbody is the first mustang to look good after the mach i we had to wait for the s197 to have another goodlooking mustang and now were back to having one that looks like its melting
  rent free
  lolwut  even mustang ii was better than the abortion of 7173 foxbody was the absolute low point sn95 at least looked like a mustang and had nice 90s style s197 looked like shit until the facelift s550 was good until the downs syndrome update
  other than the chevy ss no fucking awful decade
  the chrysler new yorker and the 300m looked good but most looked shit like the melted soap ford taurus
  imagine having taste this awful
  thats pretty much how i feel about anyone who likes the 7173 and foxbody
    the mustang ii looked way better than the foxbody they may have been gutless bastards from the factory but i dry heave every time i see a foxbody mustang    it is by far my least favorite stang
just here to tell these fags that the 7173 fastback is far and away the best looking mustang followed by prenew edge sn95 and then four eyed fox  inb4 some boomerlite retard conflates the performance of the 7173 with its looks for some reason
  cringe and bluepilled
  ah yeah that mustang that everyone hated the pigfat pile of shit the 7173 its terrible to look at and drive
      t tasteless brainlets    now this guy gets it mach i with an s197 drive train would be peak kino
  lol im a snowflake you are all idiots look at me
  who cares that everyone hated it everyone hated it in the 70s because it was slow compared to the god machine that the previous years were performance wise thats the 70s for you like i anticipated some retard conflates the cars totallyirrelevantin2018 stock performance with its looks for some reason  it looks mean as fuck and like a space ship and i absolutely dont understand whats not to love about its looks sure its pretty massive for a mustang but it just looks good
  yes actually i had a 90s buick century that ticked a lot of boxes for me comfy decent fuel economy acceptable torque and an incredibly simple engine design   gm build quality was just too awful though and fords aesthetic design was so godawful
  only the biggest of barges b bodies and panthers
  muh perforamnce  nigga the 7173 was the worst selling mustang because it was an ugly pigfat pile of shit no one liked youre a salty retard who thinks his car no one likes is a godsend because you like it it looks like shit
  there are some okay ones neon srt chevy alero cadukkac deville perhaps even the dodge interprid but not the concorde
  sells well  good car sells poorly  bad car
    neon srt4 didnt come out until 2004 sorry

  note to self increase ford general area in collage for next version
how is the 2018 poostang gt with the performance pack but no magneride all the reviews seem to be for magneride adding magneride or active exhaust forces you to upgrade to a better interior and id rather save 5k
someone else join the zeemaps i feel alone
  is president ford welcomed here or should this be renamed ford automobile general
  kek    also bump i will be posting my car for the collage tomorrow
bump
  why not just test drive one at a dealership
waitdo i belong hereor the classic car gen
    i have a 1994 sn95 gt manual it currently rides like a dump truck and i was hoping to fix that what options do i have when it comes to the suspension are there any ford models where performance suspension can swap over to my mustang do shocks springs and bushings from the equivalent cobra model swap over sans the irs if that is even applicable to 50 sn95s     i just got the car and my first big goal in my build is to refresh the suspension after that im changing the rear end ratio and lastly i will improve engine performance     id post a picture but it has bad paint and is sitting on these stupid looking 20 inch wheels with surprisingly good rubber on them
  how about both
  aftermarket is the way to go
about to go check on my rear right brake  its a drum so wish me luck
    i was hoping that wasnt the case i can get a lot of parts for cheaper than usual if theyre carried by brick and mortar parts stores but no problem any recommendations i just dont want the car to handle like garbage anymore bolt in subframe connectors are coming asap
  just 4 u bby
  ill join once i officially own a ford
is 20102012 ford fusion with awd a good car
real ford nigga hours    who up
get side swiped by a  5 goblina in her lexus 350  what the fuck  polish it with some meguiars  95 of it comes out theres not even any dents  fuck yea ford  my mt82 transmission is still a piece of shit
  what ford are you about to get
  ty
the glove box in my foxbody is stuck shut how can i get it open i tried unscrewing the two screws on the bottom but its still stuck at the latch is there an option that doesnt include breaking anything
  h a m m e r t i m e   a  m  m  e  r    t  i  m  e
  angle grinder and a new glove box
drum brakes are cool  change my mind /fg/
  foxbody is stuck shut  what year 7886 gloveboxs have the two angled pins if you can slide stiff cardstock or pins into either side of the latch you can get it open also make sure the box is unlocked sometimes if it has been lockedand not in a long time and unlocked you need to work the lock to lock/unlock a few times to get it to catch the pins
  make sure its awd if its not then its most likely a rental
  its an 89 and as far as i know it cant be locked because the lock cylinder completely fell out
    theyre unironically the correct choice for rear brakes on a fwd car theyre lighter and simpler    fwd cars are usually 6040 weight biased front to rear under braking thats more like 8515 rear brakes just do not have much to do on fwd and disc brakes back there are a literal marketing move
realize ive been doing the 12 shift all fucky  too much force to the lift side of the gearbox when i should just be going down  but putting force towards the left used to work fine  not going to question it
tfw only /o/ sticker is the ariz/o/na sticker on the car  might not make it into the collage    
  cant really accept the part that says theyre more simple but they are lighter indeed  discs are a little more hasslefree in the rusty regions and handbrakes dont tend to stick as much  however the sheer construction of them and the fact that people tend to run off from their complexity makes them cool enough for me
bumptidy bump
sigh
      its me again i have more questions     so im thinking of getting my hands on a 351w to swap i probably wont keep the fuel injection i just noticed that my car has an obd2 port and a mass air flow sensor despite being a 94 might as well avoid a wiring headache if it turns out this car was swapped bad what are my engine swap options     also another handling question since it doesnt really look like getting cobra parts seems to be worth it aside from the brakes are there any other cars i can pick parts from for better handling performance or should i just bite the bullet on a suspension kit from the aftermarket    cheers ill add a pick of shitstang that i lovingly refer to as high speed dump truck soon
bump
  bread is the way to go anon
  only 6 people on the map  /fg/ consists of 10 people  not too shabby
  thats fine for proof      see the op

hey guys i came to view your junk and read about your junk

    if the car was swapped improperly i dont want to deal with a wiring headache plus carbs are not hard for me use i work on bikes a lot in my spare time and cleaning and tuning them is easy money for me im not look for a super optimal set up i prefer mine to run a little bit rich for cool noises and for reliable cold starting
  my ride is better by default its not a furd
  isnt that a wrong general for that dont you think
  your ride is better at being shit lmao

just ordered some koni orange struts and shocks for 360  feels good lads now just to do the tie rods rear lcas and front lcas
  thanks
  yea everyone is welcome in general
whats something funny i can get my friend for christmas for his 07 focus
  us spec  a pair of mk3 mondeo headlamps for spare parts
          the 2020 escape is too carlike i prefer the old school boxier escape from 20082012 when i buy a new ford i think im going to go with the edge because its more suvlike what do you think of the 2020 escape it looks like a focus hatchback
  cuckovers have gone too far  fords design is thankfully boring enough to not make it into the suicide tier that lexus created
the 2012 escape hybrid is a good car its a shame an allwheel drive version was never offered the brakes last forever
  youre right i think the cuckuv trend will only get worse because theyre selling so many of them id like to see a plugin hybrid edge or explorer
  idk i like my 13 a lot more than the older generation escapes and ive been in plenty of old escapes you dont want to take a corner too quick in them for fear of rolling over whereas the third gen rewards it with a lack of body roll and precise feel the torque vectoring also makes twisties feel really good it doesnt plow through like older cars/audi that said the second gen v6 awd had some scoot but the third gen handles so sharp that an even more carlike one would be welcome to me i just wish theyd offer the 23 we already know it fits    when i trade mine in im leaning towards the new rwdbased explorer i want something with 300 hp but i need more cargo space but i dont want to go bof having room for 4 passengers plus their instruments would mean a great deal to me otherwise i saw an edge sport the other day toting a small trailer and i thought that would work pretty well too
anybody know a good transmission to swap into this thing to take more torque the stock 4r100 is supposedly not rated for much and id like to know a good replacement if it breaks
  you wanna go 70s80s and fuck with the engine or 90searly00s jellybean and keep it stock
  what kind of budget are you looking at    this seems to be popular  
  those seem pretty nice although if there were a stock transmission from something that i could find in a junkyard or used that was good for 1000 lbft id go for that first
  i think the escape is for females and therefore dont have an opinion on it
muh ferd
  ive never seen a welder mounted the bed of something that wasnt a full size truck is that 4 banger ranger
  its a 98 f250 long bed with the 73 in desperate need of a utility shell the welders not actually mounted it just weighs 500lbs and is sitting on a big rubber mat so it doesnt move at all really i will anchor it eventually
  you should asap i would t want that smashing back of my head in accident
  im not sure how much resistance some bolts and big body washers through the bed will give it but once i find a good spot in there for it i probably will
  bread
hey /fg/    ive got an automatic 2013 focus se i know that everyone shits on this car in automatic because the auto transmissions are known to break down a lot is there any kind of preventative maintenance i can do to stop that all the information ive found online just says to replace the transmission fluid at 150k miles but theres got to be something else i can do
  drive it like a manual     focusfanatics com/forum/mk3focus/415994fordpowershiftdcttransmissioninfouseguidenewownerslookherehtml
  get the 50hp livernois tune only 600 lol my 2017 has it and awd and it launches hard for a cuckuv all else bone stock
  20 or 16 50 hp would really help me out with the 16    im glad to know the tune supports automatic awd though
  did a bit of homework and there is a 16 tune but not 50hp still a 43hp 48ft/lbs bump looks pretty good     600 though
just washed my dd     groceries fit really well in the bed
  cute car anon
my little 03 mondeos clutch plate is all jammed up gotta go get her fixed today poor little shitbox
  clutch all jammed up  what
  cant change gear in or out when shes on but can when shes off its probably a linkage or a slave cylinder or the fluid in the wet clutch has dried over time
  thatd be the cylinder  its a 70 eur part
  thought as much looks like itll cost around 150gbp for parts labor and fluid change not too bad desu
  not too bad indeed  dont be one of those bongs that scraps a 500 pound car because it needs a 200 pound fix and then goes crying in forums how he has to take off 10 000 worth of boltons
  nah i bot her at 300 pound and im happy to triple that to have a commuter box only add on shell get is a new radio head and phone integration for the new no use phone driving  shite they gov are thinking of bringing in soon
  our gov already banned phones and driving here like 7 or something years ago originally everyone ran off to buy all sorts of talky gadgets too but it quickly faded off because loudspeakers were easier to use  dont worry about it too much unless youre on phone the whole day theres no need to get one  you can also use the popout cupholder cut a 45cm bottom bit from a large sized cup and hold your phone there and talk with loudspeaker  some people use magnets that clip to the vents they might screw with gps signal and theyre not really in the best position in a mk3

koni strut and shocks just came in  is this an easy wrench job to do i can find a spring compressor somewhere and is an alignment necessary after not like our cars come with front camber or caster adjustment unless you buy the cc plate mustang btw
  you should totaly do it becaus it will make you feel superior to 90 of so called enthusiasts and it will make your working on car skills better
  attach stuff yourself and go get an alignment
      very nice could use a paint job though
ive had my 11 lincoln mkz for 2 years now and fucking love it i know it was a rental car at one point but i dont give a fuck i love everything about it and i daily the civic beside it to keep the miles off of it i make sure to keep it clean ill post an updated pic with proof in the morning right now its too dark and im comfy in bed

  fusion is unironically better than v6 mustang
  while i think this is probably true i still think fusions are the ugliest cars ford has ever made

no f150s in collage  hmmm well heres my 13 then
  post bread
  still here
  i can never keep it straight whats the difference between the mks and mkz i love the style of both but id like to know what to look for
  add my 1997 mark viii
  mks is bigger mkz is smaller  the former is a fancy taurus and the latter is a fancy fusion
    this so the gas mileage on the mkz is a bit better and the mkz is cheaper i will say that even though it is a bit smaller it is roomy af in the front seats and im 5 10 at 290 lbs although not much room in the back as i would like just turn off thei forget the nameeasy access featurethe thing that makes the front seat go back so it doesnt jam your passengers knees every time you get out the car it doesnt bother me that much because im usually the only one in it most of the time
  honestly if i thought i could afford the mks at the time i probably wouldve bought that so i say if you think you can afford owning an mks then i say go for it
  sorry bro but your car is gay af
  add my orange pony too plox
  im glad you think so anon everyone is entitled to their own opinions   im happy with it and thats all that matters to me
  is it this one   if yes please reply with the year      need proof anon read the op
can i get love for 2 door explorers i have a 40 v6 with a stick
  pick her up a little earlier this year
  the mks is big and comfy though a good landbarge to cruise around in  ive driven my dads a few times and its nice  the cyclone engine isnt as responsive as the ecoboost but its still not a bad choice if you dont feel like dealing with a turbo
  i dont have any bread rn so heres half an apple pie
  thats one thing i like about my mkz is the power is there when you need it side note i think its funny/interesting that there is no ecoboost labeling on my car even though it is the ecoboost engine
  i think the labeling was reserved for the twin turbo v6 though i could be absolutely wrong here
  ye  2015
  which photo do you wanna use

tfw just bought my first ford ive ever owned  tfw its also my first truck  no idea how to work on it
  a haynes or chiltons repair manual is a great place to start
  i thought haynes manuals were a meme or are my friends just retarded
  theyre retarded theres a ton of information in them especially if you dont know anything theyre not perfect and youre gonna have to figure some things out on your own though
  thanks ill pick one up tomorrow in town then im going to shoot myself if i have to deal with my clutch being so loose for much longer
  clutch  loose  what
    like it feels like its biting way too late my foot is nearly off the clutch before it feels like its biting
  thats a worn not a loose clutch

post your trucks tired of seeing these manlet cars
stay mad
why is manlet capitalized its not a proper noun    moreover why dont you have the 62l
  it is the 62 2010s didnt come with emblem
  is it a 73
  based
  you got a little dirt on it be sure to clean that up so that the mall cops dont ticket you for dirtying the parking lot
    my neighbor who is 56 drives a raptor     is it not therefore a manlet car
  nice truck how is it having a camper been thinking about getting one use my bed too much so im kinda hesitant
  not a prob hate going to the mall
  for my use its a not a discussion    keeps the bed dry and free of snow an extra layer of security for my toolbox and whatever i have in the back and it can be a good place to mount extra stuff like maxtraxs work lights and similar things    ofcourse its not as easy to just take things in and out and you wont be able to transport stuff that is tall  but that all comes down to how much of those things youll transport i rarely do and when i do i just use a trailer
  its a 60 imo theyre horribly misunderstood if you take care of it itll take care of you
i dont hate trucks in theory but can you tell me why pickup drivers have the least driving ability of anybody on the road except asians
  there are shit drivers and good drivers of every single vehicle ever
  is that a 73 with the newer powerstroke badge mines a 60 but god damn do i love 73s
  and women my guess would be little car drivers have too be fast and move good if not they will get crushed trucks just dont care and drive along
  they make you overconfident also larger cars let you bully other drivers more which lead to bad habits
  apologetic trucklet
  i mean you are probably have a predisposition to hate trucks so when you see one being a dumbass you remember it you probably dont even notice the ones who do nothing wrong because they arent notable
  look guys im a manlet that overpaid for a meme shitbox and doesnt even take care of it  oh and btw maga
  stereotypes are never true everything can be good and bad equally   get out of here liberal cuck
how the fuck did truck prices jump 2530 in the span on 3 years    i have a f150 xtr and guess ill just drive it into the ground now
  i had one fucking hit me because the fucker didnt look of i was beside him or not and i almost got bit by one again yesterday because of the same reason
  theres way more bad truck drivers and theyre worse than a civic or prius shit driver because its a vehicle that takes more skill to drive because of blind spots and size
  are you trying to say sedan drivers dont pull the same shit by that logic ive been hit by 3 fucking corollas and no trucks does that mean every corolla driver is shit no
  its one thing to be hit by a jap cuckbox and a whole nother thing to be hit by a f350 super doody
  kek super doody
  demand spiked with low oil prices my bro works in farming and he tells me all about how the demand for trucks has exploded and the dealers can barely keep up
  stay mad
  obvious troll is obvious  generalizations are almost always false  if youre bad at driving youre bad at driving doesnt matter what youre driving
  it really does matter what youre driving bud a bad driver in a smart car is going to make me laugh but a bad driver in a truck is going to kill you
  still bad driver   i didnt say anything about differing consequences

  buys truck  cant go off road  no winch  cant work with it     literally what does one do with a truck like this
        nice trucks 89 30 4x4 sr5
    how are these trucks treating you two so far im debating whether or not if i should finance a first gen raptor like yours or go for the second gen theyre selling one like pic related at a good deal because apparently no one likes supercabs anymore
  either way resale value is good get the turbo if you like it or get the big ass 62 if you like that expect to get lot of attention specially from jealous poor fags
  youre more of a manlet with your factory rice mobile build your own rig or go home
  its a desert setup winch setup and bumper made for them if used all add more weight to the front suspension and decrease the travel performance raptor wasnt designed to compete with the jeep doing crawling or mudding ive also moved myself 4 times with it so far so did utilize the truck part of it  ive havent needed the winch yet for anything in the fort campbell area land between the lakes i was planning to go to colorado next but they said no i want to do a bracket in the engine bay and one in the back or tow hitch setup and keep the winch in the back till needed havent bothered yet        i bought mine new because it was only 5k more expensive than ones with 30k miles on them no experience with the new ones but its better overall performer on what ive seen lighter more travel larger shocks besides the engine in my opinion at least ford raptor forum has a large knowledgebase and probably has a in depth review by someone who has had both and beat them to shit
    thanks

post your trucks
  issa truck  tahoe gang rise up
  that looks fucking harrowing to drive   youd love the interior
  hey mcfly your shoes untied
    nice
  what is the appeal of trucks seriously i cannot fathom thinking these oversized boats are cool i have an easier time understanding death metal than i do understanding trucks
former truck
  its like having a high end luxury car that you can fill with corpses and then just spray the blood out with a garden hose
  it wont be long before people wont get bttf references
  well i kinda need it i have a couple of acres and haul lots of stuff with it and i like to go hunt a pig almost every 2 weeks
  pretty good so far its a 2010 and has 63k miles love the supercab i personally think it looks better
reminder the bigger the truck the better he sucks
  just bought one 20 mins ago everything is good interior is rough but i can fix that just need to learn to drive stick
how do you all feel about truck led drls the f250 looks really nice with the bracket styles lights and the new f150 is stylish as well every other truck doesnt look as great especially the 2019 silverados

  i unironically bought that car because no other millennials drive one and because although i love technology i like my cars low tech havent regretted it yet
  the sti is a successful manchild car its ostensibly practical but no one outside a mid 20s to 30s man would buy one because the drawbacks of having an unnecessarily stiff ride and poor empeegess would dissuade them personally i think thats fine though and theres nothing wrong with holding onto some of your youth especially in something thats as inherently impractical as a personal vehicle

  coke is trash who wants to feel good for maybe 15 minutes in exchange for 2 hours of shit feels at 80 a gram  true dat  most coke in the us is placebo anyway due to dilution substitution and using benzocaine to fake the numbing effect  a gram of meth costs 3075 and will get you 100x higher than coke it lasts around 50 times longer and you only really need a few milligrams legit meth isnt actually bad for you too that has been proven through medical experience and scientific studies meth is fda approved for children and adults 6 in the us by prescription  cokewhores btfo

  oh yeah coke ivd has a 34x higher bioavailability than sniffed shit the oral bioavailability of coke is higher than sniffed    this though is important anon uppers actually reduce the chance of death from downers but h/coke speedball users die alot because coke wears out much more quickly than h and then you can have respiratory depression and die   this is not an issue with amp/methamp speedballs because amps last longer than h and oding on amps is much harder to do

thoughts on 60s ford trucks
68 69 70s ford  60s
sexy but pretty much impossible to find anywhere with rust
  not entirely true i found my 66 f100 on craigslist that had only surface rust underneath it and i live in illinois   pic related
    we in california laugh at you    
  we in california laugh at you  implying anyone wants to live in that shit hole of a state
    as another califag i can say we dont really get to laugh at any other state
  pretty much impossible to find anywhere with rust  why do you like rust so much
i tried to do some digging but havent really found anything so theres three trim packages for the 73 chevelle deluxe malibu and laguna whats the difference between the three how are they different on the interior/exterior which is most rare how did super sport play into this were there only malibu super sports    i accidentally posted this on /k/ whoops
pretty sure the laguna nose doesnt have the big underbite bumper
deluxe is trim level for c/k pickup trucks malibu could be 4 door 2 door or wagon they usually started out base with a 6 cylinder but you could option them out chevelle would only be a 2 door and wagon ss trim was for the wagon coupe and el camino laguna was a version of the 2 door chevelle with a different front end rear louvers bucket seats etc rarest would probably be a chevelle ss 454 wagon
  yeah the laguna is i would say the more desirable model because of that front end the underbite one is tolerable only because of drive    theyre all rare as fuck because 3rd gen chevelles are undesirable to the boomer masses which means you can get them for cheap only downside is the repro market is nonexistent so good luck getting shit like door panels
  i wanna get this 73 laguna and restomod it to look like a super sport without the underbite honestly i just want the blacked out grill and ss symbol
hey fellas    longtime /k/ommando that doesnt know much about cars here     bought an 89 f150 for a bugout vehicle because the inline six 300 is supposed to be indestructible     theres some play in the steering and its difficult to keep it straight at higher speeds ill trade gun and cooking advice for tips on how to fix this thanks in advance    pic related i love her
  might need an alignment  are the front tires more worn on the inside or outsides or is the wear even  does it have manual or power steering
  tires dont show any difference in wear between inside or outside power steering     could it be a coupler or rag joint
  could be  thats what happened on my f250  take a look to see if the rubber deteriorated
  i will the guy i bought it from told me what it was then i got home and had to corral crackheads and forgot
im curious so you build this bugout car even though gas only last like 6 months so i guess its only good for the initial shit hitting the fan and let it sit until its needed im not judging id love to have a bug out car but i cant see much of a point of it since the chances of something happen are pretty nil that said ive got a crap ton of ammo and guns on stand by
  refresh all suspension bushings and ball joints bleed power steering fluid and replace the rag joint in the steering shaft if it has one
  not planning on letting it sit this is going to be my hunting/camping/miscellaneous sexy adventure car as well
  theres some play in the steering and its difficult to keep it straight at higher speeds  pepper your angus anon learn about the wild world of tib/ttb front suspension    twin i beam2wd  twint traction beam4wd share a lot of common qualities and faults one of the more common mistakes is people take their truck to the alignment shop and the static alignment checks out fine so they think the alignment is fine wrong that would be great if your truck was only static its not and lots of parts move around at speed and especially freeway speeds bushings compress balljoints show their wear u joints get a bit pissy the more worn out a truck gets the worse it is add some wide wheels and high offset it adds to the scrub radius which makes the vehicle even more twitchy at speed if the truck has been lifted and no modifications were done to the suspension links or the radius rod mounds or offset balljoints this adds negative caster which makes the wheels not want to self center but rather follow the road imperfections and wander rather than add stability and self center after turning this is why if you lift one of these trucks you need to compensate and restore factory geometry at least or it feels like the ayy lmao are trying to suck your truck off the road    even when items are new/better than new there is an inherent roll/bump steer issue these tib/ttb trucks have the larger the bump the greater bump steer issue there is this is not a steering input from you nor something you can counteract by turning that wheel in front of your face that wheel drops off the wheel is gonna self steer itself this is from fords way of designing the steering linkage on these trucks simple cheap and effective for the majority of end users the steering is only attached in three spots to each knuckle and then directly to the pitman arm this makes any change in ride height a direct change in toe plenty of pics on bii/exploder/ranger forums of this

  reducing the rollsway helps with this make sure your sway bar bushings and endlinks are good polyurethane bushings are the only way to go    first those radius rod bushings are stupid soft factory rubber bits have usually turned to rotten dog shit by now using a tire that is wider or has a high off setwhich yours appear to compared to the factory wheels will compress the ever living shit out of those rubber bushings replace them with polyurethane bushings at least if not the harder thermoplastic bushings are better p side unit is usually crapped out as the exhaust gets pretty close to it make sure the original heat shield washer cup is still in place if not replacements can be purchased removal/replacement can be a bit of a bitch on ttb units as the axles/drivesahfts dont allow much fucking about some guys just opt to grind out the factory rivets and then replace them with bolts/nuts/hardened washers on the radius rod frame mount but if you unbolt the radius rod from the     second a bit easier to replace front beam pivot bushings these can go to pot as well but more notably they allow the control to move up down in out quite a bit not good for the driveline u joints as it puts them at irregular angles and can wear them out highly suggest buying a quality set of prybars a set with at least a 18 prybar if you are decently strong get some 3 ones if you are bit on the skinny side a bit of leverage will make removing and installation of the ttbs easier you dont need to remove the complete ttb use map gas torch even a cheapy hand held one will do fine
  to remove the factory rubber pivot bushingafter getting the pivot bolt out and the arm low enough  tools   6 flat blade screwdriver  2 wire wheel  map gas torch  needle nose pliers  bucket of water  heat up the inner crush sleeve dont directly burn the rubber rubber will start to bubble around the sleeve and when the rubber releases it it will begin to slide out on its own grab it with pliers and remove it chuck it into the bucket  heat up the factory bushing shell to release the rubber bushing same as the sleeve heat it up til it starts to get soft enough use a long flat head screwdriver to break it free from the shell most will come out in chunks into the bucket go the bits  dont burn the bushing that just stinks and makes a mess  heat and scratch away the larger bits some pieces will not come off  clean up the inner shell with a wire wheel 2 is a good size  let shell cool down arm acts as a massive heat sink it will cool down fast enough  follow instructions for the bushings you have purchased    radius rod bushings dont need any special tools just patience to move the driveline out of the way
i need to lift my car to change the transmission oil will be doing it in my garage but i only have 2 jackstands    1 put both jack stands on the rear of the car a little bit ahead of the rear wheels    2place wheels underneath rear wheels    3 lift front end up placing the car jack in the middle of the car    4 place set of wheels underneath front tires
  yes
  just go to australia lol
just get some cinder blocks
  buy 2 more jackstands
  i did this but i used cement garden blocks
    wouldnt alloy wheels be stronger then cinder blocks
  if you want to damage the wheels go ahead
  yes but cinderblocks you can worry less about being damaged by the cars weight
  i wont be putting the cars weight on the wheels they are just in case the jacks slip
  i didnt have extra wheels i just stacked them high enough i could get under the car no jack

  dead map link  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  why care
  i want friends
  because regardless of what you think people do actually use it    cant believe youve or whoever the op is been so autistic as to break the link again jesus christ man kys
    pathetic
  kys map hating autist
  im not even op  i dont hate it its just pointless
  i dont hate the map i hate the autism that comes with it
  people use it  its pointless  kys      feel free to explain because it seems like the only autist is you
  i love in va not really an issue here if u do it safely
  pathetic people use it  pathetic people are pointless

  i hope my fellow anons do it safely regardless of where they love
  t pathetic pointless person
  im coming for you i mean i would be if i could find you on the map
    musta struck a nerve  kek
  good thing ive never seen a working link so i cant get on it 
spending this rainy day in my comfy garage wrenching on this beaut glass of bourbon in hand post good bike feels
suzukiyoure shitbike
  hurr struck a nerve heh heh heh  no but dont let that stop you killing yourself asap
  so basically youre saying youve been here for less than a week  good to know
  why would i kms  i have friends and dont need some pathetic map to find people  learn some social skills autist
  im going to kysms
  this is why you have no friends
  bragging that you have friends  as if its a feat of some sort  now that is pathetic  memes are not real people here have friends  we use the map to meet other anons from /dbt/ because it might be fun  just because you are too autistic to meet new people instead of the same old ones you already know doesnt mean everyone is like that
  i have no frens for plenty of reasons but you are the one acting like a real fag over the map
  drinking bourbon before noon  clean your room bucko
    all this autistic meltdown  wew
  methinks you have a reason to sabotage the map what could it be
  im not op
  ure autistic  no u  no u  haha wew what an acoustic meltdown  u so autistic xd  heherrr no u  well ok then
  i dont believe you
            all hail the map what is autistic may never die
  ok
  i like bourbon
  uhuuh everyone look how bad ass i am i drink i ride a bike and i have a gun haha man im such a tough guy dont mess with me guys im armed guys check this gun out  pic related replace the girl with a gun for people who own guns

  hey nice walther
  needing a gun and a knife  why also how shit is your aim hahahaha
  youre just as bad as the fuckheads that complain about cars that are too loud or revving to impress people fucking kill yourself yuropoor
  not him but i carry for self defense and knives for utility also close range combat isnt always out of the picture
  its ok for a pocket gun nothing special really     well im not the best shot but i did have a few awards and medals from when i was in the navy solid 4/10
  true knives are good tools
      i for one shoot all of my packages open
  i carry a glock 36 45acp is my round even if the recoil sucks on the 36 lol      good steel
op here    im sorry i caused an autistic shitstorm  next time i wont post a broken map link
            thanks for the yous guys dont get too angry at this shitpost because there will be a lot more today i promise      considered buying a glass breaker with belt cutter to carry but found that there are also knifes with built in glass breakers and seat belt cutters so considered this    what gun is this i dont have big hands but it some guns felt really uncomfortable in my hands the p99 was very nice tho
  ehh practice makes perfect better to be an ok shot than a victim  glock is pretty ok
  why are you patting yourself on the back ur not even an ok troll
post motorcycles
  if you want a glass breaker and seatbelt cutter get a dedicated tool no name brand knife makers make quality multi tool knives except for kershaw and that is kinda ehh id get a leatherman oht its designed for first responders and you can open everything with one hand it has a glass breaker and seatbelt cutter and knife all at ease of access
  you just picked this up as a project right   what are the plans for it
  4 replies for the first shitpost of the day is an ok start imo    thanks my friend will check if i dont find ill go into a hunting store and ask them or our fire brigade what they have i mean i obviously need neither of this on a bike because i dont have glass or a seat belt on it but if you encounter a wreck its nice to be able to help in the worst case
  havent got it yet picking it up soon though just gotta snag a trailer and do a road trip   short sight is get it running long term nothing crazy probably keep it stock if its solid enough probably ride it down to bike week daytona   most likely gonna be my daily
    nice i hope to do something really similar one day comfy cheap daily
    ive got a magna sitting and rotting in my backyard runs but the gas cap is rust welded shut lol if anyone knows how to fix it hmu

  yes we are in the process of finding presumably dead anons rip medellin anon to mark as mia
  zx6r  perfect example of a shit nubike   looks great  too bad its fragile as glass and made with the shittiest design and materials available
  he still has about five hours to reply before hes officially kia
    oh i assumed he was dead     cool welcome back austrian ktmguy
  va
any you guys ever go to the mid ohio ama vintage motorcycle days   i used to go every year got a minitrail there and fixed it up
be me  always do seated wheelies  get pretty good not the best at holding them but sometimes i can  always scared of standing wheelies  thought they would be hard as fuck  try standing wheelies today  held every wheelie 100 of the time  easy as fuck and i can even steer where i want to go  why did nobody tell me about these
moving to liter bike this week after riding on a 150cc shit bike for half a decade any tips
  dont take the throttle for granted
  just like your 150 there is no problem going straight from 0 to wot even through corners
  what bike
  dies
  fzs600
  you really have to dump the clutch on a leader bike to get going from a stop just give it the beans and let er rip
  take it out when the roads are quiet and take plenty of time to get used to the throttle
  i love her
  werent you about the sell it and get a busa
  nah i was just playing with the thought of the next bike i have issues not doing this one away soon already put 10k on in 4 months
  noice how do chicks ride on the back tho
    this is my biggest fear since the throttle is so sensitive i keep thinking i may overshoot throttle after shifting up a gear      are your secretly trying to kill me
  expecting an april is sperg to attract females
  ok
  dont sweat it if you really rode for five years you should be ok if yoe use common sense a fzs600 is not really that powerfull    after two years on a 650cc 40hp bike i went straight to a 1137cc 140hp bike    the big bike is easier to ride because its an inline four and smooth as butter
  madman
memes aside should i get a cheapish 350550 cb or cafe a cheap low mileage 750 nighthawk   not afraid of the work for either choice just cant drop 5k for a 50 year old bike
when you clean your baiku and find a dirty hard to reach spot and stick only one or two fingers inside  
  please dont cafe any bikes    if you must buy a cafe project someone already started to ruin and finish the job
  dont you know that motorcyclists are above the law
  parking on the leaves  thats it im calling the cops
  its not a fzs600 its a gsxr1000
  1 on this
  there was probably not a cop within 30 miles of where that picture was taken
  plenty of sasquatches though by the looks of it
  tfw you drove by my house and didnt even say howdy    t tendies anon
  oh ok try not to die    nah seriously though just remember those bikes have all their power up top id recommend not trying to test that power out till a couple months esspecially not out the apex or anything just be smooth thats the name of the game
  my dad once didnt want to shell out money for a new fairing and screwed on a new headlight and instrument dash instead did he cafe a bike by accident
  samsquantch    i summoned you 3 times in the thread you goof  we will certainly find time next year when its warmed up again over there
  liters make very linear power  they make as much torque as a 600 at 4k rpm
  that depends did he also install clipons more aggressive rearsets chop the exhaust try to fabricate a flat seat and then botch a battery relocation job before letting it sit in his garage for 4 months and relisting on craigslist    because if not then no he probably didnt make a cafe racer
  are you saying a 1000cc inline 4 makes as much torque at 4k rpm than a 600cc supersport at max rpm i doubt that but even so its an inline 4 so it will get there and make that power smooth     the guy will be fine focus on learning the clutch grab point and learn to work the possibly snatchy trottle just dont be a hooligan and max out gears on day 1 or 2345 forget that shit for the next months    i went from a thumper to a 1137cc inline 4 with damn near 90 ft lb at 7000rpm like i said being smooth is the name of the game
  a cbr600 makes 43ftlbs of tork at like 14000rpm  lmao  also he will not learn to ride properly starting on a liter is retarded
  you could be right on the torque estimations but the last thing you need to do is fearmonger the guy    also maybe because you need to start on a grom and work your way up to a supersport with 16 steps in between doesnt mean everyone needs that     learning how to ride means dedications to actually learn how to ride meaning take courses make time to keep practicing special maneuvers every now and then     if the dude already made the decisions all he needs to do is keep his cool and take it easy you dont help him be scaring him
i found my current gf thanks to the map  why would you not include it here
  gfm
  i found my current gf thanks to the map  lies
  ybr is not your gf no matter how much you say it    kys wr
  implying preceeding gfs  your story gets more and more unlikely chum
okay i still need more onsa pics thanks
  there are pillion footpegs and a small fist sized seat included if you really have to but   is pretty much what happens
    issue is people waay over value their cafe projects because they want to recoup losses its not difficult to cafe a nighthawk its mostly cutting and welding frame pipe to reposition the seat flat after that its cosmetic for a majority
is it bad to power wheelie then keep changing gears up to hold it    i find clutch wheelies so unreliable
  mostly cutting and welding    just stop    there are plenty of shitty scramblers available now for you hipster fags leave the old ujms alone
  i find clutch wheelies so unreliable  in what way you might just try getting closer to the balance point so you dont have to continually accelerate to hold it
ruins your 70s cruisers and scramblers and comes for your 80s offroad bikes next
  its a 90s nighthawk one of the ugliest japanese bikes
  still better looking than any cafe hack job
  calm down if i were to get a 70s cb id try to restore it id never put aftermarket parts on one
  do you promise
  have you seen a 90s nighthawk before its fucking hideous id be doing the bike a service
  dont think theres anything wrong with aftermarket parts as long as the originals are kept and its all reversible its frame cutting and shit that really triggers
  shitzuki  enjoy death
  tfw i will buy and cafe a r80rt and you cant stop me
mandatory shitzuki post
  ill key it and you cant stop me
  kys wr
    i just dont see the point in spending money to make the pinnacle of design in my opinion look different
  then ill turn it into a rat and wrap it in potato bags and spray rust and dirt from a can on it
  wat
  that doesnt make it any worse  you might aswell take the frame and flex it into pieces and grind off the frame number
  look upon me and despair
  pls no
  delet
  by why solid yellow
  art
  you were wrong    this is worse
  and learn to work the possibly snatchy trottle  do literbike throttles take more force to twist than smaller bikes  going from a 250cc to a vfr the vfr was noticeably more difficult to open the throttle up which made it incredibly easy to be smooth    i could see it being a consequence of the larger engine but i could also see the extra resistance being engineered out because it is a supersport
  i think the seat area on the r6 is the only real let down on the bikes looks   the front is so stylish until you get past the fuel tank is it just me or does the entire seating area just look kinda flat and uninspiring like two different bikes joined together
i wish onsa would appreciate my bike
  drinking bourbon  driving a harley   ill never understand americans desu
  what bike shes a whore for the szuk
  wr 125
goin to cruise for hookers and get a mcdonalds    c u guys l8r
  dont get hit by a bus
  llewd
  cute
  blackbird  wow it was fast 20 years ago
  riding a smaller bike than it fictional gf
  why are all cruiser riders exactly like this
  youre pulling 4 throttle bodies instead of one  each with its own return spring
  who said anything about it being fast
  noice how do sprung mass ride on the back tho
fitted my boosterplug today rides so much better now managed to creep up a hill behind traffic which i would never have been able to do before the throttle is much smoother and it has enough power down low that it doesnt just stall unless i rev the tits off it acceleration is a bit quicker too which is nice    also i accidentally shifted into neutral twice today which was embarrassing
  god that fucking headlight is retarded  and who the fuck designed the tank shrouds should be decapitated like he did with the decals
  in the second pic i ever posted you fags were sperging because my ex was in frame
at last i truly see this song is about riding         just look at the lyrics and try to understand
  girls
  when i was doing my test there was a girl doing her cbt on a brand new one of those got back and she had dropped it twice
  the headlight on new ktms is legit awesome  or do you mean cosmetically when youre looking at it instead of looking at what it throws light on
  i can see why some people wouldnt like it but the transformeresque look that new ktms have has grown on me      damn thats a shame was it hers or the instructors the place i went to had a grom and a junker ybr i took the grom out
  damn who owns the red bike that thing is beautiful 
  obv this isnt my actual bike   but dudes i love these ratty little things
  it was hers they had vanvans and some random chink bikes you could use
  witness me
  poor ntv
sleep tight bike
  it has a certain coolness to it but whats up with the exhaust orientation thats just retarded
  real racers dont need girlfriends
  this its just less money for the bike
what are my options for a non i4 sports bike besides the rsv4 and the memegale
  does it have to be a new literbike
  not necessarily but at least 800 ccs
post police bike of your cunt
  r1200s
  so no daytona
best used first bike under 3k probably will go klr 650 after i become competent
  i3s are basically smaller i4s anyways
  competent   klr650
  i wonder if you could scrape the engine before the pegs
  so i should just get one and thats it with crash bars ofc
  klr a shit
  so im about to do an oil change on my bike is it worth hunting down one of those magnetic sump plugs and in regards to oil filters do most hondas use the same filter im trying to find the proper filter for my cb400 and wanted to try a ryco or kn but dont want to waste my time with the wrong one
  de doesnt expressly forbid lanesplitting    this changes everything
  virgin baguette japscrap vs chad poutine reichmobile
  firestorm/vtr1000 sp2 ebr1190rx ducatis tl1000s/r
  i hope you werent planning on having fun in the bush citizen
  tl1000s/r  isnt it going to kill me
  daytona
  potentially they were known for that
  oi cunt show me ur loisense before i throw yous in gaol
    dude says wants to trade i got ducati srcambler 2015 4800 with minor drop damage    i think its fair trade what does dbt think
changing oil on bike  remove sump plug  either lost washer or there was none  didnt have a spare wanted to finish change  replace plug with no washer  10000km later no leaks
  replace the rear rotary dampener and you wont die     maybe
  i really dislike this era of bike design
  not as beautiful as that blue beast i saw pics of with the same fj
  dont worry about the magnetic sump plug no it doesnt necessarily use the same filter as another honda kn is shit
  whats wrong with the scrambler      if id trade mine id personally get a xsr 900  speaking of that  i intend to replace my bike next year    should i zx10rr or panigale 959  in either case ill city commute with it
  how about ryco theyre available everywhere here and getting a genuine honda filter is a pain
  nothing wrong i kinda want more power and bike better for touring
  fz09   touring
  lol people have toured on zx440s
uhhhh new thread

whats a good naked to start off on cheap more than anything ninjas and cbrs give off a tryhard vibe for someone learning imo
  by the honour of my ancestors
  tryhard vibe  cbr    you dense motherfucker

buying gf
  i think he means a teenage chad funded entirely by mommy and daddy so he can look cooler than the rest of the kids in the school parking lot he doesnt want that kind of judgement im guessing
  oh shit  im outta here
  anyone have any experience with these thinking about doing a restoration and this seems like an odd machine
  i tour on an fz07
  i guess it makes no difference to you since you never have girls on your bike anyway
  tfw you can only afford to buy one for 30 minutes each week
  do people actually think like this in real life  how does a motorcycle qualify as tryhard if it bothers you so much  cagers usually dont know anything about bikes besides the names harley davidson  honda and bmw  bmw anything attracts dumb girls like flies to african children
  why man
  way better than scrambler lmao
  how much  just curious what the going rate is wherever you are
  thats if the girl even notices the bmw badge on the bike and makes the connection that its the same brand more likely shell just see old man bike or sport bike and itll mean nothing
  between 60 and 80 euro depending on the girl
  what part of it is related to bikes
  bought a pair of rear pegs to give qts rides  literally never taken them out the box they came in  dont even know how to take the cowl off the back seat  shut up shut up shut up
  slap some fake taxi stickers on your bike and just park outside night clubs around closing time youll get some drunk sloot up for a lift home on the bike and maybe a blowie too dont forget your passenger helmet though
  if youre stationary and talking to them theyll notice  if it has any bags bars foot panels etc or if if is a naked bike like a harley then its an old man bike    you neeed fairings or youre old  this is an unwritten rule of motorcycles
  that awkward moment when youre posting on multiple boards and use blue theme for everything
  mandatory paid maternity leave is a good idea  it gets the useless unproductive slags out of the office so the nation can actually get something fucking done for 6 months

tall af  wide/tall bars not enough  2 risers  max comfy but now bike looks doofy     fuck

  move the number plate up a bit or get a bigger one
  doesnt look bad at all you usually see these 00/01 crs roached the fuck out but yours looks great love my 01 most fast/fun bike ive ever owned
    it looks better than it is  ive already had to replace literally everything to do with the clutch lever/perch through to the cover     thats kind of why i bought it though this winters project is to get it cleaned up legal plated and dual sport it come spring

  tfw my ducati scrambler only attracts men and other hipsters girls rly dont care unless it looks expensive

  why dont you let a qt peg your rear

  ew why the fuck would you post this trash   and why do i have this boner
    as the owner of an rc38 nighthawk my advice is to simply ride the fucking bike as long as the ergonomics work for you who gives a flying fuck what it looks like    pic is mine
  shouldve gone in july my dude
  true even my cbr250 gets comments like be careful that thing looks dangerous and dont go too fast on that rocket    its a small commuter bike but fairings  fast to normies
  any more than 4 autists at once is too much
we should have a super canadian maritime meet maine vermont and newhampshire are invinted
    all the time and sometimes on the shoulder too
any reccomendations for bike mods to make a bike more visible in the dark    im getting my bike very soon and id like to be prepared
  take out all your light bulbs so you dont dazzle other road users at night
    hi visible tape
  oem lights are pretty good most modern bikes have additional running lights on each side as well as alwayson headlights dont replace your tail lights and turn signals with tiny little chink leds     add reflective tape possibly additional lights and wear bright colors reflective tape is the cheapest and most convenient way to improve it over stock    also be conscious about where you ride lane position and paying attention to the factors around you will make a huge difference
  easy solution thats not permanent carry a hiviz vest they fold down small too and can be kept in an inside jacket pocket or under your seat for night riding
  these also let the responding emts know youre an organ donor so if youre clinging to life with multiple broken limbs theyll choke you out so your innards can be harvested asap not weeks later when you die in the coma    hope this helps

final post    fuck white people i will single handedly ensure that your race does not survive by impregnating as many white girls as possible
sup brehs some fuckface decided to cut my fuel line for whatever fucking reason earlier this week probably the same persons just unplugged it which i assumed it came out on its own but after i changed the flimsy wire clamps that came by default by thick ones which clamp by screws whoever is fucking with my poor mule decided to just cut it    now my idea is to get a shielded tube which would take more than some scissors to cut and just park it elsewhere even though where i park now the bike cant be bothering anyone there are more bikes parked there too but i want to try and catch the fucked doing it besides hiding and waiting which has its limitations what do you anons suggest any camera that would activate on movement and can be secured to the bike
  just watch and wait retard     now fuck white people

  new because the op is a retard
i used to have a hu like pic related but lost it can we have a hu thread
this is the new mazda mazda3 say something nice about it
it has two real exhausts thats all
  yeees anon say something nice about me
  its supposed to come in awd and a manual 6speed
    thats a cool looking econobox
  i like big butt and i can not lie
  mazdas factory paint tends to look ok
  the sedan looks sleek not a fan of hatches
i leased a 2015 3 and a 2017 cx5 i dont like the new look but thats just me
i like the i am so tired of this shit look
  its a car    im not sure why the plebs of 4chan land blow massive loads about this thing school me on why its great instead of the average i feel it falls into
  this thing is 2030k and has the interior and exterior of some luxery shitbox while being econoshitbox weight mazda is based
  skyactiv x sounds cool best of gas  diesel in one if it doesnt suck ill get a lightly used one in about 3 years
  looks better than that shitwreck awful new miata design
  goddammit it resembles my grandmas about to smile face
its about time mazda brought in a luxury brand of their own their normal cars are seriously amazing in interior quality
  i think they dont really want to be luxury just classy
i still prefer the mazda 6 bodylines
  fuck off with your amerifat rebaging bullshit  thank god mazda is free of ford and will never be subject to this again always make one good car instead of two mediocre ones
the poor mans gtc4lusso
  dual exhaust  inline engine  real
2018/19  mazda3  or   ford focus
  literally has the body lines of a shitting dog
  is it just me or does this look borderline like an alfa
  theyll tell you how fun it is to drive even though it has one of the most dumbed down throttle responses no power and torsion bar rear suspension
  perfect
  alfa looks  jap reliability  based mazda
fucking release pricing and options mazda
  im interested in seeing the hcci engine in action
    ya it does
  they did and that got them into financial crisis in the late 90s
  real as not like this peace of fake shit that is having success lately
the fastback doesnt have the fuck huge c pillars  why go for it though when there is the mazda 6
its red  its not ug  at least its red
angry front  angry rear  what is mazda so angry about
  looks like an old passat built in chernobyl
  the mazda 3 is angery  angery about being slow
  i call my nd angie because she looks angery
  being beat in everything by the gooks
it got ruined by normies
  its not some overstyled garbage made to appeal to brain damaged normies
      mazda fucked up majorly  the car already looks dated currently cars are getting more edgy again while that car is blobby as fuck  why do japanese car makers keep fucking up so hard i want them to return to former glory
  torsion bar suspension  how can mazda fanboys justify this  t miata owner
  it doesnt look dated at all to me
be warned that car is radioactive because it was built in hiroshima
  /o/ is a cute board    regards  /an/
does anyone know if it is going to have a start/stop system where the engine turns off at a red light my city has horrible traffic
  lmao shut the fuck up with your edgy bullshit  if anything itll be more classic because its not following whatever gay ass trend   do you want it to look like a tryhard toyota commuter
  ford is the best thing to happen to those slanteyed shits
  get the awd model if anyone want multi link
  aam i going to be raped by a car
  llets assume there is merit to that and the edgy/agry style will keep on for a couple of years  it still is a good idea to put out something different just win over those buyers who are fed up with more of the same
  awd mazda 3  gt godmachine
  awd mazda 6 25t with a 6 speed is all the car i could ever ask from mazda i would love to comfy cruise
  nd is more like a devil going  bweaheheh  or some shit  what i really want is a car that personifies pic related hopefully the next gen    it would be cool if mazda made a rearbiased awd system tossed it in the cx5 with the tarbo then you could get something competitive to the macan at half the price
  cringe retard
mazda are targeting innercity business women who have more money and interested invested in handbags  in return for their success their community and their loyalty mazda has given their fans a giant middle finger    where were you when mazda was kill
  they did and like the other anon said it put them into a financial crisis and also that they didnt sell all that well
  heh look at this anon who cant into inspiration
  shut up autistic retard
seen it in person looks great bros looks way better than the new mazda 6    i may get trim in a skyactiv x with awd
  i am le tired
  though the hatch isnt the greatest looking vehicle it can have  awd  25 turbo motor  6mt  that combined with mazdas everymans luxury approach to interior makes this a hell of a daily     i seriously dont get why people get so retardedly down on it just because of its lines the sedan looks fine the hatch doesnt look that bad and overall its a move back to funtodrive small cars
  it would be cool if mazda made a rearbiased awd system tossed it in the cx5 with the tarbo then you could get something competitive to the macan at half the price    just buy a stelvio
  yep back seat visibility is the only down side for the hatch which i dont care since i am not the one sitting at the back
  throttle response is good what are you talking about only other car better in the price range is gti regarding response at least and desu thats not the fairest comparison
      so its fuckin average lol
no more multilink suspension  dropped
  t afford the awd model  tpoorfag
  wanting 140hp with 3500lbs    if i wanted slow id get a crosstrek
mazda wont make a speed 3 because its childish  how about mazda 3 club with the turbo independent suspension less sound deadening manual everything and an lsd
  manual everything  so manual windows manual locks crank start no power steering etc
  resentment towards mazda is real
   your ass  tdelusionist
  buying an alfa  ever
you can swap in the 25 turbo from the cx 5 if you like
    engine swaps on a brand new shitbox    there is no reason mazda cant offer a refined hot hatch similar to the golf gti they make all the parts yet refuse to make it happen      hurr sworry amelicans mazudaspreedu so childish here underpowered shitbox for same price as hotuhatch
  im probably the only person i know among my friend group that even owns a mazda let alone would spend money on a mazdaspeed hard to mazda desu
  the only crossover id own
    i owned an nc2 mx5 and when i wanted to purchase something like a mazdaspeed3 there was nothing for me im not spending hot hatch money on tarted up econoboxes as nice as my friends 2017 3 gt is its not worth the asking price i dont give a rats ass about stupid amenities and safety tech give me my turbo smilebox
  new speed will never happen everyome wants the speed3 and i just want the speed6 currently have an 07 speed 6 but mazda is focused on luxury and comfort and not pleasing enthusiasts with sporty models again like the speed branding
  mazda usa is basically just trying to survive right now its a miracle that they offer the mx5 competing against the gti would be a waste of resources
  the current model doesnt have that and still gets amazing fuel efficiency in the city like the mid 20s in stop and go traffic which is nuts for a pure ice
  everyone who wants a speed3 dont want to buy it new and will just bitch about how expensive it is
is it bad i want a new rav4 they look nice but theyre still crossovers
blink twice if your gf/wife is forcing you to buy this
  theres nothing wrong with crossovers stop letting autistic neets on a sudanese fishing exchange tell you what your opinions are
hi shills
its better than a ferd/gm/bmw cuckover subaru has better offerings though
  she actually wants me to get a camry since they have more power and better mileage id likely let her drive my corolla and sell her car since its on its last legs
  novel idea buy what you want and she does too using her own money
  im trying to get her out of that shitcan and into something im not working on every other month
  then point her to the classifieds or drive her to the nearest dealership
  3k civic
  why cant i just sell her car and let her drive the one im keeping why do you give a shit this isnt even thread related we have joint checking accounts and she pays her fair share of bills im the one getting a new car here
    isnt the toyota better on fuel
  i like them better than the old ones the last two generations are just too feminine for me
  looks good imho
  its really almost a perfect vehicle especially the hybrid good on fuel peppy not ugly this time  i want one i bet these are going to fly off the lots  but i would get a shit corolla first
  what is a sudanese fishing exchange and what do they do
  what
hello mrshill
  joint checking account  yikes
      rav4  25 i4  203hp  184lbs torque  23/30mpg  27000    edge st  27 v6 tt  335hp  380lbs torque  19/26 mpg  38000
  thanks for proving his point dumb nipshitter
  rav4  no fun  edge  fun
girls really love rav4s maybe i should get one  
    i had a rav4 theyre good little cars if youre just using them for commuting and basic dd stuff i really like the look of these new ones like a mini highlander     predicting high levels of honda getting btfo id like to see fewer sante fes and other hyundai trash on the roads too
this is now the best crossover thread
  why do you want one    1 its really really really ugly  2 its toyota so you know its boring  3 its japanese so you know its soulless    what are some things about it that inspire you
have you considered taking a dick in your asshole or facepussy
  eh nothing will beat the 08 rav4 that hit 060 in sub 5 seconds
    ecoshit  the ford will never last as long as the toyota  those are lucky to go 40k then getting a new engine or trans because of major failure
  40k is longer than the amount of time it takes for a basedota to rust in half
  rav4 that hit 060 in sub 5 seconds  that doesnt exist
    not sure where he got 5 seconds from unless someone turbod a v6 rav4     but the stock v6s did 060 in about 6 seconds which is pretty impressive a tundra with a 57l v8 can barely keep up with that
    toyotas are indeed based glad we all agree
  subaru has better offerings though    a 150hp 3800lb cvt forester
  why does it matter if their savings are separate if they both make money who cares
  ford  dont make me puke please
  he probably looks just like the fat guy driving it in the op post that would explain it
  buy a 4runner pussy
  theres lies dammed lies and this post    problems with crossovers is that you get most of the cons of a sedan and most of the cons of an suv with almost none of eithers benefits
  1 its really really really ugly  2 its toyota so you know its boring  3 its japanese so you know its soulless  not op but   1 thats subjective   2 its not a sports car   3 are you 12
  1 its really really really ugly  op already said it look nice  2 boring  3 soulless  kek translation its doesnt break down everyday
  most of the cons of a sedan and most of the cons of an suv with almost none of eithers benefits    there are no benefits to sedans and the only benefit to an suv is ride height which a crossover benefits from
  there are no benefits to sedans  lower insurance and more storage
  benefits of a sedan are ride quality road wise viewing angles size and mpg    cons are payload/ hauling restrictions inability to tackle terrain deep snow or flooding    benefits of an suv are storage payload / hauling off a truck ability to tackle terrain deep snow and flooding    cons are mpg massive blind spots roll over prone size    a crossover gets you the blind spots rollover proness and the mpg of an suv the power ground clearance for terrain deep snow or flooding and hauling capabilities of a sedan    but you get more storage
    that thing will seriously last for about 20k before the engine blows
  20k is the average lifespan of a toyota frame
  unless youre doing outdoorsy shit with it id highly suggest a camry better mpg more hp better look better handling less prone to rollover etc    you can wait until 2020 models are announced to see if anything special is happening
  that nano ecoboost motor is rock solid try again
  nothing from ford is rock solid only thing id ever do with a ford is lease it and i wouldnt lease shit shitbox crossover
  my toyotas frame is doing fine at 140k
  i bet you wont say the same if it were other way around
  yes very
  seriously   awd  27 ecobeast  100 more torque then rdx shit  but its ford   grow the fuck up
  shitbox crossover with garbage handling garbage interior and dogshit road noise and suspension  bbut its fast   id lease a mustang if i had the disposable income for a third vehicle dont get me wrong dont expect me to lease a fucking edge though
  not that guy but are you going to point out how the edge st or edge sport are bad nobody had problems with edge sports all you can do is hurl lame insults like a confused child
  i literally pointed out the handling interior road noise and suspension that cabin noise is fucking comical go test drive one those were my major complaints other complaints that will come down to the individual consumer were the awful touch screen on the infotainment system awkward body roll goes back to handling and the something in the interior which we couldnt identify what was rattling on a new model but ill give it benefit of the doubt and say that may have been specific to that car no idea    it was a cheap feeling trash can and i know i didnt test the 6cyl variant but the 4cyl felt fine as far as acceleration went those are real legitimate complaints come back when your bus pass expires and you go to test drive new vehicles
  are you going to point out how the edge st or edge sport are bad  did you read his post he literally did just that    garbage handling garbage interior and dogshit road noise and suspension
  mazda cx5 is better
  moving goalposts  i meant the engine he was saying it would blow before 20k miles stop trying to defend a retard like that
  i drove a 17 rav4 like 3000kms over a week though highways and twisties it was fuckin gutless amd handled worse than my 82 kingswood ute
  highways
  the 19 is supposed to be better
  that they are but for city slickers like myselfthat rarely matters
    holy shit i busted out laughing my girlfriend is literally next to me reading this thread she wants a rav4 so i figured i would find a thread on here talking about the new models why do women like this car so much in her defense her mom has owned one for 10 years and it barely needed something fixed a few months ago thats reliability
  thats a rav4 its fucking huge
  trust me i had newer rav4 engine is biggest let down slow as shit and wont save you much gas   i am going to test drive rdx and edge st i think extra power is must in family car who wants hail around kids in slow shitbox
  handling compare to what  we were talking about suv edge st will blow them away
    no kids in foreseeable future i might just got with the a 2019 hcr theyre going for 20k usd i believe
  there isnt much discounts on hcr rav4 and has about 3k discount average you gon end up paying similar money
  excellent reliability  good fuel economy  high seating position gives the illusion of safety actually more dangerous due to rollover risk  easy and predictable drive  most not all but most dont care about driving fun and want to feel detached to the road
  yep thats what toyota ends up looking like
  this is a freestar cletus
  oh yeah baby that coil is one good winter away from rocketing into the cab of that hunk of shit like a snake in a can
  why would you want this   help me understand the appeal please
  thats called a toyota in good shape
  storage ease of ingress and egress ride height awd extra ground clearance toyota build quality
  this
is it just me or does that new design look a lot more like a ford design than a toyota
get a police auction full size car like the taurus with the ecoboost engine you get an automatic column shifter that isnt available on civilian models
  its because of the tall car  more important association that click in women mind
itt crossovers you actually like
i am appalled op    go to bed right now youre grounded
mumble mumble toyota something mumble
you posted one of the worst crossovers op im guessing youre a badgefag because theres no other reason to like it
looking for a cheap new car well holy fuck pic related is a damn good consideration my mom bought one of these two years ago but she works out of the country a lot so yesterday she asked if she could store it at my house for 8 months i told her sure but i was gonna drive it around as a beater  no problem  love you    i feel this car doesnt get enough love i am only basing this on msrp not compared to all cars ever  can be has for 16k  pretty nice interior and 8/10 sound system  blue toothe  steering controls/cruise control  auto power windows  power locks  decent trunk for the size  fits my 200lb 6ft frame with zero issues  not a track car but handles pretty damn well  felt to me like the first new bmw minis the non sc ones  30mpg without even trying to conserve fuel  decently quiet interiorthough could be a touch better  bros this i all around a great car if youre looking for cheap and new warranty fuck you can get them with like 20k miles for like 68k on my local cl
  these crap boxes are absolutely nothing like a mini ive driven both and youre full of shit hamster cars have borderline citreonlevel body roll and they sit way higher off the ground
  the new model is a better looking than the older i like the new headlights better
  kia rio is really nice if you want a cheap little hatchback
itt kia dealers association
  i like the new one better except the extra large mouth it looks like it doesnt fit
  30mpg without even trying to conserve fuel  its amazing that 30mpg is what people consider to be economical these days
have a kia rio ive only got 15k miles on it so i cant speak for longevity but i like it just fine so far
  looks like a camaro hatchback to me
  the crx was one of the most economical cars in the 90s and it got 40 30 is pretty good no matter what year faggot go be edgy somewhere else     according to the study fuel economy for cars improved from 134 mpg in 1973 to 212 mpg in 1991 but reached only 239 mpg by 2015 
soul  souless
  those rear lights  what the fuck
  kia soul  is one of the most soulless cars ever made    its not and never was a good consideration
being a newer kia is probably reliable at least had a 2013 rio for 82k miles and it needed nothing at all but scheduled maintenance
  buy a used toyota instead of wasting your money on an unreliable korean shitbox with constant engine recalls
  literally one of the biggest pieces of shit i have ever driven
is there a car in united states that nobody wants to buy
  buick cascada
  you can get a brand new corolla for 16k though
  because nobody wants to buy the buick cascada
  would you buy that with your own money
  where i live those cars carry the worst drivers on the road right next to the prius and the crv
  you know    if i lived in the united states i would have a car that no american man would like to have
  looks like a combination of a the worst car styling memes
  koreashills have been all over the board lately so many posts this weekend about the genesis/stinger that read like paid reviews for the first 10 posts before anyone else showed up
ladies  the toyota scion mazda mazda2 yaris ia sedan  starting at 15450
  paid kia shill  kys op i wouldnt drive it even if you gave me one for free
kia is very underrated car brand these day i have a kia soul myself and can describe it as reliable all the way
  posting objectively better box
   corolla    soul probably feels more comfy to ride corollas are ass
  kia  beats boxster in a drag race  runs 11530 on track  porsche boxster runs 11400  porsche boxster can barely beat a fucking 4cyl box    
  fuck off shill
