have you ever masturbated to a painting
  why dont you have a seat right over there
  too fat
this is the sexiest painting ive ever seen in my life and im not even gay the masculine physique is so pleasing the lack of a face makes it all so tasteful and graceful the brushwork accentuating and elegantly defining the forms of the horse and the male its absolutely perfect no boog kiddie drawings no sargent perfect faces none of freuds fat as fuck landwhales can compete
  im not even gay  ive got news for you anon
    im not gay and i dont find this sexy if you do you are
  i love that horse ass
  no but naked paintings were my first exposure to that sort of imagery
once when i was stoned as fuck i did actually beat it to a giger painting that was definitely the weirdest one i ever did     no regrets tho
the only painting that ever made me consider that but the answer is no  ive never jerked it to a painting yet
  i forgot about hussar another consideration
  that horsess ass looks a little too human  its unsettling
  why do you want to know that
  nah i cant even masturbate to painted porn something about the way paintings are rendered kills any eroticism for me
i stumbled on this painting in a book when i was like 13 and thought it was the hottest thing ever
  look at that smug sob he know what hes getting
  this painting looks like an incels dream
    he doesnt want to be a visigoth with a harem full of captured naked roman hotties   or a captured roman hottie about to be sold naked on the slave block to a visigoth uberchad    im sorry for you
literally all the time i have several bookmarks just for it    heres a few    all start with xhamster dot com  x/photos/gallery/paintederopornart144darioortizrobledo2764637    x/photos/gallery/paintederopornart138victorlyapkalo2114790    x/photos/gallery/paintederoporn137robertauer2108710
  honestly this one does it for me
  do sculptures count
      these are good
  im a woman there is very little stuff directed towards me at least stuff thats free and not fanfiction so yeah i paint a lot of stuff i abuse myself to
  nope if it lacks titties the size of a head i cant masturbate to it
  lacks titties the size of a head  lets play spot the fag
  stuff i abuse myself to  wwhat kind of stuff do you paint anon
  what kind of stuff do you like exactly     ive seen some pretty good nude male paintings/sculptures that seem like theyd appeal to women like 
tfw only find one picture in the thread attractive  am i broken
  unironically enjoys academic paintings of little boys  yuck boobs are for degenerates  we couldve been on 4channel you retards
  i like my women without woman traits  is this a faggot
  could be worse im in the same boat but the picture in question is this  because of the look on the face and the exposed shoulders due to the slipping top
no but some of manets paintings are extremely hot
    woah you guys are a bunch of queers imagine unironically wanting to fuck your own grandma
    r/4chan
    i give you 10 years before you end up in jail
  holy shit you sick incel
            this is the state of ic right now  imagine wanting a fishy bacteria filled hole over a hot throbbing cock
  he has a small butt i wouldve had drawn it larger but thats maybe the reason im here shitposting and he drew a lot of good artwork
i jerk off to digital paintings on /u/ all the time
yes
  how can anyone jack off to such poorly drawn shit
  i dont find women sexually attractive  i learned that a long time ago i never fapped to doujins i never fap to porn im not visually stimulated    but i do pretend to be because women get autistic if you dont drool over them on occasion or pinch their butts i love my gf because shes a thoughtful and caring person and will make a good mother but i do not care about the female form in the least
  he  wait thats a guy
  yyes you fapped to this
  this dicks are more aesthetic than vagene
  almost did guess im biscum now
  maybe your just gay
  a vag has less bacteria than a mouth tho
  not attracted to men i jerk off to fantasies involving women and erotic fiction involving heterosexual intercourse i just am not titilated by big butts or big tits nor small butts or small tits nor big muscular chests or big dicks    i dont care about the visual physical form of a woman but i like the idea of having sex with women
i knew keeping an eye on this thread was a good idea      user egi 75 years male heterosexual  from small town in bavaria  grandpa egi posting erotic art on xhamster but hes been inactive as a user for 3 years so hes probably dead on the other hand  ive heard of articles published in well respected journals the sun probably announcing that looking at tits prolongs life  preemptive f      so yeah i paint a lot of stuff i abuse myself to  abuse myself  getting real strong catholic vibes here  thats cute post something of yours so we can abuse you too /crabaway
bouguereau was /ourguy/
  if i was an incel i wouldnt find realist paintings attractive and claim that image is ruining my life by being posted over superior art depicting men at least learn what words mean before using them anon
i got a salvador dali art book when i was 10 and would stare at this for hours
  this one is very hot
  those are pretty good galleries on that profile
  thanks doc
  drawing males with stupidly large asses is so fucking dumb    go jack off to a woman and stop having your shitty art clog up my booru when i search male_focus

  portrait du comte roger walewski  so thats a boy huh
  i had sex with one of my paintings once
  story
  be me  have sex with a painting
    this fucking retard
  sex  sex is for living things but keep pretending you have an active sex life with your paintings
  i rolled it into a tube and shoved it up my ass
  lovely composition really well depicted scene and social situation they look like a group of middle eastern migrants swarming around blond swedish girl    one problem though who would go to the pond to get smelly stagnant water
came close to skeeting to this once the bottom girl specifically
are there any tshirt designer people here how do you decide what kind of designs to make do you sell them yourself on sites like redbubble or do you submit them to sites like yeetee what designs that youve sold have been the most popular how much can you make doing it as a side thing
  i need that shirt now sauce
  im pretty sure it got removed because the artist had a problem with it or it was a stolen design or something it was one of the 24 hour only designs anyway but was removed after only a few hours they even removed the tweet with it so something was up
bump
bump
      i shared everything i knew about this stuff in a thread a while back it answers all your questions and should answer any other questions you could possibly have feel free to read through it in its entirety link is here 
  thank you i have a few questions to ask if you are still around im still going through the thhread and typing them out and altering them after reading further so this is just a bump post ill finish going through it tomorrow and post the questions etc thanks again
one more bump because i was busy today and i want to make sure it dosent die while i sleep
im on redbubble teepublic and recently amazon i aint selling shit though im awful at driving traffic to my goods heres one of my latest hardly anyone seems to understand the joke
  this is a great example of a design that works better as an illustration than as a piece of apparel its something you might get a funny chuckle out when seeing it via a webcomic on facebook or something but it just doesnt look good on a shirt
title in other words whats the least skilled you can be and people still be willing to pay money    i am not counting people that are /beg tier or lolcows that get paid for pity points ex muh depression or for shilling some cause lgbt consrvatism etc i mean by skill    obviously amazing artist can charge the most and nobody will buy /beg tier shit but there must be an entry point right    a pic would be great to give me an idea
i have seen some shit gaining money so who knows
its not about the skill level its the amount of people willing to buy your drawings aka have a lot of followers
  sfw  you need to be pretty good  porn and fetish  you could be trash and get paid
as long as people want your art you ge paid that simple    you can be high level and still lose to a trash level one if they market it well
if this man dies in a few weeks time will the value of his art go up or down
literally fucking who
  hamian durst      the natural developement of the pricing after death of an artist shilled by sothebys is that it goes up exponentially you noob
it goes up because it becomes a much safer commodity after his death theres no new pieces coming that could affect the value of the old ones
my interest is the reports on d hirsts resale prices there was a warning that his art was making a loss recently though the recent auction of his past financial managers collection doubled the expected sales figures his auction prices come with a caveat in that if ive got this right groups associated with the artist bid for them to give the appearance of success when on the free market it might not have been so its its own minidrama

hey ic im stuck with my older surface pro 4 for drawing at the moment and im curious about thoughts on programs like virtual tablet spacedeskbasically any astropad alternatives for windows ive heard of pen remoting as well which programs would you recommend with the leastinput lag

for the love of god someone please explain high art to me
  you mean modern art  most of it is all about the process and the intentions of the artist most of it is garbage probably some money laundering going on too  there you go anon
  its bullshit anything from cia psyop to confidence scam for rich jews to launder millions of dollars
  go pick up a book
  this art is so amazing you need to read books about it to begin to grasp what it means rather than look at the art itself
the camera was invented which made the collective art world sperg out so hard that art fucking died the end
i used to be hardcore art objectivist but then i realized that an emotional response to art is way more important than how well it imitates reality   high technical skill is good in its own way and is worth appreciating but the important thing about art is that it makes me feel something appreciation of ability and emotional response are not mutually exclusive but they have their own value i like seeing interesting art things ive never seen before unfortunately seeing wellpainted portait of rich person 12634 doesnt make me feel very much  yes i agree that its pretty strange that a lot loweffort modern art auctions for absurdly high prices but thats a different discussion altogether i dont really want to get into the philosophy of it all i just like looking at art
   yes because you would completely comprehend a francesco del cossa without reading anything about it   these brainlets srsly
a scam  and a waste of time thinking about
  basically at a certain point mastery of fundamentals is meaningless id look at modern art for example anybody can get to extremely realism levels easily aka photocopy meme   so at a point you try to find the next step which is to abstract it some people go furry or animu or modern calarts bullshit others abstract even further and go high art   while results are similar to a low skill the meaning behind why they abstract is different
  its just pseud shit to make yourself feel smarter than you really are
            those ruan jia cucks again      pseud  yeah its the jia cuck alright no other person uses pseud
  people got tired of drawing realistic shit and wanted to let their imagination run wild instead one problem  cartoons and anime girls in particular were not a thing yet then pretentious faggots found out about this new hip and cool movement and shit spiraled out of control from there  and nowadays its just western children trying to feel smart and important without putting any effort into anything
  whatever pseud
low art is generally thing made for marketing purposes the goal is to make the money or get appeal looking at you fan artist/pornographers  high art is made to try and evoke emotion or thoughts firstly and when its done you pray someone will buy this shit
  back to your shota and loli imbecilic attall fangirl
  what the fuck does jia have to do with all this
  modern art was a mistake threads are 100 liable to attract the asian shitposter who also posts ruan jia admiration threads regularly incidentally they are also often started by the same person   lurk more
  with all due respect i disagree with the notion of abstraction being the next step  i get that it was a next step but where modern artists miss the boat is that they think art history must follow a linear path  focusing in on a part of an engine is wonderful and useful for a time and fuck it stay there as long as you want but insisting that the motor is the only the thing about the engine relevant now is limiting and sophomoric  yes the motor is cool and fascinating but lets reassemble that puppy and put it back into the engine and go somewhere  you can still have your geeked out technicians focusing on the various aspects of the motors function but give me a fucking break if you keep letting them dominate the conversation it will remain this big circle jerk going nowhere
  art should be only realistic
  with each post you just prove yourself as more of a pseud
  linear is the wrong word there is nothing linear about the developement of movements in art only styles branching off in other directions but these directions are not linear at all and could even go back full circle    the post modern aspect of taking the car apart and looking at each aspect standalone is more of an act of zooming in a key work in this are the water lillies by monet i almost guarantee you whether youd be a degenerate anime fag or an art philistine of another kind that when you stand in front of these water lillie paintings you will be taken aback by the rich and playful application of color that monet has achieved it is mesmerizing in the true sense of the word  the thing is that in these paintings maybe not for the very first time but still quite exemplarily the body of the color is almost lifted from what it means to depict the color itself has become the subject this was a major departure for painting in general when you accept the fact that painting after this was often more aimed at the psychodynamic process of seeing and memorizing shapes and colors you may have also taken a step further to understand where contemporary painting has come from     afterall you dont go from the pythagorean theorem straight to quantum physics because you believe you are too smart for the steps inbetween in the same way contemporary art is based on this vast history of art that humanity has produced so far and its allowed to do so yes here and there you need a manual to understand what it is about but that just falls right back on you because obviously you havent identified the implications for lack of knowledge
  anybody can do it so its not worth doing  thats just being snob
  its not like you have to stick on one abstraction the entire time but after realism you need to go somewhere its various forms of abstraction after that maybe you dable in anime and cartoon network shit for a bit then you go into high arts for a bit then youre lighting farts on fire wondering because somewhere along the line your reasoning lead you to that being art    abstraction isnt just 1 thing theres various forms of it       its still worth doing for the technical skills but realism has never been fun for anyone mastering fundamentals only takes you so far then where are you to go from there  you have to take it further and that involves completely breaking down the rules or focusing on certain aspects of art over others
  realism has never been fun for anyone  you shouldnt even be posting your opinions if you truly think this every realist i know enjoys realism for developing a unique technique and voice that depicts how they see the world as individual artists and people believe it or not some artists are content with creating beauty for beautys sake and a subset of these artists find beauty in what others would consider the banalities of realism your ignorance when it comes to different artistic ideologies is astounding look at more art by more artists research their methods their philosophies their thoughts before posting dumb shit like this your prescriptive artists need to do x gobbledygook betrays your supposed sophistication
  if you look at most realist artists though theyre not just drawing reality theyre abstracting it in their own way and style to produce something unique    maybe saying its not fun is a bit extreme but very few people see that as their end goal simply because of how easy it actually is to get there after awhile people want more than just drawing reality some do it in new mediums some do it in new styles
  is this abstract 
  i mean obviously  i have you ever seen a piece of shit that looks like that in real life
    most realist artists are abstracting   i mean when you say this youre basically admitting that whatever you say about realism is meaningless
  its about the process not the results    training for realism and attempting to capture reality is realism most realistic artists arent actually going for complete realism theyre adding their own touches and style to it maybe making things a bit more blue or upping the contrast but its about actually bending reality as opposed to being unable to capture it correctly
  i think youre confusing academic realism which is training versus a broader definition of realism that generally includes some level of abstraction
  its surrealism
low art is art created to be consumed by the masses like animation or illustrations comics arguably thomas kinkade etc  high art has the lofty idea that it is somehow a contribution to the best parts of our culture post modernism throws all of that out the window and tries to convince you that sometimes crap art is high art all in the name of deconstructing or subverting our understanding of art but really technical skill will always be appreciated regardless if someone chooses to label something high art or low art
all 4channers are /beg/  
  correct
how would i commision someone to draw me a nonlude anime girl
ask them for a nonlewd anime girl
  unironically refusing to use brush stabilizer
using the minimal one to compensate for pressure twitching hearbeat and shaky hand is pretty hand     using any significalnt stabilization or treating it as slow mo just gets in your way and keeps you from getting good
  they are required in certain cases because most tablets and styluses are way more slippery than pencil and paper your lines will always be slightly wobbly if you use no stabilization at all no matter how good you think you are
unironically drawing on a tablet without a smudge guard
not using photoshop as your main drawing program  lmao
  it saves me 2/3 of the time when i have to work on lineart whats your point
  this
  i used to until i tried krita
0 barred stabilizer master race reporting
  because most tablets and styluses are way more slippery than pencil and paper  i keep a paper on my tablet feels like drawing on paper if you dont wanna do that theres always flex nibs
unironically using a mahl stick
  not knowing a real painting brush is basically a mechanical stabilizer
not using 200 stabilization
  yeah its the future people use vector
  no tools just rules
  implying more than 1 percent of ic users know what a mahl stick is
  great post op you sure showed everyone what a badass you are well done
  i just use csp i might try krita is i manage to get it to freaking work
using aim assist in art
  holy mother of based  tfw 0 stab master race  feels good
  cringe and bluepilled
  shut the fuck up u stupid idiot a brush is like a pencil its hard and not stablilizeing
try out mobile game because kyle plays  randomly playing when suddenly  kyle fucking appears and plays in my raid  mfw playing a game with kyle and hes using the girl he drew porn of
nobody cares get back to drawing
  playing videogames  playing mobile videogames  n g m i
  mobile game
  kill yourself and i mean this unironically
  you should really stop being so autistic
  how are they not games
why the fuck is kyle playing shitty mobile games
50 percent of the threads 50 percent of the posts
  8 different ips itt  8 posts    are you drunk
  i post on like 4 diff mobiles bro not right now but i do it all the time
  then you need some serious help
  i do need help with your mom shes pretty heavy come help me turn her over on the belly side
ive lost all respect for kyle if hes playing mobile (((games)))
  nearly all of them are too shit to be worth anyones time its just drudgingly boring unenjoyable shit specifically geared to turn off your brain and get you addicted to squeeze as much time and money out of you as possible  its just a bunch of nothing a parody of actual vidya at most i see people in the train or waiting playing mobile games all the time i dont get it id rather do nothing instead
i want /v/ to fucking leave
  who cares what you want
f
  3706895  f
no one actually gives a fuck about /ic/ nothing will change
  quick rundown pls
  why
  explain
          tumblr is banning porn and theyre all gonna shit this place up
      tumblr ban nsfw blogs on 18th which probably aint gonna effect ic much since most ic are beg and got little chance for commission
  im so mad im gonna raid 4chan with porn and shit  raiding 4chan  its like pissing in an ocean of piss
  theyre not gonna come here lol theyll go to twitter da or even newgrounds no one gives a fuck about /ic/
  theyll most likely flock to /trash/
  no they wont you moron theyre slowly migrating to twitter right now
  we must prepare ourselves to spread the good word of loomis and to preserve our chamber of fundamental and academic study whos ready to parrot loomis
i didnt know 4chan was a blog posting site until i looked at this thread and ops diary post
  glad youre on the same page as us
  sorry mate this is the hampton board now
  this but unironically
  twitter is a terrible platform for displaying art
  you mean the maikeru hanputon board right
  he doesnt know hampton and loomis are two halves of the divine whole
i probably will become less inactive soon enough as i have been on ic for a long time and it just seems to be getting worse and worse goodluck guys if you really believe in yourself and work hard you will make it
  active  sorry im retarded
  tfw tumblr is actively castrating their own platform  the one reason i still used it was the porn and occasionally art references i have next to no reason to keep browsing it if all the porn is gone and im sure a sizeable chunk of their userbase are the same way
  i doubt tumblrfags care enough about /ic to come here and if they do it wont really change much since the community heres already toxic enough
  then we gotta do our best to crank up shitposting this is why you dont try to fight shitters as they are your greatest allies
  see you tomorrow
can you guys recommend me other artists who are this good at drawing juicy pussy
  ah yes the vagina the most unaesthetic part of the female anatomy    the way to a womans heart is behind her tits everyone with half a brain knows that
  yummy
i second the good vagina ressource request as i really struggle with them too  but maybe it would be better to ask in the porn thread
  thats pretty beg but what else is there to be expected from beta virgins dont make shitty threads especially when there is already a general for you snowflake
    just search vagina on sankaku and sort by quality
  sort by quality  didnt know it was an option thanks for telling us
  oh shut up roastie
    this is why most porn artists draw pussies like they belong to 11year old girls just a neat coin slot with a small bead on top and youre done
    yeah this looks good      hope you know why they call you roastie  you a got roast beef down there you slut
  meant to say looks used
  based      cringe
  i get what you mean by   11yo pussy  but now im curious about an agebyage pussy comparaison to see how this specific body part evolves with age  thats probably not a request i should ask google about
    well generally speaking the inner labia tends to grow with puberty but some women have a innie into adulthood
  yo fuck you i almost had your shit thread image seen at work
  to be fair you shouldnt have 4chan open at work much less a pink board retard
  what are nsfw boards
  your fault for browsing a nsfw board at work      ive never seen an adult woman with an innie outside of porn granted i havent seen many womens privates but i have seen some at least and they were all like ops  i heard a few years back that many porn actress with innies had surgery to get that look as with the completly shaved look it is to enhance the youthfulness so i have no idea how common it actualy is
  most images are tame at all times
  fucking citation needed are you new here or what dont be retarded
that doesnt even look like a good vagoo
  ive been here for 6 years dont give me that shit 
    can confirm since youre curious used to have the age appropriate very innie labia when young it darkened from bright pink over the years to a brownish pink and is less innie so its slightly visible but doesnt hang out like the infamous roast beef
  fpbp
  natthelich for obvious reasons
  been here for 6 years  still fumble the quotation  also if youve been here for some time you know theres a lot of unsafe content as op pics i count 5 pics with naked people in the catalog right now      im very curious can you recall how old you were when it started changing
  a childs vagina would get me in more trouble than a quick glimpse of partial nudity come on now use your brain
  so you consider it a childs vagina interesting i dont to me its an adult one
  looks like it from the thumbnail and any normie coworker would think the same
  then back to square one dont browse nsfw boards around normies
  but my shitposts
  shintaro kago
  umm perhaps 13 started puberty around 11 or 12 so im just guessing it took a year to start having visible differences since it was never instant enough for me to notice
  that   good  it looks disgusting af m8 desu it looks like a pack of wild niggers ravaged it
  thanks for your answer  of course its a gradual change and i suppose you werent looking at it everyday to check on it
  yeah by fifteen it looked about how it does now but still with that teenage youth to it like teen tits vs adult ones    also its not exactly easy for a girl to check it the most i saw it as a kid was when i wiped after the bathroom and after puberty your pubes kinda get in the way of a straight down view
  outies
    lol what is wrong with you people go outside
  judging by the available porn id say the vast majority of women in my country are innies
  judging by the girls i actualy fucked 100 are outies yes all 2 of them  judging by the strip club i sometimes go to 100 innies  judging by the live models from my life drawing classes id say 80 outies
  shaving your crotch can increase the chaces of yeast infection its really unhealthy    i personally like a little bush
  just look for a good photo reference
sticking my cocko in something that urinatesbleeds sweats and cums seems disgusting to me but when im horny idc
  so muscles get weaker with use hmm interesting
  puffy pussies that 13 year olds have is the most aesthetic part of the female anatomy
  or if youre studying real veggies do the same search on idol complex some are pretty decent
  this is all very new to me especially since porn have never really been my main interest in art or really in any aspect of my life  but now im really curious is it really that visible in many adult women  im a full grown women but my neither region has pretty much stayed the same in size and color from a when i was a kid like its completely hidden from the world and i kinda assumed every women was the same ive just recently learned this may not be the case from looking up reference pictures i need for my drawings  just hope theres not something wrong with me but at the same time i cant really be bothered to look it up /
  never ever licked pussy in my life i imagine that thing taste like peach
  when u get raped theres no brakes
    its more of a salty/sour taste but it depends on the girl the best pussy i ever ate tasted something like lemon pie unfortunately some really have stinky ones that smell like literal cat piss and leftover shrimp in the garbage on a hot summer afternoon
    let us see that beautiful vaggoo babe  or you can send it on pm if youre shy 
  fuck off tyrone
       its basically this for the most part its very sour because vaginas are acidic by nature to prevent infection if a woman is too negligent or too obsessive over her hygiene then shell start to have problems and smells a healthy pussy doesnt smell too badly but it also doesnt smell like flowers or fruit unless shes near her period then it definitely changes to a more metallicy sour taste
   no worries i myself havent changed too much either except in color so im more of an innie too everyones different but yes its more common to be an outie with color and shape changes
john currin
  more like old milk and pennies
  you face when you are a french cuck you cant use sankaku
  obsessed
  too obsessive over her hygiene  so cleaning it too much is a bad thing if so thats interesting
  from what my girlfriend told me cleaning it too much will kill the bacterial life that is kind of necessary  i didnt know that shaving it all could led to yeast infection though my girlfriend doesnt go smooth despite me prefering it that way because it itches too much when it grows back
  well i shaved the area around my phoenix once and it itched later too
   it itches like any shaved area but whats worse are the cactus prickles that quickly follow just ruins sex
  the vagina is self cleaning so anything could set off the ph balance soap  water is fine on the outer area but even that would fuck with it
  what is the source
  like any shaved area  no way face and legs never itch only sensitive areas like groin and armpits
otto dix
  this  there is a reason why futanari exists
  ah thats a relief then thought maybe something was off with hormones and thats why i didnt develop down there like the rest       sorry m8 im too much of a prude to ever share nudes
  consider it a request for reference
      just maybe you havent considered the fact that the outer lips becomes wrinkly and darker overtime which is actually disgusting aspect and can happen to innies thats why the majority here prefer the 913 range because the outer lips look fine regardless if aroused or not if you ever seen a 60 year old innie its an obvious difference
  the best pussy i ever ate tasted something like lemon pie  suddenly i feel less insecure about my vagina  dude said it tasted citrusy and i was like dude what
    not being flexible enough to eat out your own cunny to check for yourself    ngmi
  how do you even get a puss to taste like lemon i know that mens cum can taste sweet if they eat lots of pineapple and other fruit but for women i dont get
  so you fuck a 913 year old and a 60 year old  story or sauce
people who have never seen an vagina irl are suddenly gynecology experts  yeah  porn can teach you so much  god damn i havent seen something more pathetic then this  op asked for artists that draw vgs not this
  its more of a salty/sour taste but it depends on the girl  unfortunately some really have stinky ones that smell like literal cat piss and leftover shrimp in the garbage on a hot summer afternoon  vaginas are acidic by nature  shes near her period then it definitely changes to a more metallicy sour taste  ive heard that you may actually get some form of throat cancer after eating pussy what the actual fuck why must our dicks supposed to be exposed by such a putrid disgusting assaulting orifice
  exposed to such
  her ass i agree
    porn is a self selecting sample so not really representative ive heard the prevalence n near 50/50 either way mind you the outer labia are a fat pad so having putting on weight can actually make the outer labia just big enough to look like an innie    oh and the surgery thing is true too labiaplasty is becoming more and more common particularly among sex workers because that is the look

  i need facts so i can respond with my feefees  not worth the effort if youll never listen to the harsh facts i dont blame you when youre not only programmed to respond with (((morals))) but by the internal instinct of being threatened by younger competition  but even nationalist right wingers etc hate hebes and pedes  this is quite ironic since theyre the same group that embrace feminine youth    tldr its common sense
  because the vagina is supposed to make it hard for foreign bodies like bacteria or sperm to cause any harm not just let anyone knock it up thats why men are thought to have pre cum it makes the passage more base and safer for the cum as far as ive heard anyway

      wtf are there actually people who look like this
why do so many of you spend all your time talking about drawing arguing or debating instead of just drawing i see these threads like my style/your style or draw this and barely anyone participates why youd think a board like this youd actually want to draw instead of just discussing it to death and beyond i mean really all the answers are out there what new information are you expecting to find
  lets start with you op instead of being a gigantic faggot complaining about complainers why dont you post your work and lead by example
  this is a good idea
  so much this
  because most of us recognize our weaknesses and dont want to post something unless we are proud of it were only going to post something that is at our current art high
  op btfo by one post
    well op everyones waiting also you couldve been drawing instead of making useless threads
  as an artist you dont live inside a bubble you know that being the case its not a bad idea to develop a formed opinion over other artists even if those opinions are negative
  i post in the draw thread all the time go check it out your turn
  ok cool post your work here
why do so many of you spend all your time talking about drawing arguing or debating instead of just drawing  first post is literally arguing and debating  this place is dead
  post your work
  that wasnt op by the way
    oh damn im dumb
  yeah amazing logic the 10 seconds he made this thread could have been the 10 seconds he needed to make a breakthrough in his art and change his life meanwhile youre scouring for threads probably actively posting in several acting like you arent literally below beg because you dont draw sick logic op called you out and all youve done is samefag and sperg out if you arent going to post your work you are never going to achieve moral high ground you are literally just flinging shit  bbut what about op  if you even think to reply to me with this you are beyond stupid
  fpbp
  ive long since given up gitting gud  now i just badly draw gay anime girls and shitpost on /u/ and /ic/    maybe ill get remotivated some day
  im willing to bet the lineart for this looks like complete shit
    thats better than most people here not even joking you dont need to autstically render biceps just improve on your lolis little by little by tackling weak points every day
  becausethis boards very foundation is built upon lie after lie i first came to /ic/ 8 years ago and people were spouting all this nonsense about how everyone could get good at drawing and make it i was foolish enough to believe it ive been drawing for 8 years and still get roasted in the /beg/ threads because im so awful all i have left is to complain for all the years this place cost me
  epic larp
  you really gonna blame /ic/ for your own incompetence
  how is it larping my deviant art progress pics even occasionally get posted in cringe threads
  post youre art then
  well 4chan is a place for discussion   the draw thread alt and beg thread are place to post arts and people are sick of my style/your style and draw this thread  so there will be a lot of discussions threads most move slowly though  you just assume just because there are a lot of discussion threads people in here dont draw
  i dunno man if i only used /ic/ for all my art needs i wouldnt expect myself to improve either
  yes because i was misled if i knew that couldnt get good then i wouldnt have wasted 8 years i even studied loomis for 2 whole months and scott robertson for a month still cant even draw a box like everyone else    here is a loomis sketch i just did if thatll make you believe me    some people just arent meant to make it
  still cant even draw a box like everyone else  and thats the crux of the issue aint it you arent suited for drawing everyone else is doing it just fine so the problem isnt /ic/ but your overall capabilities you could honestly make it if you put in a modicum of effort but by the sound of it you arent even able to do that 1 you already have the idea that you cant make it which is going to hinder you in the long run and 2 it looks like you think you can just grind shit out without putting in any critical thinking youre not going to be able to read loomis and scott and then all of a sudden become an art god you have to actual interpret and understand the material
  thats all your own fault anon dont blame /ic/ for inability to critically think we cant spoonfeed you how to move your arms
    post your work
  go look in the /beg/ thread guaranteed that most are better than the ass doodle you shat out just because the beginners put in effort i know you dont fucking draw if you had to doodle something when someone asks you to post work but i dont know why you havent the sense to move on to a different art community by year fucking two
  weebs  actually draw  cute  dont even care about gitting gud memes and just enjoyed creating things they love    loomisfags  no skill  years in and no progress  doesnt have any art on hand to post when asked for examples  whines instead of drawing   doesnt even like creating things just go into art for easy sex    why are weebs such chads
  thats becuase you obviously skipped the fundamentals    loomis is useless if you cant draw cubes cilinders and spehres in 3d
  scott robertson for a month  loomis for 2 whole months  scott alone take several month to complete  what have you been doing for 8 years  if one book aint fit your style ditch it and go for another book i always find loomis method dated and scott is hard for true beginner   there are a few books that recommend for absolute beginner in sticky
  maybe youre not cut out for drawing but i would consider this a matter of negligence than it is a proper attempt 8 years and no sign of critical thought or evaluation of your approach past the first stages no sign of diligence or neatness in your work how do you even attempt doing other things with this kind of approach there are no real teachers on /ic/ just your peers who give haphazard critiques anonymously the benefit of this place are the tools some of which come from reputable sources and great teachers if you cant make good use of those tools in the first few months alone then it is more a lack of sincerity on your part than an inability to learn
  i dont think the weebs get sex either
be me  op  wonder why no one draws on /ic/  want more draw threads  know what i must do  make a thread to complain  iq well over 5000
  tfw i was extremely bored and actually was larping but the mean comments from all the anons hurt my feeling anyway  lel i deserve it desu
    larp means live action role play you cant larp on the internet why has this acronym become so popular when people dont even understand what it means
  cant call people larpers when theyre live action role playing because were not on a grassy field in costumes    thanks poindexter
shitposting here gives me an extra boost to do art every day
  8 years  yikes
  so what
  because complaining takes a lot less effort than drawing and doesnt require any skills complaining is already learned at the time when we are babies and cant even talk but we know that complaining makes us feel better    so thats that i guess
  are you larping as a pedantic autist here or is this a genuine post
  was this 8 years of everyday drawing its impossible not to improve post something finished youve done or if you never did finish anything strange if thats the case try to finish something and post it in this thread im genuinely curious about your skill
  its a polished turd is what im saying
  wrong i used /ic/ for my art needs and improved kys
  everyone could get good at drawing  they can though you suck but that doesnt mean you cant get better different people have different needs and expectations consider getting a teacher if youre stuck with something/have such a hard time learning on your own
  nice meme there anon
    line art isnt required for a drawing you realize painting is done without lineart right    if the lineart is bad but the finish is good it means theyre just using the lines as general guidance and not as actual contour descriptions     ngmifam
  the 4chad weeb artist  draw what pleases him  only ever does reps to honor the characters he draws   dabbled in all the fundies for one day has complete mastery of them  bends imperfect 3d into perfect 2d  mastered loomis breaks it as he sees fit  actually draws   could draw artistic masterpieces but has chosen to only draw anime tits  has created 1000s of anime ocs all are beautiful and precious to him  lifts regularly for his 2d waifu who he has drawn countless times  just draw bro
  who drew this

    1 you should learn to see and draw from reference accurately first read keys to drawing and practice the exercises    2 practice drawing simple objects around the house in different rotations some from reference some from memory and imagination until they all look the same the point is to get you drawing with 3d shapes and thinking about where things go logically
  take a shot of whiskey and you should be good
  you should learn to see and draw from reference accurately first  too bad literally no one will follow this advice because /ic/ has been infested with faggot children who dont know the difference between your ability to see and symbol drawing
any of you been experimenting with scheduling todo apps specifically to boost your drawing habits  gonna try out the next best thing i found called superbetter or whatever
  is it called superbetter or whatever or just superbetter or is it actually called the next best thing i found called superbetter or whatever
  superbetter
  got too much shit to do that wont fit in a schedule take just drawing for example you dont know when youre going to be done with it so you cant have a fixed time i dedicate 1 or more days for one task that im supposed to focus on
  im doing   4hours on  fundementals drawing from life i block ic and distractions for this time period using coldturkey   4hours off  reward relax browse web   4hours on  draw anything fundies fun stuff what ever you want ideally you would want to be working on a finished piece     i do the 4 hour split because it just makes sense youll learn more if you give your brain a break and split up your time rather than 8 hours straight running on fumes
  i block ic and distractions for this time period using coldturkey   tfw windows 10s shitty notification system does this for you
where is a good place to share art just for quick discussion/criticism/praise reddit is pure praise no criticism dont want that this place is pure criticism and zero intelligent feedback dont want that either just want to be able to post something and go drew this and have 2 or 3 people share their opinion
  post ur shit here and ill give you a critique
discord
the vincent artists club discord    find it on disboard
  show it to mom and dad
  maybe try conceptartorg     they have an art critique center and from what ive seen its pretty helpful
  hmmm you need to learn how to draw qt pie anime girls before you should paint anything else
  disses /ic zero intelligence    askes for advice      whats even more confusing to me people are actually giving you advice
  you need art friends or pay someone randoms on the internet dont care about you or your improvement so their advice will always be shit
  what a retarded thing to say
  i dont get what you want do you want people to tell you your art is shit but it has not so shitty parts
  randoms on the internet dont care about you  i care about op but he hasnt posted any work so i cant give him any relevant advice
  extremely
draw muscles and boxes all day  never actually make soulful art  please tell me you actually make art with soul
bbut muh concept art
  he didnt draw boxes with soul
  by soul you mean actually interesting
  if the fundies get on the way of your soul then you got a weak soul buddy
this comes back to the just draw meme if you always make an effort to put meaning into your art it will become more meaningful give it a bit anon
  i dont know what op means by soul but its really the measure of how fully you express your inner self in your art a perfectly rendered cube  0 percent of soul something more personal is more soulful no matter the technique
  this is gonna be the most video gamey thing ive said all day but how do you get a strong soul
  why is that commissar beating up a sunbro
soul what the fuck do you mean     making characters
      by soul i mean soul  what else could soul mean
  i refuse to take the bait  come back when you have specifics  also just so you know you can have plenty of emotionally impactful work while still maintaining a high level of craftsmanship like have you not watched and half decent anime out there or hell even western animated movies those require muscles and boxes anon
  soul finished piece that you actually want to make  if your drawings are just studies  or youre just drawing because you ave delusions of becoming rich  then it isnt soul   like have you not watched and half decent anime out there or hell even western animated movies  as long as you dont abandon your soul its fine
  context
post art stations
  this guy is fucking obsessed with his gear yet ive never seen any good quality art coming out of it what a sad existence
  disgusting setup you know theres pcs out there that you can actually take to work and not look like a douchebag and still have the the same power right
  funny enough you seen to have no second wacom mobile studio as its never actually visible on your photos buying a box just to shitpost
  are you the tsugumi guy
  oooh yeah he had two boxes haha the fag bought an empty box
  absolutely based and redpilled
  that wacom tablet was outdated on release now its basically a dinosaur now imagine investing in razer blade stealth and an ipad youre bad at making decisions
why not show your own art on the tablet youre an artist correct
dont have anything completed ive shown on /ic/ before sorry
  this is the ipad 6th gen or its the pro
  why are you so proud of an alienware op its so cringy you fell for the bait of gaming laptop you should be ashamed and i wont even talk about the wacom tablet/pc
    hey man im also into traditional which books do you recommend im deep into figure drawing/painting
  all these fancy bois
  laptops are the way to go    you should put a blue light over i bet its covered in jizz and cum and other biological filth disgusting also who the fuck is dumb enough to buy an alienware laptop it doesnt matter how rich you are
  anon im you from the thirdworld
  do you enjoy being made fun of bad credit anon you should be drawing
    all those fucking layers  do you niggers seriously do this
  first gen ipad pro 97 inch
  lol do you even draw
  not using layers  ngmi
  has to resort to layers  has no sense of unassisted edge control  yikes maybe take the training wheels off some time
  desu i am shocked do you create a new layer for every highlight and tone or something    not utilizing the same layer to render form  have fun spending several minutes trying to find the right layer you want to work from its all so cumbersome
  i constantly press ctrlj to create a copy of the selected layer that way i can go back to a checkpoint when i made a big change and i dont like it
  the books pictured are what i am starting out with besides pic related and a scribd account that gets you about anything you want  also check out the suggested donation podcast  they have tons of trad figurative painters and they mention books and philosophy of seeing and the like  depending how new you are the davinci initiative has some good stuff especially their youtube vids  you can search concept art to find some big copies of bargue plates  right now i am just practicing and trying to get good at measuring sight size and comparative  im sticking with a pencil for my next drawing then going back to charcoal  once i get a charcoal drawing done that i feel i can frame ill try to paint a plaster cast object  i have no accessible life drawing class near me so im not sure how i will proceed to the figure
  
    being this scared to make mistakes in digital of all mediums  meanwhile sargents mentor would periodically wipe his entire canvas off and make him start over to make him realize that if he could only paint something well once it was luck you coddled faggots are never gonna make it lmao
  yeah and where is he now dead   enjoying being ngmi and dead lol
  please just fucking draw    you are wasting so much time on ic with all ur dumb pictures of your setup you arent going to get over your depression shitposting like this    this isnt the attention you want    get mental help talk with someone and overcome your faults and use art to further yourself as a person
  dead and recognized as one of the greatest painters of all time ngmi
  tradfag detected  pyw
  just like you will be right 
  thanks for the tips i already knew bargue and da vinci in im saving some money to buy bargues book cost half of minimal wage were i live model sessions dont exist here too i usei some photos but mostly i study on digital my skill lv is lower on traditional
  except you do realize there is lots of uses for layers right especially when doing composition and making changes that you probably might not like so its best to revert can your trad workflow do that i didt think so also you can get a trad feel on your canvas if you enable bevel/emboss and remove the fill on the layer thats how craig mullins gets that trad feel look of wet paint
  im beginning to give up man my depression is progressing further and im thinking about giving my studio pro away
  save your money and download the bargue course from bokorg
  could you at least post your work never quite saw any of your drawings
  its furry art youll probably call me gay for it
  what if i told you most of us started off that way even /pol/ had its fad of closet furs youll probably get over it eventually anyway
  alright give me 5 minutes to post
    im so sorry
  sorry
  stop drawing stylized figures and do more life drawing
  where do i start and you better not say loomis memes
i also used to draw with a friend but i gave up because of my anxiety     pic related
  thats some other anon start doing more of these     you start by learning to use basic forms and refine forms in space look up perspective made easy by ernest norling and study mechanical perspective
  ill check it out tomorrow since i do nothing all day except push buttons i literally do nothing all day i find no enjoyment in anything and ive got everything ive always wanted but it still doesnt fill the void i dont watch movies dont play games seldom get on /b/ to troll no sex anymore stopped running 10 miles a dayis there a group here i can join so we can learn together
  is there a group here i can join so we can learn together  no for the most part were all riding solo why dont you go lift weights for a change and hire a fitness trainer to kick your ass also stop thinking about yourself it will help and i sincerely mean that
  ill try in the mean while i need to get sober im addicted to red bull and nearly had a heart attack a while back also are you an artist
      look through these threads too
  
  im guessing your friend is the one that did the inking and rendering in part 2/3/4 their style looks appealing enough to make a decent amount of change from furry commissions
  yeah save your cash and find a free download  heres some of the plates in high rez    
    degenerates        comfy      i have my art desk behind me and the pc one in front with the chair in the middle its not ideal but i cant fit all my shit onto one surface and have it look good
  its hilarious how normies think that going to get fit and to gym is the solution for all mental shit         i do not like you at all but i am so proud of you that you are doing construction studies
  just 3 and 4
  i dont know how to color and painting on program is not like in real
  looks like jizz on the keyboard from the thumbnail
  youre female arent you
my corner apartment didnt come with any desk to work on so i figured id just use the coffee table and its overall a pretty comfy setup    the range murata poster is really great the eyes almost follow you so whenever i look at her it feels like shes cheering me on to work harder and ive been able to get a lot more shit done
  yeah sorry for the late reply
  are you talking to op or the poster you quoted
  poster i quoted i know op is that half jew
  hello fellow anon im really curious to know what state you live in totally not a government agent tho lol
  half jew tell me more about op
  why do you want to know and ill let you know not fbi
  forgot to mention why you want to know
  just miring that sick long mag
  it holds 31 bullets
  its hilarious how normies think that going to get fit and to gym is the solution for all mental shit  you forgot to take your happy pills this morning
  exercise is shown to reduce low levels of depression so if you have neet depression youll feel better but it wont do as much for real mental issues besides the endorphins it releases
  have you tried taking vitamin d supplements and getting a prescription from a psychiatrist made me stop wanting to kill myself seriously mate  reducing porn consumption to bare minimum helps too      i took mine  i started working out too but only after the medication made me want to work out before it was a chore i tried for a full year  its great that youre healthy anon
        how long have you been drawing seriously for
  /pol/  at least there is some good advice in this
all i need to get by
  these look very bad you need loomis
  holy fuck is this what peak comfy looks like
  one year off and on
  nah i heard anti depressants make it worse so im good      il but isnt loomis a meme like has there ever been a guy whos used it and actually made it
  yeah mindlessly copying shapes and drawing furries from memory will surely help you to improve faster than some well respected books because youre such a special depressed snowflake who has so much more to offer than anyone actually can comprehend
  ill try after work today and like i said before i wish there was a group on /ic/ heck id even pay a tutor from here
  everything you say just reinforces that you deserve to be as bad as you are artistically   where does the hubris even come from
  i dont think i have a dime anymore i dont even pride myself in art    i used to be friends with a guy was terrible at art and over the years hes improved were different in financial statuses but that didnt phase him i on the other hand got jealous      long story short i have an inferiority complex
might as well post mine
  just go on las or use plebbit art buddy discord
heres mine fellaz
  ill tutor you for cheap anon ill even give you a free trial period
  are you one of those sweatshop artists that kept in a dungeon on a budget
  post art i dont want to get memed
  no but thats a basement yes
  give me your discord ive legitimately been looking to take on students that are interested in learning fundamentals/life drawing

  is that the one with xnosebro if so it was nothing but shit posting
  no    nosebro was banned from our server months ago  we tried to reason with him
  las  way to intolerant wouldnt recommend it for anyone
  intolerant  oh boohoo you cant spam niggerniggernigger    if you want to be an annoying sperg with their head stuck up their ass theres always nosebros server

  i hear csp on ipad is 25 for a year  you can get a 6 month trial for free though    i ordered one too yesterday it wont be here till the end of the month update us on how csp runs on it
/ic/ tends to have pretty shitty tech builds  makes me think there needs to be a sticky to help bring people up to speed or that a guide should be added to the existing one its a shame that a lot of these digital artists here use the shittiest monitor that money can buy and do all their drawing with slow ass computers or janky gaming laptops
  tfw i still use a wacom cintiq companion hybrid despite android version does not go beyond 42  same applies for those getting old intuos and bamboo tablets either way if it still works without flaws then it should be ok temporarily

  its someone who brags about his gear and started posting pictures of his anime figures and set up then someone noticed the browning walls in the background and he explained that was from the spit when he had bouts of ngmi
  got a link for that tablet stand
  ngmi    oh that explains everything
  can you post your drawfee bg
      its this but i got mine at frys for a few bucks less      thats not a bg i just paused the video when i was taking the picture but heres a screenshot of it  you might need to edit it yourself to get rid of the grey  i had to time the screenshot when the player controls went away and the logo was still on screen id edit it myself but im about to head out
  oh i didnt realize that was the name of a youtube channel i thought it was just a random graphic thanks
  lol alienware
  heres what my setup looks like when im inking  streaming      i like everything about this especially stabilos and toothbrush  toothbrush  god dammit i couldnt find it yesterday when trying to clean my nibs and it was literally right in front of my face im retarded      nice inking stuff i see you are a man of taste just like me
  gib amazon link for crystal lamp pls
  im skinny as fuck and i cant sit on my knees or like the japanese do for long periods of time either    that shit hurts people that sit like that are subhumans
heres my setup    my partner sits to my side and to the right is my bed its a pretty small room but it is comfy to me     i really want to get some fgo figures to put on my tower
  nobody sits like that for desk work you sit with crossed legs like a normal human being do you wear suits 24/7 
  bought it from an artisan in guanajuato mexico i think they sell similar stuff online though it is made of quartz
  crossed   not propping up one leg like a woman    one leg master race if you say youve never done this youre a fag and a liar
  im talking about pic related  what are you on about
  thats not something that is done constantly or for long periods of time just like you dont wear a suit everyday
  dont the japanese people sit like that and pic related for long time though  its inhuman and hurts like a bitch
  anon cant sit like this    there no way youre not fat post pic of you you i fatass i get you have tons of fat under your leg preventing you from sitting like i the pic you posted
  im only 140 lbs
  is that a wacom or a huion
  ohhhhh  so youre a manlet
  that is a wacom
  no im 59
  so a manlet then
  my sides
  whats considered a nonmanlet
  im gonna find where you live and write my name on your prostate
  511 is king of manlets so youd need to beat that
  im 5 10 am i least better than the nonsitting manlet  
  510 and 59 tf is going on in here is drawing just something you do when youre a mini human
tutorsan never added me
  bold of you to assume you can reach my prostrate even while im lying down
  maybe cause y doont have a pfp
  tfw 5 9   us manlets have to make up for the ugliness we provide to the world with our art
  kekd
  whats pfp this is my first time using discord
  i imagine being in that room at the beggining of summer before junior year high school    streaming some kino tv show at med volume    your dad and mom in the house puttering around    your cat/dog sometimes walk in for scritches and snackies and nappies    all the while you are in those swimming moods where nearly every inspired brush and pen stroke lands in the best possible place and manner    the sun is shining through your comfy smelling room like golden light    no assignments    no deadlines    all relaxing and bettering that one idea you had in your life    props
    this hurts even more when youre skinny beause youre sitting on your bones stretching ligaments in on your knee caps cutting blood circulation by pinching veins and the fact that youre bearing weight either on hip bones or your crossed knees  japanese could not invent a chair thats why its rooted in the tradition its got nothing to do wih practicality they dont sit like that in the offices or any other professional setting that requires prolonged time  but why do i care for your knees youll feel it yourself when you get a little older
    its incredibly ironic you blame that anons inability to sit like the cold hearted japanese with his height when most japanese people are short as hell  by your logic shouldnt they be incapable of sitting like that for long
  humans have been sitting on their ass far longer than the chair has been invented for     chairs were the solution for cold places where you couldnt just sit on your ass because of loosing body temp and which slowly became the norm for everything but they are not the natural position for sitting in one place for prolonged amounts of time there is actually no natural position for that even staying completely horizontally is not good for you how many times have you woken up with back pains yeah i though so
  you honestly remind me of myself we are pretty similar but ive been getting over my issues recently    you seem like your in your early 20s aswell myself    add me on discord lets talk we can do text or voice call
  are you alright anon you wanna talk about it i know im a few days late and you probably left but if youre still around and you feel like you want to talk about your feelings ill be around until this thread dies
  op here ill add you on the way to work im currently eating breakfastwait are you the tutor      どようことなの
  not him but as time has gone by ive been using fewer and fewer layers and fewer and fewer brushes i started with using about fifty to eighty layers each layer with their own tiny detail  now i use two to three layers background midground and foregroundany extra details and i use two brushes plus the erase tool  i dont know if this is good or bad
  im sorry thats literally manlet sized as a rule of thumb manlets are under 182 cm  im so sorry
potential tutor here sent you request finally going to sleep now
  is that a cintiq pro 24
  what is the background image on the right

  winter exists and people who work indoors with windows that filters uv light plus everyone drives or has public transit to work no one hangs outside anymore
  youre not clever youre not unique youre a brat pining for attention by signaling how quirky and special you are all youre doing is refusing to type like everyone else by insisting on posting desu in all your posts if i could hate you enough that youd die i would do it if i could murder you in person i would do it because you really have not done anything besides this    the times ive been unfortunate enough to have stumbled across one of your posts in a reply to another post have always filled me with a visceral disgust thanks entirely due to your blatant and flagrant disregard for social cues so yes youre not cute youre the image board equivalent of a furry going   wags tail
  lol faggot desu
  oh well in that case youre not doing to bad just keep at it and dont ignore studies
  by insisting on posting desu in all your posts  lurk more
  winter exists   winter doesnt kill the sun unless you live in some real slav shitholes but indigineous people there have adjusted skin for this  and people who work indoors with windows that filters uv light   do you work in a sweatshop most people get food break great time to get some air  plus everyone drives or has public transit to work  open the window   no one hangs outside anymore  sounds like a personal problem
  newfag
i was able to find a nice mesh comp chair at my local angel view for 5 buk  feels fuggin good
  winter doesnt completely kill ot but it makes the sun spend less time in the sky plus more cloudy weather also induces weather caused depression in some people which will make them stay inside more  most people eat indoors because they arent thinking about the health benefits of the sun or anything and most use ac or fan in the car helps with drag and not having your face buffeted again most people arent gonna go hey i may be low in vitamin d lemme open the window even if people hang outside theyre not having picnics in full sun theyre going out to movies playing vidya with friends going to malls and other indoor stuff  im just saying in general people are less exposed to the sun m8 no personal problems
sorry for my gross ass mess
      how do you deal with this cluster fuck    this stresses me out just looking at it

  hi
  keybinds written on the wall  old and cutepilled
  dat horse  do you post your horses anywhere
  lol niggas can remember a shit ton of pokemon or porn stars name but cant remember key binds
  gerald is that you
  anon is grill
  what happened to the shelf
  wear n tear its old as fuck i grew up in this house parents passed it down to me
  girls on 4cham dont exist and even if they did theyre probably just trannies ugly bitches or lesbos
  reading this  girl  lesbo
  how does it feel to draw on your xppens screen
  you have poor taste in beverages but good taste in cute girls
  i like the shit that you posted on the wall its good
all those faggots arguing about tablets while being shityy artists  i started back in 2006 when i left college i had no money and could afford only genius 1200 i still have warm feelings about those years  i worked in industry and now live by selling merch and doing whatever job i can take  why low skill autists always shit on tablet choice like it actually means anything   none of those people who said lol genius is worst you cant learn to draw on it xd is an artist now   especially that smug cunt with cintique
cintiq 22 hd and just a normal pc that is mostly used to play jazz while i draw
  who    can confirm petty gay
  feel good man its a great value i removed the matte screen protector because it made the screen look bad in my opinion drawing with the artist glove feels natural theparalax but thats normal and im already adjusting      its a poster i got at walmart years ago hes a good horse      im new to digital and i find writing things down helps me remember i dont look at alot of the notes anymore also yes 35 but age has its advantages and disadvantages
i sit on floor
  mfw i fit two of these descriptions
  does the screen have a texture
  that looks real goddamn depressing  its clean but void of any personality apart from the degenerate weeb and memes on the screen of course
literally how do i learn human anatomy
  just fucking die
learn how to see
  try nma they has really good human figure courses
  brace yourself anon because this may be too much info for some    1 look at humans  2 draw them  3 learn to erase  4 repeat 13
not op but in the same boatfore arms and legs arent that bad niether are hips and pelvis but the trunk and upper arms and shoulders are very hard for me to study personally    the scapulae clavicles there is a lot of unexpected geometry in the trunk and clavicles and scapulae move and rotate in relation to the arms which i suck at learning and applying but mostly i just suck at drawing in general    honestly even basic proportions are hard to me to do from memory
by learning to draw boxes cylinders spheres and cones first
look at a mirror draw yourself
  wrong and dumb advice that no serious artist ever followed observation is key
get a couple of large mirrors  set them up  get naked  pose  draw
  learn gesture and draw from life till you draw good enough   then pick a book on anatomy if you want to go deeper
  look up proko on youtube he has some great vids
  this /thread
  look up croquis cafe on youtube and draw from their videos
  implying there are more humans inside my apartment  har har next thing you know youre going to suggest i go outside
  what im about to tell you is highly technical and will require an immense amount of cognitive capacity what the other anon told you was merely childs play are you ready if so proceed to follow these complicated tasks    somehow navigate to the website known as google using an internet browser on your pc  when prompted with a search bar type in humans posing  attempt to draw these humans in the various pictures  continue to do so until you become better at it  if you need any help contact your local ivy league university maybe the professors there will have advice
  see naked people
  didnt read the sticky
  theres surely gotta be a wrong way to go about drawing humans like that though right or do you seriously just look at them and attempt to draw them no matter the technique
  are you retarded or just shitposting
  look at humans  draw what you see    thats how i did it
buy an anatomy book    bridgman is good
                  bad answers            good answers
piggybacking off  and       
also this 
wow there are a lot of people who want to learn everything  ambitious
  everything  well yeah theres no genre option     i wanna be sci fi autismo lord supreme
these data mining threads should be against the rules
nice these are really interesting
  its because the categories are stupid my goal is to draw cute girls in cute backgrounds fucking garbage poll
  you cant focus on everything so it means they have no focus
  probably the best description of ic yet
  figure drawing  stylized  character design  stylized  manga  pick one
  im just interested how many ppl are on /ic but not this garbage like who fkin cares what every anon thinks and wants to do
  its an fbi datamining trap
  how do so many of you tolerate photoshops ui
  yeah i picked figure drawing stylized but there should be an option for cute anime girls
  its so they can blackmail you by telling your family you draw shitty anime if you ever conspire against the gobmint
  the ui is the best thing about photoshop i wish csp would be as easy to use because it seems superior for painting
  the current goal question was really lacking
  a girl made this poll
  no
  joblonek
  needs more ntp niggas
  10 years  14 votes  20 years  14 votes  did you anons make it or what
mfw i feel inadequate when a lot of folks use photoshop     two points when theyre a professional artist    then i realize pirates exist so i dont feel bad at all
hey guys i spent two hours working on my favourite character what do you think i should improve on
  a lot of things heres some in decreasing order of importance  youre still symbol drawing read the sticky and read loomis  anatomy do studies also more loomis hampton vilppu whatever will teach you anatomy better  your lines are quite ugly stop chicken scratching      
how does this make you feel
upvoted
well i mean he could be examining his cigarette/joint for all i care
  feel  what kind of faggot are you
you
  yeah except no
  i love the feeling of burning ash on my tongue
  lonely so lonely ive never had a gf or even kissed a girl before
nice drawing but did something happen    context pls
  yoshinaris drawing last stream took way longer and looked worse
  yoshinari  who
  yoh yoshinari character designer and animator at studio trigger
someone whose neuroplasticity hasnt started to rapidly decline beat someone whose neuroplasticity has been declining for decades
  not this meme again
    neuromemicity  i refuse to believe that my sorry as garbage self right now is going to be the best i ever will be go fuck yourself with that defeatist unscientific shit  if neuroplasticity was like this guy acts it is i would unironicly hang myself because id have nothing to live for anymore
  kim jung gi is like 43 and doing just fine
  oh damn the stream was today right    hmm maybe will /a or /ic will share again
why do people hate yoshinari so much
what did yoh draw for comparison
  akko from my little witch academia
  op why do you have such a hate boner for yoshinari who hurt you
op   do you have the psd file 
  because hes good and crab cant shit on him just because he does anime because he has a well defined neatlooking style    this one i think 
  huh like it doesnt look bad but its definitely outclassed a bit by the op picture like both are definitely great but the drawing of akko doesnt really have nearly the same weight and atmosphere to me
  i think it just comes down to experience with digital yoshinari is probably almost comfortable with a pencil and paper while the younger guy knows how to get the most out of digital
    art is a competition    ngmi
  also yoshinari probably taught the younger guy a lot of what he knows as well
  holy shit  yoshinari is literally genzoman tier  this nigger dabbed on him super hard
did anyone manage to download the vod
  based and redpilled      not really have you seen yoh yoshinaris other drawings dude made one drawing that is slightly better than one of yoshinaris drawings because he is more used to digital but yoshinaris whole body of work slams his into the ground also yoshinari is a better animator overall than this person
  cringe and bluepilled      he draws the same powerpuff girl over and over again hes mid tier at best
    the way he uses photoshop is almost painful to watch
leave him alone maybe he just had a bad day  you have offdays too right
  like i said have you even seen yoh yoshinaris other work he has drawn a few powerpuff girls a few years back but thats not all his work not even 1 of it take the time to actually look at his artbooks and you will see what i mean        true but he is not naturally a digital artist and has been learning how to adapt and use it
  holy shit he dabbed super hard the absolute state of nigger madman btfo owned xd lololol
  but yoshinaris drawing is way better than this
  i agree op is delusional
  wow a single image can that artist make animations didnt think so
  i didnt know yoshinari had to prove himself to crabs considering hes made it and has been in the industry for over 20 years next your gonna say masami ōbari sucks too    neck yourself op
  you know nothing here is a redline of the mistakes you are not seeing that yoh would not have made             based and redpilled
imagine actually thinking yoshinari is a bad artist i think crabs are just jealous of his talent
  im sure these people dont even know who yoshinari is just someone else to put below themselves i guess
  this  sees someone better than self  artist fucking sucks
  aaahhhhhhhhhhhhh give me linnnnnkkkk aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh iiiiivemissed it and i knew it was this weekend aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh give me linik spoileri am so lonely /spoiler
  download is in artbook thread
  this thread should be in /v
beginners see a beginner drawing and think it looks good  every time  might as well be harping on about the latest ron julia shitwreck being ohmygod can anybody top him good
  crabs sees a better drawing than he is capable of producing and the attention it draws and proceeds to call better drawings and the people who like it shit  every time
by the way this is the part where you ask me to post my work because thats the only defense idiotic fallacious twats like you folks can muster up 
  im not going to ask you to post your work because im not interested in looking at garbage right now maybe some other time
  yoshigrandpa is this mad   oh nonono hahahahaha
  can you post the good drawing
  and yet here you are in a thread where the op image is garbage how ironic 
yoshifaggot uses a legit copy of photoshop   draws like a toddler      this literal who uses medifuckingbang  literally cums inside yoshinari    muh gear muh programs   hahahaha eat shit richfags
  i have to wonder what you were thinking when typing this like genuinely i would love to see someones face as they sit in front of their keyboard looking up at their monitor typing something like this out of curiosity can you tell me how you feel after typing this
  like genuinely i would love to see someones face as they sit in front of the keyboard and monitor typing something like this  here you go
    is this a joke the akko picture is ten times better the op looks like mediocre fanart by comparison
  it is a joke yes  /ic/ is the punchline
  off model  blank expression  no perspective  literally no composition  beg tier colors    the akko picture is ten times better  really mate
  off model  blank expression  no perspective  literally no composition  beg tier colors  yes thats an accurate description of the op picture  add bad foreshortening bad anatomy and bad proportions and youre almost there    i mean whats the pose in the op even supposed to be it looks like shes sitting on something but theres nothing under her ass and she cant be crouching because her legs cant support her in that position
heres the pic by yoshinari i personally think its better not his best or anything both pieces are okay not sure why everyone is making it into some sort of competition seems a bit childish desu
  is there something wrong with the arm  feels awkward
  i bet you are from pol
  her foot is also awkward
  i have to wonder what you were thinking when making this like genuinely i would love to see someones face as they sit in front of their keyboard looking up at their monitor making something like this out of curiosity can you tell me how you feel after making this
  yoshinari is bad  why he has proven he is a compitent animator and director and all around artist    reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee he better than me so he is bad
  muh gainax muh meme shows  nigger yoshinari is a director cause he married a mega rich topdog producer fujo landwhale  he and imaishi are hacks stealing credit from the real talent   for example atsushi nishigori is the real topdog talent behind your favorite meme shows but you keep giving credit to literal faggots that cant even draw on model
  t never looked at any yoshinari sketchbooks / storyboards
  he is a director because he knows how to animate well it has nothing to do with who he married just go to 120 till the end of this video for proof 
  are you trying to tell me that the klk op sequence with literal hundreds of drawings of the camera going dynamically through all characters of the student council in perspective he did all by himself over the course of a couple days is hack shit    youre a literal retard if youre not trolling man you have to be a complete utter moron if you dont understand that design is not the core focus of animators and why not everyone and their mommas can just become animators even if they draw something that looks good which is an illustrators job the guy from the last stream is an inbetweener which really means the skillset expected from him at that point is closer to an illustrator than an animators and that is the same for atsushi imaishi and yoshinari even when not directing are in a position of giving flow and movement to scenes literally just watch flcl if you think imaishi not being the greatest draftsman affects his ability to convey action which is his actual job    i want to believe youre just trolling really bad but nu /ic/ has some really uneducated young kids and id rather bite the bullet and reply to bait than let this meme go unopposed right now
  the way he uses photoshop is almost painful to watch  why    true but he is not naturally a digital artist and has been learning how to adapt and use it  hes been digital since the 90s you mouthbreather
  hes been digital since the 90s you mouthbreather  source because weve literally seen him work primarily on paper instudio in the documentaries
  hes been digital since the 90s you mouthbreather  you can see him autistically working on paper in the lwa ova behind the scenes from 2015 though
  autistically  autism haha  you need to be 18 to use this site
  yoshinari just got btfo from a 23 year old trigger newbie
  tfw hard work  autism  fucking dumbass
  did that trigger you anon    they were 2 weeks behind in the schedule because yoshinari kept redrawing his shit over and over again because he didnt like tiny details the director of the project was visibly pissed and had to force him to give them his work so they all wouldnt get fucked   dont get mad over some random aword thrown in there i know hes working hard doing allnighters to complete the project and delivering the best possible product i wish i could be as passionate as he is
  oh no no no posting  /v/ is that way friend
  proportions are not right nned more loomis
  not that anon but you cant just become a director because youre good at animating while it can be a plus for demonstration and storyboard purposes a director requires a different set of qualities ones which are able to bear the weight of an project singlehandedly and elevate it to greater heights
  a director is somebody who can do the whole project on his own if he could clone himself or have enough time
noooooooooooo stop bullying muh meme artist he totally drew the entirety of gurren lagann all by himself
  you know that neuroplasticity means you can improve if you keep grinding right kim jung gi is better than ever because he draws daily i guarantee you yoshinari doesnt
  the yoshinari is clearly done by someone with far more experience the kids pic is good but theyre not on this level yet
a little art history  a cartoon ie the outline/ silhouette for the scene was done on cardboard in the 14 and 15 century in preparation for a painting  specifically for a fresco  the artist would draw the scene/ figures out in a simplistic manner poke holes in the cardboard along the lines they drew on and then take a bag of crushed charcoal and tap it along the lines dusting the fresco with the outline of the image  the italian word for cartoon is cardboard which is where we get carton in english from
  root word im kinda tipsey
i dont usually like art but i cried when i first saw this
  bacon was pretty awesome in the early years not a huge fan of anything beyond 1940 though
  i dont usually like arr  people who say this genuinely baffle me
  i get it i barely thought about or looked at art before i started drawing one can be basicly blind to it
  not all of us can be pirates anon
    im curious you as a person who hasnt really looked at art when thinking about it what do you make of this picture or other turner watercolors    it was made in 1840s by jmw turner and i feel it has a lot of fantasy quality to it i get butt load of tolkien vibes from it and it looks really calming all the light and soft colors transitioning from one to another
  this shit sucks tho wtf
  are you lying
  yeah
his style didnt always work he turned out some dross his stature in britain is probably definitely too high i dont dig one trick ponies really take chirico he gets derided for his gay horses but at least he went somewhere else with it i dont know
  britain really does treat some of their artists as national treasures some i would totally agree with bacon and hockney definitely not i like bacon early but after the boxed in people it sorta loses its punch
  britain really does treat some of their artists as national treasures  yes        some i would totally agree with  so do i    bacon and hockney definitely not  i do not agree
just
  to me its more that some british artists dont get their due to the detriment of the uk i look forward to the readjustment in stature of the 13000 canvas that is phenomenal it is so good some of it and hardly in the publics consciousness at all  it should be i think of damien really dont you think some of these dude/ettes deserve their time we could do it we could resay waht british art is and shove it down europs throat pain in the arse your art is such aa bastard tho damo huh
  thats a rare wojak
  gb has always been very provincial almost hermitlike when it came to the arts they had a very late start into newer movements beyond realism even the national museum didnt get itself past renaissance and old masters until well into the 1800s and even then only to buy even older paintings the beauty of that being that the british art world pumped out some of the most highly skilled traditional artists the bad thing being that it left a lag in the art world of gb being kind of overlooked for a really long time even though some of their modern contributions were among the best and most wellfounded evolutions from the past they spent so much time appreciating
  fascinating
  my view on british art is that its angry dirty and seems to be from the outside looking in  ralph steadman bacon and gerald scarfe especially but even lucian freuds work has this revolting appeal to it ive always felt that this was a subconscious cultural reaction to losing the empire once the imperial days were over and we gave all of the nations back we had to turn our attentions inward and we didnt really like what we saw the art reflects this misshapen horrors baying mouths and lumpy forms seem to take centre stage over the beautiful sweeping landscapes of the classical eras  this inner horror was probably what we were trying to escape by sailing off around the world     im not going to bring up a certain artist with the intials dh because hes not an artist hes a pompous idiot who got lucky when his work started being used for money launderers
  some freud work is unnerving in a subtle way there are other british artist from the period youre harking to that had a different outlook they are currently awaiting their revival
    hes mentally disturbed and i think he attracts people who have given into nihilism
  artists are either psychologically damaged or avoiding actual work usually
  well said sir
  it was very popular in the seventies
bacon slaps
have you seen the state of his google results its an outrage whos frank zhang
  t brainlet kike
why did he put arrows in his work is there any reason are there many arrow paintings
  the documentary really is touching
  most contact the general populace has with fine art is garbage mate the sooner you accept that the sooner youll see why people just dont care for artists as people much outside of the internet
  some people value art they do exist and then the popularity of francis art in his lifetime contradicts your statement they queued up around the block for his show also while im rambling drinking a 10 red the art market can be too greedy ordinary people should and can own original art imagine if the pubs we went to had original oil paintings and you could contemplate them quietly as you sit with an ale itd be heaven bringing the incredible back into ordinary lives i had a painting and i used to take to the pub and watch it by candlelight take it on the train and see the sun flicker across it  and it makes the paint live imagine if people could reconnect with oil painting as something alive in their lives painting does something in natural lights that no exhibition in a painted bulb lit room quite reveals buy a painting take it out with you move it about the house watch it as the sunrises and sets in the garden
13000 you could have a car thats worth 2500 in five years time or you could buy this painting only one exists youll pass it down in your family or sell it later and most probably itll keep its value the woman that made it really cared about it and its forgotten sitting in the back of a store room its such a special thing people could buy art again wed be made
margaretthatcherjpeg  its why i think galleries shouldnt be frightened of deaquisition let the paintings have their life again  and let the public rediscover them by being able to purchase it
where can i see this painting
  i had a painting and i used to take to the pub and watch it by candlelight  i started a drawing of you having a date with a painting but i was too bad so i dropped it the thought sounds pretty funny though although it does make sense to look at it in many different lighting situations
  it was a special time for me anything seemed possible not anymore still the next canvas thank you for the thought of the drawing very touching
i just got banned from upwork because apparently the fact that you have submitted a high number of proposals for jobs on our site without many contracts or earnings    man im so depressed ive been doing this for almost 10 years and this fucks locked the visibility of my account so i count get any more traffic to my profile well anyways enough with my blog rant     what other non meme alternatives are there to get work as a freelance illustrator
  i have a lot of upwork experience and have gotten some decent jobs off of it upwork is not a good site but you can occasionally find jobs that are diamonds in the rough if you have good relevant work and can communicate well then you can usually land the jobs that pay best     ive been doing this for almost 10 years  when was the last time you got a job how much have you earned total what are your reviews like     his fucks locked the visibility of my account so i count get any more traffic to my profile  this is a nonissue any sort of passive traffic to your portfolio from upwork searches should not be a concern as any meaningful worthwhile connections will come from you bidding on a jobs     theres a few likely reasons youre not getting jobs it could be one or several of these  1 from what i can tell your english is not the best this is a major issue   2 your work might just not be very good  3 you have bad reviews  4 youre applying randomly for jobs  jobs that are not relevant to your portfolio of work you should not be applying to jobs where you dont have similar previously completed work that you can share with the client as an example of how you can complete the job   5 your proposals are not good copy/pasted proposals are a sure way to get overlooked proposals that dont actually respond to the design brief will be overlooked proposals that are vague and poorly written will get overlooked     what other non meme alternatives are there to get work as a freelance illustrator  upwork acts as a rather useless  expensive middleman in freelancing the most effective way to get work as a freelancer is to simply cut out the middleman and connect with potential clients directly consolidate your work into a cohesive professional portfolio and reach out to clients to pitch your services  clients that you have researched and that you honestly think could use your work
  would you elaborate more on why upwork is no good other than the fact that they take a cut i suppose    im currently working on a portfolio and i plan on finding work on that website at least as a start can you give me any tips thanks
  clients that you have researched and that you honestly think could use your work    not op but where exactly i can find them
also a freelance illustrator reporting in running dry on comissions this month i just send out my cv and portfolio to agencies i like on the web never tried upwork is it any good how do you get paid with it    also i am feeling you bro when work suddenly runs out i dont know what to do with myself just send emails drink wine and cry myself to sleep
    would you elaborate more on why upwork is no good other than the fact that they take a cut i suppose  is it any good  id wager 95 of the jobs are trash low pay bad clients but so are 95 of the freelancers low skill unprofessional if you are friendly thoughtful and attentive in your bids and your work is good and versatile then you will definitely land regular illustration gigs     yes the cut they take sucks 20 on your first 500 with a client then 10 on payments higher than 500 a big issue is that a lot of clients go on it and demand more work than theyre willing to pay for it ie i need fully illustrated 20page comic book  budget is 150 good jobs that pay well are rare and within that small pool of good jobs you also have to have a relevant style  work to show    the folks who moan and complain about it being impossible to land gigs on upwork are either  1 lowskill artists with no unique style   2 terrible awkward  generally unprofessional communicators  3 copypasting generic pitches instead of really reading and responding to the clients needs  4 applying to jobs that their style is not appropriate for    youre also at a huge advantage if you live in the us as you can apply to us only jobs which often pay much much better than global jobs     also  is that you pyros0me youre my favorite artist on /ic/      out in the world from this day forth keep a keen eye for illustration or whatever it is you do that is published out in the world record the names of the business that published the work  work that is similar to what you do and simply reach out to them via email to share your portfolio site youd be surprised how far a friendly introductory email expressing your interest in working with them can get you easy to do hard to get results theres a lot of rejection / noreplies but the right work shown to the right person at the right time will yield results
  ah fuck im in the no good 3rd world shithole country canada
  yea its me thank you anon   that doesnt sound all that bad i looked at the rates on the website and the lowest i saw was 20 per hour i already charge less than that living in eastern europe is still relatively cheap regarding the payment i was mainly asking because every month i have a client or two who i cant get to pay on time is it ever a problem on upwork what kind of gigs are you getting from it i dont have one unique style in my portfolio mainly cause every brief i get starts with a style reference from something already made before    think im gonna try to set up a dribbble this week and if it doesnt work ill keep upwork in mind
      upwork has been trash for a while now op its not you its them
  the lowest i saw was 20 per hour  a quick tip worth mentioning is that you should only focus on fixedprice jobs hourly jobs on upwork are a joke you can set search filters on upwork  i like to set them to fixedprice only 250 minimum weeds out a lot of trash jobs and exploitative clients    regarding payment  its probably the only positive of upwork they act as a middle man when starting a job the client funds the milestones youve set up i usually just do milestone 1 deposit milestone 2 delivery of final work when you reach a milestone you can request client to release the funds of the milestones over to you if they give you issues and youve kept up your end of the job then upwork will help you out its a pretty wonky system but it works the funds transfer over to your bank after a few days     what kind of gigs are you getting from it  varies from simple 1off illustrations for projects again minimum 250 to large projects composed of more detailed illustrations or a series of smaller illustrations my best paying job was around 3k creating 50 simple illustrations that took me about 2030 mins each 60 per drawing other jobs include creating cover art for albums an illustrative spread for a large printed product a portrait for some medical association instructional figure drawings among others i continued working with some of these clients off upwork    i dont have one unique style in my portfolio mainly cause every brief i get starts with a style reference from something already made before  you seem to have a really great unique style based on your instagram its honestly one of the more commercially viable styles ive seen on /ic/ on upwork i avoid all jobs that ask to match a style different than my own i only apply to jobs where my style of illustration is appropriate and i explain in the proposal why id be a good fit     dribbble  dribbble is not a great source of freelance work
nice thread bumbiti bump whit this nice pic
  is that from peep show or something else i thought i watched it all but dont remember that
  yea stop drinking milk and dont eat for one month thats what jesus did an he made it to the cros but still
  thank you anon this is very very helpful    opinions on dribbble vary when working at a studio we never got any inquiry from dribbble and i thought it was kinda useless then i collaborated once with a girl who actually had an interview published on dribbble blog and she said most of her gigs were from there by saying its not a great source do you mean that the projects are shit or that its less likely to get comissioned at all    as for the works on my instagram i never used that style professionally happened to me twice that a client said wow really like your instagram sure you would do a great job on this project i have and then they requested something completely different pic related for example the thumbnails in my portfolio look like theyre all made by different people thats why id like to use dribbble as my business card page  as in come see my beautiful and stylistically consistent dribbble shots and if you wanna see more visit my mess of a portolio website    anon you seem a bit more experienced in freelancing im having downtime for the first time since i started in june what do you normally do when you dont have comissions money isnt an issue but i wish i could use this time as efficiently  as possible
just email potential clients directly retard
  sure thats what i do man im so desperate for them replies i check the analytics on my website all the time for example sent a link to one studio in sweden got 4 hits from stockholm 3 yesterday 1 today what are they doing up there i wonder no response from them but they visited my website from 4 different devices fuckin swedes
  artstation is pretty cool
  i suppose this works but for me i always feel like id bother people thinking that if they want artsits for a specific job theyll just ask for it on sites like these classified ads etc  also that itd get lost in a tons of other mails anyway  but ive always had the same noskill job so i suck at this
  not that anon but could you define commercially viable    this board is so specific to anime/concept and i really dont know how to make a portfolio for illustration
  regarding dribbble  im just speaking to my own experience  keen observations id imagine that if you somehow got featured or if you put in the large amount of work it takes to get towards the top pages of the searches something that will take a lot of effort to do then youd see some sort of return though i just dont see it being a reliable  steady source of opportunities unless youre a prominent member of the community     did you make those food illustrations i honestly dont see that being that different from your more expressive work at all  there are many recognizable similarities looking at your insta  tumblr i think theres a lot more cohesiveness than you might think from an outside perspective it all definitely looks like the work of one artist    id recommend cleaning up your portfolio site and if you want to show your work to someone just link them to that cleaning up your portfolio might involve getting rid of work that you might enjoy but still doesnt really fit into the bigger picture its okay if theres some variation but the more cohesive the better when i do a job i often ask the client what pieces in my portfolio they like  that way i know the exact look  approach theyre looking for     what do you normally do when you dont have commissions  i personally do a few things the 1 thing i do is create more personal work for my portfolio i might submit to an art competition i reach out to businesses that i think could be potential clients as  so eloquently put i might work on my passive income prints etc ill likely just play copious amounts of rocket league  csgo     cont below
  reaching out to people does work you are not bothering people when you do so your goal when reaching out to people is very simple make yourself known show them what you can do and express your interest in working with them in the future it does not have to be a long winded email and you do not have to bullshit them just a simple friendly introductory email can do wonders     its a bit of a numbers game  theres a balance between quantity how many emails you send out  quality how relevant / useful your work  style is to the business youll likely not hear back from most people you reach out to that is completely fine and totally normal however some will some may respond and say they enjoy your work and will keep you in mind that is a great outcome its very rare that youll get a job right there on the spot instead think of it as planting a lot of seeds the more potential clients you show your work to the more chances one of them grows and blossoms into an opportunity    the great thing is that it gets easier the more you do it in 3 ways  1 sending the emails becomes less  less scary  2 more successful opportunities leads to more published work in your portfolio which makes it easier to land other work  3 a happy client could become a repeat client a repeat client will continue sending you occasional work meaning youre getting more paid opportunities without actually having to do any more promotion / put in any effort if you land several repeat clients then the next thing youll know is that youve got a steady stream of full time work knocking on your front door     but in order to do all this you have to just reach out to people waiting around to be discovered on the internet is a passive approach that relies far too much on sheer luck take luck out of the equation as much as possible  be proactive in your self promotion it sucks to do but it is effective    also  thanks for the instagram comment last night 
how much would i need to pay someone to draw maps for a project im working on
  you are not bothering people when you do so  you can be though i have gotten people emailing me aiming for my position due to them not knowing i also handled the emails
    yo ronan i am saving those replies for future reference this is great and i really appreciate you writing all this for me and other anons to learn from    some of it ive already figured in the past 5 months freelancing i used to have 4 regular clients i dropped 2 already because they take ages to pay and im getting really pissed at this point its been two months thats why im seriously considering upwork because i hate being in this position    another thing i learned from my experience thus far is that connections are everything so far all the clients i got chose me at least partly because they knew the studio i once worked at the most effective connections i got so far are with people that my past employer either recommended me to or that once collaborated with them its quite ironic because working there in itself was sheer nightmare    although i hate to abuse your kindness would you please answer one more question how do you approach your clients about publishing rights i cant even make my portfolio site public yet because some projects are too recent i keep it under a password but really wish i could put it more out there did you ever have clients who didnt let you publish i once had an argument over it with a client it was a studio and eventually they said i could publish but only stating that i made it while working there fulltime as they didnt want to disclose that they hired a freelancer for that project o_o
  there is no single right answer to this it could range from low hundreds to high thousands depending on what its for the complexity the map and the artist working on it among many other factors      absolutely not abusing at all  i really enjoy sharing ask whatever its also helpful to me as it helps me organize my thoughts  identify positive proactive actions someone can take to push their career forward  things i also need to remember to do on a regular basis    regarding publishing rights in this context sharing the project you completed online  im afraid i cant really help you there theres been a situation or 2 where ive signed an nda for some stuff and the project got canned and i wasnt supposed to share it and i didnt beyond that ive never had a completed job where i couldnt share it online the moment it was published not just completed by me but published by the client ive thankfully never really worked with cranky or difficult people before     the clearest and most effective way to work this out is to do so before the job even begins via a contract contracts dont have to be super complex  its just laying out what has been discussed and what you  the client are agreeing to do licensing  publishing rights should have at least some mention of how the work is to be used for a lot of projects theres a full transfer of rights over to the client with the exception of the artist retaining the right to share the work as part of their portfolio / self promotion though thats always something worth double checking with them  id imagine most people are perfectly fine with the artist sharing the work in their portfolio once the project has been finished / published out in the world
bumping    this is great    how else do you promote yourselves freelance anons
  whats your insta not sure it was me that commented    but thanks for all the infos youre a good person taking time to answer all of this
  whoops  that was meant for the other guy in this thread happy that its helpful regardless my own stuff is 
  how else do you promote yourselves freelance anons  a lot of people swear by good ole fashion postcards put your best piece on the front links and a short handwritten note on the back     connecting with art directors on instagram is a great way to get on their radar as well if i stumble upon one that i like ill follow their work and like a few of their relevant posts they might follow me back and now theyre getting direct periodic exposure to your work which strengthens the connection between you and them so that when the time comes to directly reach out to them they already know who you are which is invaluable     posting on reddit can work well  especially if youve made a piece of fan art that you want to share /r/art is useless and does not allow promotional links back to your blog you have to share your work on other large subreddits that your work might be relevant to for example  made some video game fan art consider sharing it to that games subreddit as well as /r/gaming with links back to your blog in the comments     getting a real portfolio site is real important where you can curate a gallery full of your best stuff instead or a mish mash of everything youve done on a blog     once you get big enough you can get an art agent if you want to handle all the promotion you need and feed you a steady stream of high paying high profile work though they almost always look for artists who already have their shit together
  getting a real portfolio site is real important  i dont get that i thought traditional sits would be outdated for this what difference does it make if you have a site rather than a well organized tumblr or somehing    i know how stupid that might sound but nowadays people are all on social media and sometimes id rather check one of those rather than a site which i think are serious just by tradition but actually not that relevant    but clearly i dont knwo shit
  a lot of people post wips and sketches on social media in order to game the algorithms and get more attention but stuff like that isnt necessarily going to look great in a professional portfolio honestly i think its important to have both a wellrun social media presence in order to gain attention for yourself as well as a wellcurated portfolio site you can direct clients to something thats composed mainly of finished pieces thatll give them a better idea of what sort of work you could offer them
     honestly i think its important to have both a wellrun social media presence in order to gain attention for yourself as well as a wellcurated portfolio site you can direct clients to  this is how i see it too both are important and serve different purposes     your portfolio site  this is your curated gallery of work that you would show to people you want to sell your services to it gives the best overview of your best work a portfolio site doesnt often get passively discovered unless you direct someone to it    your social media sites  these have multiple purposes one of the most important being that your blog can help extend the reach of your work it is a vehicle for widespread mass promotion and passive discovery plays a big role it can act as a more casual gallery of your work featuring wips shots sketches etc as well as lifestyle shots to see what type of person is behind the work
  no tumblr is as well organized as a simple gallery/grid of images on a website that you make people dont want to waste their time simple links to portfolio and contact are much more attractive to most clients than a blog

any advice on what kind of email name is for business best like i was thinking making myartistnamebusinessemailcom or i have been seeing things like contactmyartistnameemailcom on instagram i want to make it both professional looking for any studios that would want my stuff but not too formal if one of my followers would want a commision any advice
  i personally use firstname  firstnamelastnamecom i have my own domain  gmail linked to it    i good variation i often see is johnsmithartemailcom or something with art or illustration i think business just doesnt really fit
  any advice on how to handle contracts ive been working on upwork for a while now and recently began to pick up speed and just the other day i get my first direct client but i dont yet know too much what im doign i nregards to contracts  sorry if its a dumb question but i thought it might be helpful to ask since i guess most people here are looking at getting direct clients
  not a dumb question at all  will answer in full when i get the chance
  a contract really doesnt have to be that complicated all it is is an outline  review of what has been discussed so that you can both agree to it     ive attached a contract i generally use with a sample project described it fits on 1 page covers everything you generally need to and just sort of recaps what is expected to be done by both parties really straightforward i just plug and chug the relevant information
damn the rest of /ic/ is arguing about loomis and anime while the big shots are talking about big jobs and big money in here
  theres many different people on /ic/ that are at many different stages of their own art journeys monetizing their work is not on the radar of a lot of people here but rather continuing to improve their own craft until they get to a point where they feel comfortable to do something with it some folks here dont even want to make a career of this stuff  which is also totally fine
  hi op i am an artist as well that isnt super great at drawing but has decent 3d skills and 2d sketches i was wondering and this applies to anyone reading this if anyone here would be interested in freelance work that involves drawing basic sketches up imagery needed for my project i am self funded never hired anyone before but am interested in knowing what prices you guys are willing to work for the jobs would be paid per piece and you would most likely be drawing items and small imagery concept art doesnt have to be super detailed but it needs to be something i can utilize to create tangible assets myself i can do some of the leg work but i cant hire anyone who only draws stick figures please let me know what kind of pricing you guys are working for or want/accept thanks if im not in the thread perhaps reply with a throwaway email
  hmu  throwmeawaycockli
  can i make money on upwork or related sites by drawing anime though
  genwerally speaking no     i have seen occasional listings for anime commissions though they are usually very poorly paid personal commissions and have a shit ton of competition for them anime art is just not a lucrative area of illustration and theres an overwhelming amount of supply for the relatively low commercial demand of it

looking for critique on my pixel art clouds im trying to work with different light sources and saturation but i feel like the more i practice the worse my clouds are getting first is top left second is top right third is bottom on the third one im trying to make it seem like its in the background
learn to draw  youre adding random rim lighting in the third without having any fucking clue as to what rim lighting is  working with different light sources doesnt mean whatever your beginner mind thinks it does
  cool thansk
  what rim lighting you fucking moron you have to be one dumb motherfucker to chastise another anon while simultaneously not knowing basic art terminology ngmi and kys
  can you not see that shit on the third cloud attempt  you have to be /beg/ as fuck to try be angry while also being blind
  i see a very subtle attempt at bounced light which you can observe on any real life cloud you smooth brained retard or is your worm infested brain too primitive to conceptualize reflected light
i have a ugee 1910b and my edges are relatively crisp on the tablet but when i upload them they look super blurry whats going on here
the gamma on your shitty tablet is probably blown out more than your shitty attempt at anatomy is
  wow that is some alien pussy monster not sure if i should feel aroused or scared
gd  g
  thanks lol its hentai anatomy     is that some sort of gamma setting
  thanks lol its hentai anatomy  its bad is what it is in every way shape and lack of form  just post your questions in the beginner threads next time will ya
  why would beginners know about tablet settings
  anon flip your canvas and use some references id say the most glaring thing is the size of her massive vagina study real anatomy from life you dont have to stop drawing for fun but spend at least 20 minutes a day going over your trouble spots you are going to kill everyones boners with anatomy and perspective like this

i want to learn about painting  but for me its like classical music something that seems hard to get into    so a few questions which might sound a bit stupid considering that a i have not general knowledge and b enlish not my first language      what are the current movements if any  who are some stars of modern painting     is traditional painting still alive what kind of market is it small/niche for rich people im not talking about hobbyists     how does one start painting any beginner recommanded techniques how different/harder is it compared to drawing     once you have something to sell how does it go is it true that its basically about who you know and that the quality doesnt matter that much sometimes or is it a stereotype     how do you go about analyzing paintings like pic related in a more classical illustration you could talk about the composition story it tells etc etc   is it just like experimental/noise music something visceral that you cant analyze much i assume the strengh of this kind of painting is that anyone can feel different about it    lastlytalk about anything painting related beside those questions
asks about painting  posts this shit
is traditional painting still alive  alive for hobbyists somewhat for professional   what kind of market is it   very very small for a pro basically as you said rich people invest in art unless your in a art heavy city most gallery artists i know work a day job   how does one start painting  read the sticky  once you have something to sell how does it go  horrible unless you know rich a rich person that wants to buy it or a gallery thatll display it trad art has never been an real option for the masses    most modern art i see in galleries is pretty shit muh emotions pieces if you wanna start painting like op pic related then just grab some paint and vomit on a canvas if want to learn how to create something other than a mess of color i recommend stating at /beg/  also if this is the kind of art you want to do /ic is not the place for you most people here do digital art and suck the dicks of the old masters so youll probably have better luck somewhere else
   what are the current movements if any  i honestly dont know i did get a rumour theres a new ism going around    who are some stars of modern painting  its a lot of people that are coming to the end of their careers richter is 86 hockney probably has his best days behind him new art stars are once a week really from following artnet news there is a glut of midcarer artists you want to barge past them of course      is traditional painting still alive     it is to my mind its new artists reacting off of the midcareer and established artists as is usual all to play for     what kind of market is it small/niche for rich people im not talking about hobbyists  no idea its whatever you can get you want a gallery and a contract and access to their black book or get together with your generation or set yourself apart and go it alone      how does one start painting any beginner recommanded techniques   buy paint kit get on with it join a local art group  how different/harder is it compared to drawing    depends what you want out of it you want to be titian its all of your life you want to make pop or modernism  just go for it     once you have something to sell how does it go  results vary     is it true that its basically about who you know and that the quality doesnt matter that much sometimes or is it a stereotype  it can feel like that to people outside and it is sour grapes it can still be inspirational if youre on the inside it propably seems a lot different you dont get the resale baby     how do you go about analyzing paintings like pic related     how many more are there of these  error comment too long  hth
    what are the current movements if any  there are no movements anymore that died with modernism what you have now is contemporary art which is a broad term  who are some stars of modern painting  depends on what you mean but there are some that are getting sucess like luc tuymans marlene dumas christopher wool wilhem sasnal alex katz peter doig albert oehlen    once you have something to sell  usally you have to know people the art market is very small now and galleries cant afford buying paintings from unknown artists so you have to suck dick in other to make money   how do you go about analyzing paintings like pic related   thats a richter so you have to understand what he did before those paintings he painted hyperrealistic paintings based on photographs and then destroyed them in a way they were about surface about imagery history and about paint itself the abstracts are about the same thing but done in a more agressive way
   the art market is very small now  the progressive globalisation of the contemporary art world over the two decades straddling the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st witnessed biennials and art fairs mushroom across the globe
  luc tuymans marlene dumas christopher wool wilhem sasnal alex katz peter doig albert oehlen  except for wool those are the artists i kept posting about when people on here claimed that painting is dead and degenerate these days  seems like it caught on cool
  the art market is very small now  id disagree in fact it has never been bigger than it is today and most of all painting is still at the top despite performance art being pushed since the 50s as the most hip and political and therefore most interesting art of the present day but i would add that performance art has also gotten old and unlike paining its essential form is paradoxically way more limited than the flat surface of the canvas because performance art is confined to space and time and if it is documented it exists in another media video text sound so performance is ephemeral which has its own appeal but i kind of get the feeling that it will grow old and gain the label of entrylevelarteducationfuckery in a few years time     so yeah the art market is flourishing but the conditions are changing most of all globalisation and networking are key issues that any artist has to keep an eye on today
   as bad as in no better than the /ic meme face painter if they are even different people  gldgxgkgcog9y  yc
  the art market is very small now and galleries cant afford buying paintings from unknown artists    kek the art market was feed up with jews and their art trade scams and went to the parteon/facebook/etsy/instagram/pixiv the people dumped the big art because 87 of all art trade is about fucking scams and tax heavens    normal people are now following the main idea that it will be better to finance an artist directly than watch some fuck telling me what is in and out
how does that work then
  gldgxgkgcog9y  yc  metoo
  i ran out of effort for it
i suppose it needs its context
  what are the current movements if any  memeschlock my dude  is traditional painting still alive   gonna be a resurgence   how does one start painting any beginner recommanded techniques   i started by doing cut out transfers to canvas then graphite transfers to canvas and currently grid transfers to canvas     i also started with the cheapest paints canvas panels brushes etc also started small with 8x10s then started esploring into different canvas sizes as i started to get a scents of the whole thing   how different/harder is it compared to drawing  same same but different   once you have something to sell how does it go is it true that its basically about who you know and that the quality doesnt matter that much sometimes or is it a stereotype  yeah like if you got friends or acquantences that just want to be able to flex about owning original art and theyd like to think theyre supporting you you could probably get away will pictures of literal shit     but at the same thyme if nobody else cares about you and everyones a critic so you generally have to do something neat if you care about appealing to strangers  how do you go about analyzing paintings like pic related  its a feels painting that can add life and texture in a lot of different types of space  is it just like experimental/noise music something visceral that you cant analyze much  you can analyze the color choices the nature of the brush strokes the color locations in the frame the emotions it elicits and then theres always art history lore and its influences or whatever     lastlytalk about anything painting related beside those questions  just do it lean into impulses and set out knowing youre more than likely going to make a bunch of shit put more pride in the effort itself than the outcome
its all really bad painting
really l freud is a lot more better than all of the art here
  define better  or better yet make a direct comparison between any given piece in this thread and a specific lucian freud painting
  define better  better adj comp of good superior  more profitable  more suitable  larger  greater  more  improved in health quite recovered  b half coll wife  better adv comp of well in a superior way
  ok heres that same point for your dumbass to stop deflecting define why lucian freud is a better painter than marlene dumas
  i dont need to i can tell by looking at them and if youre so anxious to say blue is green thats your business good day
      makes a ludicrous claim comparing apples and oranges  called out for it  chickens out    yeah i thought so
  luc tuymans marlene dumas christopher wool wilhem sasnal alex katz peter doig albert oehlen  googled those 90 of what ive seen looks really unskilled and not particularly interesting to me if they were nonames to start a career on social media they would probably never become big names  yeah i know the comparison is weird
  look everyone  we have an art expert over here  with the ultimate socialmediameter
  damn its like i forgot to say the comparison was weird  but since it was about popularity and about painters being popular just because theyve been pushed by friends i thought there was something to note here if like everyone says you need contacts to succeed in painting which is still illustration then all i was saying is i would be curious to see how those guys that unless make me change my mind have nothing really special would do without the help of anyone  i might also miss something about their art but ive seen more interesting in a lot of digital paintings
  peter doig one of the most famous painters of this day and age  if they were nonames to start a career on social media they would probably never become big names
  but ive seen more interesting in a lot of digital paintings  please for the sake of the argument post the best you can conjure up im really excited to see your excellent taste
  doig is the only good ones good luck defending the others
  marlene dumas one of if not the top living female painters luc tuymans distinct historical themes and faded painting style world class as well as all the others albert oehlen contemporary of martin kippenberger dead and sigmar polke one of the best known german painters wilhelm sasnal part of the gruppa ladni polish painter with international exhibitions alex katz major solo shows around the world christopher wool dont know about him  literally all of these artists paintings sell for six figures     show your excellent digital art pieves
  controversial
why is this place so angry    inb4 some hostile remark
i dont know
  4chan
  artists are generally terrible people whove had their ego inflated by normies growing up to realize the world is saturated with artists more talented than them and even when they get closer to their goal they realize that the artists they strove to be more like are still terrible people and likely mentally ill
  artists are generally sensitive people     also people treat others like they would treat themselves you cant categorize all artists with one specific type of asshole that shit posts on 4chan becasue he got his feelings hurt       because its 4chan what a silly question
  as one specific type of person
cuz its 4chan  the place is angry even by 4chang standards lurk some more on other boards
  yeah the other boards are more playful with the mean shit they say and none are as vicious as /ic/
most of the people here are incapable of making art and are therefore incredibly bitter about anyone who shows even the smallest ability
  not true    a lot of good artists lurk here you have no idea
    /djt/ on /jp/ is just like /ic/ i call them sisters
  i said most not all    sounds like youre part of the most
  people who are insecure about their art skill and frustrated at how slow growth generally is  there are racists and people who hate women for some reason  these are the main reasons why its so angry
  /djt/ is comfy what are you talking about   出来ない
  anondont get sassy with me
i am a very damaged person and an attention whore
  positivity has no place on 4chan
  wow ive been lurking here to learn things and nothing said here sounds that awful people are not really nice thats how tgey are and an honest opinion is always better
idk man i always thought of this place as one of the nice boards i visit
  because if it wasnt it would be a circlejerk where criticism doesnt exist
  because nice people are fake niceness is a tool for con artists to extort something for their benefit be it money or fame
  who hurt you
because the people here are more interested in tearing down successful artists for doing things wrong so that they can feel better about themselves than they are in actually improving their own work
  yikes
  how old are you
  because literally most people here have become bitter from grinding loomis for 20000 hours and still drawing like a middle schooler while 14 year old koreans that draw just for fun style all over them in both anime and realistic paintings
  i go out of my way to call in on /ic/ every now and again  when i do i go through a few threads and just wish people a good day or give them encouragement etc   in all honesty i do it more to the people who are being particularly vitriolic with their criticism   reason being is that its likely that they themselves have an unpleasant life or lifestyle   if they feel more positive in their own affairs then they will hopefully present their critiques in a more positive manner     i think people tend to forget that there are actual human beans on the other side of the screen   no need to be a dick to people when you can be nice for the same amount of effort     also people forget that art isnt a competition sometimes its better to just let people plateau   they may just be happy where they are and thats not necessarily a bad thing
  heres some genuine niceness since i get nothing from this nor want anything from you  i hope your next meal is really tasty   and i hope you feel hydrated and refreshed today
  yikes indeed who thinks like that
  based african cat poster
  /jp/ is unironically the nicest and most pleasant board on this entire website
  tfw can draw but i cant render how can i learn to render
that thot audit got me thinking arent artist who get their income through patreon and commissions in the same boat as camgirls when it comes to the irs and the like
  no how the fuck do you hide patreonbux even thot cosplayers pay their taxes from patreon
  why the fuck would the irs go come after some neet that doesnt even make 10k a year to pay taxes in the first place
graffiti generals first thread    this thread is for the discussion of graffiti styles famous pieces history terminology and general discussion    what is graffiti and its history      how do i get started in graffiti where can i get tutorials        where do i go to buy quality graffiti/spraypaint/caps/etc and read reviews        i have other questions  
kingspray vr is a lot of fun  and it isnt illegal
a few months back some anon posted a french book about graffiti  what was the name
what does /ic/ think of harley brown
flawless
good one of his books seems like a cool dude
one of the most valuable instructional authors thats never mentioned here
oops the sage was leftover from illustrat thread
  whats good about his instructionals
one of the things he said makes me think  he says that he believes that design composition determines to a greater degree the success of a drawing/painting moreso than color value even draftsmanship
  its design oriented mainly for artists whore already skilled but lack in design fundamentals     thats not his point the entire premise of the book is that color and value choices and composition are design and those design decisions are what make great art

pixar requires a college degree for employment  dropped
  they say that to deter no experienced losers like you you dont need a college degree
  just try getting into nickelodeon or cartoon network they accept high school graduates
  dude just make ur own film    do it cause u love it not for the money
  industry animator here you really dont need a college degree if your reel/portfolio is good enough having said that pixar and disney have hardons for big art schools and regularly recruit top students as interns which then might become full time or project based employees     if youve worked in the industry long enough and have a pro reel/portfolio pixar and disney will definitely hire you
    why would you want to work for current year pixar anyway they keep rehashing old movies
tfw this is your 95 on google arts  culture
  this every fucking movie from them looks the same
  do you think this guy has a perfect body for disgusting ntr porn
upcoming movie toy story 4  currently done movie is incredibles 2  huh theyve got way too many sequels and the recent originals are pretty meh
  i know an accounting graduate girl who works as background painter you dont need art degrees for pixar
  is this image a real painting i feel like its an edit
  implying any autist on here has a marketable portfolio or any job in the industry
  is it easier to get into smaller animation studios cold submitting a portfolio i dont really know anyone that could refer me or have professional experience coming from a non art industry or should i just focus on networking through conventions/social media and become a known quantity that way
  didnt cory loftis get hired for zootopia despite dropping out of art school in his 2nd semester  not to mention according to him he decided to become an artist rather late in life and hadnt had any prior aspirations to work in the entertainment idustry
  working at pixar  that sounds like hell
  protip never work in any art industry period art/animation becomes soulless the moment its operated like a machine just go independent
  if you have a degree it shows that you have the ability to commit yourself to something
  network as much as you can hit up animation conventions and make connections ctnx in burbank is a good one put together a professional clean portfolio or reel and show recruiters they are usually around the studio booths and can give you really good advice even if you dont get in
  ill never understand why people say dropped as if they ever had even a remote chance of picking up the thing that they are now claiming to have dropped
  i saw something on reddits personal finance sub yesterday inb4 plebbit that said that you have the likeliest chance of getting an interview with a company if you meet 50 of their job requirements go for it anon good luck 
  not op but thanks for sharing that
    as in 50 is better than 100 if so whys that do i look tryhard if i am too good of a fit lol
  idk why but if you have 50 you have slightly more of a chance to get an interveiw than if you have 90 or greater     apparently its why you should still apply to those starter jobs that require 3 years of experience      glad to help 
bump
  why do you want to be a wage slave anyway
  i believe its because if youre too qualified theres a greater chance you can get headhunted or just up and leave for a better job    if you are mostly qualified they know they can at least bring you up to speed and youre more likely to stick around because you dont have better prospects
  that and they dont actually want to pay someone market rates for being qualified the amount of entry level jobs where they want 5 years experience for less than 30k are disgusting
      this actually makes me feel a lot better about my prospects thank you anons  i was super worried because i only ever worked on 2d mobile games and most job offers now require 2d plus 3d plus animation on top of inhouse experience  but if i can just be taught one of those throughout work then it might be fine after all
  literally just meet a recruiter show them some of their work theyre going to sugoi over it and be on the lookout for your application/give you precedence over randos   i mean if you were actually good enough in the first place that is
  t normie brainlet response  as if anyone learns anything from the talentless professors in college im in a state college right now not one of my art professors has ever done a demo and they no place to see their work i have seen their work though on their facebook pages and its basically highschool level dogshit mostly abstract im literally learning everything from old books like famous artists courses and jeff watts on youtube
  did you even check out the schools program before you applied you might have seen the level of work of the faculty beforehand and saved some time and tuition
hey /ic/ help me pick an object for my research paper     this assignment invites you to create a scholarly analysis of  an object painting architecture sculpture memorial  that is tied to a theme of your choosing
how about a canvas  history materials first recorded usewhich painting
  pic looks like a birds eye view of a mouthfleshlight
  on the topic of fleshlights
hey gang    im part of a secret santa this year and someone ive been matched with is an artist i know she does a lot of work with glass frames but also likes traditional art too pencil and colours type art    what would you recommend buying for this person to make sure they get a quality present art is probably my least knowledgeable subject so i guess id like to know what you would like if you were this person    budget can go up to about 5075 im all ears as i have zero idea really    thank you in advance if you take the time to give me any ideas
            if i got this for christmas id be super happy
  many of those are unavailable which is unfortunate i like the look of them though
  where the fuck did op say she likes charcoal    you got any of their work
  oops sorry dude i would hate to see artist expand their tool base   gtfo
  hey yeah it doesnt matter what you think they look like   its a perfect gift   those items are not sold exclusively at that store only look around   i fucking did work for you took you by the hand   not spoon feeding a fucking baby anymore
  artbooks     an artist has never enough artbooks    here is something which i actually have and i love it 
  for drawing supplies either get nitram charcoal or staedtler 2b pencils
  if you decide to go with charcoals you should also buy kneaded erasers and a sharpening block too
yeah nitram is top of the line   its a gift that any artist can use to improve or make great finished pictures
  staedtler 2b pencils  why would you give them only one fucking pencil grade
  kek
  buy sketchbooks artists often are particular about their leads and charcoals but ive never seen someone turn down empty sketchbooks
what kind of painting do they do op right now if someone was offering id want a bunch of watercolor supplies but thats only because im on a watercolor kick right now    otherwise i would like a pentel brush pen if i didnt already have one and a high quality sketchbook
  post her work muthasucka
op here i quite like the idea of sending this      and this  
  for the love of god dont get her that book that shitll sit on a shelf for eternity
  not that anon but 2b is a popular grade for general drawing id much rather prefer a box of 2bs over a set of grades that is half useless to me    op another good answer is a pentel pocket brush pen or their black pigmented color brush
why does everyone draw little girls nowadays  is it generational what does that say about our generations  its not that i dont like it but im drawn to it so im questionning myself about this    on the other hand im also looking for fresh things besides this and most stereotypes what are some digital artists that dont draw as their main focus little girls cold concept art muscly cape comics or portraits of pretty girls
  anime is the reason anon
  i think its because theyre easier to draw than an adult they dont really have much muscle definition or adult fat that you have to think about and put into condideration when you draw not saying you dont need practice to draw them because you do need practice to make it look good im not really into sexualized loli art but if its a cute innocent nonsexual its really fun to look at
  pedophilia is obv being normalized and you have the gall to pretend like you dont know why art like this is popular
  the beauty of innocence feminine getting more power both on the feminine and masculine sides of the society lolicons
complete and utter lack of appreciation for masculinity and maleness in modern time  all media dominated by female worship driven by male desire to love and protect females and female desire to love and protect themselves  the association of youth itself with femininity
  because anime
those titties  i dont think thats a little girl i think thats just a cuteified adult woman since yknow adults can in fact be stylized into cuteness through the same principles of how cuteness always work with big heads soft small proportions and exaggeration of delicacy  traits associated with youth and cuteness do tend to be tied in to women anyway since theyre kind of just underdeveloped cuter dudes
  underdeveloped cuter dudes  i think their small brains are extra qt uwu
  little girls are cute and fun to draw and also i want to be one
  thats a harsh take but i think theres some truth to this combined with the fact that when inserting something into a scene the vast majority of people just find them more pleasant to look at cool guys are seen as immature self inserts nobody likes average men and cute guys are too niche as they only appeal to women and gay men girls seem to appeal to men and women almost equally that said im just some mentally ill creep whos probably projecting i know id much rather be an attractive girl than an attractive guy
  thats not a little girl though shes tall enough to comfortably use all her kitchen furniture
  anime has been around since the 60s and 70s op is just a pedo himself who follows artists who draw pedo work and thinks everyone is drawing lolis
  this guys speaks truth  im in comic/vidya industry since 2005 and these days i moved to gay scene completely because its the only place where i can draw cool and cute things without pandering to pedo hereros  holy fuck its annoying  the newest ralph cartoon is epitome of what you said and why i decided to leave industry and to draw gay stuff only
summed up  animes influence on art and japans weird reverence and sexualization of youth  young female bodies are easymode to draw especially stylized  everyone loves girls historically and internationally the most beloved artistic subject  nowadays weebs wanna be like their cool autistic jp twitter lolicon artists
    shes drawn like a 12 year old and thats what really matters you lolicon fags are so fucking ridiculous it doesnt matter if you claim your character is actually a 25 year old businesswoman or a 3000 year old vampire if she looks 12 because that is never an accident it is by design what part of this is so hard to grasp
the rules of marketing is that what sells best are  babies  babes and   beasts  hence why theyre used so much on advertising  so obviously a cute but sexualised girl preferably with animal ears is gonna bank on all points
  what makes you say shes drawn like a 12yo though her proportions are compactible with an adult in her 20s  or is it because drawn in pastel colors immediatly equates to child
  not that anon i was actually about to defend you but on closer look her shoulders are really narrow and the figure does seem on the young side she sort of reminds me of a petition friend i had in high school so she looks about 15 to me
  
   implying gay culture dosnt have a shit ton of pedophili and shotacon  lel wat
  dont be a retard  gay culture is all about muscle hunks around 2535   boys are too feminine to be liked by gays usually shot as being fucked by straight pedos
  look at that image op your answer is right there and it is cute
  implying the artist ever thought about her age at all when drawing its just a cute girl anon she is cute
  why dont you draw the body types you personally like anon theres a market for all of them if youre good enough     personally i think the popularity of feminine men has more to do with a temporary burnout on masculinity back in the day that shit was all over the place femininity inverts that so its novel right now it will go out of fashion too
    cuteness comes from childlike features aka neoteny
  its biology grounded fresh new affectionate baby oven is what creatures shaped by natural selection like us prefer  being there and being healthy and emotionally all right is enough to present a significant value as such a individual can easily produce 8 or more children    males are more hitormiss
  you find art you seek out if all you get is little girl drawings its what you wanted to see in the first place i dont see a whole lot of little girl art
  personally i think the popularity of feminine men has more to do with a temporary burnout on masculinity back in the day that shit was all over the place femininity inverts that so its novel right now it will go out of fashion too    i dont know masculinity sure was everywhere but girls were not absent either old paintings had women portraits and little girls heroic fantasy had pinups etc
  thats bullshit and you know it
  what do you see anon as i was saying my post had 2 parts both questionning people about the omnipresence of the little girl phenomenon and finding about modern artists that do something else that this stereotype or the other i was talking about
  some like gilfs some like kilfs thats just how it goes
  you can literally see her tits youthful features and style choices might make you think differently but it doesnt make the character look like a 12 year old
    12 year olds dont have breasts
theres a lot more fixation on girls especially in first world asian countries many asian mothers dont like having sons theyre not pretty and are dirtier and less cute and prefer daughters even though that isnt true and kids are pretty filthy i knew a taiwanese mother who was like this also a bunch of personal anecdotes from other people cant point exactly where it comes from maybe a rebound from patriarchal values but its been going on for a while now
asians draw little girls  the west draws their own anuses with period blood  guess which one became popular
you know i could make a fake account outbid everyone and never confirm payment just to fuck you up for posting this you faggot
  you wont do it faggot
have you ever fallen in love with a character you have drawn about a year ago i spontaneously drew some chatacter for a comic i was working on but then i started to get really attached to her fast forwatd a year later 1/3rd of my drawings are of her and its gotten so bad i cant enjoy drawing anymore unless im drawing her when i draw her i spend hours blendinging the same spot over and over or even find myself running my fingers across her thighs yesterday for the first time i even pressed my lips to the page when i close my eyes i dream if her i dont know whats gotten into me im not even a kissless virgen or anything     pic not related
pygmalion and galatea
  murata and fubuki
statues you can fuck
they arent fucking real lmao at u incels
  more real than you they at least exist on a piece of paper and you are just some pixels on a screen that will cease to exist pretty soon
i dont draw people its hard to be romantically interested in a landscape
  damn
  yesterday for the first time i even pressed my lips to the page     dropped get help op
  when you draw naked anime girls everyday its difficult to get attached to one
post your waifu pls opi also believe what youve created is a tulpa
  oof
  not really fallen in love with a original character but i tend to draw the same kind of muscle male body with the chadest of jawline to all my male character  i just love muscles thicc men with perfectly define muscles and veins just gets me going but its getting in the way when people comission me to draw regular/normal men they always ask me tone down the testosterone  i only got two other girlfriend who enjoy the same stuff as me all the other wants twinks  but to be fair i should draw other body types even if its boring
  dude women are landscapes  have you never heard of the river flowing through the bushes afoot of the mound
yeah i have the exact same problem  dont stroke or kiss it or anything i just draw porn of her instead     its easy to explain why too   i use her as a stand in for any poses concepts or other pieces i work on drawing acts as a sort of emotional release for me as i did it as a kid to cope with abuse   as a result ive incorporated her into the usual dopamine dump my brain gave me from simply drawing   ergo i get a dopamine buzz from her now
  i dont know about love at least not romantically or sexually but ive grown quite attached to the characters and world ive spent years creating to the point where i dont want to make anything unless its about them although i think a part of that is also because i desperately dont want to be another artist that just draws fanart of everyone elses creations
    this  youre creepy op imagine if she was real and you did that
yes i am a female though and my character is a guy that i created i dont want to draw porn of him though or anything gross because that would make me feel bad i just draw him over and over cant draw anybody else desu and it has been like this for a year
  well why dont you post her
  you must be lonely spend more time with other people even if it is your parents
  i accidentally got one of my characters pregnant    i dont know what to do im still not making any money off of my art how am i supposed to support this child
  pressed my lips to the page  i hope this is bait for your sake anon
  draw her accidently falling down a flight of stairs
  lol
    basicly this exept pygmalion got a happy ending      no i dont want people making edits of her someone already did and it hurt pretty bad      i dont want to draw porn of her i dont want to cuck myself       maybe but it wouldnt be because i lack having people around me       nope i just have this urge sometimes to do more even like something inside me is urging me to lick the page and consume the drawing sometimes i just want to shove the entire page into my mouth and eat it
  if buckley can fix this problem so too can you
  hey dont you diss him he already needs to deal with his irl wife
  i just have this urge sometimes to do more even like something inside me is urging me to lick the page and consume the drawing sometimes i just want to shove the entire page into my mouth and eat it
    this then make a selfinsert comic of you going through the hospital door asking the receptionist on where the room is crossing paths with a doctor to ask him where it is exactly and you opening the door to find her crying
  and then she kills you cause you are the fucker who is behind all her pain and suffering like brutally murders you with a scalpel
  why dont you draw yourself as a 2d guy fucking her if your love is in another dimension then you must project yourself into it
  but it would just be a clone of me not the real me
  im sorry for your loss anon
  it would be literally you dont you think your waifu would be sad if she knew you had the power to literally meet her but chose not to
  in the past ive been more emotionally attached to my shitty placeholder character than my actual partners this is mostly because of discomfort/inexperience with intimacy  that is slowly changing
  it would be literally you  i dont think so thats like saying if you clone yourself right now the clone is you
  you wish you could connect with art on a higher emotional level like op
  this is a completely different kind of level though
  this happens to me all the time  im so horny and lonely aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh why cant daffy duck be real pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  based aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah poster
  hello srisiru      na na na in absolute starkest reality your waifu is completely inert to have the animation youre assigning her shed have to be off in her own universe which follows its own rules he is you on that side im doing a story about a character who jump between settings and i want it to be smarter than the next metafiction book ive put far too much thought into the logic of all this    by the way i refuse to continue this conversation until you have read and comprehended this article  
while id certainly not say im in love or done any physical things imagined having sex with her while masturbating does that count there is a character i draw which ive internalized as my anima jaunian psychology shes very much a female foil to me though shes more masculine than i    for the most part think through problems asking what i and then she would do helps give two perspectives as for drawing well opposites attract honestly shes just a waifu but i dont own body pillows or anything so i cant empathize with being in love with my characters ideal girlfriend fantasying is about jacking off to her is about as far as it goes
  these homunculi we draw gives us a strange relationship to the human form
  reminds me why there is never true love in reality a creator cant love its creation
  sauce on the pic op
  whos this pic both char an subject
  top kek
  op are you gonna post your crush
  artists are the only ones with the power to project themselves unto other dimensions if you refuse to use it then youre no better than some normalfag npc
  a creator cant love its creation  probably the most interesting thing in the thread how you figure bloodborne made the same point but i disagree artists always find something they did wrong but theres tons of reports of soldiers being distraught when their bomb bots get destroyed including one squad that tried to have theirs buried with military honors i have some sort of 3piece gimbal/hinge thing that i think i put together as a kid that im embarassingly proud of its not even connected to anything i just like that it works people are proud of their tools and mechanisms    reminds me why there is never true love in reality a creator cant love its creation  by the way desuarchive is down right now but when it comes back post this image in /co/ and reverse image search it trust me its funny
  nope
  that guy in the image sounds like a piece of shit but hey theres a slim chance his version of things is correct ill have a look at that trailer
    i could look at this picture forever and admire how the light cascades on her body and all the different shades of skin it creates    its fucking amazing
  if youre sociopath yeah
post comic panels  bonus if you made it     ill start

  thanks
  where can i read this
hyperreality and simulation are deterrents of every principle and every objective they  turn against power the deterrent that it used so well for such a long time because in the  end throughout its history it was capital that first fed on the destructuration of every  referential of every human objective that shattered every ideal distinction between true  and false good and evil in order to establish a radical law of equivalence and exchange  the iron law of its power capital was the first to play at deterrence abstraction  disconnection deterritorialization etc and if it is the one that fostered reality the reality  principle it was also the first to liquidate it by exterminating all use value all real  equivalence of production and wealth in the very sense we have of the unreality of the  stakes and the omnipotence of manipulation well today it is this same logic that is even  more set against capital and as soon as it wishes to combat this disastrous spiral by  secreting a last glimmer of reality on which to establish a last glimmer of power it does  nothing but multiply the signs and accelerate the play of simulation
i like this thread give me some inspiration are there any professionals here selling they comics    what paper size is your comic really like this one
  dreamicide  a korean webtoon on tapas about a highschooler waking up 7 years later as a leader in a zombiepocalypse he realizes that every time he sleeps he has the power to tavel through time so he decides to try to prevent the destruction of humanity its the only one im mentioning that you have to purchase with tapas coins after a certain point or ink or whatever it is now though in my opinion its worth it apparently its inspiring a new tv series over in korea    mokepon  a smackjeeves comic a comedy drama about a boy who hates friendship and adventure being forced into a pokemon journey if you like this then i also recommend a comic called super effective thats also a pokemon parody albiet more streamline    gloomverse  a smackjeeves comic it has a weird premise about personified colors or something and the art is pretty bad in the beginning the colors may make your eyes bleed but desu the storytelling is solid and the characters become genuinely charming its getting a bit of cult following on that site    the outer door  tapas comic about a group of trickortreaters getting locked into a magicallyboobytrapped mansion and trying to escape the art is genuinly and fundamentally good and there are even animations and musical scores sprinked in there better yet its finished and a pretty quick read no reason not to check it out      seconding avas demon
  
  am i the only one here making a comic thats isnt drawn anime or murican superhero style
just found out theres b4 paper size available to purchase in my shitty third world country  it was called 1/8 w all along    still have to purchase the rest of the stuff off the internet tho
heres something i did ages ago people keep telling me to get back into horror comics
almost done inking the cover for chapter 5 of jasper gold
id like to begin making some short comics as a way to improve my consistency in my drawings and force myself to do more environmental design do you guys have any tips for someone inexperienced
  start with a simple story something that has an introduction middle and ending if page count is your issue then something along the lines of 1015 pages would be alright it can be shorter than that so long as you share your ideas onto the canvas
  i remember checking this out a few years ago nice to see youre still at it
  japshit does not count as comics
    yawn
  i can see why this is good
  thanks for taking the time to check it out anon     here is the inked version
    thanks right now im focusing on animation but sometimes i miss doing this kind of thing
  not this shit again
need honest critics is this style good enough or should i try harder
  artstyle needs to complement the tone of the comic if this is super serious then no but if its more comedic then sure i cant tell which it is since i dont speak refugee
  first panda comic is for kids second is darker something like yu gi oh
  the diaper wearing furry absolutely ruins what couldve been good
  this
  ssorry
hey guys help me out did i get the panel order wrong for when the dude gets shot
  what this is actually good  what a great surprise anon
  dead project what a shame
  yep unless you are doing manga
    even if he is doing a manga there is not enough space to breath for the reader you have to make this more dynamic and breathable
  i get what you mean by breathable but what do you mean by dynamic this is my first strip in years by the way just to add
heres previous page panels not drawn but you can prob make out whats happening
    it looks cool af but it looks like you just drew this in all fine tip sharpie which is fine if thats your thing but you could try adding some bolder lines in with a thicker marker in places that turn away from the light you could put a shadow under the figure or the underside of the arm or fingers/kuckles to give your figures more dimension than they already have
  ya im doin that too these are just rough prototypes right now
  this right here  i cant force myself to look past it
  kek
  i really like this comic do you host it on a webpage or something the art looks super cool
  i sure do dubsman i hope you like the rest ive been spending a lot of time recently trying to improve my lettering and speech bubbles so progress was slowed this past week    
  thanks heres a penciled panel
i wrote him a letter asking what is going on with his book particularly on amazon and express my gratitude for the gem which ive stolen since couldnt buy it pic rel is his answer    fucking amazon//
    im going to send him this thread link and have you arrested see you in prison retard
  /ic/ pure love
  were going to go tell on you now
  what kind of name is zlara
  which ive stolen since couldnt buy it    dont give bullshit excuses you stole it because it was convenient and you couldnt be bothered to buy it amazon isnt the only place carrying the book
  beat me to it     not having enough money isnt a justification for stealing ffs
  steve
  oh shit is op going to have to do a gesture battle with michael hampton op is toast
  that would be hilarious and historical    hampton if your reading this dont jail op instead just challenge him to a gesture battle
    ive confessed to him      how did you get it      since youve thrust yourself i stole just to check it out and now i know how wondrous it is and actually reached out for the author himself to ask whats going on and i only can use amazon
  ive confessed to him    nigga i didnt hit send on the message i was scaring you i just did though because i want him to post on /ic/
  how did you get it  you can guess it by the lines you didnt paint
  i am surprised to learn hampton is alive i thought he was from loomis era i will buy his book for myself this christ mas
  actually you all fucking hypocrites could send him a letter of gratitude since his educational work is enormous unironically instead of predictable shitposting
  
  ive confessed to him      ahahahaha you think any of these kids have the balls to send a email to god king hampton you played yourself
  can you paint it over pls i accidentally
  you know if hampton does happen to come here we will get faggots who will say something retarded like his faces are all sameface neanderthals in his book
kinda blows my mind that you just reached out to him i feel like im not good enough to message pros like that
  true i might literally kill myself if he came here and we made him cringe instead of posting our best and getting god tier crits
  is mike joining us quick anons hide the pissbottles
  post your work op
  what a nice man
  tfw havent thrown out piss bottles in half a year  do i have time
stop bullying op and hampton its not nice
  availability is a valid if not legally tenable reason for piracy with video games for example there are certain games that simply cannot be purchased by any means depending on the country you live in cough russia /cough    not even to mention the fact that youre very unlikely to get sample material for any product nowadays which means you might end up having to invest a bunch of money in something on trust alone or just not have any learning material full stop its very difficult to be an informed consumer with the current way things are handled right now most people would rather pay for things when they can so its important for companies to convince them that they should
posting in potentially legendary thread
  actually ive been thinking thats the natural way to communicate for normal people you know what ive been drawing for 2 months lmao but i just try to talk to different people and learn from them i actually send some masters my works and you know what i got the replies with corrections on top of my drawings i didnt even ask for that you see how open and generous people can be even being extremely busy etc  thats a great lesson per se  the art of not being a dick      not gonna mar this beautiful thread ive posted in /beg/s
i might have to enter threads near 0100 more often yesterday good tomboy thread now this
  i couldnt express it better thanks
  i know thats true in my head but i feel like my work is at such a level that its not worth someone elses time to critique me i know i dont work hard enough and that all of my current inadequacies in art could be solved on my own i already know what i have to do but ive yet to do it thats why i dont want to bother other artists
  there are known knowns and known unknowns but also there are unknown unknowns    if you dont bother other artists that you like or find inspirational with your works how can you actually predict the impact that might happen after the exposure you cant just one stroke on top of your work can shift your mindset just one word or piece of advice can be an apocalyptic revelation whatever you think is highly subjective in every aspect of it you think you need to work on this this and that and on that in a specific ways but its quite possible that thats not the case
  theres no time youll have to drink them anon
  this hampton sounds awesome it feels really good that someone like this is getting the fame he deserves his book is a gem
mike if youre reading this thread give me a you and tell me im going to make it i need it
  inb4 michael hampton sees this thread silently shakes his head in disappointment and just leaves
  anime avatar  youd be lucky if mike even glanced over your gibberish
  is he married i wish hed take me as his wife and teach me how to get gud in person  id succ his dick 5 times a week unironically
  jesus christ anon have some manners he might actually see this
mr steven michael hampton if you see this hi glad to see youre teaching at brainstorm inland in january thats fuckin awesome
mr hampton if you can actually read this im sorry for the amount of retardation youre seeing in this board  unfortunately we have been struck with an influx of chivalrous normies thots edgy 13 yearolds and anime faggots who like to shitpost this board into oblivion since god knows when  they like to discuss stupid shit like artunrelated trends incels social justice /pol/ memes anime and other worthless bullcrap instead of actually drawing so this place must be like a spit in your face  so our apologies for the mess    にょろーん 3
  disregard this guy hes just taking a quick break from his home website r3bbit to make us look like retards with his cringeposting   you can tell by his redit lingo thots normies anime faggots etc that he isnt one of us and is likely underage to boot  he does not represent us in any way   apologies for the painful revulsion you felt while reading his textual vomit
  disregard this guy hes just an underage faggot whos trying to gain some 4chan creed by pretending to be one of us  you can tell by his buzzwords like cringeposting and blaming redit for everything  apologies for the worthless post im replying to
    that last letter is a k i reckon
  nno youthe post  redit getting toasty
  retarded threads get retarded posts anon  its the cycle of life
link to pdf
  nice try hampton
this is now a thank you hampton senpai thread  be thankful or you wont be able to draw in 3d anymore
  thats amazing but the book is available outside of amazon
  disgusting
  this was meant for   
thank you mister hampton hope you dont sue my communist ass really cant keep an expensive book around our camp as i can be killed by my comrades    from anon
who would win in a gesture battle  steve hampton or michael huston
  chad huston vs virgin hampton
so steven boy didnt post yet huh maybe the captcha is giving him problems so it isnt worth it
  oh wow i actually emailed hampton back in 2014 with a 4chan link i completely forgot about that how time flies by
  oh gosh im so ashamed to link that 2014 thread my posts were so cringe
hmmm    thoughts on his new piece
  soulless and void of any tension or movement
  yeah nah post your work faggot
  why does it look like a still shot from a ps2 cutscene
  you seem upset
  frozen stiff in time  amazing rendering though
  its good    frozen stiff in time  this isnt necessarily a bad thing it feels like a deliberate choice here given the pose of the guy on the left freeze frame in a movie
  when u spend 40 hours on rendering something that looks like a photobas
  the youre only allowed to criticise it if your own work is equal to or greater than said piece meme get the fuck outta here illastrat
    nno everything ruan does is perfect nooo  this chink has god ascended tier rendering and used to make really good shit but lately it seems that his work has been uncomfortably bland and stiff   iits just because hes changing his style  maybe he is and i dont like the results unlike his old shit that was vibrant with colors and had a lot of stuff going on that kind of artwork is fucking forgettable and boring once you get past the impressively accurate rendering i even thought this piece was one of his later artworks of some shitty soldier exploding in the sand getting reposted stay mad ruanlets
  thank you for proving my point now fuck off
    everyone talks about how good ruan is at rendering and yes he can render individual pieces really well but often as a whole it is jarring how badly integrated his characters often are into the enviroment his landscapes are fucking amazing though i wish he painted more rocks and shit
    you first faggot
  the foot not having any ambient occlusion is a bit offputting and id put a greater emphasis on the projectile the girl is shooting or something like a muzzle flash to really show the action/event but since there is already a huge flame there it wouldnt work unless he made the flash cyan or blue other than that its really well rendered and the colors are very unified but lacks the catchy something his older works have
  did you know that art critics dont have to produce art faggot
  really awful composition theres no real focal point  just a bunch of random bits of interest awkwardly placed around the composition     the angle of the front figures legs is ridiculous  it almost creates a tangent where the left and right legs could be interchangeable i cant unsee how the little white strap could be their waist and you have some bizarre extended torso connecting it to the rest of the body the left leg is just sticking straight out in a way that is disjointed from the rest of the body it is absolutely jarring and contributes to how still and devoid of movement it seems     is the figure in midair or stepping on that piece of machinery its impossible to tell because of the poor separation of space    is the figures arm on fire and are they getting hit by something or is that fire  debris from the tank exploding in the back     how is there an explosion large enough to send that tank flying upwards in the back but to not affect the unarmored bluehaired woman  right next to it wouldnt she be blown the fuck out actually  how far away is that theres a terrible separation between the midground and the background
  what the fuck am i looking at  the anime girl looks like someone else edited her in
    great rendering    it almost looks like fragments of a dream it has a strange serealness feel     i wish he would start painting castles again he paints amazing arcitecture
  how is there an explosion large enough to send that tank flying upwards in the back but to not affect the unarmored bluehaired woman  right next to it wouldnt she be blown the fuck out actually  how far away is that theres a terrible separation between the midground and the background  i think the guy got shot and that the power of the bullet   his gear exploding sent him flying back  why does he have a third gun in his holster kek
  lelele you dont have to be a fine artisan master chef to be able to taste if something is good  its a bad analogy misused as an argument here your ability to palate food is already inherited along with your five senses however in terms of draftsmanship you must learn this trait and develop a palate to fully appreciate fine works of art and analyze pieces of work in detail but one can easily tell if someone is talking out from their ass if they cannot walk the walk therefore you are full of shit
  food is one thing but by your logic there shouldnt be music cinema fashion or architecture critics for example you cant critique a movie you havent ever held a camera before anon youre the one talking out of your ass despite none in this board being half as good as ruan jia valid points have been made itt
is he starting to use photobashing or just abusing the sharpen tool    these latest ones feel different rendering wise
  the fire is some distance behind her and that tank wasnt pushed upwards wtf its sitting on a dune or some shit just compare the contrast of the flames and the contrast of the tank the later is obv some distance away while still getting bounce light from the fire      then again it is a bit confusing are we to assume the white tank is a much bigger version than the darker ones the design is very similar the use of atmosphere sure makes you believe so or is the tank on the left supposed to be further away if yes there is some issue with scale and contrast going on    yea he was shot already as the debris on his left shoulder indicates as for why he is on fire maybe a 2nd bullet damaged his cable     eh maybe its just a wip idk
  implying acoustics film masonry and drapery critics havent immersed themselves in their respective fields and produced competent work themselves  youre incompetent in any field if you cannot demonstrate the how and why of a matter which is an issue here since every single one of you faggots talk straight out from your ass and when someone calls you out on your shit we have an episode like were having right now where you backpedal and use every form of excuse to not show your own approach or even your work
all his rendering looks like a render with default settings in a 3d program technically very good but kind of cold and soulless too
  he literally never photobashed even his old concept paintings are all fully hand painted the great majority of the pro chinese art scene are really dedicated to paint everything on the canvas as its dishonorable and weak to use photobash etc a lot of eyes are on them and the brother with the biggest skill gets the most students it would spread like wildfire if someone like hgj used photobash the majority of his students would leave and go somewhere else a good reputation and name is the most important thing in most of asia
    implying   points werent valid and well put  you ruanfags are fucking insufferable
  i can cherry pick too     passive aggressive cunt  
  chinese people are actually infamous for cheating
    every single one of you faggots talk straight out from your ass  nnot all of you though  now please since youre so skilled yourself tell me more about his process and what makes his art so good i guess you can do something to balance out all the negative comments right
  i love some stuff by ruan jia and even got one of his paintings hanging on my wall but this looks like shit man stop trying to defend everything he does
thumbnail reads like a photobash and a pretty bad one at that  character on foreground is unreadable theres debris flying on his left shoulder like he has beenhit there and by the lack of shadow around his feet he is midaid but his body neither convey a blown off jumping or falling impression  the girl aim is totally off if shes aiming at him which doesnt help reading the situation  the giant machinery in the back throws all sense of scale away so its pretty much impossible to tell distances and scales
  fpbp  this guy got worse over time for whatever reason
  unlike you i am self aware to not critique ruan jias pieces since i am nowhere near his level of fine draftsmanship however what i can tell you is he is very knowledgeable with bringing about the aesthetics behind light and shadow and how these properties complement each other to produce depth and space his use of vivid colors brings a sense of dynamism in the environment in which he further refines form by describing planes in intricate details ruan jias stroke economy is by far one of the most impressive which further highlights and compliments his amazing skill in rendering
  i am self aware not to critique ruans work  gives critique anyways  see what i meant dont think you cant critique something because youre not as good as the artist in question because i can definitely agree with most of what you just said faggot
forgettable before i scrolled i already forgot most of it for example what color was chicks hair all i can clearly recall is guys armor and oxygen tanks  my first impression is wtf is going on  no hate
  but anon how can you tell he is   very knowledgeable with bringing about the aesthetics behind light and shadow  if you are  self aware to not critique ruan jias pieces      giving compliments is a critique too if you compliment someone without critiquing well it just means that you follow him blindly right or wrong
  a lot of negativity    i dont see the problem with this guys skill at all    lifeless    so many jealous pepes
    if you think this is lifeless i feel sorry for you
  that spaceship is a bit out of place
  boring soulless and super rigidi dont even like the color palette he use on this one
    kinda makes me wonder why youre spending time in a thread that focuses on his style
  anyone with the work ethic of ruan jia can make work like ruan jia stop acting like this is new shit   7 tenths of you can picture shit in your head youre just unskilled because you dont know balls about anything because you dont work on anything difficult    attempt literally anything this complicated and succeed bam youre instantly and automatically ruan jiatier but will you no because fuuuuuck that  fundamentals are a meme just grind and make like 6 autistic pieces and all the fundamentals will be mastered    heres your practice drill/ic/ anyone who does this will have fundamentals mastered   spend however long you need to complete these images    2 french gothic architectural environment scene with people in costumes and clouds mountains  2 groundfloor dense cityscape environment with people cars poles store windows  1 wasteland with soldiers fighting monsters  1 cute girl wearing detailed impractical scifi armor  1 cute girl wearing detailed impractical fantasy armor  2 grotesque monsters  1 detailed sci fi vehicle w/ people to show scale    10 images it took forever but you did it congratulations
  ascended tier post
  youre only allowed to complement his style  fanboys are the fucking worst
  where is the guys shadow lmao  he isnt even stepping on the object hes just floating there  it looks like he was just copy pasted from another photo onto a random background same with the girl
  nice bait retard thats someones shitty study
    sassy
  honestly he seems like a guy who can paint whether he want but pick the weird way to do thing  most of his background is surreal as hell compare to how he render the characters
  you have two characters pointing at the negative space between them i feel as though you could have cropped this into a portrait and nothing of value would be lost
  op asked
  anime chick looks ridiculously out of place
  calm down anon
  practice makes perfect  is what youre essentially saying but i hate to disagree with you because that doesnt work with drawing all the time
  thats probably the best critique around here
  thats the exact opposite of what hes saying anon  its more like perfect results are perfect results
  im no expert on body language but if they were talking id imagine this is what theyd be saying
  that handwriting  you must be a woman let me see your hairy snatch
  woman  aaaaaaaaaaahh im so lonely and horny aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh
  spot on
  keep your pants on you animal
  op never said anything in his defense
  based
its impressive how boring that is
  normie chinks yes not the type of artists that were mentioned there are enough vids to show their full process from scratch and i mean a process for an actual painting that was posted online not some semi study
  he even left his name on the pic    cmon now dont embarrass yourself
  also you forgot    work 1115h a day  paint mostly from imagination  be ruanjia    amongst many other things
  ngmi
you can see he can render realistically but hia composition is surrealistic how the fuck is he shittier than kim jung gi and that bioware concept artist i follow on artstation wasted skill to be honest
but the idea of surrealism is about realistic depiction of nonrealistic things     the problem is that some of his compositions are just shit like this one and the overrendered girl in a transparent dress where she has some super impressive materials on her panties but she just is fucking ugly lol and all that rendering looks like lipstick on a pig
  if this is what    1 chinese artists supposedly god tier of artists aspire to and    2 having high rendering skills is like and    3 drawing from imagination is about    then i dont want any of it    why would you even watermark something like this
  well you can make it if you practice dont give up anon you wont be ruan tho lol
suggest a few names and ill make a straw poll once /ic/ votes everyone draws that person
  this particular miku
  she looks like a turtle  ill add her to the list
eliza ivanova
  nice choice anon
i want to buy my first display tablet can someone give me some recommendations  i was looking into the cintiqs just because that was the name i was familiar with but i saw some people complaining about lag and jittery lines with the pro 16 does the pro 13 or 22hd also have those problems what other brands should i be considering
  everyone is saying ipad pro so i guess with with that    i personally dont like display tablets because hand gets in the way and you cant have your other hand on the keyboard and the buttons are too small on the screen
  id discourage you from buying an ipad because itll last you 3 years at most before breaking down it has real durability issues theres tons of videos on youtube talking about it if you want proof stay away from apple tablets  if you can afford it id definitely recommend the cintiq pro 22 have had no issues watsoever with it easy drivers no issues with lines really worked like a charm it really is a blast to draw with ive also had the chance to try out the pro 24 the multitouch feature thing on this one is a little fucked so id not really consider it either
  my pro 16 is great iike way better than i expected
  how is running photoshop on an ipad vs a pc it looks like photoshop for ipad was announced is it out yet  i would like the flexibility of doing all my art on my pc and money isnt too much of an issue biggest thing for me would be minimizing lag the lag in some of the 16 pro videos looked kinda crazy but maybe theyve fixed that issue since then
  got a specific video so im not blindly searching is this people sitting on them with no case on it or something i mean i see people still using 90s clamshells for fun that were used by school elementary kids and they still work people irl still using iphone 5 when theyre on ten stories of people future proofing their laptops too well and having no excuse to upgrade when they want the latest gimmick etc so id be surprised   my pro in particular is almost 3 years old and at most might need a battery changed in the next few years because its used almost literally all day between members in my household so i mean its relevant to me if i need to start worrying about it      its out next year you can watch the reveal video where they do a live demo seemed legit because the girl was super nervous and trembling    if you like working on pc then theres no reason to consider an ipad unless you really need a screen or the portability
  yeah it has a ton of negative reviews on amazon which makes me nervous some people make it sound like the thing just doesnt work dead pixels and overheating problems with parallax and lag etc    is the wacom link plus included with the pro 16 and does that let it work out of the box with a pc that only has hdmi ports
  what dont you buy the coolest and newest ipad release each year
  i have had no problems at all with it guess im lucky mine is great
  not xppen thats for sure
how does it feel that you will never reach perfection
  i dont want to reach perfection that is completely unrealistic and just stupid i just want to get decent
  perfection is literally the most boring thing ever life is about the challenges not be a perfect machine
  the disgusting trash in ops picture definitely isnt perfection
i wont reach perfection  you wont reach perfection  the greatedt masters didnt reach perfection  because perfection is an ideal not a real achievable goal theres always more to learn more to study more to do  no one ever reach the peak and no one will because its not a mountain but an infinite slope    so perfection doesnt exist deal with it
perfection is subjective
  when the roastie sees a younger more attractive girl
  girl
  it feels good what the fuck would i do if i ever got to reach perfection
    teach lurkers and dab on the f/a/ggots
  huh
  i mean if you put it this way perfection doesnt sound too bad  so now it feels bad knowing that ill never reach perfection
  tfw never will cum in a 12 year old fallen angels cummy to make beautiful mixed angel children
  i honestly think ill be able to paint like this within 30 years
im already perfect
  go for it bro  its a worthy endeavor
    sorry to say but thats a shota fellas
  even better
  i came here to post this
  and
  so perfection doesnt exist deal with it    i refuse to
realistically if one devotes a decade to the craft can he reach perfection
    thats cupid cupid is a boy
  i dont want to reach perfection  i want to reach a point that i enjoy
  perfection but i cant see a penis
  whoever painted this is based af
  goddammit im so horny and lonely
          ngmi      good form
  he doesnt know who painted this   jesus christ
  looks like firez from the toes muddy brushwork and same face
  jesus painted that
  bouguereau is based indeed
   posting the censored version  come on
  used to bother me now it makes me feel human
  how does it feel that water boil at 100c
    what if you make a model in 3d and then do something like tracing
  id sell my soul just to reach mediocrity at this point
  god i wishthat were me
  that pic reminded me about the time one of my art teachers included an old painting of a naked young boy like yeah it was a good painting and all but it was really awkward having to look at a naked painting of some 14 year old in class lmao
  ahhhh im so loney and horny ahhhhhhhhhhh
  modddddsss
  perfection doesnt exist
i completed 2 of 120 pages
  3 shitty a4 sketchbook and 1 standard moleskine  the moleskin i have going atm
  ywn be a cute anime girl doing a comfy art sleepover with your friends  why live lads  really comfy artwork to answer your question i completed two 60 pages a5 books and two 120 pages a4 blocks
im afraid of wasting them so i just use paper sheets
  whats actually the point of sketchbooks worked on comics and paintings all the time i which i could start a sketchbook
  damn blog
  whats actually the point of sketchbooks  for me it makes it fun to draw in the train waiting outside between classes etc
  0    which is funny because i have drawn more this year than last    would probably draw more if it was as comfortable on a smart phone as the girl in the bed makes it look
  i only drew like 20 times this year  ngmi
  i started this year around july finished 34 lots of half finished ones in the sizes i like less protip dont get the 20 more deal ones they barley fit in the rings as the rings are the same size and they blow up
  2600 pages
  idk i did all digital started june and got 120 drawings done most of them were colored shaded and uploaded to muh blog
  august 2018  somebody forgot to rip the calendar pages
  2 20 page sketchbooks for inktober   1200 page sketchbook mostly for very rough idea sketches  1 20 page watercolor sketchbook
  it never snows anywhere on earth in august  northern/southern lights clearly visible  bouvardherschel comet discovered on august 16 the circled date
i think ive done about 450 sketches 50 drawings 120 paintings so far which adds up to about 650 hours of work    ive put in about 5000 hours so far so i think im halfway to mastery of my art but its slow going feels like i work as hard as i can every year but always end up with such a low number of hours worked
  i just did my research and it does in fact snow somewhere in august
  you are right my bad
  literally this it hurts so much  also its cheaper to buy 500sheets/5 copy paper instead of 1430 for 50 sheets
  draw on loose paper  throw away garbage art and just keep good stuff  bind it  we godtier sketchbook now
  maybe five it was a really slow year
the new year is just around the corner and you know what that means  new years resolutions what are you new years resolutions going to be this time /ic/ are we finally going to actually finish something are we going to get out of our comfort zone and start applying color to our drawings are we finally going to crawl out of this bucket and expose ourselves to the normies    how do we get out of this godforsaken place and how do you deal with the cancer outside in normieville
new years resolution  abandon /ic and never look back
  my resolution is to get over my infinite laziness and learn how to draw properly  coincidentally that was my resolution last year  did i mention my laziness
  we keep coming back though
  i need to draw more original things instead of just doing photo studies
  more photo studies  more softcore  more intimacy study how to visually get across the feeling of closeness and power dynamic  more women maybe
  i know damn i just cant stay away
not doing too bad in other social media sites except for this  what do you guys do to gain attention there
have conversations with people
  kek
  where do you think you are
  best bet is to get an established artist to repost your work engage with a lot of artists when they post always be positive and steer clear of politics
  follow people repost their shit  omg i love your shit man x  keep gitting gud have a consistent posting schedule  its gonna take some time but dont get discouraged
  shit
  make friends post fanart have connections with popular artists previously established in other sitesbasically tumblr where its easier to get recognition
i send sassy tweets at trump and hope he replies   its going pretty good so far
  go away karla ortiz
  i only do well with twitter but all i do is tag my stuff i dont even talk to people i dont even respond to someone who comments on my posts
  this is the truth or close to  twitter is about networking and scratching eachothers back lots of fan overlap between artists
less than 200 followers here so not great but  turn on twitter analytics  so you can check your tweet performance  tweet with one or two hashtags max  i dont like to socialize but if people talk to me ill like their replies and respond to questions  draw fads like bowsette drew mythra during this ssbu censorship controversy and got 10 new followers
    can you guys elaborate on this like what should i just cold message people orr
  can people do this on twitter i dont really know how the site work
        pretty much this    also dont overtag your post this isnt instagram youll look desperate for attention
  draw peoples ocs
i dont i failed   im doing okay on instagram lmao
  yes like you can post a comment and theres a chance the op will see and like/retweet and that gets people exposed to your account     if they see you around enough theyll most likely follow i post genuine praise on artists posts and it feels cool when they like or say something back scary at first but you wont get anywhere keeping to yourself     practice anon
  show tits like everywhere else
  i dont think people will be aroused by man boobs
  draw memes
grew my instagram from 300 to 8000 this year  grew my twitter from 1000 to 1500    it fucking sucks
  memes are embarrassing
make account some time back  dont do anything with it  log in  its banned
it could be that you have a lot of stealth followers im guilty of this myself because i only want content pertaining to certain media on my feed so i put popular artists on a list for better organization i also put the nsfw artists who rt nsfw things on a separate list so it doesnt show on my feed a problem with the system i guess
  7k at the moment modest and happy with the people ive been able to connect with    just find your people and be genuine focusing on gaming the system too much will ruin your own experience
  why
  not necessarily true i have 10k followers and only left a few comments here and there i barely talk
in my experience   get into specific niche not too big not too little  interact with people in niche not necessarily with your art at first  if youre good your new pals with bigger following will rt it  gain followers
  facebook is better in every way today twitter can limit you for random bullshit its pure bot based
  youd be surprised
whats this style called
  impressionism
  shakyhandinism    some artists have hand tremmers they usual are good impressionistic painters
  the  i have to take a shit and it hurts so bad like someone pushed a knife up my ass but this cute girl is checking me out so i have to pretend everything is fine  artstyle
  masaaki yuasa out of context frame
    do you want to talk about it
  no i dont like that artstyle that much
  its animation faggot
the 10 second rotoscope
  ping pong is pretty fucking kino
  bullshitting until something interesting shows up  kinda like that monkeys with typewriter eventually writing shakespeare but on a much smaller scale with some hint of direction
    these are correct
  whats this style called
  i believe this style is called beg
  its a smear frame my man not a style
how do you deal with the fact that youll never be as good or as unique as lucian freud
  all those ridges  so just paint with a lot of paint and boom and use a lot of greys easy
  i aam as good and im as unique by definition
looks ugly and the face is all messed up with weird angles not sure why id want to paint like that anon
itt anime scum dont appreciate real art
  are you even an artist  ugly is easy  beauty is hard    you pick the easy one and call it art wow such high standards much art upvote xdd 1
    you have no idea what youre talking about and its embarrassing
  youll never be as good or as unique as lucian freud  what do you even mean by this  first of all i am not aiming to do the same thing as lucian freud so how can you compare me to him as if there is some universal measurement for good or bad art  secondly you dont know me im gitting gud every day and i dont draw anime
i look at people who study at slade and laugh for the amounts of money they pay to do this
by drinking every night which will eventually lead me to drinking myself to death
  i want to push that sculpture over so fucking badly
    when will tradcucks realize that the way they laugh at animufags is the same way we abstractionists look at people fawning over dead white dudes
  caring about race or gender  at all    epic i love art students so smart and woke to care about whoever created the art and not the art itself you are so legitness
 you are subhuman and with this mindset your art will forever be trash read your history books and stay off instagram
  the sculpture is the least offensive thing in that room
  i shall be better than him in that case
  talented artist living in england mfw
  this
  abstractionism is associated with anti white racism sure making a poor case for your already poor art
  
and i dont know lady rothermere either
  doesnt even look good honestly
  maybe you just dont like painting
    why would i laugh this chicks becoming pretty successful and shes getting into galleries all over the world now     shes a qt asian thot im not gonna bother posting her instagram but its funny you posted her cause she just had a showing in la last month    arts always going to be changing if people cant accept that theyll be left behind
  art is not about being as good as someone else grow up and youll understand it
  eh its not the art i wanna do that art seems good but its hard to compare realist painters to animators or comic artists or some other type of art
  lucian frwud looks like a better version of that shitpostinh acrylic painter
  well you shouldnt be on /ic really there are over six boards on 4flan dedicated to cartoon drawing
as well as a graphic design board
  you may as well go to /fa and tell everyone how much you dont like clothes
  i can admire an artists work without envy you should try it sometime op   maybe i dont want to be lucian freud because i am myself
  i find it difficult to not be envious of other artists like messrs freud artists that have patrons and subject matter and a bohemian life making great culture and lots of sex freedom of indulgence i suppose which comes with its own dangers what will fate bring for us
  i dont peer hard at artist biographies thinking how cool and troubled their lives were instead i read them as a kind of reminder that you can go down all kinds of paths to achieve something i feel that i could be pushing my art much more aggressive and more driven than i do but i always think that way and there might not be a point where it would be enough     i certainly dont have naive crap in mind like you i dont envy that romantic cliché image of an artists life beautiful models that you can fuck indulging in all kinds of vices bohemian life  bullshit do you know how fucking frustrating it is to work in a former storage that you rent as your studio and there is no proper heating there is nothing romantic about that that artists life was and will always be a fucking burdon so much fucking insecurity how will i pay my rent  theres nothing to envy its an entertaining read to study an artists life but that struggle is a burdon
  have naive crap in mind  i am full of that sort of thing
  how will i pay my rent   thats what i envy the success but im also mindful avoiding it might be the better thing destiny will do what it will
  sorry to hear      yeah they say that success sort of corrupts but id wish for just enough success to be able to afford a proper studio with good heating and more space that sort of thing no grandeur
  sorry to hear  ill grow out of it maybe
  have a few days off the booze
  art has been regarded as competitive since the hellenic era
  did you paint this
can i get a redline
is this the new purple girl
  /jp/ please go
  holy shit these broken legs  this guy needs loomis
  where is her head heads are on top of the body lurk more loomis
  this    now its better
  nice good job anon
rate my redline guys
  10/3
  desu the legs are broken as fuck but im giving you at least a b since this would be way outside my comfort zone even for me and it seemed like you were trying for something different and interesting    you desperately need to work on your prospective and how to establish heavily foreshortened forms in relation to the viewpoint
  we should not be seeing the popliteal of her right leg
  sure op  here you go 
  what does this mean
gymnestics handstand or acrobatic hand stand its not a very intuitive pose so might consider looking for reference on what that look like and what the limit human body is like
  i dont understand her left feet
a pose like this without reference is really courageous
  the top is at the bottom just like the picture
show me what yall are working on rn
is improving linework all about mileage or is there some shit i can learn that will help me improve
  train with a pen or something you cant erase it will teach you to do better looking more confident lines  outside of that its all mileage
what exactly is mileage  inb4 retard
  doing it a lot
mileage  shit like line weight study why people use heavier lines broken lines and uniform lines when they do
    literal milage how many miles of line have you drawn in your life in the past month
dana gibson is a master of lines man makes full value with pens and hatching dudes a genius
no they cant be shutting down my porn blog on tumblr how am i supposed to make a living
just make a twitter lmao
  you honestly think people didnt make a living drawing porn before tumblr got big
mfw i cant have juicy tumbl pussy
go to newgrounds like all the cool kids faggot
talentless degenerate porn artists who took a shortcut to money are getting btfo while hardworking legitimate artists grinding away 10 hours a day to join a legit industry are unaffected    there are no shortcuts on the road of life
  the greatest artists in history were just jacking off to their creations  see michelangelo  he was also a faggot
    being a succesful porn artist is no different than being succesful in any other endeavor there is no shortcut involved you have to consistently produce high quality work and often work long hours
  being a succesfull burgerflipper is no different than being a succesfull chef    you are the bottom scrappers the dirt from under real artists nails and dont you forget it  you are just a touch more respectable than camwhores
  youre such a clueless retard i can smell you cant even draw for shit
  stay mad artwhore
  let me guess you could never learn figure drawing because you were too scared to look at a naked girl
  people wont waste their effort on making something people will spend 30 seconds on while scrolling through porn and jacking off  that means they cant    let me guess you never practiced perspective backgrounds or even clothes because all you were ever drawing were dicks faggot
  lol look how mad you are  i think its pretty obvious now that you have never drawn a naked body which of course comes after studying perspective and you call yourself an artist  brb ill finish that dick ive been sculpting for about two years now like the real artist i am
  oh please dont grasp that straw makes you even more pathetic    your hyperfetish diaper inflation ponies and horsedicked footfetish futas are nothing like the actual art where people sometimes happen to be undressed    notice david doesnt have a horse hardon and nipple piercings and his expression seems to be bothered with some other matters like killing goliath and shit perhaps because hes not sexualized
  your hyperfetish diaper inflation ponies and horsedicked footfetish futas are nothing like the actual art where people sometimes happen to be undressed  a horse hardon and nipple piercings     whoa thats oddly specific buddy are you sure you arent into that    also to think david is not sexualized is to blind yourself against a glaring truth yeah he might be not in sexual action but that doesnt mean it wasnt an object of desire by michelangelo which was the case most likely
  stop trying to project your degeneracy onto high art
  oh i guess the bodybuilders are the objects of sexual desire for everybody attending bodybuilding events right     theres more to people and bodies than sexual desire   not every naked body is painted so you could jerk off to it
  theres more to people and bodies than sexual desire   not every naked body is painted so you could jerk off to it  of course its not dont put words i never said in my mouth but david definitely was for michelangelo    stop trying to project your degeneracy onto high art  whats high art  and why would eroticism in art be a bad thing it has been a thing since forever you fucking prude
  all this whining wont save your anime
  i hope you realize the weirdo that ever mentioned horses or anime was not me  read art history
  no joke i am literally shaking right now i have furaffinity but most of my commissions come from people on tumblr i dont want to have to go back and work a real job what the fuck
  i only draw degenerate art so i can do this art shit ful ltime and focus on my true passion which is animation
welcome to december 18th the day all you retards have to go look for a real job   hahahahahahah
  i dont think they will go through with it people are pissed
fuck pronfags they get away with shitty fundies because all people care about is tits and ass someone like cutesexyrobutts and nu sakimichan would never make it the usual way
  lmao get fucked
  remember to practice smiling anon
  oh i guess the bodybuilders are the objects of sexual desire for everybody attending bodybuilding events right   just going to point this out for the fyi since im a bodybuilder but probodybuilding was basically started promoted and funded by very rich homos and to this day still is many probodybuilders get sponsors like roelly who got sponsored by some qatarian oil prince to come to qatar and work out all expenses paid for until his next comp
  he was also a black trans woman
im not saying i could do any better but i havent seen any concept art that stands out and really looks exceptional aside from absolute legends like craig mullins
  his weapons are disco globes
  those chains look real cool
  does anyone on this board know the difference between concept art and an illustration ops pic is an illustration
stephen oakley is a great concept artist    craig mullins barely does any conceptart he mainly does illustration
  thats not concept art you dumbass
because its about the concept and not the art
  why doesnt everything look exceptional  because something exceptional is uncommon by definition  you dumb fuck   jesus it wouldnt kill you to think for two seconds before posting
  youve heard of disco inferno say hello to disco infernal
  must be some unexplainable force
    designs are generic for a reason most film and game productions arent looking for something very innovative
    this op is a faggot again
big game movie tv show is expensive  big corporations buy all small studios and then buy all medium studios  management only wants ideas proven to work  art director tells you to make it generic or change it  same mood boards for different projects  extreme pinterest rip off of rip offs with no understanding  artists flood market begging to work on anything  no license or formal education required  photobashing demanded for tight deadlines  photobashing other concept artists concept art  same google image search results in every painting  3d artists are totally separate and not at all infuenced by quality of concept art  gamers do not care about art because gameplay is totally separate and not at all influenced by concept art  customers dont like originality would rather watch same thing over and over again  most profitable movies are sequels  most profitable games are clones of older games  concept art reduced to cosmetic microtransaction accessories  zbrush rapidly decreasing reliance on 2d concept art  free to play and declining revenue means everything gets worse every year for all involved  tfw drawing stops being fun
    the kids love chains    every fucking time
  i would kill myself if i had to work in concept art and it really surprises me that its a goal of so many anons here
  god the legs in syndras splash are fucked how do these artists get hired honestly same thing with that new leona skin
  liefeld begone
i havent seen any concept art that stands out and really looks exceptional aside from absolute legends like craig mullins    ask me how i know youre a tasteless blind beginner
  picasso told him to do it
what do you think of his physique his pose his clothing folds  what fabric do you think hes wearing  whats he feeling and doing
  go ask to the draw/beg threads
  i think its cute i like the way the cloth and folds are sketched out he seems to be yawning and stretching
i think its a beginner drawing drawn by a beginner who cant draw and should be posting in the /beg/ threads next time    you have no sense of form in the figure and even less in the clothing clothing takes form thanks to that which is underneath it its not just random fucking lumps and creases he could be wearing fucking saranwrap for all youve managed to convey
  nice energy on the pose and the clothes i like the line weight too looks like cotton some lines on the clothes dont make sense though to me at least like the few on the bottom of the shirt
planning on using my month of winter break to neet the fuck out and draw for 812 hours a day and gain 1000 followers on twitter by january 20  who else here /gmi/
twitter
  unless youre doing porn or fanart dont think youll make 1k followers
  1k in a month  k
best of the luck but social media does take a huge chunk of time from grinding
  making it over the winter break  yeah right
  the majority of the time the only artists i see make 1000 followers in less than a month are the artists who are already good and got their art retweeted by popular artists if you feel like you have to grind a ton more youre probably not at that level yet 1000 followers within one year seems like a more reasonable goal     heres a tip that can gain you followers a little more quickly try to study art from popular artists that are the most appealing to you figure out what makes that art look so appealing and try to apply it to your own work         often these good artists also did fanart or porn too
  hard work is not enough to get good at art you need to learn internalise and learning can only be sped up so much there will be a limit your own learning ability will pose
  bruh im taking an entire semester off except for one class which would be life drawing nude models were /gmi/ fuckin goals  starting on new years weekly vlog about improving my art and becoming the kind of artist i want to be talking about what ive been doing and how thats worked out i need to get over my fear of cameras and putting out my process  improve gesture  make anatomy second nature  storyboard keyframe and animate a video that i can be proud of  begin steady income from my art instead of random oneoff commissions here and there  6 months anons i can do this
i find it amusing that folks think 1000 followers in a month is somehow unattainable   granted you need to know how to draw things people want first
  i think its the opposite i started in may and kept a record of posting 1 drawing a day for around 3 months it served as a big motivation to draw and i would always think abiut what i would draw for tomorrow then on weekends i would draw a as many as i could to post throughout the week then i would use that free time for grinding fundies    i dont post daily anymore but i still draw everyday
  does anyone want to band together and try to get followers
  yeah im kind of confused by the responses in this thread its really not that hard if i was to do what op suggests then id probably get a couple of thousand in a month guaranteed like you said you just have to draw things people want
  suuuuure lets see those works matey  show us what we want
i propose a challenge then post your blogs when you make them fellows and see how many followers you can get compared to each other
  dont see why that touched a nerve my post genuinely wasnt supposed to be arrogant or anything im just surprised by everyones disbelief that its impossible because 1000 followers is not really that unobtainable in that period of time  personally i get about 100ish followers every time i upload i draw for things that have active fanbases and will actively check tags and seek things out if your work is good then popular people in those fanbases will rt and follow you etc  it really is about what you draw mostly i have seen some really low skill accounts get thousands of followers and engagements because they draw smash bros stuff for example you guys gotta look at whats popular and post what people want to see
  my benchmark for success isnt follower count at this moment if i get too wrapped up in that i tend to get really depressed and i start to churn stuff out just to post every day instead of trying to improve what i struggle with if i lapse a day or if a post just flops its really demoralizing   ive tried that a couple of times before burning out in less than a month this time i want to embrace the process instead and share that process
  id probably get a couple of thousand in a month guaranteed  thank god you are not arrogant    you didnt touch a nerve im genuinely interested in getting more followers thats why i asked to show what is that people want
  thats not arrogance thats projection based on the amount of engagements i currently get youll notice i said if i followed the steps op is encouraging that that is what would happen if i average 100ish followers per upload and i was to pump out art non stop in december then you do the math  well thats the answer just draw relevant things and engage with other people in active fandoms theyll help you by following and rting you and help you build a fanbase a lot of social media fame is mostly based on building connections with other people and networking
      dm me we can band up
  so you are indeed full of shit   my bad im new to this board i didnt know that the the stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood from /b/ applied to every board  carry on lad
  measuring success by popularity  you are legitimately a ngmi take it easy and enjoy your break before your heart sinks and you get depressed
    not sure what your damage is and why the concept of someone speaking from a place of experience is putting your knickers in such a twist thats really not that much and what im saying is not unbelievable in the slightest so im presuming you must be /beg/ but i only entered the thread to give honest advice up to you whether or not you take it op whatever im out good luck trying to make it
i think he is right though the onoy way to get massive traction and hundreds of followers fast is to pander to what is popular now  you want to get many followers quick prepare christmasthemed smash bros material and post it at the right time then do the same for the new year    that or get reblogged by a popular artist my girlfriend gained 700 followers the day her favorite band retweeted a fanart of them then she wouldnt shut up about musicsempai noticing her for about 2 months
  you have no control over whether people follow you or not stop setting yourself up for failure  the goal to draw more is good though
  do fanart and memes
  who hurt you
  and gain 1000 followers on twitter by january 20  you can always just get 1000 followers from brazil and russia for like 10
  lel true
from what ive heard gaining 1k followers a month really is pretty normal once youve gotten to a certain level and know how to pander    really wish i used my neet days to do that now im in a situation of dangerously low hours at work and not knowing if i should try calling in or just get more underpaid commissions i want to try grinding a presence to support myself on art but i think im out of time to do that at least for the immediate future moving soon so a real job is necessary to be stable at least at first
do you guys think its better to have a following following on twitter or instagram also are there methods ppl use to gain a following besides make art that looks like popular art      
  twitter or insta  both ideally at the moment one is no better than the other but that might change  also are there methods ppl use to gain a following besides make art that looks like popular art  you gotta figure it out by yourself in that these tips might not apply to everyone but heres a few pointers anon  dont clog your feed with unfinished shit/wips the vast majority normalfags included are indifferent or dislike wips when they see it on their feed sketches are fine but they must be clean   some hours are better than others to post  be aware of releases and try being the first to jump on bandwagons no need to do that with every franchise and bandwagon there is though if it shows youre genuinely interested in it ex make a smash artwork with a meta joke in it itll do even better and might get retweeted by bigger accounts
    cropped gay furry porn mixed with ebonics meme format    what
  you almost got me thanks grey cat
you can get 1k follows in one day with the right tag
ooh a new sadlawner everyone before you has given up good luck op we hope to see your progress
  who the original artist of that pic i hope he draws nsfw stuff
  i hope youre having some money for the carpal tunnel surgery
just dropping a quick fuck you here for whoever reported me for posting a sfw tiger man pic i thought by now 4chan had got over its hate boner for furries
  i doubt it will work
drawing for 8  12 hours a day is a meme
  what  anon im dead serious
the fuck is he making with baking soda in a pot
  i got 15k in 2 months but not on twitter
  if you arent already used to drawing at least like 5 hours a day youre gonna get carpal tunnel or burn out
  this literally got nearly 2k followers in a month due to posting daily but it was my first time drawing regularly in years now im really burnt out and im lucky if i can post a couple times a week
hi guysunfortunate events whole town got hit by a strong storm and we wont be having internet for quite long i cant use my schoolism subscription traveled 50 miles for internet connection any torrent files/links of online classes you have so i can practice offline
  practice offline  practice irl you dumb cunt
what the fuck man if this is seriously your mindset jesus
  what do you mean by ops mindset
lmao grab a pencil and paper then practice outside
  i hope you like nma   
  got hit by a storm  perfect time to draw doesnt draw because of excuses  doesnt have internet   perfect excuse to go draw from life doesnt for reasons  cant use schoolism subscription  perfect time to practice what youve learned already doesnt for reasons  traveled fifty fucking miles to use internet to download more fucking tutorials that wont make him any better  this is just veiled procrastination whether op is aware of that fact or not beginners like tutorials because they think they can shortcut thousands of hours of practice  so i can practice offline  you can practice any time any place you want he chooses not to because hes afraid of failure and has a weird arbitrary definition of how and when he can practice
anyone make money doing these kind of flat generic vector art i just did a commission in a similar style i could see myself building a small portfolio with such illustrations as a back up thing its no worse than drawin gay antrho wolf dick atleast and you can make it somewhat comfy looking
dude absolutely work like that in my experience is actually very in demand at the moment not so much in games but everything else
its no worse than drawin gay antrho wolf dick atleast  anthro shit is that bad
  i think he meant bad for your soul
  doesnt necessarily have to be vector  or even generic by any means  but flatter illustration as opposed to more rendered is extremely versatile in its usefulness to a wide variety of different things theres a reason why you see so much of it out in the world  its fast and widely appealing     i would never recommend forcing yourself to push yourself in this direction if you dont enjoy doing it but if its something that interests you then you can reliably land regular good paying commercial work    though your comparison to it being no worse than furry porn is unnecessary work like this is no better or worse than any other style of illustration  its just different and is a better fit for certain opportunities than others if you look down upon this type of work because its not overrendered digital paintings of fantasy / scifi subjects then you shouldnt even bother because that mentality is delusional  immature
    i know somebody    they work for microsoft and with web developers commercial and video games    theres definetly money to be made but its not easy
  we have to do some of this shit for a design class in my art school  theres nothing quite as boring and offputting desu our teacher said we had to do it because its easy to pickup even for untrained artists i guess you could make something out of it i see illustrations like this in ads and such all the time
  can confirm  ive found the less you deviate from the style the better it is financially  people literally just want that style and the closer you come the better it is
  hey op yea thats pretty much what i do the style in your pic is a little outdated you can go to dribbble to see whats trending now
  dribbble    thats were i found it could you direct me to a specific creator on there that better represents whats in at the moment
  dribbble    literally the artstation of ux
  recently i worked on a project where we used this  as a reference i think it reflects the current trends pretty well
  in  just a tumblr flavored version of op  if it looks like its made of construction paper then thats probably it
  jesus christ i like how apple literally ripped off the giant body/small head aesthetic and even stole the designs of the black girl and the grandmother
  how do you get people to pay for that hahahaha the shading on their faces doesnt even look like shading it makes them look like some kind of food
  this is really offputting
      i see thanks so kind of a hipster with a hispanic surname used to have a tumblr blog when i was 17 before i got a degre at the illustration school and now im sipping on my onions latte whilst lounging in a café in a gentrified neighbourhood with my macbook kind of style
commercial illustration goes through trends if you become known for doing whatevers hot right now you will find yourself out of work when trends shift  and you can then try and follow that trend never having the satisfaction of creating work you really care about    stick to your interests find your niche and you will find success    that being said plenty of people create alternate personas or brands specific to a certain style or popular aesthetic to get more work in  just dont forget who you really are creatively
  brazilian elephantiasis treatment facility christmas 1912 colorized
a good example of this style is adam avery  a classmate of mine when we did our degrees at norwich    adam had been kinda plodding along never making anything of note but sometime at the start of 3rd year he completely switches style and approach and starts making these really strong compositions flat shaped very conceptdriven illustrations this is 2011 we graduated    now you can tell he really enjoys his workflow and this kind of approach is supersuited to editorial work where the idea is more important than the technical execution of the image  it gets the concept across clearly and easily and its nice to look at    no surprises he got picked up by an agency straight away  in order to work for magazines newspapers etc you need a simple workflow to produce results quickly and no fuss to change things or completely switch tracks if some exec doesnt like something
  adam avery      nice portfolio im jealous one day ill start a sideproject like this for editorial and advertising illustration
                    
  cont  as a result his agent has landed him some fairly huge clients he did the cover for the guardian university guide a few years ago has had regular spots in wired magazine lush cosmetics etc    so in response to your question op yes if you want to make bread and butter money from art being good at flat shapes and going down the advertising/editorial route is probably a good way to do it  not only do you get given the topics to work on on each commission you usually retain the copyright should you wish to make and sell prints or other merch with your art on it
    wide like kylo ren cool good for your friend ill keep your comments in mind i forgot about the airbrush stipple approach to shading
    good stuff thank you
  agreed im getting along fairly well with my own stuff a few logos for mates starting businesses a few gig posters for promoters with tight budgets and kinda wierd surreal/psychedelic/scifi digital collage/photomanipulation album covers but if i ever want to do the art thing properly fulltime i know im going to need to prove i can do more muggle friendly stuff the bigtime art directors and agencies  and i kinda like the idea of actually sitting down and designing a new persona/brand identity to work under might make the corporate work feel less soulless lol
  interesting textures are definitley your friend when working with large otherwise flat shapes
      i find this style very unnerving its like that autistic deviant art deformed fetish stuff like the one with the long arms and the crystals
    makes me think of that guy on da who made anthro diver ocs with fart fetishes or something he drew everyone in the exact same pose with some minor difference in body shape and then wrote a fucking novel about the character to go along with it
  yeah i was thinking of that guy
  its not by apple this is studio buck theyre one of the most relevant in the industry i think
    someone post it i forgot what his full username was
  learn animation and you can make infographs with this shit and get that youtube 
  kodyboy777 it something like that he asked me for a request a few years ago
    gosh shit like this is all over behance there doesnt need to be even more illustrators copying that style
why is everyone moving on from sai to clip studio what does it have that paint doesntthats not a crutch like 3d models to trace over
  i think its mainly the fact that sai hasnt been updated in ages version 2 has been in beta for years    clip can do averything it does and they actually bother to upgrade it
  i moved to csp too like 2 years ago during a sale  better online support  i work on large canvasses once in a while and csp doesnt crash like sai does  sai is lightweight for small doodles but for bigger pieces csp is much better sai lags really bad with large pieces  free textures patterns and more brushes for printing out patterns  thats about it i guess but i bought csp during a discount anyway   iirc the guy who made sai is working on csp
  csp is to sai as photoshop is to gimp
  well first of all it has brush mechanics similar to photoshop especially since they added proper opacity instead of some scuffed opacity option when using density sai doesnt have a proper opacity brush besides the marker brush but it doesnt function like one since it doesnt overlap strokes which is crucial and when you do overlap with it with say a grey color it will fuck the entire under painting up also sai doesnt have curves and neither does photoshop and curves allows you to control ur pen pressure far better than sais linear slide bar
  yeah
  cuz theyre idiots
its on sale rn anyone know if its worth the money for the ex version
isnt the only good thing about sai the watercolor brush
  based sniff poster
i dont know why clip is so laggy and crash prone my computer can handle ps and modern games with ease its nothing to scoff at
  only if you do comics or animation
clips stabilizers feel much higher quality and my lines come out nicer somehow even with the setting at 0 so i like using it for high res pictures it can lag like shit when i use large brushes and crashes often so i use sai 2 for casual stuff also sai 2 feels very well optimized and has a superior crash recovery feature that doesnt interrupt your work every few minutes and can recover by undo history
  why is everyone moving on from sai to clip studio what does it have that paint doesntthats not a crutch like 3d models to trace over    because clip doesnt freak out and make your file unreadable after a certain size while sai just says unable to open file dont get me wrong sai is great for a free software but clip is much more stable and has a ton more features that make life easier for you if you need to get shit done and you are no longer stuck in the shounen improvement mentality where you are making things extremely hard on your self to improve better because real life doesnt wait for you to achieve your final form before you start to get shit done cruches are there for a reason and no rules just tools
  yikes getting a bit defensive there its ok anon its clear need to get shit done is always an euphemism for shurning put mediocrity
  the same way calling out others for using crutches always coming from romantic armchair experts going maximum dunningkruger
  what do you know about expertise when you use crutches and get angry from getting called out ha
  when use is there for expertise that doesnt get things done because it gets outcompeted by people using crutches ten times starving artist meme much
  /thread
  how big is big i dont lag at 7000x7000
  clip has a similar brush though it took a bit of tweaking the settings to make it the same as sais
  stabilizer  best color blender  you dont really need custom brushes  lightweight  autosave  doenst crash out of nowhere like sai  csp sketching is more satisfying than sai    thats all for me atm since i just grabbed a copy last friday    3d models arent that helpful so far though i need more time playing with the feature and im sure itll be ok
i want to lick stinky armpits
tfw im so manly doing linework on photoshop without stabilizer
  it isnt bravery its just a waste of time
  can you share your brush settings anon i cant get csp brushes to feel right
im trying to get into digital art ive been using an old form of sai that was yarharred but im also a little interested in animation     is clip worth the investment more importantly is it a monthly sub like photoshop
mfw i dont need any stabimemes to do perfect lineart    im a god
  hell no stick to sai2 like the topdogs
cos some famous gook said they use it i imagine
  more importantly is it a monthly sub like photoshop  no    didnt photoshop add stablelizer 
listen csp has some amazing shit as a comic book artist its come in all sorts of handy and those bonus materials are awesome look at this there is a line tool that can create stacks of books friggin incredible
  excellent though im using version 110 i cant put a price on free i guess      thank you for the response
  not just drawing a stack of books in their correct perspective  having to rely on an algorithm to do it for you  not gonna make it
  you can diss it all you want doesnt make the technology any less amazing when used correctly
  based
  my sides  you can replicate this shit in any art program with a few clicks
  crab
  i love using the shoelace brush someone made it and it made shoes go 10x faster and look 10x better
    i thought one of the biggest advantages of sai was that you can paint on canvases at insane resolutions with no lag because of how lightweight it is especially since sai2 is 64bit so it can take advantage of all the ram your system has
  did you mean brush  most program can do these shit with custom brushes
  muh richfag meme program
   not using krita  baka my head  i bet you use windows too or even worse a mac
  let me guess linuxfag
  guess again
  not him freebsd
  install gentoo
  im waiting for the resource rewrite  the fact that i cant bundle my brushes without it completely fucking up my tags boggles my fucking mind
  nope i did not mean brush its a custom line tool
how does clip studio fare vs photoshop
  depends on what you want clip is enough for painitng no photo manipualtion at all
  that happened to me too once the best alternative probably is to back up your resource folder even though with this method you have to manually add all your brushes back to your tags
  i have a mac so sai was never an option for me in the first place
  you can do windows apps on macs tho
  wait what how do i do that please tell me
  bootcamp mane or wine
i want to learn how to draw properly but every book i pick up on the subject tells me to buy a lot of stuff i just want to do simple drawings with pencil and paper nothing too sophisticated   is there any guide out there that teaches you how to draw with a minimal budget
  drawabox is pretty good  all you need is pen  paper / tablet
loomis
  just draw anon books are meant to fill in the gaps in your learning as you identify flaws in your works they wont function as an educational roadmap at least thats my opinion
read keys to drawing and learn to draw what you see      cheap pencil/ ball point pens dollar store pens are good 300 for 500 sheets of printer paper from walmart
  do i need to read the stuff from the site or is the playlist on youtube enough
if you want to draw  start drawing making this kind of posts on 4chan is pure procrastination if you dont have a fuckin pen  paper experiment with ur ketchup  toilet paper
loomis
  man thats daunting it feels like you need to know so much all at once and its difficult to know what you should focus on first is this just a problem in the beginning i dont want to have to deal with this indecisiveness a year down the line    most of the time i feel like im just jumping from one tutorial and concept to another with no clear direction shits confusing
my hobby is making photo realistic images of people naked  i literally throw on some classical music load up some image of a hot chick in clothing grab the wacom and paint away her clothes paying special attention to lighting and anatomy it keeps me sharp  the more difficult the better looser baggy clothing in which i need to analyse where the cloth lies and folds to accurately paint the naked figure below  accounting for the lack of a bra when naked which will result in a drop of the breasts etc  anyone else do anything like this  of course i never share them or post them online
  of course i never share them or post them online  why not
  dont see the point to be honest where would i put them have no interest in running a tumbler or dealing with inevitiable requests its not exactly something i could make money off without being shut down very quickly  sure if there was a community or group of people into it it would be fun to challenge myself or share critique but where  i just find it more interesting that the usual standard nude study also the satisfaction of lowering the opacity of the original over the nude one and seeing that everything lines up perfectly
  hey my man got any cate blanchetts you can hook me up with
  but where  um sweety welcome to 4chan where every kink is welcome post some
you fuckers i wanted to know your unsavoury habits with your art not create a request thread
  um sweetie  every kink is welcome  do you know where you even are
  not him but this is a stupid ass post whats with the influx of newfaggots its not even summer yet
actually just occurred to me would it qualify as original art since you changed the original image so much
  his  or his
this post is kinda pointless until you show us your stuff
  he asked if anyone else does that how is showing his stuff related to the topic at all
  /r/ needs you badly
post work i mean it
post your work goddamnit start with the op chick
  what a fucking weak excuse the question who else does this haha is entirely unimportant the majority of his post describes what he does and how and is just a blatant attention grab its like some ethot making a thread like sometimes i put on thighhighs and dance anyone else do that haha of course i never usually take pictures or videos  this thread is entirely useless if op doesnt post what hes described
  what a fucking weak excuse    excuse for what sounds like youre just being really bitchy for no reason other than trying to start a fight he asked if anyone else did what he does and youre flipping out calling him an attention whore and telling him to post his work go outside
  its like its a sneaky way of asking if theres anyone here who can xray the girls in ops facebook feed  before op posts his work theres zero reason for any discussion the premise isnt valid
i also would like to see your stuff
being this (((woke)))  fucking based   post your work now
fucking hell seriously nobody else does anything like this it never occurred to any of you that it might be a nice way to challenge yourself  i didnt expect this board to turn the thread into a request thread  on phone right now will post something tomorrow once im back from work gmt
  why dont you give it a shot yourself paint the clothes away
  seeing as noone else is answering your question i used to do this when in was in school but not anymore now that i think about it unless it fits the theme of the piece im doing i dont have any opinions on it i dont really give a shit what other people draw if i dont like it ill just not look at it even more so if they want to keep it to themselves
  this reads like copypasta

  will post something tomorrow  4 days ago    op is bullshitting confirmed

  what exactly is this image trying to convey
  probably teaching the face shape in perspective and shit
  i remember the thread this was made in it was about how she got fatter in the bottom picture
      thanks looks like i really missed it
  lmao why the fuck did you save that shitty gif i made    the purpose was to show how she became less cute as she got older and that the outline of the face was what was mostly responsible her jaw is sharper and she is less chubby in the top photo in which she is a few years older
  wait so she is older in the topcuter picture or did you mix things up
  the top one is less cute this is objective truth and your are invalid if you disagree
  lmao at this incel shit what kind of person who isnt an autistic psychopath judges people based on their jaw line
  your subconsciousness does the judging what this guy did was trying to figure out why he judged it so retroactively
  the top face looks flatter like someone tried to make her look asian and failed
can we have a sculpting thread    pic related is a rough sculpt of an orc head im working on

just when i finally start to gain traction tumblr shits all over my momentum    where the fuck do i even go now
make your own website 
  it does seem like a good idea but the exposure i got from tumblr was really good
  did u draw pr0n
  most nsfw artists seem to be moving to twitter
how the fuck do you draw anime this good
  good  thats just quick scribbles with basic coloring
  them milkers are to big she probably has spine problems
  mommy
  yeah no faggot
do some studies of cute anime babes and sit down with an open mind and try some workflows and basic brushes that get that look    if youre new to drawing in general itll suck regardless but keep your chin up and keep trying
  they arent large enough
  yeah yes fag
  pretty beg probably done by some westerner
  looks painful
  who drew it
this isnt particularly amazing just draw anime also her poor spine
  it was done by jap
  this is heavily heavily simplified drawing if you cant grasp how to draw that you might want to look into trade schools
  whats the appeal of backbreaking jugs serious question
  healthy breast feeding
     wants big boobs   will wreck spine   why do you want this woman to suffer  i dont think breast feeding will be satisfying when she is paralyzed because of her broken spine
  if you cant grasp simplifiedharder drawing then you surely cant grasp realisticeasier drawing  kek  realism is a prerequisite to draw nonshit anime its why most anime drawings here look like shit
  true even anime artists in japan draw from real life same goes for mangaka
  how the fuck do you draw anime this good  boobs  anime this good    look anon drawing a pair of boobs isnt that hard
  are you being ironic here isnt that the very same speech by professional chain smoker and old geezer miyazaki made and the anime was mistake meme was born from
  that doesnt happen in 2d
   isnt that the very same speech by professional chain smoker and old geezer miyazaki made and the anime was mistake meme was born from  i  f you actually knew the origins of that meme you would know that he never actually said that
  i know the origins of that meme geez his main problem was that young artists in the industry do not draw from life they draw from other animes that is what i was asking when answering 
  yes it does you just have to draw it happening
  i wont what now faggot
  its true anime is kind of a circle jerk self referencing remix culture its like watching a dog trying to catch its own tail new anime is always trying to capture the spark of the old eg darling in the franxx is just modern eva if people were more inspired by their own real life experiences than anime they watched as kids then anime wouldnt have this problem thats what miyazaki meant by draw from real life
  slaps you thats what bitch now stop making this 2d girl suffer or are you some kind of woman hating sadistic fag
  then again miyazakis own works can easily be labelled as remixes of each other as far as the plot and story goes at least after porko rosso he is also a huge unadmitted airplane otaku so his scorn for otaku is hyperbolic granted he is a bit detached from the desires of todays youth because of his age    i mean the key point of most anime is escapism from the shitty robotic life of modern japan people actively want things that are not inspired by their modern lives that is why the light novel market has exploded in the past decade and the most popular read i said popular not best animes are based on them even though their plots are 90 the same people do not want realism people want to escape from it
  that is just a stupid meme
  it doesnt happen in real life either
  how
  anon airplanes are not natural occurrences humans made them just like humans made these things
  i am sorry you are retarded
  realism is a prerequisite to draw nonshit anim  back to beg
  calling miyazaki a chain smoker shitter because he doesnt accept the cancerous weeb culture in the anime industry  eat my shit weebcuck
  implants weigh about the same amount as real breast tissue if she has those string implants they probably weigh even more your back would not snap if you had tits that large
  unless all ginormous anime titties are all just implants your logic doesnt apply here
  how exactly does it not apply do you think there has never been a woman with the same natural breast size as ops image all im saying is they would not be paralyzed or have broken spines from that size anyhow
  just practice you fucking goob
  that sanae looks weird
  this good  relative to what
  me
  it literally is dumbass do you have eyes to see  its not bad but its sketchy and has simple coloring
  no source yet    yeah no
no links  no tutorials  no nothing    what the fuck assholes i just want to draw anime
  there is no tutorial to get you to draw good immediately  analyze art from artists you like and take those little aspects and apply them to your own
  nah bro gotta grind fundies you wont be able to draw anime until youve drawn a thousand boxes in perspective and at least a few hundred realistic portraits
  well he is objectively a chain smoker and an absolute tyrant to his colleagues
animeartacademy
  i know the secret but im not sharing the good pros on here know it too and deliberately mislead you
  yes it is check drawthread
  that woman whos implants exploded in an airplane
  thats an urban legend anon
  is that hair or a hood
  how close are you to drawing the op pic 10 20

dont get fooled by the childish humor    i bought his anatomy course and holy shit he throws you way too much information not related to drawing i felt like if i was at med school at times    just look at his bucket lesson you waste a lot of time drawing learning to draw a super detailed pelvis and hampton just simplfies it as a box or cilinder    dont get me wrong proko is great in an artiss enciclopedia kind of way    but to actually learn practical stuff i found hampton way more practical an easier to digest or is it just me
  hampton just simplifies it as a box or cylinder  posts pic of proko simplifying with boxes  brainlet alert
  retard i was talkig about his pelvis lesson this one comes after the pelvis lesson
  so youre mad because he chose to give you extra information about anatomy that may be pertinent in the future brainlet confirmed
  retard everyone was complaining he was making the pelvis lesson too complex if anything this proves my point as he uses boxes after he makes you you draw a fucking bucket
    amazing you missed the point of the post retard     so you are an autistic 12 year old got it
    2 unique posters   stop samefagging idiot
  i never said i wasnt the op you retard     and i am not coplaining you autistic retard i sais i found hamoton easier    god why retards always hijack threads
  gets called out on samefaggotry  i never said i wasnt samefagging  are all third worlders this retarded
  stop samefagging idiot  no shit sherlock i am the op god you are retarded    and i am not complaining i am just sayng i found hamtpn easier jesus you cant even read
  obviosly replies as the same person op  retard feels like a genius for figuring this out    lol
prokos bucket is shit hes still the best anatomy teacher active today and its not close    stop attempting to simplify anatomy draw it as it is so you can know what looks like and what its for
torrent pls
  stop attempting to simplify anatomy    ok
  it is an anatomy course meant to further your knowledge after you got decent with figure drawing    you dont realy need all that detailed anatomy knowledge unless you realy want to master the figure beyond basics
  the problem is people are going too balls deep into simplifying aka drawing boxes for major masses then drawing simplified forms for the muscles its all too much when all they really need to focus on is surface anatomy the rest can just fall into proportions
  /beg/ here i dont really understand what you are saying desu
if you want to do art as a job why arent you practicing 8 hrs a day minimum
  i did    now im learning japanese only 4 or 5 years to go
  i only can do 46 since i have a full time job that takes 10 hours of my day away
  because im too busy thinking about you op
i did now im too busy but ive fallen in and out of having art jobs over the past 4 years
  why arent you practicing 8 hrs a day minimum  because thats a sure way of not making it anon
what does it mean to do art as a job
because i am a lazy fuck and cant stick to anything that long not even videogame s probably genetically so bad that i am ngmi it any field whether art or not
good thing i dont want to ruin the thing i love by making it my job
  are you retarded
  because i spend majority of my time working and then coming home and sleeping  and by the time i wake up its time for work again    art is for kids with no obligations and neets not well adjusted working adults
  look at this well adjusted working adult spending his limited time shitposting on the artwork critique board
  whatever makes you feel better about your lifetime of wage slavery and absolutely zero impact on anything or anyone around you
  genetics    thats an excuse anon if you want something do it
  i think youre a fucking bitch i work a basic ass 40k/yr job with shit ass benefits and ive got the will to come home and draw everyday for at least an hour and a half     maybe you just dont actually like drawing
  the ability to just do it is exactly the thing im lacking i only care about being productive and have read up a shitton of self improvement advice over years but at the end of the day im still a lazy fuck like i always was since i was a kid
  anon if you spend all your time working then come home and do nothing youre not a well adjusted adult
  not that anon but it sounds like youre selffulfilling that prophecy i used to be like you id have this mental block where i would convince myself not to draw for reasons then i started just making myself pick up my sketchbook and start doodling and eventually it would turn into actual drawing and now its a habit you have to take small steps to increasing the amount of work youre willing to do each day but you can get there you should at least try anon also possibly talk to a doctor because you sound depressed and that will take any motivation away before you even have it
  because im a fucking idiot and im legit gonna time myself and check in on this comment tmo
  because i cant do anything at all for more than 1hr at a time and feel tired all the time
that pic reminds me of japan id sure like to go back
  im tired and sleepy and horny fuck aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah why dont girls like me how can i draw 8 hours a day when all i want is goth mommy milkies aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
  i used to work two full time jobs and then come home to draw porn commissions for more money now i just live off of the porn commissions alone maybe youre just lazy and useless
i want to become good at drawing but its so difficult to push myself to practice every single day or at all  i just get swept with games and friends and then later feel bad that i got nothing done for the day    curse me for my laziness
  maybe try setting yourself a quota like 5 figure drawings a daythen at least at the end of the day you know you made a tiny bit of progress

is tracing considered as cheating if i choose to do it for the best results
shut up retard
  what is art anyways rightfucking do what makes you happy and gives you accomplishmentif pointless tracing makes you happy go fort it
  if i choose to do it for the best results    its the opposite of getting the best results you fucking moron i have never seen 1 good looking trace before tracing lacks basic fundamentals and /beg/s like you dont seem to understand
  this board is not about fucking art this board is about acquiring high technical skills
  is tracing considered as cheating if i choose to do it for the best results  no rules just tools there is no cheating
you have to be an extremely low level beginner to think that it isnt obvious when folks trace   why is it obvious because it never looks good the results are shit   however the folks who think that its an acceptable thing to do are too low level to have cultivated an eye critical enough to even notice such glaring flaws
its obvious when people trace  have been tracing my construction the whole time ive been here and have never been called on it  kek
  have been tracing my construction    have you been tracing boxes wtf does that mean anon
  this is the board where low level beginners congregate surely you dont think otherwise
  people feel too sorry to call you out itll be like telling a special ed kid that their magnum opus of a sculpture they worked on for 5 hours actually looks like a turd
  find reference  trace forms on top of it
  choosing to trace for best results  what
  basically this if you dont care about learning how to draw and all that crap just jeep tracing
no rules only tools
  a biginner of 2 months understand that it gives the worst results but whatever works for him
  if i choose to do it for the best results    why do retards not understand that being a xerox isnt the height of art  even if youre painting from a photo it looks better when you actually fucking paint it and fucking copypaste it onto your tablet  grids arent a solution either if you need proof take a look at jimmys stuff when he next decides to dump 12 gb of reaction images into a thread  you cant cheat at art if youre shit your work will work shit so just get it over with and learn to draw properly
  if i choose to do it for the best results  average viewers dont think tracing is impressive and if they found out the result will be bad for your reputation
  yes this does in fact help you with construction  its a fundamental exercise tho not something you should be doing for finished pieces
  drew struzan alphonse mucha norman rockwell
  if he was producing results like rockwell he wouldnt be here asking if tracing was legit    its a tool that some artists use with good effect but it can be a crutch just like autistically doing grid enlargements of someone elses photographs
    god norman rockwell is so terrible and creepy  guy couldnt place a figure on solid ground if his life depended on it but thankfully most people are as blind as op obviously must be
  post your work that puts rockwell to shame
  okay as soon as you post yours first so i can make sure youre somebody whose opinion i should care about oh wait you arent going to post your work first because your fallacy doesnt work that way lol
  youre a faggot and youll never have 1/100th the skill of rockwell youll sit here crying on 4chan like a faggot day after day until you finally kill yourself like you know you should ngmi
   /ic/   feeling sorry about someone    good joke
  we all know you trace your construction mcflintcock thats why everything turns to shit when you attempt to render anything
  thats nice but could you post your work so i could see if i care about anything you say first
typical day in /ic/
  this is the most embarrassing no you first i have ever seen
no tracing is not cheating anybody who says otherwise is a brainlet desu
tracing is definitely cheating cheating yourself out of ever being able to draw anybody who says otherwise is a brainlet desu
you still need to be able to draw to trace without it looking to shit 
  you sound like that youtuber holly brown desu
shit escalated quickly maybe because 90 of the good artists trace to obviously get better results especially drawing porn but want to hide the fact that they trace
  maybe you have no idea what youre talking about lol post your work master tracer oh wait you cant because you dont even draw
  trace if its for a background or something
  begone from my board cretin
  yes and no    yes in that it makes you stagnent and youll probably end up do nothing else no in that if youre in a time crunch or dont want the effort into something only meant to be in the background/12 panels its probably a better option than spending hours trying to draw it normally    its a tool like literally everything else in drawing and art you use it irresponsibly like most people do its going to look like shit
  /beg/one beginner
  i have teachers who make a living tracing lmao and i know there are tons of other people who trace 90 of their work and they make a living doing it so i guess who even cares   granted these people cant really make things up or draw appealing cartoons or anything else

what was art class like for you in high school/secondary school/at the farm
i cant remember the exact structure but it was just an omnibus of techniques mediums and prompts   i think the main takeaway from it was experimentation and drawing every day   pic related  my final high school watercolor piece
  i didnt attend one but my friends said they tried inking with nibs and some acrylic painting nothing too complex
  during high school i had both mandatory art and drawing class for two years   art class was nothing special nor serious and we got to toy around with clay wood and paint a bit for a grade  drawing class was more serious we got into many fundamental topics   the practice with perspective i got back then has made it a lot easier to get started again after discovering this board
my school was a joke erratic jumling from one medium and subject to the next with no actual instruction im glad my art teached died of cancer a few years later burn in hell bitch
  this but without the megalomania lots of scuffed up collages and textile work virtually no fundamental drawing and painting skills the workload was very high and it put me off art for a long long time i never made it to art school because of high school
  nice horse
  how old are you do you work for an art publication or agency have you ever appropriated 4chan posters work are you a gallery representative are you published or a publisher
  looking back at my secondary school classes it was pretty awful i took the 3 last years in the plastic arts option basically meaning that you get 48hrs of art per week  for the first year our class had two really good art teachers that knew their shit and could answer questions and all but werent giving practical classes like anatomy perspective just random project hopping from a medium to another with no real standards  we had an awful teacher for the last two years that basically killed my desire to do art for that time by the second year i was actively ignoring his garbage i dont have much memories of what we did with him iirc we copied images with grids for some time and were forced to use ink for a lot of his assignments oh yeah and there was a final year project consisting of 4 drawings we were supposed to do reviewed by a jury consisting of our schools art teachers and some local pedantic critic gayass i took the time to do a decent autoportrait that was better than the average of the class that means upper /beg/ tier and my faggot teacher actually told me i wasnt the one who drew this since he never saw me draw during his shitty classes as my 17yo retard of a teenager self couldnt be bothered to bring the a3 block to class still got a good grade and fucked off this school forever not very good memories indeed     all that was 7 years ago the thing is i actually think my school wasnt that bad i think it really comes down the teachers involved and that it will always be weighed down by them being forced to cater to a bunch of useless teenagers and to respect the program our shitty educational system is forcing upon them
  thats just the school system innit its maths science it and more maths and damn any kid that dares to cultivate an interest in anything else
its like i didnt even meet my art teacher he would just tell us to go outside and draw trees or whatever and then wed pass the results after class and that was it for my entire art classes
  wow this is exactly how i felt about my secondary school art classes my art teacher was a bumbling retard
the hs art classes that i took dabbed into a lot of different topics like painting clay modeling photography but oddly pencil and paper drawing was taught very little    it doesnt help that it brings a lot of painful memories i was that kid who sat alone while drawing for my final art project

  hey i was thinking about buying an gaylienware laptop but im not rich have you tried paypal credit on ebay there is an option to pay a minimum of 300 or so and then the rest is monthly payments i havent tried it but i wonder if this actually works before attempting to pay for one

cartoonist thread when youre not good enough to get by on either art or writing so you combine the two   my last cartoonist thread died coincidently enough after i didnt post for a day due to a death in the family but im back
sorry to hear that anon my condolences ive been liking these little comics and seeing how you stick with it keep it up
i was being a shit and played pokemon lets go as soon as i got home so have this old thing
i like when you post these little jokes you go in expecting to have heard a thousand times but turns out you havent keep doing what youre doing
i think im getting consistency down but now i feel like getting better ive just been doing this stuff in gimp with a wacom tablet should i stick with this or move to something else      thanks for the encouragement its the little things that brighten my day
its very heathcliffesque non humor try getting a more appealing color palette is my crit
your comics always make me smile op
  im not much of an artist is there some color theory kind of stuff i should look into
  not gonna lie i like this one
i love these comics man almost always funny
if you use only bw theyd be so much better
  i might try that
  good lord  tell me this isnt really your sense of humor
sensible chuckle
  you are not a cartoonist
  what part of the definition do i fail to meet
nothing new today im afraid im getting down with the sickness
  i love your ideas but itd definitely be better if you worked on the drawing qualitywhich is probably what that guy was refering to
was once again done in by the sinus infection another oldie
ive been wondering if i should just ditch the shading
is progress like this possible for the average person
  if you use loomis   also post your work so we can laugh at you
  could be possible if you are tutored by a great artist that focus on just one thing
  you can make a lot of progress in one month if youre a neet and do nothing else
  is this real
id honestly be happy if i managed to get to february
    actually at no pont do i think this person studied real anatomy so no loomis up to july the face is still obviously wrong on august he simply learned to imitate anime style better with decent eye positioning and hair but this person heavily used a reference for that one and still doesnt know how to draw like that on his own as evidenced by october and november those faces still look wonky like on past months because he tried a different angle      now if you ask about rendering yes that progress is possible for anyone you start mix brushing on photoshop and notice what works better after a few hours repeat for a whole year and youll reach a great level i mean you could do it in a single day or a week watching tutorials on painting in a style you like if youre already acquainted with the program  but dont be fooled that person still cant draw those faces are anime symbols he picked up and it wouldnt be bad but since he trained his rendering to a whole new level he probably thinks hes already a pro and will stop improving his drawing ability instead hell most likely keep improving on the rendering and do realistic abominations by year 2
  just download photoshop the only difference is that he stopped using paint there everything you do will look cleaner
  not that guy but to me no program makes my stuff look less clean than photoshop i only use it because i am used to it because of photo editing and gay forum banner making as a kid no idea how anyone is supposed to draw a clean line with ps
  i mean the only real progress is the rendering and its still quite poor and unsightly in the final december picture out of curiosity what is it about this progress pic that makes you feel like a lot was gained furthermore what about it makes you question its validity    i can tell you right now ive seen better progress in half the time hundreds of times myself included and if you dont believe me just visit the progress threads there are several dozen people on /ic/ alone who have advanced further and faster than your pic
  thanks for bringing me down even more the progress in the op is so incredible that i honestly didnt believe it was real ive been drawing for over 4 years now and i couldnt create the april pic
  2nding this      who is this artist
  how do you even go about drawing
  you need a waifu
  there is not much improvement in drawing/painting there but the skills about the software
  honestly this doing weekly waifu drawings not only makes me draw but makes me want to put in a lot of effort and time into each drawing
  uh ok
everyone draw ran
  source
      his pixiv is dead and this is all that remains of this picture as far as i can tell this is legit      here is a link to a bunch of images that depict a year of artists progression
  custom colors  trashed
  he stop evolution in july op  the draws after this is same composition but with differents poses
  thank god most of the ones in your link are not even close to the speed of the op
  pfff
  i think the difference from august to december is not very big in fact the drawing in august has the most appeal imo but the artists lack of understanding of forms and things work in 3d space holds them back from making better drawings
be me  only care about drawing one thing  only have to get gud at this on thing  dedicate a year to learning to draw my oc  one year later  oc looks kawaii as fuck    just grind one thing for a year and youll get good at it op
  hey man do you take commissions
    he stopped improving around august thats what you get if you dont grind the fundies and keep on drawing weeb stuff
easily
  i meant to delete my file before posting that but since i did i started drawing seriously feb 2016 with this trash    im currently plateauing though
  kek
  i kind of want to see /ic/s artists like tealmemeschlocktheartistknownasbb and those tower girls illustrayor progress
  did you reverse the numbers either way thats at most a month of the op
  if thats without ref your first drawing trash is a lot better than mine after a few years
  it looks like you spent 95 of your effort on the buttcheeks and 5 on everything else im not kidding the ass looks great and everything else looks like puke
  pretty accurate i didnt and probably still dont understand coloring fabrics that well also abused blur tool a lot for shadows
  i meant the drawing not the rendering
im bored post your best work and ill do a master study of it dont care what it is could be your worst work
  ok ill post some stuff for you brian
  please im so bored
      paint this
  draw this
    please dismiss your shiny bum from this thread
  not bad brian not bad
  wow thanks so much
  didnt think you would do it but you are a based op
  is based a macro now    i keep seeing it or do people just use it now
  shitpost more anime for me to draw
not a drawing but draw this legend
  bless up based thanos statue
  draw this next     your thinking to hard about it based is just a quick and easy way to say you think someone is cool or well grounded in their priorities
  i didnt write the gibberish language not worth the effort
  thats no problem now draw this
  your boob is kinda fucked up
gj on my armored boi anon
  idk why this one was so hard the image was really small and blurry on my phone though so maybe it was that
  when you was learning to paint did you study values first or just jump straight into painting i was thinking about doing more traditional still life paintings with acrylic to learn color theory    im my drawing ability and understanding of values is still at a very /beg/ level though maybe ill practice color with acrylic paint and values with charcoal
  these are more fun to draw than the animu
  i got better at drawing first try to shade everything and be purposeful with your lines and values helps to keep your canvas small when you decide to start painting though
   i didnt mean to make it hard but i guess its a good thing means you are working out youre drawing muscles here is something new to draw
  im flattered  my last one
can you outdo me
do me do me
taking a break right now to draw stuff for my friend gimme a second
  sweet baby jesus why pick your worst work
dont half ass it
  why does she have an eyebrow above her eyebrow
tried to make a classical looking painting and failed miserably maybe you can make it look better
its not my best but im curious to see how you do it
  
  just woke up and need coffee so this ones kinda half assed
draw this
okay then
    mine now
painted a black guy
  black people have more of a sloped nose    the guy you drew looks like a arab with big lips
  his brain must be very small
  well yeah
  whoa stereotype much
  oh hey /pol/ is still leaking  whats even the point of critiquing something like this
  so you dont think its good
    very nice i like black people and im not even black
  i dont i dont know if youre op but ill assume you are  the two point lighting is okay but it has major inconsistencies and the lack of contrast and strong shadows makes it look like a turd with eyes you also drew in full profile so its difficult to critique your use of form because you didnt really use it outside of your muddily painted ear which again lacks any contrast as a caricature the exaggeration is honestly striking which is good but its hard to tell if this was racially motivated which would just show that you have poor taste the comment makes it even more likely that this was done by a /pol/tard    so yeah aside from perceiving racism which is subjective and i cant really critique you on its an unfinished caricature and i dont know what you want me to say outside of finish rendering it
    lacks features    basically you just need to use reference
  this one is right      this one doesnt understand common racial characteristics which reminds me of artists who draw nonwhite people by minimizing their racial features which is in a roundabout way racist
  so i cant draw a black person without the assertion of racism this is where were at in 2018 sad
  fuck off maxmushroom
  even named your file nijpg  i give you valid criticism and even give you the benefit of the doubt by not assuming youre a racist and thats what you reply with    just how fucking retarded do you have to be to show your hand this bad sage and hidden
      /thread
draw white guy  change his skin to black at the last second  call it representation  anime is really guilty of this
  damned if you do damned if you dont
  its shit next
  why are you so triggered by skin color
  man you got some issues do you see racism and politically correct shit everywhere its just a guy i painted that happens to be black sorry ive offended you sheesh
  can you lay it on any thicker
better than anything illustrat ever painted
its another all blacks look the same episode  its another you have to caricature black features or the character isnt actually black episode  its another anime characters are white not idealized featureless moeblobs that dont resemble a real human being episode    why am i even taking the bait guarantee none of you can draw at least youre white though right
  im triggered by the lazyness of that and other examples they didnt even try just changing color skin isnt enough to make your character black there are certain features or something
  there are certain features or something    like what anon
  this thread is going to be so deleted
  at least youre white  first of all no second how about you actually address a criticism directly instead of being a passiveaggressive little bitch know how to reply
  who the fuck are you maybe you specifically anonymous are not white but lets not pretend it isnt mostly sad white dudes perpetuating these /pol/bait threads and i find it hilarious youd take the moral high ground with me if you had any part in the bait what  criticism no points have been made just typical retarded echo chamber polshit
this thread should have 0 replies so the fucking op realizes he should post his fucking drawing in the draw fucking thread    or we could have moderators that do their job
  who am i who are you totally beside the point on 4channel thats the point of anonymity   what criticism  you didnt even look 
you know i could ask if your rcdarts but then i rember if you were her youd make the eyes small as fuck but over all it is really good rendering and a good cararacture
  who is this
    technically we all do look the same its just that most blacks just absolutely hate themselves and find some creative way to make themselves look different from others somehow the women change their wigs every week and then men grow out their hair to braid it into dreads or whatever is in your pic     i honestly dont know why i was born black i just despise myself and want to die what is the point of god doing this to me if im just a white man in a black meat suit it could be worse i mean at least i was fortunate to be middle class and have both of my parents but i just really hate being black
  his idea of a common black man is a criminal with closeset eyes and a cartoonishly thick neck    why should i argue with you in good faith when you wont do the same with me ive seen these retarded arguments a million fucking times theyre like a million past lives to me somebody calls an obviously racist caricature racist then you play dumb and act like that monstrous shit in the op looks like any healthy human being on the planet you call me passive aggressive and maybe i am but its just something you learn when dealing with the same tired shit year in and year out ill debate you when you learn some nuance but frankly this was never the place for it which is the real issue    heres something to think about on the off chance youre being genuine with me though why must black features be exaggerated frequently to the point of grotesqueness for the character to read as black but white features can be downplayed or outright ignored yet the character is still considered white it doesnt even matter if canonically the character is white people usually white will insist the character is white because in their mind beautiful and delicate features  white features it gets so fucking absurd that you get guys like   saying a darkskinned character isnt black is in fact white painted black because they dont meet their checklist of stereotypical black features you literally cannot imagine a black cartoon character without huge pink lips please justify the double standard to yourself
  epic larp
  no i am legit black do i have to take a picture of my hand or some shit what is the point of proving that anyway
    thats really sad anon theres nothing wrong with just being black and im a /pol/ poster there are lots of amazing black people and nothing innately wrong with the race you were born into    this is why multiculturalism is bad it leaves people feeling alienated you have value and shouldnt despise yourself
    im unattractive and have none of the good genes my brothers have im basically the shit end of the genetic spectrum on top of being the worst race in the world all i have going for me at this point is drawing to silence the void of ending it all
  i dont understand why a caricature is racist for exaggerating features it would be like doing a caricature of conan obrien without touching the hair    features are what makes people recognizable if you have conan large lips and a broad nose it would stop people from connecting the drawing with conan in their mind
  it kinda sounds like you were bullied/rejected on the basis of race and internalized it along with typical low self esteem i guess i dont know you though but that shit isnt healthy or normal honestly if i were you id get off this site its only aggravating the issue
  arjuna from fate
  it kinda sounds like you were bullied/rejected on the basis of race and internalized it  i was bullied by my own kind for not wanting to associate with them growing up whatever little interaction i had with white/asian classmates wasnt awful some were friends some were friendly banter friends but no race stuff /pol/ never was a topic of question in my life and ive been actively browsing 4chan for 9 years    aaaanyway i was just responding to whatever post was above im going off on a tangent as im a little depressed
  im the anime pic guy its all about facial structure and hair my dude im not exactly no no im not specifically referring to lips the entire face varies between races asians have a very unique face and so do black people from different countries i recognize that much but white black and asian people we all have certain preset faces that define us not just specific characteristics and latin people too you can just know when someone is from latin america mixed thatd be    it might be impossible to find this exact same face in a white or asian guy lets not fool ourselves and i think accurately representing these features without making it a caricature is an interesting topic to discuss on /ic/ i know i struggled when i tried to do a black female friend and i found myself awkwardly drawing it like blackface there should be a better way to do it but straight up drawing a white person and coloring it black is lazy
  youre comparing an individual to a race see how i criticized the notion that all blacks look the same thats the problem if your primary purpose in a conan obrien cariacture was to play up his white features your idea of what those are then yeah thats racist it can be incidental to your primary purpose which is to represent conan obrien as a caricature but why would it be your main purpose why would you stereotype an individual when trying to exaggerate his unique features    thats my problem for a lot of people all blacks look the same and if a character doesnt meet their arbitrary checklist of black features they dont count as black white characters are never considered with the same scrutiny in fact white is the default the standard a character never has to prove his whiteness its simply assumed it gets to the point when fucking zootopia characters apparently read as white to some people actual comment i saw yesterday which i took to include the water buffalo voiced by idris elba
    you used to have a great culture with music arts and dancing before the jews unironically bastardized it all with degeneracy after the chronic album theres nothing wrong with being proud of your race stop self loathing just because your skin pigmentation is darker you can still achieve great things dont be fooled by the leftist media suggesting that youre oppressed they want you to believe youre at a disadvantage so you can remain angry and they can keep your vote
    though you might be right i once read that anime characters look asian to people from japan they werent made to look western on purpose thats just my own assumption they only look asian to me if they have a samurai ponytail or something else to identify them like that about the face im not sure whatd make them look asian to me
  his idea of a common black man is a reaction image  what the fuck no its a funny picture i didnt even know he was a criminal i was just thinking damn this dude is neckpilled as fuck see pic for what i mean   as for a possible doublestandard heres what im trying to point out the insistence that nonwhite characteristicslike slanted eyes broad noses fuller lips hooked noses should be minimized is implicit commentary that white is normal and desirable and that nonwhite characteristics inherently debase a characters design and make it offensive   white characters are stylized with a lot more freedom but artists that hesitate to draw nonwhite characters as nonwhite use white characters as sort of a baseline template for what normal looks like   i dont want more rcdarts shit to be considered normal or good art but i also dont like creative freedom being restricted by taboos around race theres a general trend in animation for example toward more streamlined less creative design and that coincides with the inclusive idea to minimize differences in character designs based on not just race but also sex its really samey and for the wrong reasons
  okay well why didnt you want to associate with your own kind it kinda sounds like you came at them with your own unfair preconceptions and dont tell me its because all of them were ghetto hoodrats i went to 80 black schools and managed to find black white and latino friends who shared my interests and sensibilities      its so weird to me that youd choose that pic of a black american with clear euro ancestry as your example like im not denying skull differences but are you seriously saying out of the billions of asians and whites you cant find a single one with a face like that believe it or not skull differences themselves are just trend if a strong one youll find surprises in every group human diversity is not that clear cut    now for your anime pic is that guy even supposed to be black because i agree he doesnt really read that way but that probably wasnt the intent he looks indian to me or something heres an example of anime character who does read as black and without stereotyping him or drawing his entire head shape in a different way from the rest of the cast
  yeah he is indian and thats a good example nice work here
  leave burgerland boi it doesnt matter outside of burgerland
  the whole dont count as black is an issue i see more with black people than whites
  well my bad your argument just set off some red flags ive grown accustomed to recognizing but you seem genuine    i think were talking about the same subject and taking a slightly different view on it youre saying nonwhite features shouldnt be avoided for fear of offending/stereotyping and that white shouldnt be seen as the norm i agree with that my stance is that a lot of what gets grouped under white features isnt actually white but a generic simplified ideal anime for example and we only see it as white because were culturally biased to even nonwhites growing up in western countries arent totally free of this bias when you get people racializing zootopia characters as white like i mentioned above i think that points to a bias    though im not sure how afraid people are of exaggerating in and of itself i mean tumblr is kinda known for exaggerating nonwhite features and theyre heavily socially progressive its a certain type of exaggeration like the op that reeks of stormfront
  pretty much just this other than that i like it op
  wahhh wahhh racism wahhh  fucking hell m8 do you even know what site you are on
  black skin does not equal black person sorry my dude but black people do have racial characteristics that are very prominent but if you would rather be racist and just recolour white/ asian people instead of actually having black characters go ahead ya fucken hypocrite
  black skin does not equal black person
  white skin does not equal white person sorry my dude but white people do have racial characteristics that are very prominent but if you would rather be racist and just recolour black/ asian people instead of actually having white characters go ahead ya fucken hypocrite
  i dont think that white should be seen as the norm in a country like japan i think that if white seems like the norm in our cultureim assuming us its because our culture is marked by a european heritage that seems fine to me i dont feel excluded because up until 20 years ago i literally didnt exist   if i want representation of my racial makeup ill do it myself and i expect that to be okay theres nothing wrong with black people drawing black people white drawing white exc and there is no shortage of black creative people creating good art they can represent themselves i think thats dignified   i think that we diverge in our opinion about white being normative in american culture but i think that if cultural change is organic theres no reason to fight one way or the other art will reflect the artists as it should   a lot of the beef artists have is being told what they can or cant do with their art thats the long and short of it unless youre a social engineer in which case you create art to serve an ideological goal and youre probably okay with the restrictions that ideology places on you
  you have nice hands anon dont kill yourself just yet
  i agree those hands are for drawing theres nothing to regret about being black if youre unsatisfied with how youre perceived or how your community is be a model and shape yourself into your own ideal   im not thrilled with other members of my race and it has everything to do with their selfhatred and their dominant worldview so i live my life opposite of their worldview and i behave in a way that i think is befitting of a noble human being i cant change what group i belong to biology is eternal but i dont have to because what they do doesnt dictate what i do and maybe one day i can help to wake them up and realize that hating yourself your parents and the society that gave you life is the opposite of noble and good and maybe one day ill be the kind of person to show them that we can be something great and that no one is really holding us back
can all of you idiots just shut the fuck up about race and start talking about the drawing anyways id recommend looking at a reference first the forehead is really short and the jaw line is extremely feminine compared to the rest of the face enjoying the colors you might want to add some more contrast though im no expert so dont take everything i say as 100 fact keep on working good luck
  be a good man and breed out your race by breeding with only white or asian women
bump  still looking for validation critiques
  validation critiques  read dick sucking
draw a picture that looks like a cartoony person with black skin tone  thread devolves into racism discussion  this is why you should never include black characters in your media you made no matter what all it does it take away from the message and its not the fault of black people its societies obsession with raising race above way more important personal characteristics that is the root of the problem
  i just despise myself and want to die  we can only hope
    that you die i mean not me
  i bet you thought that comment was really smart or something but it wasnt and is proving a nonpoint try again
  i bet you thought that comment was really smart or something but it wasnt and is proving a nonpoint try again
   theres nothing wrokg with your race   unless its jews    moron
   no u    you smell like poopoo and your mom did a doodoo
  serious answer youre attacking a strawman i never said that shit that black skin  black person read the thread or hell just read the post you replied to more carefully
  i know what i attacked you were copying a post you replied to because you thought his point about black skin / black person is stupid it is not    black people as americans and europeans refer to them  are mostly focused on the wester and southern subsaharan africans black people have tons of variation and distinct festures from bone to skin level if your only measurement for the racial differences of people is their melanin levels you literally do not know a single thing about anthropology and apparently east asians and eurooeans are the same cause they both have white skin
  so youre not him because his point is stupid its stupid because i never said that that black skin  black person in fact i argued the opposite but you and he didnt carefully read the relevant post    or any of other posts in which i repeatedly said all blacks do not look alike    so you missed that
  dont get depressed about it youre where a lot of white people are right now feeling bad just because of their skin which is down right stupid   nearly everyone you meet on this planet is an idiot black or white racists or not just rise above it and be proud of you be a great you you cant be anyone else thats what makes a worthy human
  honestly anon just give up theyre arguing in bad faith    the real way to win is to tell them to post their hog
  not a /pol/ poster you can have opinions like most black people share common features like brown eyes kinky for lack of a better term hair and broad noses without disliking black people
  you knownwhats the real irony thou none of this is even about actual racism aka discriminatiory policies and treatment based solely on race this is a cultural war of white people virtue signaling against each other i alwaysbthought the most desrructive thing about white oeople is how much they hste each other more thsn sny other race actuslly hates them i do believe this is a problem with all rsces thou the more you look and act alike the less you seem to trust each other
  you drew lively eyes thats great  add some jewelry
      dont be like that anon im black as well and i dont let it get to me theres no reason to hate yourself i used to be bullied for not acting stereotypical but i dont let it get to me so what i cant play sports and i draw anime a lot it makes me happy and thats all that matter keep on living keep on loving life is going to have its lows that just what it means to be human
  jesus christ
  hol up  is that garand thumb
  based and redpilled
  me too  i have draw a refugee    my village used to be white  but since a few years they are everywhere    i i do not like them because they often do mean to us 
  i wish i was black and not that average geeky white boy desu but i dont live in the us so maybe its harder to be black there
  funny i was just thinking that if a white person drew this it would be considered a racist stereotype but if it was drawn by a colored person it suddenly becomes brave and inspiring and whatever see those recent benjerrys ice creams
  maybe you specifically anonymous are not white but lets not pretend it isnt mostly sad white dudes perpetuating these /pol/bait threads  just let me be a prejudiced racist piece of shit in peace already  the fact that you dont even realize your own hypocrisy is just sad
  quit being retarded /pol/ is always the first to pull out black crime and iq stats i bet you never speak up then do you im pointing out that /pol/ is overwhelmingly populated by white neonazis which is a fact they themselves will admit even if they deny the nazi part i never even condemned racism by the way what an utter waste of effort on this website instead i pointed out a double standard that even a racist should find ridiculous
  christian is this your art
my god  this thread is 5 days old and its at the top of /ic/ again     you people are still here cant you see whats happening to us sage and hide this thread immediately get back to just draw before the gains goblins get you for good
  bless
on a scale of 110 how do you rate your own art talent
1 being a childs scribbles and 10 being michaelangelo id say im about a 2 or 3
a 4 with photo reference 10 from imagination
  same
  1
  interms of anime i think a good 6 or 7
11/10  witness true art you could learn from me no need for thanks
  but truthfully though i think its 4/10 and thats after i received help from other anons
  3 doesnt help that im a lazy cunt too
  kind hard to measure talent   but if you mean skill then probably between 2 and 3
  2 because i can feel the form
  blonde twintails with an ahoge carrying a bomb
  1 mentally retarded  5unremarkable  10god like  so id say im slightly under average4  pic not related
  probably around 3 steadily climbing up
  10/10
  a straight 8 but with the endurance of a 2
  blonde pregnant loli
  maybe 5 after all it took me ten years to reach a decent level
i normally draw at a 6 but i can go to a 10 no problem
creativity 10  actual skill like a 2
  if kjg is a 10 im probably a 3 or a 4
  5    7 on a good day
  talent  a flat zero  i got to where i am through practicing and building a skill not being innately talented the only talent i really have is having an overactive imagination for visualizing things and willingness to be creative  skillwise im like a 3
  if i put effort in i can not hate my own work otherwise my stuff looks like a literal nonartist could have made it
  having visualisation  thats not 0 then
  talent is a fucking meme you big dummy
  somewhere around a billion
  4
  i dont deserve to be alive/10
    honestly i can make pretty good looking stuff but i still rate myself as one because i cant do shit without good references
  dumb egg poster
  considering im more of a writer that likes to draw on the side id say 34 maybe 5 when i actually work harder
if 1 is the lowest then probably a 1
  youd think it would be backwords
10/10 otherwise whats the point
  what anime is the girl in op from
  really it is so hard to draw from imagination for me
  3 maybe 4  not good by any means but im better than a complete nobody and maybe some beginners
23 given the amount of work i have put into it the results are rather unimpressive
about 5 id say theres something there but im not very attuned
  5  1 on a good day
  2 or 3
0 being an adult normie  maybe 2
  u always have interesting characters original 10/10
  ptsd flashbacks of tierlists ensue
  i use a base11 number system and id give myself either a 7/11 for when i make art that is at the tier of a 7/11 hotdog with nacho cheese on it or a 9/11 when i make art that is at the tier of lifealtering acts of terrorism
3 or 4 maybe wouldnt call my shit good but its not super hard to look at
  thats really funny jimmy jokes aside id give you a solid 2/10 you certainly have established your skilllevel without a doubt through hundreds of paintings with little sign of artistic talent or progress so my rating is more or less based on your ability to copy a photo using acrylics not everyone can do that     inb4 12 paragraphs of le base 11 system gaggelygoofball jimmy behind seven proxies of irony  post it on reddit
  thank you so much
if 5 is a unremarkable artist meaning totaly average then probably 4 im that close to being well just unremarkable enough  with references or a model i can get to 6 on a good day  of course reaching 7 or 8 will take exponential time now
  this
  thats no how base11 works
  zombieland saga
  eh probably a 4 or a 5 maybe a 6 if im putting in a lot of effort
  2
  this   being talented is for the weak anyways haha ha ha
3 at best
  56 good enough to cinch a holiday job as an illustrator like 2 years ago
you all should shut up and follow   its not good to look down on yourself artist should have more ego
  obviously ur gonna measure it when ur puttin in the effort no otherwise thats literally like measuring a flaccid penis  either way id really love to see an exampe of your high effort work just for curiositys sake
  no you arent    1 being the learn to draw manga american books and 10 being the guy from berserk or kim jung gi i doubt you are a 6 let alone a 7
  id take about a 45 when im feeling cocky 3 on most days
  id probably say about a 4 maybe 5
55 to 7 on a good day
  56 with reference 34 without
1 or 2
i put my sketch book in the microwave for about half a minute
  this post sums up this entire thread
6
    dont dodge my post lil nigga
after drawing on and off for about 2 years id give myself a 335
i started this year and i fucking suck    but im not quitting and im gonna get decent one day
about a 7
  well im better today than i was yesterday
  a light decent to strong 6
either a 5 or a 6 as i am now  im better than the average person but i havent seriously trained my artistic skills since i was a kid    working on that now though hopefully i can be in tip top shape by 2019
a 6 maybe
  like a 6
  3    out of 20 maybe
  what do each rating mean
  67 halfway through the piece  23 after ive finished it
    im probably around 354 now at least on my scale system and the artists i want to be like i think i have a sense of design and imagination but still lack a lot of basic knowledge and draftsmanship skill    at least im much more driven now so im improving fast
  0
  based
  replying yourself is cringe worthy your shit sucks btw
5  1scribbling  2 doodles  3 symbol drawing  4 copying cartoons  5 copying real life  6 copying multiple references  7 original work  8 color theory composition stylization  9 polish  10 confidence
bout a 7 but those last 3 are a bitch to achieve
  4 because i literally cant finish anything
2 or 3
  what a low scale any mediocre artist would be a 10
id give myself a 9/11 at anime drawing skills
  anime  are you sure
  heck yeah im basically japanese now after drawing 
im still drawing with paper/pencil so 0
  my font looks really ugly but i would still say im about 3
  you and me brother
  34  i dont want to be one of those overly negative artists that always put themselves down but im also realistic with myself
  6 sometimes 7 very rarely 8
  you and i should join forces i have decent skills but my subjects are too generic
  not everyone can do that   you
  these are disgusting dude pls stop
  u kno he wont    dont feed the troll
  aww poor girl you prefer your art image boards to just be a wall of text of anonymous children saying how good they think they are with no pic related ah bloo bloo for you nerd ngmi
  troll  im a goblin you stupid frick read a book maybe
  better than illastrat
  youre so fucking silly bro
3 but i really want to get better
  if one is deviantart preteen and 10 is that godlike chinese guy maybe 4
  negative ten
      i dont like these
comparing to myself in old works id say im in a pendulum of 69 thinking in my goals im around a 2 so much to learn but the burnout is real
  56    i mean ive only been drawing for 2 years
  i rate my talent at 34  i rate my dedication and hard work at 8 which is the only proper factor that can help you make it talent alone wont do you any good
  probably like 03 my friends say my art is really good which probably means its a 03
itt    id fuck me
  a few months ago a 1  i guess now a 15
  9 if were talking about talent i saw people telling me itd take 10 years to be like murata or whatever but looking at my own progress my art gains are amazing in just 5 months im already confident i surpassed everyone who  was good at drawing  but never bothered studying the craft in depth and i can do any character decent enough    for example ive never drawn ironman or the hulk or a wolf but if someone out there in college told me to sketch one id do a good enough job they would think im a pro im fucking amazing i can do anything goddammit im so good this all without references thats the key being able to draw without reference because you just know how bodies are supposed to look is the greatest feeling    and im sure this isnt just me being high progress is undeniable and i fail to see myself progessing slower as long as i have objectives to work towards ill be a master in a year or two im fucking better than all of you and if im not ill eventually be i am evolving i am growing stronge
  post your work
  is this brian
skill 18  imagination 81    overall talent rating 46
  what youre seeing now is my normal state this is a 6  and this this is what is known as a 9 that has ascended past a 6  or you can just call this a 9  and this is to go even further beyond
i feel like im always a 4 no matter how much i improve
compared to the average layman maybe a 6 only because an art teacher told me i was above average creative wise 23
3
like a 43
  this this this this this thisssssssss  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  fucking kill me  cut my face  i dont deserve to draw
  are you also lonely by any chance
i feel like i can attain a 4 within a year or 2 as long as i continue studying the fundies aka anime
  who gives a fuck the sooner you stop mythologizing and romanticizing imaginative drawing the better for one imaginative drawing is endgame if you keep using reference youll eventually get there two most professionals generally only forgo reference for basic compositional sketching and thumbnailing its common practice for comic book artists to take photos of themselves and literally trace their own poses the goal is to create a good finished image not to wank yourself over how you got there
  id say im trash/10    eternally a beginner
  whats the thing on the left of the head
 wrong   wrong   wrong   wrong   right   wrong   wrong
id say 5 6 if im really into it
5
im a 1
  solid 7
  sorry meant to type 7
  actually judging the rest of this thread i rated myself a number too high
  savage but i probably deserve a little bit of getting yeeted on for posting mediocre stuff
about a 45
id rate myself about a 1 2 on a good day
  6/10 as in a failing score
like a 02 at most
currently at 5/10 looking to improve
  6 better than 2 years ago but still not great
1
  epic fail im sooo bad haha this is just a doodle i didnt spend anytime on it even haha    yeah guess youre right you really suck dick give up
  i spent an hour or so on it looked up multiple refs and even then i still didnt get the drawing i wanted i took two irl drawing workshops for concept art related stuff recently and seeing the work of other art students and how hard they grind was humbling other students follow the concept art trends very well everyones using blender and eevee now but i dont even feel interested in those things     i wanted to be a character concept artist but seeing the competition makes me realize just how far behind i am so when i think about a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of how far i am from that goal i think im at a 1 also it takes me a long time to learn things and for the amount of time ive put in ive gotten back very little
2 but i work harder than all of /ic combined  watch me as i leave you in fucking dust u fucks
probably like a 2 to people better than me  a 7 to people just starting  and a 4 in my own eyes
  a 9 maybe
4 maybe most of my drawings are ok but they are really ruff and generally un polished
a few months ago i wouldve said like a 7  right now im feeling a light to decent 1
  hey you aintt tokiya
    stop the humble brag aaaaaaaaaaa
  here you get a 9 too for having good taste
    talent solid 1  art skill 34 maybe still trying to understand the direction i want to take
  2 but its awfulness adds to the overall mood and aesthetics    i love sailor moon
  god i wish this was me
  i love this so much want to make something with a similar color palette and vibe
talent wise probably like a 2 but skill wise i think ive gotten up to a 6 maybe 65 so better than average but not by much at least for me
  you should check out tokiya sakuba then because this is pretty much a trace of an old piece of theirs
  oh and the pallete is blending layers its extremely easy to fuck with color pallete in photoshop
  this is pretty nice but you need to do something with the lineart what style are you going for is this the finished piece also under the arm on the left side of his body i have no idea what is going on kind of makes him look like his body is barrel shaped fundies and lineart practice and youll make it in no time
depending on what anons rating i compare myself against it goes from 14 i guess i mostly just wish i had the resolve to draw more than one thing every quarter year
  a 3/10
with this  as the scale a 4    with this  as the scale a 4
sketches 7/10   finished digital work 4/10 5/10 on a good day  finished traditional work 65/10
id rate 5/10 if im drawing using a reference 78/10 depends how long im given to draw though
like a 6/10
  how long have you been drawing for
my overall talent is probably like a 4     my talent for working smart can fluctuate between 68    pic related is just a study
  35 it drifts i would give it a 1 at best but at the very fucking least grasp the basic fundamentals
  almost a year and a half now its frustrating
  stop shitposting any time now
  i want to get paid to draw like krenz but im nowhere near his level of ability i dont compare myself to other students
  im probably inbetween 3 or 4
10
whats the point of this thread
    you dont have to intesively look at krenz work to know he doesnt draw with fully opaque brushes
  probably a 45 overall not complete shit but then again i barely draw much to begin with
hmmmm 65 and i gain extra 05 pointed each every month cause am gud
  nah mate it looks like a 3/4
  2 to me
it feels a tab bit narcissistic or self pitying to rate myself but if i were someone look in id rate it a 5/10 4 if im finally really depressed or 6 if i feel like a egotistical douchebag     its average sometimes above average but sometimes below average points deducted for boring poses lack of backgrounds and one trick pony syndrome i just do character designs
  thats like an 8 dude
  lol
    thats a 2 3 if we are lenient
i dont really know maybey 5 or high 5 idk what do you guys think
   this man gets me 
  4 or 3 maybe 5
  34
   i hate practice and rush everything most of the time 3 mostly or 4 on a really really good day  also this piece of shit drawing is mine
face it the only way to make it as an amateur with no connections is lewds the sooner you realize and internalize that the sooner you will progress
im learning how to draw just for lewds checkmate fag
  no kidding
i guess this is somewhat relevant i think this is the most viewed profile i can fine on artstation and a lot of others dont even come close his stuff isnt that great but his compositions are good so i guess people like story telling/properly placed elements more than anything els
  isnt that guy the tracer dude    ahahhaa it is  
  lol didt know about this god he sucks
  to be honest these just look like heavy referencing
  oof
  the only real question is where you post it
  are you like 30 serious question
  it doesnt make it okay when youre focal points of pictures are heavily referenced with almost 0 thought of your own
just do lewds as a side gig while you build up a respectable portfolio for real jobs      i dont think ledditors understand what tracing means it just looks like he photobashes and relies too much on ref instead of designing on his own wojtek does that too
  lmao the state of conceptfags
  deviantart/insta/twitter/patreon
  this follow market demand
  and that is exactly what ive been eagerly avoiding to do lewds are for faggots
  amazing original post
  this is not tracing you retard
   the fuck
  tell me anon how much more would he need to do for you to consider it tracing
  he would need to trace
  this board loves tracing so they should be worshipping him right
who are some of yalls favourite artists in need of inspiration atm    pic is egon schiele
percy kelly he made a lot of dark landscapes that are bleakly atmospheric life in britain is like how he says it is in his art naive visionary small dedicated following
pleb taste coming through    piotr jablonski fav out of those if i had to choose  satoshi matsuura  some guy that goes by jie gaoart on artstation  theo prins
    just looked him up really interesting work    caravaggio always one of my faves i wish i could use light as well as he does also that i had a modicum of talent but w/e
  im not big on michelangelo merisi i find him dull id prefer titian zurburan
    i think my appreciation of caravaggio has to do with watching a documentary about him when i was really young and the symbolism involved in his paintings that deal with things like his seeking forgiveness/atonement add a lot
  yayoi kusama  i saw this in person and it just fucked my shit up
david bomberg 
  i was knocked back when i saw some of his landscapes of spain theyre above and beyond anything ive seen in my life really
    looks like shit lmao
at the moment i really love david hockneys landscapes and life drawings
  you had to have seen it it sucked the air out of the room it was amazing

i am kinda a newbie with drawing been practising for about 4 years now and though out that time i cant seem to maining a social media following what do you guys recomend i should use and how i keep updateing   pic not related working on a character for a furry for cash
  any tips for maintaining an audience for your art    persistently product good works of art
be good in art and in character
  maintaining a following is a combination of the following    do work that people will want to share with others    no one will follow your original stuff if they arent aware of you and the way people become aware of your niche stuff is you have to first appeal to a broader audience     so if you draw furry stuff draw a ton of appealing sfw pokemon fanart or whatever you feel capable of producing good work for people who like your style will dig deeper and find your stuff    consistent good output    awareness is multiplicative the more people see your stuff the more likely they notice that youre making stuff they should see maintain a schedule where you make stuff as frequently as you comfortably can its how you keep and build your fanbase    be a good person and know when to stfu    this section sucks because its just a fact of the modern internet people like people who do good things and are kind who are like them and who they feel they can get along with the easiest way to damage that feeling is making things too real too quickly this means knowing when to stfu     for example if you wanna be known for your art and generally popular avoid directly discussing politics religion and economics people disagree violently about these issues and picking fights here is unrelated to your art and will alienate a lot of your possible fans you can tell jokes and hint at your thoughts on these issues but if you wanna be popular dont wave it in peoples face by making sweeping and unignorable statements on issues or be meanspirited     dont shittalk other creators even if you dont like their work or you think they have bad opinions because a lot of your fans probably share those bad opinions its okay to say their work isnt for you because its true     if you are going to break these rules have two channels of communication one for your main stuff and another for private thoughts so people can choose to ignore when youre being stupid

title
  legally you could be sued by the copyright holder if youre drawing and distributing art of their ip but itll never happen    you the artist retain copyright of the individual work that you create unless you transfer copyright ownership of it to the client  things get tricky when your make art of someone elses ip though this is my understanding you hold copyright over the work itself but the ip owner holds the copyright of the characters in the work and thus can order you to remove it or sue you or both
this  anon is right  /thread
i know this sounds dumb since shit like order of the stick exist but i cant help asking myself should i do webcomics now or just wait until i get better to tackle them
  only do it if its fun if you are concerned with skill at least spend some time every day studying fundamentals
if you are a great story teller dont hold back
  depend on what kind of webcomic you want to have   gag/strip comic dont need to if your punch line are good  others require a certain level of skill since webcomics are all over the internet now
again if its fun do it    sarah andersens first comics were goddam awful seriously terrible and now she makes a decent living out of them    frank chos first liberty meadows strips during college look nowhere near close to his current style    i think drawing is like work sure lets say you can become a good programmer by copying a few challenges but nothing beats having to build a real thing that is going to get some use    studies only get you that far
  yes you need skill to do good comics    comics are a storytelling medium if you fuck up something people will not understand what you want to tell    but the better way to improve is to do comics    have fun focus on storytelling
how do i keep finding actually interesting shit in the archive anyhow ill say the same thing i said in /co/s /hyw/      good webcomics with shitty art  hitmen for destiny  please dont draw in mspaint im okay with bad art but this is fuck ugly  xkcd  feast for a king  small amounts of colour seem to go a long waylots of characters have red highlights and look better for it possibly an actually good artist prioritizing speed   october20  asscastle    shitty webcomics with good art  glacias  asis  actually seems to have good writing great setting and sketchy/realistic art complements the mood but fucked over by atrocious pacing and 45 panel layout  factioncomic/mulate  seemingly no one who wants to write were in a vr mmo but now with stakes seems to actually get how players think heartily recommended if anyone is feeling writers block and needs to read something that missteps at every turn      actually can i talk about pic related    as you can tell the arts amazing the storys complete selfcontained and it even has its own accompanying music that plays while you read this page has a high alien droning that underscores how unnatural and threatening the sectoid is  but theres no point in reading it twice the story is utterly standard i dont remember anyones names i dont remember who inevitably sacrificied themselves to save the team webcomics have zero oversight and all this aspired to was just a blockbuster    same deal with glacias up there i got to page 13 in one sitting and i fucking dare you to do better trust me your storytelling is way more important it all falls apart if its absent
    its mostly slice of life with a overarching plot about a escaped lab experiment living among a family of normal humans
  this is what i call a good comic
  xkcd  good
  what the fuck  those obvious xcom traces  that bathroom wall texture on the aliens face  cgi effects still visible
sooooo
  lol what a shit workflow
  women really are good at art
good for them its not like people like this are ever going to take the job they want because all they do is copy trace from photos
  women make this world better god bless women
who in the world colors in patches like that
  she is probably used to colored pencils
  wow women are so good at art  i wish i could be as good as her i cannot even draw a line
  this bitch makes a better job and much faster
  based
  women are better than men deal with it sweetie
  seriously tho why do people waste their time with this photocopy garbage
holy shit does no one check the catalog theres already a thread on this
  i didnt know this guy was dead
  what is even the point of photo realism  just to flex your drawing skills to everyone    if you used it to make things that didnt exist already in real life then i suppose you could make some really good pieces but all anyone ever seems to do is recreate photographs    its fucking boring   youre spending hrs maybe even days doing something that can be done by a photographer in a few seconds this kind of art would have been ideal in like mediaval times when no one else knew how to draw and the camera existed but today its so pointlessand soulless
  the point most likely enjoyment i imagine they enjoy drawing these things regardless of what you think about their artistic worth do you enjoy drawing do you even draw
  wow shes so talented
  most likely enjoyment  haha what  photo copying isnt enjoyable  its tedious as hell you idiot
   whats that image with 2 filters put ontop of one another with some part halfassedly erased trying to prove its obvious that she played around with greyscale filters and brushes for like 10 minutes before posting it here fucking none colors like that ahahah  they are so gullible holy shit 180k likes way to take people for utter dumbasses and actually get away with it
  for you but you dont even draw how would you know
  do you literally live under a rock
    samefag whiteknight or troll
  huh  i drew your mom getting gangbanged by black bulls the other day
  some people enjoy things you dont
who the actual fuck colours like this  just make her send a video of the work if she doesnt she has the gay
  whiteknight  there aint an easier way to spot an incel
women are superior fuck off if you think otherwise
  black bulls  i know you wont believe me but being familiar enough with that term to be comfortable shitposting with it is really damn cringey
  i drew your mum as a futanari last night
  see immediate improvement i even think it rolls better
  he doesnt but i do    who is this
  implying thats copied from a photo
  when will we have someone as good as her does she have tutorials damn
  yeah heres one
  pretty sure hes just fucking around
  congratulations you are a dot matrix printer
  you put a filter over it while she grinded for years just look at how she paints using small brushes she must of studied ruan jia maybe you should go back to reading loomis instead of being envious over a woman
  fuck youre right must be all the piss mixed with arizona iced tea that brought me to dare spite our new queen
  the absolute state of photo filters
do we have valid reasons to know shes using a filter and not just spending autistic amounts of time on it  if so yall should call her out      mustve not must of
  you must of read my post wrong of course theres no valid reason to call her out just ic being retarded again
  it is copied from a photo
  i like how she dicked around with the same soft edged brush like would do some retard opening ps for the first time everything about this image is halfassed people are so fucking retarded for believing this its beautiful
  stop it    okay all im saying is that some people are masochistic fucks and will actually do all of that from scratch nor is that level of similarity unachievable
  i agree with you
  i dont even know who it is
  there were videos of a dude explaining how you can fake this even on video  i second your theory
  who in there right mind would work like this how are people so stupid
   hurr durr people cant possible enjoy things i dont enjoy
  where does this obsession with authenticity come from dont the ends justify the means when it comes to artwork people so obsessed with artists doing things the longest and hardest way possible its stupid you should trace and copy as much as possible you arent a photocopier use tools
  its not traced or copied its a photoshop filter
  its seriously not just a photoshop filter she painted over the photo directly shes just a lazier numyumy
  its a filter dont be dumb
  will you zoom the fuck in plus no one would create a filter that retarded what the fuck would be the point of a filter that does nothing except let you can see tiny ass brushstrokes at 2000 zoom
  fuck that kills my eyes
this is all because of the nature of digital art it ruins a lot of the point of stuff like drawing and painting one of the big reasons painting is so cool is because youre taking a weird paste and working it with your hands and knowledge into a flat surface and from that you can make it look like a beautiful realistic object if its on a computer screen the illusion is not as impressive
  mebody once told me the world was gonna roll me
  no it is a photo with some filters applied to it
  just look at how she paints using small brushes she must of studied ruan jia  holy shit i think weve done it we found the most dunning post on this whole board
she streams her work so obviously she fakes it on video to are you people retarded you deserve your jimmyillastrat generals
  sorry meant she was better than ruan jia youre right
  filters
    youre the one with dunningkreuger if you dont appreciate the genius thats just been revealed to us small brushes the true secret of art
  you can literally see her coloring it though
even if she had drawn it whats the point of literally just 11 copying a image that already exists i ve never understood what people find interesting about those besides the craftsmanship 
  nobody colors in blobs like that if thats truly her process then she is retarded
  i mean you can watch her she does color in blobs like that
  the image got removed from twitter
  why
  pointless in my opinion fine arts photorealism at least has the benefit of being done in some medium like oils or pencil this is literally replicating pixels zero artistic interpretation
  people are saying it violated the copyright of the photographer that took the original picture
    it did not get removed wtf why are you lying
when you get so good at copying that people accuse you of cheating    tbf she probably used a grid which is equally unimpressive
  hah xerox machines btfo
  image from   just dug through her twitter and found this to prove your point heres another one 
    human copy machines are legally not artists  fucking kek
  im certain she colorpicks too    is she impressed with herself
  after seeing this  i get why she does the blobs she is even less of an artist than i first thought jesus christ its literally pixel copying with a tiny grid what is the point
  wtf i just looked at her profile from your link and the garbage from the op got her an interview with the bbc and it got labelled viral how is this even possible   to me this is proof that hitler didnt go far enough and should have gassed all the normies that like art like this too
  i stand corrected   still wholly unimpressive and pointless though not even crabbing the way she chicken sratches her flats is hilariously bad
  lel
  why are you racist against black bulls
  does she color pick
  considering the level shes at probably
she didnt trace dumbasses if you line it up the eyes are a different shape the tattoo is in a different place and the fingers dont line up
  the blobs  you mean like how many artist does to easily colour picker the colours they need
whats your opinion on bob ross and his painting series
essential for anyone looking at streaming desu
  love his happy accidents
a great introduction for beginners
  handsome man
  he is based
  i love it but i dont have the cajones to actually start
honestly he was a big reason why i started painting a huge influence as a kid    there is something about looking at a painter having fun     yes he isnt a grand master he wasnt the best teacher he never presented himself as such    the criticism of ross is way out of proportion
            i had no idea there was so much support for him
    i dont see a lot of criticism of him hes a meme pretty much everywhere
  youre unlikely to find it here and i think in the last few years his reputation has increased dramatically    growing up you couldnt mention how you wanted to paint like bob ross without a smart ass pointing how much he sucked and people only liked him because he was popular you can still find those remarks in early 2000s art forum posts from people who simply didnt get it    like other lowbrow artist from the past their reputation improves when the kids they influenced get really good and they start talking about how lowbrow artist was a big influence growing up
  if you dont like bob you have no soul
never forget
  typical im different i go against the norm   tweet
ill chime in  coming from a mid 20s millennial who didnt watch ross when he was both alive and relevant i think his art is an excellent practice in raw efficiency he makes impressive use of a broad range of tools from pallet knives to brush strokes techniques that quickly communicate exactly what he wants you to see on the canvas in a very short amount of time some people find his art boring or so lacking in anything ulterior that they dont give him any merit its unfortunate sure  his art can be perceived with no meaning outside the landscape they earnestly represent but they reflect upon his personality in a profound way his simple yet effective techniques showcase a man who loved to teach the landscapes he painted and the animals he has had on his show highlight his love of nature    in general he was a flawed but respectable person and while he was deeply private with his personal life and we cant speak for who he was completely he came off on joy of painting as a gentle compassionate person with all this being said i find it impossible to truly hate him  are the kinda people i just do not understand their anger is blind and it just seems unjustified usually people like this either find his work not technically impressive or they see it below fine art the former is dishonest the latter is subjective but these people typically hate minimalist and contemporary work as well which is hypocritical at best people who despise him are at best moronically pendantic and at worst theyre bullying a dead man
  pretty much this anyone who outright hates ross has some serious misplaced rage he taught people for free on public access how to get started with painting and was passionate about it like how can you hate someone like that
 new to ink   accidental mark    pic related
  just use white out jim lee does it all the time it works
  oh good idea actually thank you
  fuck off maxmushroom
i have no idea how to grasp learning to draw i know that i should draw people and stuff in general but it seems like a fools errand on my own what is the order of learning when it comes to drawing is there a list of essential books that can help me get to some advanced level
  i have no idea how to grasp learning to draw  this is normal and i dont even know if there is a correct way to teach drawing because you need to learn a lot of things at once that necessetate each other so i guess no matter what you are going to be bumbling around a bit in the beginning there is a list of essential books though
  it depends on what you want to learn to draw say if you want to draw cars and vehicles i wouldnt recommend loomis    start with the basics you needs to know how to draw basic shapes in 3d then you will be able to learn what you want
  thats actually pretty good advice i wish i had seen that before i started

have a confession to make as an artist or a d/ic/k air your dirty laundry here    keep it art related or related to the hobby/lifestyle/career/education of art
  in 5yrs ive never read the sticky
  i have been drawing for like 3 years and im still too insecure about my basic skills to begin coloring and dedicated lighting  i just really like drawing basic stuff ok
i autistically spend time reading art books and drawing videos when i had planned to grind figures and gestures i dont know why then i end up not practicing much and i feel bad
  do dine with an alien who emits light from her very skin often
  i use a tablet but i still ink and do the final brushwork with a mouse
most people just want fame thats why well never make it    wanting fame is not the same as true expression and true expressionists dont make//care about the money its the artless dodger that always wins
  being said choosing to not care about money will not suddenly give you insight to true expression
  i bought like 6 art books like education ones and i have yet to finish 1    i have countless more books on my hard drive plus video lectures i havent watched    feelsbadman
  close 4chan and get to work
  actually its 443 am where i am and im on here procrastinating my college supplemental essays i already drew today and thats usually not the issue i just dont read the shit i buy thanks for motivation though will read more framed perspective tomorrow
  godspeed anon i hope you improve and succeed
  you dont need to its shit anyway
  what books do you have    i had read mine i need to crack open my anatomy books again tho want to buy some new ones too
ive never read loomis or any tutorial artists i only take advice from anons
  after 5 years does my artstyle is beginning to stabilise and starting to get a more regular audience  though im also starting to feel that i am only drawing for the attention lately
  how to spot a ngmi
  i bought 4 cgma courses and 2 other 500 courses and have yet to finish any of them
  thats 3800  4000 spent on this shitty hobby and im still shit not including art supplies the cintiq i bought and physical books estimates my spending to 5000 to 6000
  its been a year since i really started working on my art but ive only gotten through a couple of small practice books and my art is still not even /beg/ level at this rate ill be dead before i get anywhere
  jesus christ why would you do that
  i have an extra kimjunggi book and an acquaintance wanted to have it despite not being an artist at all
i keep trying to copy other people artsyle but when im close i just go for the next artist
  i got good enough to understand and draw things in 3 dimensional space my understanding in color is still below good i feel that i could get better if i had time to draw but i waste all my free time of vidya help
confess now do you fap to your drawings
  nah im frigid
sorry for late reply woke up from slep      than you very much      i have framed perspective vols 1 and 2 steve hustons figure drawing book pen and ink drawing by alphonso dunn and both of scott robertsons books yes i know some of these are in the artbook thread i just like reading physical copies more   on my hard drive i have the usual loomis hampton bridgman etc plus video courses from vilppu watts atelier and hampton i dont know what books you read but huston vilppu and bridgman are all good hampton is actually a bit harder for beginners which was why i kind of dropped after the muscles part started might be good for you though since you already know anatomy
  the occasional halfchub when its better than my usual shitpiles but then i fuck it up one way or another
ive never read a book or followed a tutorial or anything since starting in 2014 and while i managed to slowly feel my way around drawing to a decent level i never managed to learn all that much about color and now my pride gets in the way of actually reading books about it
  i dont pay taxes
if someone thinks i have aptitude/talent in something despite it just being me working hard i dont even correct them it feels embarrassing to admit it even though it should be something i should be proud of feels like im disappointing them if i correct it    but in reality no one actually gives a shit
i feel like practice books are shit the only way to become an interesting artist is if you develop your own individual style and dont get it from a practice book find out what artists and what specifically you like about their art and make your own version of it that exaggerates what you find is good in other art
  no but they turn me on
i have spent almost 4 years only autisticly practicing and studying art almost every day and i have completely surpassed a lot of my artist friends who i met when i was complete shit im afraid this makes them super jealous and resent me for finding secret art gains or something so i dont talk to them much anymore because when i do they just say my art looks really good and that they are jealous of how good it looks    secretly i revel in the compliments and secretly thrive on the nature of competition and feel like im winning i shame them for not trying as hard as me to be better but im deadly afraid that they will catch up and be better than me
  post your work
  theyre my babies i cant
  your probably reading the books wrong because they dont teach style they teach foundation perspective composition anatomy color theory are the sponge base of a cake the style is the icing that gives it flavor if all you have is icing your cake lacks substance
  im just here to confess my feels
    but i wanted to congratumatate you didnt you get off on the complemenations
  i shame them for not trying as hard as me to be better  cringe judging people by your own goals kys npc scum
i want to make a comic but i dont have any writing skill because i only read books for school classes and never for fun because i would rather be drawing but my drawing is shit because i never study and i also have a nasty habit of drawing just to get attention from people im the worst of both worlds but i dont know if this desire is one of genuine art for myself or just to please some illusion of being a famous and rich comic artist
  using a mouse is literally easier for me and more precise some strokes i cant do at all with my hand  aka im ngmi and retarded
  ridiculous you should only need 100 dollars worth of materials as a beginner maximum pencil charcoal ruler paper eraser something to draw on like a board and maybe a book of technical stuff you should never have spent that much money when almost everything required to become skilled is free thats a toxic investment
  just do it no one needs to know or if someone you know will see just say youre considering some different perspectives or looking into alternative representations of moods or whatever the fuck make something up even to your own mind
  im an architecture student but my perspective is still shit
i spent 100 in prokos anatomy curse and now i feel like shit becuase its free everywhere here and i understand hampton way more
the one book that has helped me the most ive yet to actually purchase
  prokos anatomy curse  based quads of truth
  where its free
  architecture student  perspective is shit  how did you even pass the entrance exam perspective is one of the fundies where im studying at
  yes i do on a regular basis in fact
  my friends and artists who are younger than me are all slowly passing me and im starting to really realize that im not going to make it and i never had a plan b because i was so dedicated i thought i would for sure be one of the ones who succeeded i want to fucking die
im about to start drawing 1 in college but im scared ill fail because i naturally suck
  i dont practice as much as i should because im better than 99 of this board so i just call people out then btfo them with my art but i cant compete with the truly skilled artists i have big fish small pond syndrome
  post your work so i can laugh at you
i stopped drawing porn to be more appealing to industry positions the 2 chances i had lined up both fell through and my social media presence stagnated
  you first
i must admit today was the first time in my life i woke up and realized i deeply regret making illustration my career choice i used to think hey whatever i pick up id always end up regretting i hadnt pursued what id truely loved well i am finally ready to admit it was a mistake i should have kept doing art as a hobby and put my mind to studying something useful like chemistry or mathematics i could be in my fifth year of bioengineering instead i struggle every day to get my ass from bed to desk to produce something halfdecent for people to judge i dont know how much money im gonna make this month or next month or the month after that i wish i had lived my life differently but high school is over college is over the only good professional opportunity i had went to waste and im still a nobody
  get good
  there will always be a million people who are better than me and even if i get good theres a million people who are already at this level there is no point in trying anymore
  yeah people got better than you by trying a little and then giving up youre right where you belong i hope you stay bad forever
i suck and i know im the only one to blame for it and it makes me want to kill myself for my laziness and my lack of passion  yet i want to get praised for being mediocre  why i dont fucking deserve it
ive been a neet since age 18 im 24 now but havent studied a single art book and havent even picked up a pencil in like 3 years i come here sometimes to make myself feel bad about wasting 6 years i could have been getting good but every time i feel like i should force myself to study even if i wont ever be great i think about how much time i wasted and how good i might have been and give up
  thats literally the case in any field unless youre some kind of genius innovator prodigy which is something you shouldnt bet on
  each day you work on your art that millions of people number will drastically decrease
  ill never kick using art materials that ive basically scavenged despite being crap until i stop sucking at art but ill probably never stop sucking at art unless i stop using crap i find on the ground
  there are also millions of people worse than you that feel the same way and with they could at least be as decent as you
im extremely paranoid about getting a art job because i dont want people to connect the dots between my real life portfolio and casual online accounts
  tfw dont care about money or fame and just about getting gud  this is already such a crippling weight that self expression is completely out of the picture   sadfaec
  damn i feel the same way    im actually kind of worried about making it one day because of that reason not to meantion the pressure of the spotlight and having fans i dont know if the recognition is worth ultimately losing your private life
  3 years and still at that level seems like youre going about learning completely wrong not to be mean but you could make a ton of improvement in a month if you applied yourself to learning properly
  instead of doing it wrong just do it right  nice advice
  exactly its not rocket science the anon just needs to go to the sticky and apply themselves its obvious from the drawing that theyve not even started
  its comforting to see im not alone   im planning on asking for advice from other anons as to how to avoid such a fate   i dont want to lose my almost decade long time of being a somewhat anonymous online artist and then suddenly have people know my real name or something really puts me over the edge
  anon you replied to here  some advice ive heard over the years is to create separate art styles one for your personal account and one for your professional account also try not posting anything specific like ocs on both accounts as it could link them together  and on your personal account try avoiding disclosing any personal information if possible be as anonymous as you can use a pseudonym or even a fake persona if youd like    hope this helped a bit good luck anon
i want to draw cunny
  i started drawing just to make pretty pictures of my waifu at some point i got rolled up into drawing porn and now thats all ive drawn for the past month my porn style isnt suitable for drawing her at all each day i feel myself getting more and more locked into drawing porn and slipping further and further away from my initial goal
    draw cute shit and porn on different blogs its what i do
i trace
  i waste more hours here than drawing
  this is except its not just with art i spend more time on /v/ /a/ and /ic/ then actually doing the activities associated with those boards are lurk drawthreads and offer to draw for people only to drop the idea completely once the pencil is actually in hand
tldr im a resentful bitch that isnt getting gud because im too busy being jealous of my ex whos more successful than i am   i just want to be free of this horrible poison i dont like hating anybody ultimately i just want to make something that i can be proud of that other people love   but theres a gross side of me that wants fame and success just so i can prove to my ex that they were wrong about everything about me they said things to make me feel so worthless when i finally accepted that there was nothing to hold on to they wouldnt let me move on they wouldnt leave me alone to heal theyd just keep saying things to make me feel like a worthless piece of shit that they threw away because they were better than me telling me how hard i failed who they were dating now how good their life was   i feel like ive left that attack on my soul unanswered and because im not a successful artist i feel like absolute garbage which just makes me even more of a resentful and damaged person   i cant become a good artist if im haunted by my own hatred for this person it takes up too much space in my mind     how do i overcome my own ego and humble myself to become a good artist how do i keep my dreams and ambitions realistic
  are you still planning on art as a career
  im 24 going on 25 in a week and a bit ive been painting for 4 years or so and am stuck in a loop i work a typical fast food job where i spend almost the entire day thinking about painting replaying videos and lessons i have learned in my mind trying to break down my environment and how lighting acts in it using my imagination and dreaming about just going home to be alone in the dark and to draw i push away from social invites and alienate anyone out of my immediate circle of family and one longtime friend because all i ever want to do is draw i spend my time listening to audiobooks on productivity and altering my life for the better so i can try to learn how to clearly focus in on doing the thing that i love and have the energy and drive to succeed    and then when i sit down after working a long shitty day and i go to draw i freeze up either i dont paint anything at all or i paint and its a quality that i deem unacceptable and get pissed my social media had all but died and any followers have more than forgotten about my existence in the last 3 months i have posted 5 things    i paint the same stupid shit over and over with the same flaws and never expand to the level i want to be to illustrate what i want to     im just so angry and tired i wouldnt have ever called myself an angry person before but something has gone bitter at the core of me where i am just so upset at my progress and the circumstance ive put myself in     there you go blog post over i cant even tell whether i feel better or worse after writing this all out heres the latest garbage i didnt post
  i push away from social invites and alienate anyone out of my immediate circle of family and one longtime friend because all i ever want to do is draw  bad idea your brain needs social interaction to work at its best  latest garbage i didnt post  post it silly post everything people arent artists and they dont notice flaws they like sketches most of the value of a piece to the average joe is whats in it that will be there whether you like the piece or not
sometimes i feel like my art is so much shit i keep relearning and learning the fundimentals untill my hands hurt also i spent about 300400 on copics and never use them
  sometimes i feel like my art is so much shit i keep relearning and learning the fundimentals untill my hands hurt  this is ok dont blame yourself  also i spent about 300400 on copics and never use them  dude use them
  it isnt garbage anon i think its really good is there something or a number of things in particular about it that you arent satisfied with   im a tad younger than you but im in a similar boat one thing ive learned in the last 6 months is that if you socially isolate yourself you will be miserable and if youre that miserable you will drop the ball on everything slogging through days or weeks without seeing one friendly face is brutal for even introverted people let alone artists who do the majority of their creative work alone   id also say that having a game plan prepared one day before helps a lot pick no more than 3 things and do the most important thing first when you sit down and you freeze up youll have a guiding document that tells you what you need to do next honor your past self by fulfilling your agreement to yourself to do your work if the quality of your work is whats killing you identify your problem areas and make a plan to tackle those problems with intention   as for posting i have no idea myself i do the whole posting regularly thing for two weeks before burning out ill find a solution that doesnt burn me out eventually   i hope things get better anon dont slander yourself
yah i have to agree with 
    i have smashed 3 laptops 2 of which were above 1200 dollars art related rage and i have smashed 3 wacom tablets 2 were 400 dollars and one was 200 all because i became frustrated with the slow tedious progression of becoming a true artist reaching that level you dreamed of    all of that shit i smashed was my hard earned cash
  yea but why force more social interaction when im stuck out all day if anything i should maybe just invest myself in the people around me/my job instead of painting over and over in my head but then i remember reading a thing about mental rehearsal having physical effects so why compromise that as well      thank you for the compliment there is a whole bunch of issues in it that leave me unsatisfied mostly how poorly conceived and rendered it is i seem to have fallen into a rut where my comfort zone is just doing things like this but the issue with pointing this out is the answer is so clear i should just do better    all things said though thank you for the tips todo lists have worked for me before so i really do need to start doing it again your optimism is contagious anon good luck on your journey and enjoy your head start the younger you start the better
  i never had a gf
  jesus its sure nice to have a lot of disposable income
  just fucking get over it and get gud fuck me you women are fucking blind    hurr i wanna make my ex feel bad by getting gud  sjdhjisus i wanna make nice picture that people like    the answer is clearly get fucking good get over yourself or get kill yourself

    youre beautiful anon idc what you look like
ive been drawing for 3 years and havent had an original idea the entire time
  then my post applies twice as hard go do the thing or forever suffer your whore ex
  just use a mouse if it gets the job done
  free i havent seen anyone share
  different fag here with similar issues and age 26 in few months i go through the 95 work day just thinking about painting listening podcasts i can have an imaginary steve huston lecture going inside my head for solid 8 hours then i get home go to grocery store walk my dog warm up some dinner and its 7pm  i sit on my computer / drawing table and just feel so tired and dont know where to begin and what to do on weekends its a bit better    thanks for the tips and optimism
  i push away from social invites and alienate anyone out of my immediate circle of family and one longtime friend  that may end up being a mistake when you tunnel vision your life in that way towards only one thing you also narrow down the source of creative inspiration this is the cause of your art block    you need stimulation to be creative you need experiences good and the bad to have something to draw from art is a form of expression but what will you express what story will you tell if you dont go out there and have experiences    if you focus merely on productivity you wont be happy youre not a machine your best asset as an artist is your imagination dont try to starve that thing by putting yourself on rails between work and grind
  i love drawing extremely objectified women with either dark or caucasian skin with perfect abs there i said it
i have considered drawing porn of men in an effort to not appear sexist because of all my porn drawn of women
i own a 500 huion kamvas and spent less than 3 hours using it total it felt awkward compared to an ipad and now i just use it as a second monitor
  how do i get over this
  get a bf
  where do i meet new people  right now i dont meet anyone at all and i dont know how to change that
  yea but why force more social interaction when im stuck out all day    because hoomins are social animals isolation is bad for us on a chemical level it doesnt matter if we like it or not    if you had the selfdiscipline to make art whether you feel like it or not ingrained at to a subconscious level since childhood youd be making art right now since you wouldnt have these particular hangups since youve missed that boat and dont have anything forcing you to do it like you would say schoolwork you have to work around that    if you make positive emotional connections with people your brain is going to get more feelgood chemicals if you have more feelgood chemicals in your brain youre going to feel at least a little bit better if you feel at least a little bit better youre more likely to actually try out things youd like to do instead of just fantasizing about it    i guess another way to put it is that people who gorge on pleasures like food 4chan fucking and/or fdrugs are not happy people the monotony makes their misery comfy comfy misery means no reason to leave that comfiness since then youd have to put in actual effort stagnancy is the biggest motivation killer of all forming actual bonds helps get you out of that misery become addicted to friendship instead of /ic/ and youll want to art more    after you have friends and start arting make it a stronger habit prioritize your time so your gainz are efficient as possible having less time ironically makes you do more since you have to make the most of the time you do have and keep going until you have some real discipline then hopefully if you lapse back into a friendless depression youll still have that motivation and can keep arting
  you degenerate fucker
  what do you recommend    confession i dont take the time to practice drawing even though i like it my free time is scarce and i prefer sharpening knives
    total beta who cant distinguish good tech trash the ipad or noose yourself w the power cord you use for charging the pen
i have all the free time in the world at the moment but i cant seem to do anything not art not writing not vidya nothing
  start by having goals friend
  thats called depression anon get your ass into therapy
  go talk to a therapist you will learn things about yourself you never knew and your life will change    clean your roooooooooooooooooooooooooommmmmm
i admire two artists but deep down i know im envious of them because theyre infinitely better than myself and i just feel i wont be as good them
  i used to be friends with a budding artist but we lost contact    now theyre really fucking good and i see that as how good i could have potentially been had i not just sat around for a decade doing nothing    it hurts
  i know i lack dedication and dont put enough time but i do nothing to adress it
  get rid of the internet
  i feel this on a spiritual level
    ill try setting closer goals sounds like solid advice and i do waste a lot of time on the internet      perhaps maybe i should i dont really feel depressed or anything but at the same time i dont feel much to begin with /blog    thanks anons
i collabd with a 13 year old their line art is better than mine /
  this anon back again to say venting in this thread literally gave me a second life like idk what it was but just expelling all my feelings let me process a lot that i was internalizing i painted for hours last night in the dead silence after posing to my social and it is some of the best work ive done in a long time today i got the chance to relax with a friend and now i feel like charging back at it and putting out more awesome work    thank you based thread
i feel like i have the opposite problem of most im highly driven and when i dont get the results i want im prone to bouts of depression i grinded through colour theory and gesture and for years each and now have a solid grasp on them maybe colour more than gesture but theres so much information available on both its pretty easy to pick up and have friends crit you whats pissing me off is just getting any meager grasp on storyboarding especially for comics im studying films im watching animation but theres nothing ive found material wise other than duh worms eye view makes duh person look big and scawey extremely generic statements that lack any context i had people tell me they look at webcomics to learn from and im sorry just no a lot of them are the epitome of laziness and general amateurism where the hell do i go to learn how to actually compose frames and shots and explains all the proper hows and whys i dont even know what to search i should add i know how to write i write my own stories and work with a writer its translating this into pictures that im stuck on i do have scott macleods books on making comics though i feel like where they gave me a basis now i need something more advanced
  weird i am studying a stem and dream with leaving it all for a drawing career all day from like 2 year now when i draw time flies by and i dont feel hunger nor thirst maybe if you would have studied some stem you would be feeling the same now think about it you knew it would be like that because when you want to be an artist everybody make sure you know that you are gonna starve to death yet you chose it because you love it so hard that you didnt let anyone to convince you i was told that from child and i ended fearing to study art now i am trapped here you at least are free    street dogs may not eat 3 meals a day but at least they are not caged in a house for the rest of their lives
  stop letting your ex have power over you and fucking block them everywhere jesus christ just try to let the whole thing go and focus on bettering yourself for your own selfworth rather than your exs accept that youre not going to magically improve at art overnight and keep chipping away at it    also if she keeps pestering you and not leaving you be that probably means you have as much of a hold over her as she does you honestly this shit is why i stay single
i focused so much in learning how to paint my drawing skilss are way behind and even /beg level    no im practicing learning to draw without color or rendering to catch up i find frustrating knowing how to render but not drawing like shit
  your brain needs social interaction to work at its best  how do you know mine most definitely doesnt
  look down on an artist everytime i ran across their art about 4 years ago  see their art now the faces and color has improved so much  im so lost
  anon you need to learn how to be happy with where you are and what you have now or you still wont be satisfied even if/when you become more successful than them delete them from your life and move on

  i draw porn of old men 60 and post it in a fairly remote place and im somehow starting to gain a niche audience  elaborate
  assuming youre not larping sometimes the reason you cant find material on a subject is because those with the knowledge intentionally or unintentionally obscure it so others cannot reach their levels if youre as driven and skilled as you say you are you have to transition into a mindset where you actively deconstruct what others do from what they actually do and not what they publish some things you need to just jump in experiment and make some mistakes and make sure to keep the best stuff for yourself
  i think old men are hot gay and hetero  and apparently other people do too

is using rotate tool a crutch
  nicely put anon
  you should stop masochistically comparing yourself to other people and their progress anon  focus on what you excel at the most only occasionally going out from your comfort zone to learn new things too
  i dont feel much to begin with    depression is mostly apathy after youve hit adulthood constant sadness is mostly a teen thing with the hormones and all
  no you can rotate the paper in traditional as well its just utilizing the optimal angle for your arm
  thats because youre autistic and dont have positive connections with anyone
  never thought of that really is there a pic when to use your wrist shoulder or elbow for efficiency
  not that anon but dont give up your stem for a silly art course you moron a stem carreer will give you 10x stable job than being an artist unless youre sakimichans patreon tier which i doubt you are keep art as a hobby you wont regret it  t senior programmerfag
    fuck you anon give me your blog
  i sold my car to pay for a powerful enough pc to draw on
  ppls post
  fucking kek are fans really this sjw or why
  bless you anon  i hope things keep getting better bit by bit
i started out drawing sfw and then slowly but surely entered the nsfw realm it began as relatively vanilla lewds but now its degraded into niche degenate fetishes i dont think even the people who are into those fetishes would like my stuff  so far i havent posted my art/writing anywhere and i dont think i ever will the postfap shame is too great
i didnt get into a show/ contest thing i know the judge doesnt owe me anything and its not personal it really just comes down to them not liking my submissions hell even i wasnt entirely happy with what i submitted and who even cares whether i get in or not it doesnt detract from what art means to me and what compels me to do it but i dont know even though i logically understand this it still hurts i cant help it ive been feeling tons of self doubt recently and i think deep down i really needed and wanted this affirmation that i was on the right path that this was actually a noble pursuit that i could prove to myself that i could i actually do this thing but i have nothing to show for it it hurts and i know its because i put all these expectations into it im just going to try even harder thats all i can do
i havent drawn in 6 months since my art buddy left and now im going to the priest
i feel bad for anyone that wants to make money with art ive been there and done that changed to a profession where i like what i do and also have steady pay and i can draw whatever whenever like i did when i was a kid i come here to laugh at people
  says anon on the anonymous imageboard where anonymous users can post images and not have said images traced back to them unless theyre retarded  says anon when the internet allows them to post written works with pure anonymity    clean the exif data and use a vpn if youre really that paranoid but no ones going to bother digging up personal info on some rando that posts stuff without even trying to have a social media presence
  plenty i fantasize with them sometimes
i cant replicate my work from digital to traditional
  ive become too normie and hang out too much with art friends and im not spending enough time getting gud    im trying to remedy by doing schoolism courses alongside my art frenz and i rechannel the discipline and schedule i had years ago
  also fuck i have to get an insta/any social media account to regularly post my studies and use it as a journal for studying
  i know it may seem appealing to do so but i would be wary if you do do it make sure you dont slip into mindless studying in an attempt to please a crowd rather than the sole intent of learning and getting better
  that is very true and a very real threat    ill do my best to uphold the integrity and importance of study  i just feel like i need accountability
i used to draw a lot of selfinsert porn of myself doing shit with my now exgf   a lot  did like a 15 page comic two years ago
i want to marry my artist bf but i secretly wonder how we are gonna feed our future kids
  dont have children ecksdee
  just draw food lmao
  i find more joy reading and studying economics history philosophy and sociology than reading and drawing art now the latter is more of a chore while i cant get enough of the former
  im not good with talking to people not even online in person or in text when i get a compliment idk how to react and i overcompensate with  and emoticons
  sell your art materials lmao if you marry an artist you should accept that his/her income/commission monies can never sustain a single person in a month i know this shit because i married my painter wife i managed to loan and get her manage my printing/graphic design business so shell be busy enough not to resort to camwhore on the net when her art thing doesnt sell more than a month
  is being an artist an evolutionary dead end
i tried drawing my own porn a few months ago i made a four panel comic its in a sketchbook i planned on destroying but havent gotten around to doing so im afraid something will happen and someone will find the sketchbook
  by cheating on him with me you can come to me when you need comfort of a real man with 6 figures ill do things to you while he is busy thinking what brushes and strokes to make on a canvas
  i understand that at my current pace and with my current motivations level of output etc i am genuinely ngmi   but i cant accept this and quit art and get a real job again ive worked real jobs before and i dont think id last two years before ending everything   i keep trying to build up momentum but its like trying to start an engine that just wont stay going for long enough on the rare occasions that ive got all cylinders firing i burn out after a few months and get sick insomnia and other things     i dont know what to do   i dont know how much longer i can do this im an adult now and i can feel my parents quiet disappointment and it crushes me i dont think theyd kick me out but being stuck here and feeling like this is slowly killing me  i dont know what to do

i lack the attention to read comics but im working on one
  tfw the computer does it for your working  no one does it for you when your drawing  i felt that feel
  whyd you marry someone who would consider hoing herself if she has a real man who can take care of her unless youre a poorfag cuck then nvm
i dont like my art
ive been on this board for 2 months now i havent even bought a pencil
  having sex with girlfriend  bluepilled and cringed    drawing yourself having sex with girlfriend and jacking off to that  redpilled and based
i am a christian yet i drew lesbian porn in my ipad and i liked it i havent showed anyone tho
im pro im good at all trad media if i see something another artist did that i really like i just copy it for my own private collection     i also post my copied versions and dont give credit lots of likes/follows if somebody calls me out they get blocked immediately
  same feels good
  do you copy from good artists
i want to make art friends who dont mind my terrible skill level and want to do collabs and work together despite it maybe even help eachother improve and generally be friendly not like the harsh art critics and general negative assholes you can get on here
    are these shitposts or do you guys really do this
rip
  i really do think it would be a better fit
  you just couldnt stop posting nudie drawings could ya well now look what happened
  porn threads human anatomy references titties
  its art tho
  this thread would be a perfect fit on 4channel 
  its just a drawing mate
  speak english smelly brown
  you have to be at least 18 to post here
censored off the internet gg felas
  red boards stay  dont you know that
  what is your name
why the fuck would /ic/ go on 4channel
post art that you know is probably bad but inspired you regardless
i sometimes just like browsing webcomics and the like because i feel like i couldnt possibly be the worst
pixiv is a goldmine for this shit
gary hume  sam taylorwtf  gavin turk     its probably bad art i suppose the inspiration is that its such a low bar being better is easy
bad art always inspires
  sam taylor  oh i see what you mean there is something about it though
  jimmy inspiration
  i hope that sold for millions
  gary hume  just went through an image search and it was all absolute garbage except for pic related i kinda like it
this one it might somewhat apply but there is something that makes me sick looking at it and i dont think it was intended purpose so therefore i qualify this as bad art    it leaves me physically sick angry and wanting to offset by creating something of my own
  im trying to figure out why it makes you sick anon but the more i look at it the more i get what you mean
  i mean that isnt completely terrible the colors are moderately off putting but it seems like youre projecting hard like i cant possibly see how that makes you physically ill and saying we might relate to your extreme irrational levels of disgusting is bullshit
  i cant imagine why
  i think that sickness is probably envy draw more anon someday youll get gud
    i think the utter navelgazing of it does it for me
    i dont get it it just looks like a card captor sakura ripoff i dont think the irritational hatred is justified
  you have found a different person to who i meant these are quite enjoyable
  its not navelgazing fucktard its a half decent model sheet thats ineptly bloated but otherwise full realized the relationship crap and other pointless narrative detail is unnecessary in a professional setting but you are probably harboring hatred for a piece that was likely done by a child    its done well enough that it is over the bell curve and the fact that you are repulsed to the point of feeling physically sick is completely irrational i cant tell if youre going full blown tip of dunningkruger or youre just an asshole
  its above average id hang it on my wall
sketches are my art fetish
  if you take the time to see his gallery you will notice that he breaks anatomy on purpose
  lol
  its sickening because its some weebs self insert fursona of cardcaptor sakura
  self insert  fursona  go fuck yourself now youre just being disingenuous anon just so you know its really difficult to lie about something when you have it in front of you
  are those supposed to be ultra saggy grandma tits on a young girl or what is this
  its good i like it
this guy  is not one of the worse ones ive seen him post but they all have the same stiff feeling yet i utterly love it
  can any pro tell me why the color and the line hurt my eyes so much
  dont even bother replying to yourself stop being a jealous roastie
artwork not relevant to thread      a piece that was likely done by a child  according to her site    she started her studies at moscow uni in 2011 if she started her studies right out of high school shes 25 now or older unless she is some sort of prodigy and finished her high school earlier on her meet the artist posted 2015 she wrote shes 21 so she might be  dont get me wrong i did search out her profile on da after finding a picture that caught my eye posted here she is indeed talented and quite proficient in drawing manga things but that one thing just doesnt sit right with me at all      feeling physically sick is completely irrational   youre just an asshole  i never said i wasnt an asshole and never claimed this reaction was rational just wanted to find out if only i had this reaction or not  seems 50/50 so far so idk      stop being a jealous roastie  oh come on i like her other work and if i am jealous its of people whos skills are scary good like duhrer leonardo people working at blizzard just about anyone pro in entertainment and industrial design younger algenpfleger and so many many others who i cannot recall on spot
  it looks like meh deviantart shit you guys are so melodramatic  ahh this makes me sick ahh
  i dont get the revulsion but i wonder if its the weird tumblr shading on the limbs/bodynormal anime doesnt do that and it makes her look dirty comparatively    you can see the same idea on her cloud skirt
  this image is based
its shinchan right now i dont know why exactly maybe the simplistic almost abstract art style i wouldnt consider the art bad though in the first place
  shinchan is based
honestly sakimichan  others i cant do realistic shading and colors at all     evan lee counts too
  drawthreads are pretty neat for this
so the new 184 update is out how are we all finding the new features added    wwwclipstudionet/en/dl/release_note
theres no reason to buy tvpaint anymore
  there was never any reason to buy tvpaint not while it uses a dongle
so they finally did it they added autocolorize
  so can we now adjust the length of each frame numerically
  how do u use this feature im still relatively new to csp and id like to try it out on some lineart rn
  edit  colorize tech preview  colorize all
this is big i can finally uninstall animate cc
  its not 100 part of the software they upload your image to a server and do it remotely  they say privacy is assured but somehow i doubt it
  based
  lol is bowser hiding his head in his turtle shell
  horrifying
sorry photoshop is better
  for illustration and painting yes but for comic/manga and now animation csp is better
  just use krita lol
  who cares use whatever suits you csp is definitely a strong contender against photoshop for anyone doing manga and comics its the program to use
    nope csp is clunky photoshop is faster
i bought csp and got disappointed i could not bind flip canvas and undo to the stylus buttons  back to photoshop it is
  but you can in the software of your tablet
  youre just an idiot  you can literally bind any key to your stylus from tablet driver
  i could not bind flip canvas and undo to the stylus buttons  i dont know what youre doing it werked for me
      ive tried through the software for the tablet just like with photoshop sai sketchbook etc  doesnt work in csp for me the buttons seems to be locked to functions in csp even after unbinding everything in csp  so i really dont understand what im missing
major update  doesnt fix the text tool thats been broken for years  still no ability to save brush sets     but hey we get useless ai coloring
  this confirms pro ps users are brainlets and their opinions should be discarded
  1 install autohotkey  2 rebind your tablets buttons to the appropriate hot keys but only when csp has focus    it shouldnt be that hard to figure out if you read the documentation
    i take that back well atleast it seems they fixed the interpolation for scaling and thats very good news
  you could easily do that if you have half a brain but ill be nice to you this time  1 find the default shortcut of the function you want to use eg flip canvas  ctrle etc  2 go to you wacom driver settings  3 select the dropdown menu of the button you want to bind  keyboard  keystroke  4 type in the shortcut of the function you chose earlier  there are other ways but this is probably the fastest most practical method
the ai colorize feature is pretty impressive looks prettier without linework imo
  i wish i could use it to separate the materials into maskssuper time consuming instead of pseudo watercolor
  its a great base for painting over a mask tool would certainly be nice theres this other tool called paints chainer so i wonder if its the same algorithm
  lol photoshop crashes all the time and is poorly optimised for anything non intel     csp is not a clunk program youre thinking of paint tool sai
  if it worked like this i wouldnt have had a problem thats exactly how it works with photoshop and thats how i thought it would work with csp but for some reason it does not work for me  so clearly theres something im missing that goes beyond binding the keys in the wacom software
    fuck i pirated this shit and cant find colorize in my edit  might consider buying it now
    where the fuck is it
  then youre doing something wrong or using some kind of bugged cracked copy
  ive been waiting for the audio shit for so long it barely feels like im awake its almost like flash had decent brushes
  i just bought csp during the sale so its a legit copy  of course im doing something wrong because if i wasnt i wouldnt have a problem  i can bind the buttons on the tablet no problem but on the stylus wont work its like csp is overwriting the wacom software
  get the 184 crack on cgpersia if you dont have an account wait for a couple of days for it to surface on cgpeers
  csp doesnt have any native stylus button binding feature so it cant possibly overwrite anything whenever you want to bind you can only bind indirectly like with that method i posted double check everything including modifier key settings maybe you missed something
  under edit      it goes on sale like every week lmfao just cough up 20
the future is now niggas  half a dozen clicks with nothing in mind and shit looks good to start with
itt brainlets cant do an underpainting for better colors
  holy fuck i love you you dont even need a cgpeers acc to do this thanks friend the internet works fast as fuck
    this dont see how this feature is remotely useful except as a fun toy for people without art skills
the ai coloring feature is fucking worthless lmao
  fuckin this even the ones on the web are far more customizablestyle2paints the csp one just has a target and reference layer and thats it
  i was too optimistic it is pretty trash might as well just use style 2 paint
        damn you mad
  why are ps users so fucking stupid  fun fact you literally cant even rotate the canvas with a keyboard shortcut in ps without going into a gay rotate mode where you must drag the canvas manually either with your mouse or a tablet both of which suck ass for whatever reason there is literally no way to bind a keyboard shortcut to rotate it to the right or left say 10 degrees 5 degrees something that literally every other program can do by default
  lol only if you need to rotate frequently and why rotate at all that rotation is only good for those who use cintiqs and even then you still dont have to use it as much
  have you used it
  i have on   and its fine for what it is you draw a line of a color and get a soft blend its definitely something im going to use to figure out color relationships for illustrations or even getting me started on coloring    more interested in the animation features t b h but i think people are shitting on it because they hear ai and instantly think robots are going to steal their jobs or fix all their issues and then get disappointed when a tool doesnt turn them into a jap
  nigga all it does is take color from an image on to the drawing there isnt even an option to choose what color except editing it through the advance menu while with the ones online have an approximation with what ever color you choose
  its like this  i have bound brush and eraser in csp to b and e i can map b and e to the buttons on the wacom tablet and pen through the wacom software when i use the buttons in csp they work just like pressing b and e on the keyboard all that works just as it should    now i want to bind flip canvas i have it as h in csp i hit h and the canvas flips  i go to the wacom software to map h to one of the buttons on either tablet or pen  it should work right wrong using the button that is now mapped as h does nothing inside csp it does not flip the canvas hitting h on the keyboard flips the canvas  same with undo it doesnt work  things that do work is brush eraser brush size rotate among others
  have you tried different shortcut combinations ctrlshifth ctrlaltshift or anything like that
  doesnt work either
  that is just bizarre its just doesnt make any sense for it to work for certain shortcuts and not the others have you tried reinstalling and resetting your configuration
  you can literally do one color at a time youre overcomplicating it
        the final nail in the coffin i hope you all stay shit and rely on algorithms that turn you into one trick cookie cutters
  did you see my post  i have no idea how windows handles device input but autohotkey is what i use for remapping my gamepads and managing keyboard macros it should be able to do what you want
have they added in a history option like photoshop yet being able to go back several steps at a simple click and bookmark them is something i cant drop and last time i checked csp doesnt let me do that
  there is both history and color history you turn them on under the window menu
  i havent tried reinstalling but ive tried resetting all configurations    i downloaded auto hotkey but setting it up looked like a hassle at first glance so im gonna give that a go if i cant solve it any other way having a 3rd party program do the mapping for something that should work out of the box is something i want to avoid
  i know theres a history option but last time i used it it didnt function like it does in photoshop you can go back a few steps but you couldnt bookmark it have they done anything about that
  no you still cant bookmark as far as i can see
is sai just a simpler version of csp
mega when
  in way yes but the mechanics are a bit different but a /beg/ like you wouldnt know
  ive always sucked and ill never progress at my age so im really tempted to use this so im really tempted to use this    fuuuuck    is using it cheating or is it just using a tool  only case i could see this be fair and even then not sure is for work like animation or webcomics when you have to have a high speed of production and you have no assistants like pro    but some other part of me is still against this i dont even use the puppet models in csp not sure if useless pride from the past or actually healthier
  post on their forums or something geez
    krita already has an autocolor function for your information its not as good but they have one
  i dont knwo why many anons bitch about this this is great for /begs that want to focus on drawing better its obviously not as good as real painting anyway
the audio doesnt play while youre dragging through the timeline it shows the audios waveyzags but it doesnt actually play a snippit of it while youre dragging through the timeline like it would in flash or toon boom        still its a huge step forward for the program i think theyll add the needed feature in a future update
cant wait until twitter and deviantart get flooded with shitty comissions and artist charging 10 more just for coloring lol
  the audio plays in krita iirc you should consider giving it a shot sometime its timeline is much more intuitive as well much like flash just without the motion tweening
  but i like csp
  oh this is more than i was expecting though
  damn well thanks for the info anyway guess ill continue to wait
  dont stay loyal to a piece of software youll end up like the retarded ps users who post in this thread
  youre right if theres a superior alternative i should at least try it
i just wish they would sort out the brush texture so that it can be different on each stroke it cant that hard to do
    different how do you mean offset different scale or something else
  any way wouuld do just so that you dont get these big texture holes that none of your strokes will cover up unless you change to a brush with another texture
  its not there though
someone explain to me the hype around csps new animation features as far as i can tell they just added the ability to import audio is there more to it what am i missing here   bigger question can i finally animate on ipad and ditch learning toonboom on desktop
  did anyone catch dave gibbons webinar
  added motion tweens and audio its basically flash with an actual good brush system now
  wait they added tweens    oh god bless    but how does that work flash is vector based csp isnt
  here i downloaded it before it got removed heres a mirror    
  they added full audio motion tweening and camera movements the only things it cant do that toonboom can are postprocessing besides the basic fx layers and puppet animation      csp has always had vector layers just everyone myself included forgot   and you could always tween bitmaps in flash it wont look great for size tweens but its there
  csp is not a clunk porgram yourre thinking of paint tool sai    how can someone be this wrong about anything ever    like holy shit thats one of sais biggest strengths its incredibly lightweight
  i use it all the time while drawing thats how i draw
  i aint trusting that shit
so its just updates for animation nothing new for making comics
    just tried it works
  of course youd say that to your own post im not downloading your bitcoin miner you cunt
  skeptical about the link but how do bitcoin miners work i dont own any bitcoin
  they use your pc to mine bitcoin for them it doesnt matter if you have any or not
  how can you check a rar file for it i really want to test the new animation update
  i think cravks are viruses they will always show up as viruses even if its a legit pirate
  then dont
this isnt necessarily about the csp 184 but i wanted to share a way to closely replicate sais density behavior that i discovered recently    basically csps adjust brush density by gap feature is supposed to make its brush density work like in sai but in reality it doesnt work very well because the feature makes it impossible to get a perfectly opaque stroke this could cause problems in your painting depending on your workflow    but by fiddling around with the pressure curve while adjust brush density by gap is off i managed to get it to work almost like in sai    do note that you should experiment with your own pressure curve since im very lighthanded my particular pressure curve probably doesnt suit everybody
  first of all let me tell you why youre wrong about everything you said adjust density by gap literally tells you it keeps the brush consistent so why would you ever have to toggle this on  and second of all that is not how you use pressure curves the y axisoutput means how hard you can press and the x axis is the range of opacity/density or w/e it may be if you have yours cut off that way that means you cant control the full range of density its only half of it the default is a linear line from corner to corner since sai uses sliders instead of curves its just linear and both of these programs are based off your initial pen pressure settings notice how i have better control of the density than you in pic related and why would you ever paint with density its garbage
  calm down man no need to be so confrontational    adjust density by gap literally tells you it keeps the brush consistent so why would you ever have to toggle this on  adjust brush density by gap was originally made to replicate sais brush density mechanics    the y axisoutput means how hard you can press and the x axis is the range of opacity/density or w/e it may be if you have yours cut off that way that means you cant control the full range of density its only half of it  the reason i cut off the curve at the yaxis is because your stroke actually remains opaque even at 35 brush density depending on your gap settings    and why would you ever paint with density its garbage  it all depends on the artists workflow the tools dont make the artist you may not like it but others do some notable artists that paints with density is rei and i think theyre doing just fine
so apparently the ipad version is getting the same animation support its in the review stage i guess     lads im going to make it im going to make the thing happen if i can do the majority of an animation on a screen tablet thats portable i will be over the moon i wanna make cartoons for the internet and sell merch art of my ocs
  adjust brush density by gap was originally made to replicate sais brush density mechanics  lol what who said that  the reason i cut off the curve at the yaxis is because your stroke actually remains opaque even at 35 brush density depending on your gap settings  what thats not what i meant by that at all  it all depends on the artists workflow the tools dont make the artist you may not like it but others do some notable artists that paints with density is rei and i think theyre doing just fine    i said its garbage to paint with not garbage as an actual tool
  so apparently the ipad version is getting the same animation support  do you have a citation for that im posting with my new ipad and drawing with the pencil is fucking amazing with a cheap little bluetooth keyboard this thing is more comfortable to type on than a laptop i just bought a lightning  hdmi adaptor because apart from a few games and linux applications i rarely touch my pc lately
  lol what who said that  its never explicitly mentioned but its one of many features such as mix ground color that is very obviously designed off sai i mean they even called it brush density instead of flow you can see when you turn on adjust brush density by gap it matches up with sai very closely and the difference only starts to show at 100 which is the issue with the feature    what thats not what i meant by that at all  what im saying is that you dont need a full range curve because brush density becomes fully opaque at around 35 you can have a fullrange curve like yours or a limited one like mine and you would have the same amount of control    i said its garbage to paint with not garbage as an actual tool  to each their own if you dont like it thats okay im not trying to change your opinion but like i said there are a lot of great artists that paint comfortably with density just fine so you cant really pass it off simply as fact
  yes
  well my new toy just got a lot sexier thanks anon
  are you running the newest ipad that screen looks delicious like a coloraccurate frosted pastry running at 4k 120hz
  stop with your autism its making me cringe
  why would you ever paint with density its garbage  since there is no option to put opacity on pen pressure in that program
  yes i didnt go with the pro because the size of the normal ipad is very comfortable to hold    i dont have anything decent around to compare the screen to but its very very nice
  didnt they add opacity on pressure a few patches ago
  how is explaining a basic feature autism
  yeah opacity pressure has been a thing for a while now
  because youre explaining it wrong you have no idea what youre talking about and im done talking to you    they did which is funny because corel painter did the same thing with its 2017 version    its on there bud
  cool crack bro    doesnt work
  you havent shown a single thing i have said to be wrong honestly trying to run away from an argument like this is just an embarrassing sight
  youre using the curves completely wrong because you have no idea how density works now fuck off
how am i using it wrong when its working perfectly as i intended stop playing dismissive in order to evade counterarguments and start having an actual discussion  the y axisoutput means how hard you can press and the x axis is the range of opacity/density or w/e it may be  and this is actually wrong the yaxis isnt how hard we are actually pressing the pen its the output pressure as interpreted by the software which will result into whatever opacity/density the xaxis is the one representing the raw pen pressure we send to the program
  
  do you know how to use the crack
    make sure your shit is offline first  replace init and the clipstudiopaintexe to the wherever clip studio paint folder is celsysclip studio 15clip studio paint and run the offline activationkeygen   enter serial code into csp   then csp will give you a license auth key on top and you put that into the keygen   you enter the authentication key from the keygen to csp
    sorry im an idiot it works thanks
  i said its garbage to paint with not garbage as an actual tool  if you dont know why brush density is useful for painting you dont know enough about digital art programs or painting in general to be snarky about it
      links down
        ill leave it up for a few more hours before i get shitted on by the feds
  its good for like a few things but in general its bad for painting
    explain why its bad im another anon and i have used clip studio for years for digital painting and i have no idea what you are talking about im actually genuinely curious if you could provide a detailed answer what you mean
  its not my main program so its bad
    not gonna explain it to a bunch of /beg/s sorry
  pyw
  because there is no reason haha just as i thought
  the fact that you dont know how to paint is funny enough so stay a /beg/
      have you considered making a gumroad apparently you sit on some cutting edge knowledge regarding digital painting and you could atleast squeeze some shekels out of it if you dont want to make a coherent argument on a sentinalese archery forum but if you prefer to keep your secrets to yourself so the compettion doesnt get ahead thats perfectly understandable aswell
  some brushes in ps only show texture at lower flow value  because you actually need some spacing otherwise you get giant blobs of paint     but im sure you know this master
      based
    lol fucking begs and their cute little interpretations of basic shit
    why not just upload it to mega with an obfuscated name
  actually please upload it to mega with a name that isnt basically program crackrar so that it wont get taken down
    not understanding how to manipulate density settings for texture control    ngmi
  someone reup those please
  density has nothing to do with texture
   photoshop   fast  nice meme
   pointing out another autocolor app is better   implying thats anger  damn you dumb
    pretty sure it still gets taken down
can someone verify if this doesnt have a miner in it    masterkreatifcom/clipstudiopaintexhtml    people are saying the ones posted here and cgpeers has a miner in it
  bruh just wait until it goes on sale and buy it lmao
  does the miner only work when you activate the keygen or is it also every time u use the program
  what people source    people have been calling witchhunts from the dawn of ages with no proof
  this is the one i used and i havent noticed anything usually a miner will show up on your task manager eating up cpu or eating up graphics card resources
  audio and camera movement support  thank fucking christ now i just need to wait for a sale so i can upgrade and finally ditch opentoonz
  lmao bro just buy the pro version at 200wait for a sale itll just be 100 lmao what u poor or what laughing my lmao off  i have bought it already but i am limited to 24 frames in animations im frustrated 
did they make it so you can make transparent gifs or import gifs yet
  i bought the pro version for like 25 bucks they have big sales
  thats one thing krita has going for it with gmic and split layers by color      
  just testing it on stuff and i like it
  csp  slow has shitty color management has useless 3d gimmics for people who cant draw for shit namely awful unflexible 3d dummies to trace and a now an ai coloring for people who cant color for shit either  ps  fast and has advanced editing and tweaking features but has a shitty brush engine crappy stabilizer not perspective rulers at least not oob  krita is fast has a good brush engine has perspective rulers has pretty advance editing too even the liquify for scrubs and animation tools    why the fuck would anyone use csp   last time i tried rotating large canvas on it it was glitching out had screen tearing and had overall awful performance
  krita is fast  ha ha ha faggot
      at this point i just assume anyone bringing up krita on /ic/ is trolling
  just stop using windows   krita is fuckloads faster than sai or csp those programs shit the bed once you make 500px stroke ove a 80008000 canvas   ps may be faster than krita in somebetter liquify things slower in other brush strokes but krita has a better more streamlined workflow for digital art
  there it is  the just change your os bro lmao meme that always follows someone pointing out krita is shit    literally change how you do everything else for one single piece of software based on an anonymous guy on the internet and evidence of shit not working well on the os you already have
  buy a decent workstation  buy a high quality monitor  buy a wacom tablet  pay for an expensive software  but somehow cant give a the superior software a try    changin an os isnt even that much of a change if youre too dumb fo linux theres alway a mac   i spent money on my art workstation why not also sped some time on software   all it took was to boot to ubuntu from a usb stick installing krita and giving it a try then i bought an ssd to permanently install ubuntu on and never booted to windows again feels like a waste keeping it on the disks but there still are files and documents i could posibly need one day
  burden of proof is not on the people who already spent all that and then saw it run like ass on windows homie
  this is a computer graphic ergo graphic design     /gd
these features are pretty great i must admit th r animation ones i dont really care for though im not much of an animator
you get all that shit for 20eurosfuck im glab i payed for it these japs will soon destroy photoshop they just need to add all the photoshop gimmicks aswell
i need to download this ilegally
  arent you consufed with the ex version which is limited to 24 frames and which costs about 20 indeed
  kritas stabilizer is unironically fucking garbage csp and sais are extremely good
  no the ex is the more expensive one with comic pages manager 3d to 2d filter no frames limitation and maybe some other things
  ya way more shit especially when you export shit
  dave gibbons uses it so they must be doing something right 
  slow  it isnt slow on my shitty 4 year old 300 dell desktop  has shitty color management  what makes it shitty ive never noticed any deficiency  useless 3d gimmics for people who cant draw for shit  theyre actually very useful i doubt you draw much if you dont see the utility in not having to draw out an entire vehicle in the exact perspective you want  now an ai coloring for people who cant color for shit either  its an emerging technology that might one day be very useful or at least fun to play with you find it bad the devs are working on that and letting users try it out      i use linux almost all of the time but dual boot windows to run csp because its that much better than krita i do plan on switching to mac soon because i dont play many of the games i used too
  i still cant get avi files created by csp to work with davinci studio resolve  mp4s work fine but are limited to 1920 x 1080 and do not support transparent backgrounds  avi supports up to 7680 x 4320  until i find a fix im just exporting as an image sequence and dumping it into resolve
  trying to draw in ps is pure ass csp is good if you do actual line art
  photoshop is faster  the only thing wonkier was paint shop pro
  ps rotation is also destructive everytime you rotate pixels get fucked
i want to use csp because all i draw is basic bitch anime shit but it very clearly datamines you and i dont want the lewd bishies i draw getting sent up to the cloud to be stored forever     i think ill switch to krita
  krita  liquify  nigga its almost 2019
  graphic design is likely older than your grandpa you zoomer piece of shit
    take off the tinfoil hat
  open the celsys folder in appdata open csp make a new file draw something save it then notice a 1mb encrypted file has been created in that folder and csp attempts to contact a server
  specifically the encrypted file is created in the promenade subfolder
    different anon than the you replied to  thanks for saying this because i was about to download this program myself before i remembered the possibility of datamining you helped me dodge a bullet    are there any digital art programs that dont datamine i havent really started digital art properly yet
  its not enough to firewall csp
  depends if the programmers are honest then yes but since the program is closed source they might have ways to dodge the firewall
  wtf that means that all the huge fucking dicks i keep drawing all day are stored somewhere on csp servers  why
          you flaming retards this is for their service that saves the files onto their onedrivelike storage if you actually bought cps you get 10gb storage free if you dont want to use it turn it off or load paint separately    data mining holy shit you guys are a special case
        
  kill yourself nigger
  this but unironically
      again a whole of fucking nothing  1 connection to to clip asset thing and their onedrive like storage  2 some anonymous diagnostic tool you can turn off yourself  3 licence checking tool big fucking deal not much different from license checker that adobe and other companies use this shit wouldnt exist if you fags stopped playing everything    kys
  someone with newest clip pain studio is it possible to set pencil back to default settings from version 154 you know the white one back when pencil was drawing like thin pen/marker i honestly dont like newer version but i dont want downgrade
  i have found cps good for lineart and ps for actual brushing/coloring     thats all i really dont get your debates
  krita is still behind literally everything paid with performance and overall quality its like a trolling people same goes for libre office i fucking hate open source they literally do shit who the hell would ever pay for this shit if they were commertial
  how so krita is as good as those programs imo
  hi mode
    its honestly the only thing that keeps me from using it
started drawing and one of the first things i learned is that i should draw quick sketches frequently to improve anatomy and perspective skill the problem is that all my sketches looks like random ass lines and i dont feel ive learned anything from one to another to be honest i dont even know how to properly construct one and what i shoud be looking for while i do it    the point is how do i sketch properly and get the most out of it
  what are you reading/studying are you doing gesture  
  i pause videos of people dancing at random times and try to draw what i see trying to put guidelines and shapes on top of the figure failing miserably most of the times
  wait youre not reading loomis bridgman vilppu or anything like that but youre expecting to understand the human form one of the trickiest subjects in drawing right off    your expectations need to be adjusted famalam go hit the sticky    also here are some books 
  learned is that i should draw quick sketches frequently to improve anatomy and perspective skill  you fell for the meme  you improve your anatomy and perspective skills by studying anatomy and perspective not by mindlessly doodling     just draw meme is for retards who are too dumb to think with their own heads and dont mind improving at a snails pace
  i was doing that while waiting for someone to post here thanks for the book links too      noted
is this art can you call this thing art
looks like garbage
drawing elf gal its fun
  i want to make cel shaded drawings and paintings my own style but there are no tutorials on the internet to show you how to draw that texture and im not good enough at art to figure it out myself
im going to use my not usually drawing cartoonyer stuff as an excuse for mine but this was pretty fun i still cannot into coloring no matter how simple
  iktf
  nice style
  eh not my style but wanted to experiment so why not i fucked up the arms badly i dont know how to hatch also i need to study flowers
  very cute
would you
i feel like im polishing a turd at this point but hey i tried better than procrastinating
  no idea why the eyelid lighting contrasts everything else so much dont ever draw a face at that angle again learn how to draw clothes
  what did i fuck up with the angle of the faceanyway thanks for the critique man
  eh not my style as such
  this is really freaking cute anon
  based arma
/ i got frustrated at some point
  best
  i appreciate that you drew an elfelf and not a humanelf
  look at the size of this lad absolute unit
  i like it should incoporate this into your style
  jesus you put way too much effort into this son
  nonsense i think if he can put this much effort into one single image he should do it 100 of the time im jealous ive lost that drive to get 100 effort in everything i draw keep at it anon and dont set your self short
  best one so far
  that bulge
  heres my shit
  good job with the eyes very evocative    youve got a really nice flow to your lines noice    that pose is quality    you have to go thiccer if youre gonna do a booty shot lad i dig the clean lines though        dont know why i tried to do anime when i never draw anime
  muh style lol  doctors hate him  follow these steps to get a style like his
  i dont mind it anon i like your colors
  can you post an example of what you mean i googled cell shading tutorial and a handful came up on the first page
  id fug that
  not how top down perspective works
  thats real well done pal
  i love this god damn picture so much
  youre right it was fun
had a hard time getting used to painting in clip studio
  why is she an aunt wine
  pretty hot
  dont know what ya mean pal though the wine is there because its important
  i love this
  thank you
  i recognize this anon no raep this time   i am disappoint
  is this based off that preacher guy who blocked that kids punch
  cute
had a lot of fun with it
  man i really like how you did that
  appreciate it
  
  dont hide the feet faggot
  i just cant do them
  neither can i but i will show my mop feet proudly
  i really like it  but yeah show the feet and remember if you cant do good detail just make really minimalist feet with only toes or even just the basic block shapes
  wonky but too tired to fix it up
  i really like how you can see the space between the lines good job
  try turning on screen mixing off
  looks gorgeous
  thanks man will try that
  kinda looks like a doll
  giv blog
  hottes and cutestt one itt
  style  sorry im only capable of poorly copying other artists
  blog pls
  nice
  blog
  finally some good fucking food
hey it might be a chance to finally post something without any pressure    does rough sketch so far so good this might be done in 30 mn or so    2 hours later looks nothing like the rogh sketch and is a rigid styleless piece of shit and i learned along the way that i dont understand how clothes work at all    ragedelete    i want kill
test
  nice job
fug
  id fug that elf
  id color but i have so much shit to do for school and its bumming me out
  love how you kept the pose expression and floaty stuff blog
idk anons but this made me happy
  ya did good my dude
  cute/10
  i ended doing it again its a tiny bit better at least but still a styleless unfinished blob with pretty much every fundamental wrong    i dont care i have to start posting somehwere one day and let go
  forgot pic tho
  dont beat yourself down anon its cute those legs are nice af  honestly youre putting to much pressure on yourself   just post whatever man its not like anyones gonna remember and youre definitely in the better tier on this thread so theres that
  i wouldnt say so objectively but thanks its really nice to have feedback like that these threads are super fun to look at by the way i hope theres more of those in the future
style aka just drawing and hoping it turns out alright with absolutely no consistency between drawings
  cute style do you have a blog
start one of these threads  put your oc on the left  free art for your oc in many different styles  artists get practice and feedback on their pieces    as long as you guys dont do commission tier pieces i like these threads dont let someone dupe you into drawing their shit for free though
  but what if i want to do commission tier pieces faggot
  implying that anyone here can actually put out a drawing id pay money for
this is not my style normally but i just read beastars so sorry about lowkey furry
  reminds me of secret of mana
  these gorillaz fingers
  was aiming for a serene expression but ended up with a 420 blaze it
  pothead elves best elves  nice work blog
  thanks  my insta rezq88
no effort draw because floaty clothes obscure body  thanks op    doesnt put spare effort into anything else
  i love the shapes cute/10
  oh fully i embrace my awfulness
  never said that if you like long neck embrace it it worked for parmigianino
  tfw have fallen deeply in love with the girl on the right and am now cursed to spend the rest of my days searching for a pale marfan qt
  you can try to become a doctor specialized in the illness
30 minute shitzel art
  i always wondered about that foot near the tiny guy
  maybe during restoration they removed too much paint and revealed something that was hidden
  marfan  holy shit i googled that and they look like they jumped out of an arthur rackham picture
im actually gonna do this when i wake up tomorrow i hope this thread is still here when im done penis bump
  will do it now im as tired as you but i want to draw or paint this piece though
her shoulders are busted as fuck but im too lazy to try and fix em
  what a cutie
quick and sketchy      im really trying to get back into drawing/get serious about it and doing this felt really good nothing special but in my own personal progress i really feel like im improving and doing this felt super rewarding      i love this
youre all a flock of sheep
  dont draw things i dont want you to draw waaaaaaaah  youre just a black sheep and you dont like it
hows this
  super cute      this is super nice looks like it has so much depth
  could be cute style but gestuepose is weird and breaks it for me
  looks hood but your shading makes no sense where is the light source
  did you reply to the wrong poster what shading are you speaking of
  yes
  im really digging that jacket
  acute
    t footfag
  blog
  draw the rest of the top right version
  all drawfags become footfags at one point or another
  what about this guy 
oh no i didnt draw the feet rolls eyes
  blog please
  twitter juste_vu  tumblr day_job_vu
  hot    precious
  blog
heres some /beg/ger work yeah i know the face is not symmetrical and blah blah blah
  eyes too close  learn proportions    dont get limited to faces dont be that guy who only draw faces do body movment attitude its fun
  i appreciate your comments but if i wanted critique i would have posted in the /beg/ thread and if this wasnt a 45 minute drawing for a low quality your style i might have drawn more then a face
  friend the whole point of the board is critiques if you post you should expect them of course its up to you to listen to them but there is no need to get defensive
  no shit sherlock but theres a difference between asking for advice and being offered advice you already know    if it was a serious art challenge i might have bothered to do more and clean it up and had you offered a unique critique i might have cared but both are a no
  you need to chill it will literally only help you improve    this is an art critique board and any piece is subject to criticism no work is safe you are not helping the environment of this board by whining
  look at you making excuses and getting angry at criticism on a critique board     just leave now anon its not for you
  making excuses  dude i literally said it was /beg/ tier how is it making an excuse when i state the fact that i didnt try really all that hard for this draw in your style thread had i spent more time it may have been a bit more symmetrical but it would be more then a face its not like i think adding an hour to it would have turned my shitty drawing into a masterpiece though      i responded the way i did because you offered the lowest level of critique which i had already known i could fix if you wanna offer me more in depth critique feel free but dont repeat something a 10 year old could tell me for instance how could i texture the hair instead of leaving it blank or how could i shade better
  another anon complaining about getting crit on the artcrit board    
    sorry if i hurt you but drop your ego for one second which prett much every human not only you have trouble doing  if you do so a critique is always good and if you dont care about it just skip it   but this is the reality and thing is on the internet you cant avoid peoples criticism  that being said mine was no meant to be mean pretty sure you can see those and skip them right away i just thought it could help you get better    so yeah posting  exposing your work to people of course youre going to get all sort of critics here if you dont like it look for a board where the spirit is more in alignment with what you want
        holy shit you are such a fucking faggot kill yourself the fact that youre so defensive before you even got crit means you are unironically never going to make it post your shit to reddit if you want to be coddled
  im the master of colour
  do you use the pen tool to make them nice lines  dont laff at me for asking
dunno where the other thread went but heres my unfaithful adaption to that other style drawing
  if youre gonna take any advice take these two     dont try to get ahead of criticism by saying your work is bad/beg tier/assymetrical/whatever own your work if you know its bad or know how its bad fix it     when you get criticism take it or ignore it and move on whining never works and it made you look terrible
  unironically using the ngmi meme
  nah i used some default krita brush its called like rough inker or something      cute
maximum effort  i think the original thread died i had to look up the ref
  blog now    are you the guy that drew the monkey those lines look similar dunno
  sick blog
  thank you op i need to practice more and these kinds of challenges help
  this took a bit because i kept getting annoyed at myself but im ultimately happy with how it turned out     no nipples because i realized i forgot them too late and couldnt make it look normal woops
giving free art
  super clean an i love the stylization you used      i really like how you stylized her  also upper right full pic when      nice linework i like the colors      were you even trying this is so messy jfc anon
  not doing art for free as an enjoyment  pathetic
  the coloring on this looks really nice    i like the way you did the face
  that bulge god
  she is so pretty nice art
  i wanna see your mop feet
  looks like kaguya
always welcome feedback
da wip
there ya go

  cute 
  who is chris
  chris oneil oneyng    if you really dont know here      your style reminded me of his
  ticc
  commission tier drawing for this garbage thread  you just did ops work
  gives advice  his drawing is shit  this is why nobody posts their work
hippopotamus noises
  nice
tfw you never want to finish anything and drawing in itself is depressing  sorry op this is the best my willpower can muster right now
friends motivate this draw fag to give life to his idea a pure elven maiden
  meant shitty draw fag  pretty much cant do anything but i try shoulders are fucked up among other things it someone could give pointer id be grateful trying to make the top to be made of leaves since elves mean nature and all also no consistency between legs drawing is hard dudes im in awe when i see some of the drawings here
  
  get back to java faget
  i fucking love this anon blog please

what does /ic/ think of contemporary painters    i personally love the work of victor zayas but im bothered at how some contemporary painters can both make marvelous beautiful work see ronnie landfield his for william blake is beautiful despite all else while the rest of their work is pure meaningless jackshit
  i think its too difficult for anyone to escape the echo chamber in the modern era to do anything truly outstanding
  what kind of echo chamber do you mean
  not him but i definitely feel stifled by the endless influx of often excellent art and media and the instantaneous lol gay omg so gr8 of social media    it takes constant effort and discipline to escape the cacophany of human noise and practice anythingvisual art music or writing especially if you need to work a job for a living
  it takes constant effort and discipline to escape the cacophany of human noise and practice    youre absolutely right
  in the past you would eventually run out of books youd like to read tv would be reruns and trash for most of the day your friends wouldnt want to hang out all day every day    now there is more tv and movies and porn and online pseudosocialization available than any person could ever consume every moment of spare time can be filled with entertainment optimized by thousands of experts working around the clock to keep you glued to the screen    its hard to acknowledge ones own weakness to temptation but its like being a fatty and passing by a free ice cream and pizza buffet on your way to the gym every day no matter how strong your will eventually youll take a taste and most of us will gorge ourselves once in a while    i think that even if i withdrew to a shack in the wilderness my mind would still be twisted for years
  youre absolutely right and ive seen from other people in artistic depression we will often sink into sedation and oversaturation yes you have to train willpower but also see entertainment and social media for what it is white noise and emotional vacuum   just like food addiction you have to cut immediately and try to understand the mechanics the thing youre addicted to to get off it
  i want to become a great artist but i dont want to be poor
    assuming what you mean by contemporary painters  painters who exhibit in contemporary art galleries    most of ic isnt willing to engage with   contemporary painting paintings which dont flex traditional technique/fundementals are dismissed as pseudo conceptual bs     /ic/ values tradition and technique more than it values experimentation which is the hallmark of contemporary painting and thats fine contemporary painting/art isnt for everyone
  id say that there are still contemporary painters who utilize fundamentals or exhibit some level of appeal to traditional painting techniques while also innovating phil hale comes to mind and i think hes probably the most popular theres also that abstract realism idk if thats the correct term style that people like benjamin bjorkland and nick runge use but yeah i agree with you /ic/ is mostly about commercial art so the discussion is heavily skewed toward concept art and porn commissions since thats what brings in the dough even discussions on comic books or web comics are pretty limited here
  yes youre right no normal functioning human can truly escape this iron cage of modern entertainment i say that with enough confidence because the artists philosophers and writers of our time all have some sort of disorder  psychological or not  that allowed them to shut their senses and focus inward    prousts in search of lost time deals with that the main character explores all mediums of distraction be it societal sexual egotistical etc only to at a late age discover that true success in life can only be achieved when you abandon these pleasures if at his time the beginning of the 20th century it was so tough were going to need supernatural force to achieve anything in the future
  well can be really good when the painter understands what hes doing
  yeah /ic/ is definitely not interested in art only commercial drawings i hate saying commercial art because it is contradictory art deals with beauty and beauty alone    on the topic of contemporary painting i understand why some people are so reticent on it its literally an industry we have established painters who vomit art daily and make millions out of it when in fact the only thing theyre selling is the name if they werent famous and recognized their art would be labeled as pretentious and the artist a dilettante    the second problem is the art itself most of it i dare say more than 90 percent is pure nonsense the most famous and respected painting of my country is called abaporu pic related the painter when asked about its meaning said after a thunderous sleep filled with nightmares i woke up and in a frenzy i painted it i had no idea what i was doing i just knew that it had to be done the following day the painter brought it to her husband so he could figure out the meaning of the painting baffled he called a friend and they spent a whole day trying to find out what this piece meant when they did they pronounced that it was the portrait of the brazillian working man its small head symbolizing the lack of critical thought the big extremities symbolizing the hard working aspect the posture meaning the connection with the mother earth etc etc    im perfectly aware that the abaporu is not contemporary but it is still the most exact definition of what art is to our contemporary culture
  you make a perfect illustration for the hunger after meaning in todays art world without context this painting would mean little to nothing to me the story  which is still wonderful for the people involved  is too subjective and i wouldnt even come up with the idea because the painting doesnt attract my attention the painting still doesnt mean anything to me desu but im not arrogant to say that everyone shares my aesthetic a taste i dont share and thats that   but i agree the industry is shit and its always the same couple of people made of a structure resembling a political one who decide what hangs on the walls and what wont thats just how it is now theres no diversity in it which makes it al very onesided and hollow a lot of the time  still were lucky being the first generation of artists to be able to share and sell our work to people all over the world our ability to network has spread immensely so theres that
  thank you for this post i feel fucking insane because im completely content by myself living in my own little art world of discovery and self exploration i will definitely check that book out
  interesting take    i certainly dont hate that painting but i would probably hate the tastemakers who elevated it to the status of a national treasure    i think fine art paintings will always be a commodity for the wealthy its a medium that produces a one of a kind object over the course of many hours and usually requires years of training/practice by necessity it requires a patron with some dough if you are painting in italy in 1600 you will have to paint some angels if you want to make a living or even have your work displayed somewhere besides your garage    so perhaps it isnt that art or artists are broken but that our wealthy elites are broken they have no taste and dont even pay lip service to a spiritual creed aside from whatever progressive dogma is trending this year they dont even care to surround themselves with crass baroque opulence because they wish to present themselves as average joes just doing the will of the people

  i like painting     
  i really like this  you know how you go along and have thoughts/ come to conclusions but never put them into words that focus them for the mind to see clearly  well you just did on this point  thank you sir
  i understand your point regarding the painting but i do hate it because in my vision it marks the birth and evolution of a culture of ignorance led by fools when we analyze a work of art very obviously the object being analyzed is the work itself the effect of the painting such as in impressionism where the focus is on the effect created is merely and only a symptom of the tools and techniques used in the making    the very same painting can cause many different effects on each viewer but the artistic element can be reduced to a single point or fact of the work itself when many viewers have very distinct or even absurd interpretations of a single canvas most likely the painter failed when there is no common place of opinion regarding a work of art analyzing it would be no different than analyzing the viewers mind a painting that allows the observers thoughts to wander aimlessly is not creative nor thoughprovoking its bland and its empty that is why the abaporu is not only bad it lacks beauty it lacks focus it lacks harmony it is the most awful symbol of modern art
is zdzislaw beksinski contemporary im not a huge art person i just like to draw but i really like the aesthetics of his work pretty shallow perspective but i dont know how to gain anything deeper
  i also agree perfectly with your view of our wealthy elites function surpassed beauty and modern art is no more important than wallpaper when decorating a house    however true artists have always lived and trived in obscurity prudhomme won the nobel of literature that was denied to tolstoy and no one reads prudhomme anymore proust had his books denied by almost every french publisher forcing him to selfpublish and remain unknown for long after his death while balzac remained the epitome of french literature for more than a century id say that the modern capitalistic culture and way of life enforced more than ever that art is no more than a tradeable object but we have been living in this culture for decades now and we still have not found our sowaited artists of obscurity whom i dare say simply do not exist
  of course beksinski is great there is always an eerie feeling to his colors and sceneries a sort of mystic melancholic view of reality    i recommend you watch this documentary to have a good start on aesthetics 
  art deals with beauty and beauty alone  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

nsfw artist survivalism talk thread    today on the menu     is the market saturated are we competing against one another or all in the same boat   where to promote our work without it being obviously shilly   what is your long term strategy to financially grow as a lewd artist   is your following loyal how loyal how did you achieve a loyal following   has tumblr banned you yet i seem to be immune no idea why   whats the new emerging sites for lewd artists   is instagram with censored pics worth it   is normiebook with censored pics worth it   if i make an instagram will my 70 year old aunt know its me due to phone number   what are you having for dinner today    and in general id like to appeal to other nsfw artists here to be more friendly and supportive of eachother i genuinely believe that the pie is plenty big enough for all of us who make good lewd art those that dont put in the effort will fall short as they would anywhere else its easy to feel scared and ultracompetitive when starting out but dont let fear turn you into a cunt and dont let /ic/ turn you into a cunt either probably too late lol
you faggots deserve this after all these years of tax evasion now its coming to back to bite you on the ass
    i have an accountant anon
  having an accountant doesnt mean you pay any less for the full freelancer ride
  it also doesnt mean that i beat my wife
  is the market saturated  im beg but it really looks like it but its the same for any other form of art i suppose
  its only saturated if your art and fetish selection is shit
  this there are always new frontiers to explore in the world of creativity and imagination
  whats the new emerging sites for lewd artists  id really like to see some thoughts on this i lost my tumblr and i didnt have a huge following so getting started organically on insta/twitter will be difficult i feel like the best case scenario is to start over on a fresh site
from what i can gather  porny porn porn arts are not really in a market whats happening is people who are interested in porny porn actively or passively lurk around different communities in search of stuff for whatever reason some of them like depicted fetish some of them might like specific artists style in any case they might show interest and start to follow this specific artist around thats not really a competition      ive lost my tumblr too and didnt had time to alert followers by the looks of it it will take quite a lot of time to get even semblance of traction on twitter so i guess its time to hussle and properly tag shits  i was thinking to extend from twitter to furaffinity hentai foundry and picarto technically theres newgroundsstill cant believe that its a legit alternative to tumblr now and pixiv but eh also it depends on what you draw if its kissy cutey vanilla then insta and facebook might be an alternative but i dont know what audience there is maybe its very bad and overlyvanilla
    you didnt get your accounts back
    whats wrong with hentaifoundrycom
  its fifth day now from the moment when ive contacted the support no response still terminated
    this      do people actually use it i see hf profiles come up occasionally while browsing but i assumed the userbase had stagnated
  im curious about this too mostly because i get a lot of glitches trying to upload to hentaifoundry on mobile/tablet and i dont have a working computer right now so im just considering not using it
can you guys help    i made a second insta on my phone on for my nsfw stuff and i want it to be totally separate from my main i have a different email and everything but i have them both on my app on my phone at the same time     anyway can people from my main account see that im the owner of the second one i ask cause i uploaded some lewd fan art and someone i knew from my main account liked it hmm
bump
  i dont know i see a ton of good artists so i dont think thats the problem fetish is another one what kind of fetish were you thinking about    but even without talking about porn there is so much offer and sometimes for really cheap      creativity and imagination doesnt seem to sell tho fanart and formulas do most people doesnt care about lack of creativity
have any of you had any success with patreon im personally kind of done with commissions i cant seem to make them work as a business mainly because the pay isnt good enough for the amount of time i put into them on average it takes me about 10 hours of work to make 100 personal work goes a lot faster    if theres any enlightened person who knows how to make patreon work for them and wants to share with the class please do and post your address ill go suck your dick if it helps me get things going
  do you already have a following the only way to really get patreon going is to have an established following shill to them constantly and promise exclusive perks
  why are you faggots so obsessed with competition why the fuck does it matter do your own thing you are fucking insufferable youre one of those people who when someone takes you fishing all you do is ask we too close to that boat should we move i think we should move i think were to close are we too close just fucking fish you god damn retard
  furry artist here     is the market saturated are we competing against one another or all in the same boat  among simillar styles youre competing but there are many unique styles its a very individualistic industry     where to promote our work without it being obviously shilly  no such thing as shilling post everywhere     what is your long term strategy to financially grow as a lewd artist  be actually good at art if you can draw content nobody else even has the skills to you will be very safe if you just have an interesting but simple to replicate style all it takes is one new artist to do it cheaper and more often and youre done     is your following loyal how loyal how did you achieve a loyal following  interact with your clients get them in your artist discord talk to them on stream make them your friends     has tumblr banned you yet i seem to be immune no idea why  not yet     whats the new emerging sites for lewd artists  none for furry     is instagram with censored pics worth it  dont use instagram but censoring porn in general is a bad idea youre sexually frustrating people and you will on the number one spot for drama hate and leaks     is normiebook with censored pics worth it  ditto     if i make an instagram will my 70 year old aunt know its me due to phone number  get a second phone/email/etc if you really want to hide from your irl life     what are you having for dinner today  i dont eat    not my art
  i have about 6000 followers on twitter and 10000 on tumblr i dont even know if thats enough   my main issues are the general issues that plague most ngmi people i can do the drawing part but i dont really know how to make a profit out of it im rather bad at engaging an audience
  im not sure if they know its you but it for sure will put your porn blog in their recommend of anyone your even facebook friends with or have innyour gmail contacts
  patreon sucks it makes alot of money but also pisses off 90 of your viewerbase who while they may not be your clients theyre what put you on the map with their retweets and sharing  ive seen many artists go the patreon route and 3 years later everyones forgotten they even exist
  im not sure if i believe this
  i think he might be referring to some kind of situation where someone stops releasing their content to the public to focus on their patreon audience almost exclusively and thus disconnecting themselves from the internet at large
    patreon exclusive art delayed pics by a week or a month keeping complete versions of art exclusive and keeping decent resolution/nonintrusive watermark pics only patreon are all pretty regular offenses especially so in fetish art     i cant speak for everyone but if i see that shit take over someones gallery or social media i quickly lose interest in them if youre going to go down that route you should consider picking incentives that wont piss off the masses that made you relevant
  the problem is youre the one establishing these practices as standard in the conversation rather than stopping at the cautionary tale   patreon does not necessarily suck it does not necessarily pisses of 90 of your viewerbase i think you failed to present this issue properly because while what youre trying to say is valid you made a broad statement on a platform that is more confusing than useful for anyone considering using it
  what kind of fetish were you thinking of    none in particular though you have to take into account supply and demand for each one if there is even a real way to be aware of all that    cheap shit will always be cheap shit there will be those who produce quality at a low price but i cant imagine that lasts when these artists become more known    i think art style factors into demand as well some are more appealing than others for porn though getting as gud as possible with proper fundamentals will do you no wrong id guess its about being consistent and outlasting the competition in terms of how active you are  tfw still havent made that art blog to rake in that sweet taxfree commish money
  you will do fine around 1 in 800 will throw money at you or it can be a better
  forgot to say i wasnt the one who made the claim lol
  ive got twitter/tumblr/newgrounds/hentaifoundry/pixiv/deviantart    i dont feel the market is saturated since there are so many niche series or even just art styles that dont have hardly anything  there are a few followers who are very supportive and all my clients have been great so far  i joined the hentai foundry discord thing too afraid to speak to anyone though    only made money from commissions so far id make a patreon but im still just thinking about what to offer  long term plan is a secret but at the moment im working on some comics    if im going to make it im gonna have to start doing some collaboration hit me up the names sexynomicon
make degenerate stuff  furry faggots will throw money at you
you know
anyone else checked out  yet seems japan is getting in on the commission game
  youd be amazed at whats tax deductible as a freelancer
  food rent and any art supplies are needed to work amirite
  are you sure even though my emails are totally separate
  you actually could segregate a part of your house for work specifically and deduct a portion of the rent you pay relative to the square footage
    at least in murica call it your office
  not that anon but yes having different emails doesnt matter a lick if you have 1 instagram or facebook account they will be linked to the new one without your permission  happened to me i googled it and this pretty much happens to everyone its not possible to do this and have the facebook app on your phone too people theorise they are actually basing it on your ip rather than anything   only way to get it to stop was to completely remove facebook from my phone never used it anyway and to uninstall and reinstall instagram even then it still suggested contacts in my phone without my permission so i went and blocked them all once i started following art people and posting stuff suddenly i stopped being recommended people i might know irl
  are there any resources for this or do i actually need to track down a lawyer to figure out the basic tips and tricks
  is instagram worth it  is facebook worth it  holy fuck no way  is the market saturated are we competing or all in the same boat  i personally believe these are two very different questions whether or not theres a large supply of nsfw artists were all in the same boat we have the same goals i think we should appreciate that  whether or not the market is saturated is a really difficult question to answer because the market is so spread out between platforms instagram has a partially different userbase and therefore a partially different set of consumers/market from tumblr not to mention how hard it is to find all the nsfw artists on a given platform until everyones art can reach everyone who looks at nsfw art we cant really tell if there are just too many nsfw artists posting content in other words we should focus on building our own niches and reaching everyone possible before giving up and saying there arent enough eyeballs for all of us

  be actually good at art  wait is the guy who does soul silver good at art    none for furry  how about for nonfurry
ive been thinking about going into drawing for a profitable hobby that pushes my limits but im a little apprehensive to consider anything lewd i know its probably the easier way to get money especially since im charging 15 but its also disparaging to be known as that porn guy i think its just getting over the stigmatism and the weirdness or just saying no porn and going with sfw stuff i dont know   i think the hardest part is going on tumblr
actually become a decent drawfag for the sole purpose of making my own doujins someday  a good doujin idea or scene pops up  draw out 5 pages realize how shit and cringy the writing is  become demotivated trash it all away  rinse and repeat  mfw    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh someone save me from this hell please dont let my hardearned drawings skills go to waste  anyone out there really passionate about hentai who actually knows how to write and wanna collaborate  shitwritingcockli
storytelling is also a skill op  your first drawings were really bad right and you got better with time  the same goes for stories those trashed attempts that you made probably will probably help ypu to get better in the future
why did you make a second thread
stop these threads shitter
  i forgot the bottom part
    shut up weeb fag nigger its called comics here or sequencial art if you want to be fancy we speak english no one cares if you cosplay and have learned to pronounce a few japanese stock phrases badly
50 percent of the threads 50 percent of the posts
  remove all writing and dialogue outside of moaning  nobody is ever reading their porn dumbass
  post your drawings op i dont think youre going to get anyone serious messaging you without knowing what level youre at first
  i dont want to link to any of my finished stuff but to prove that i can in fact actually draw here is a sketch i drew of rikka i can link to more of my stuff if someone sends an email
  emailed you
  speak for yourself if a doujin has shit dialogue i lose almost all interest the hottest thing about porn is the context of the situation and the mental descriptions
  he reads hentai  anon thats stupid  also my screen is usually moving too much for anything to be readable
  i agree the power dynamic can be the hottest thing about porn communicating it visually is important but having the dialogue to back it up really fleshes it out
  also my screen is usually moving too much for anything to be readable
try having a mute character so you only have to write half as much t mute fetishist
  do throwaway stories with super quick sketches to learn the story telling and not let good drawings go to waste
   post work
  
  if you are good at drawing writing hentai must be easy because its very simple and formulaic you literally can get away with anything as long as your characters fuck each other besides the dialog is always the same after the first 24 pages on a 12 page format so your plot and settings should be presented in the first 4 pages before the sex ensues then you can default to every story progression on hentai   getting nude/foreplay  amazed by dick size or pussy shape/wetness  fellatio with an im at my limit at the end  cum in mouth  sex  climax with lots of fluids  aftermath with semen leaking out of pussy prego or a knowing smile    one thing to have in mind is that people love their weird/bold phrases in porn so you should include one of them or even make your story around them like  cumming in your mother underwear is the best  even though im the president im fucking this 10 yo pussy   being fucked by satan is hella good  this is what i get for being a slut   being a rapist sure is fun  things like that work as the titles as well and add to the meme value and give you a chance that people share your work or so i think im not sure lel i dont write this stuff     also you may want to add some kind of tension in the story in netorare typically this come in the form of trying to no climax while being fucked by another person or the fear of getting caught by the real partner but the fear of getting caught while fucking works for every genre and so is the fear of getting pregnant discovering a secret and surviving are less common and more niche
  i wanted to do porn comics but then i realized my rape fetish was too degenerate women would hound me down all day for normalizing it
  its probably fine among the crowd that reads doujins even the women i bet shindol does well and his stuff goes hard
  post a sample of your writing it cant be that bad 99 of doujins are shittily written so youll be in good company
  this but if you just want to draw there are plenty of writers that will be willing to work with you or that you can commission      as someone who writes erotic romance novels trust me when i say a lot of women have a rape fetish the dark romance genre is full of it and most of it is written by women makes a lot of money too     i will say that you will need to keep it among your niche because people will judge you harshly for it and attack you its just something you have to be prepared for so dont use your real name or any identifying information
  rape or its soft version psychological abuse is so rampant that many best sellers feature it from beauty and beast to 50 shades wopen loves this stuff not all of them of course but a significant part    heck just look at goblin slayer rape scene in the first episode many people complained that it was too sexualized when in reality it was pretty dark and horrific if peopoe found it sexualy appealing its mostly because rape is often an unadmitted fetish
  there are plenty of writers that will be willing to work with you  i figured so which is why i made this post in the first place      i dont wanna make those cookiecutter hentai
  well then just make what you like op you just need some practice  and congrat on becoming a decent drawfag thats what i aspire to be too but for doing games not doujins
  i wish i liked games too because i can both code and draw
  i can code wished i could draw which is why i lurk on /ic/  ive tried collaborating with artists but every single time we couldnt agree on what direction the project should take and it fell apart  which is why i think its good for you to try doujins those are small projects that you can go through even if theres some artistic disagreement with your writer
  all writing is cringe without good enough context
  a good doujin idea or scene pops up  draw out 5 pages  you made it didnt you  i have 0 idea and 0 page
the old one got archived
influence from tattoo flash
would love to get some constructive criticism
      great ideas but you might want to grind a bit on shapes and forms
  some stuff over the past week
  really good id recommend expanding your tool set to include darker and lighter pencils  maybe even get some half tone paper and white conte
drew this a few days ago
painting experiment
  thanks ill keep that in mind for later but i cant right now because i need to save money for christmas shopping
  just a couple random ones i did which i liked
  heres some more i guess
various character designs
  this ones incredible
might turn this into a painting
  really love the color and linework work on perspective and form more and itll be even better
  these look cool process on these designs
      very nice
      nice rembrandt style with a little touch of watercolour your art would look great
  thank you honestly i just improvise
naked chicks and dino dicks    planning to eventually do a full painting of this as a desktop background though theyll have cloths will have to move the composition fit it across multiple screens and actually have a background
showing a friend how boxes can be used to draw more complex forms    boxes arent a meme but you have to be using them for construction in offset to get the full benefit moderndayjames and kjg tend to show this process in their content
      these a fucking awesome dude artist tier style
  your most honest and brutal crits please
  i love the leaves and branches you communicated a lot with just squiggles
anime is holding you back from progressing the sooner you drop anime is the sooner you can become good  but you should practice both fundies and anime at the same ti  no just stop anime
  literally retarded and ngmi or trolling and maybe gmi
    dont drop anime and see slower gains vs dropping anime and then seeing gains gmi
  gains    gains towards what tho
  i dont even draw anime im just saying you are retarded
  i dont even draw anime  more power to you my bro
  i did and my work improved
  how long have you been drawing for
  switch back to the edgy batman knockoff
    has it become a staple already
    less than 6 months
  no
  yes
  sure i dropped anime and now i am getting commissioned pretty regularly  dropping anime has also helped me practice colouring even more often its amazing how by just doing this simple act i am churning out more and more finished product  my anatomy is now the pinnacle of perfection and so many people on artstation is praising me for it feelsgoodman  do it anons drop anime
i dropped anime and i felt a lot happier
  you also gotta realize its much easier to make money as a free lance artist that can do both fundies and anime as opposed to just fundies   you can think soley of progress you need financial stability to keep that progress going
  anyone can copy a video of studies and call that work
  is that katalina and rosetta from gbf
  yes study critically acclaimed fine artists like jackson pollock and friedah kalo instead that will teach you real understanding
inb4 op is just doing the classic /pol/ falseflagging tactics by being a smug dipshit about not doing animes so that people get antagonised by op and end up sticking even more to animes  inb4 ops main point is actually just draw whatever you want and dont be like me  thanks dude
  yep the artbook is really beautiful
  good taste i have the digital copy of it and its one of my favorite
  animeshitter delusion
  gets a single case  tries to apply it to everyone else  thanks man you made my case even stronger
  as i said same thing  thanks again d
        
  when faced with reality the animeuser retaliates
  2013 was the best
  no anime is the only reason i started drawing in the first place if i cant do it ill just stop and spend all my free time playing video games like before
    nobody says you cant do it just dont do it when trying to get better
  holy jawline that is almost meme level
  is this what its like to study anime alongside fundamentals
  anime  more likes though and thats all we are here for
    you cant make quality anime without the fundamentals who would you follow an authentic japanese artist with quality work or an /ic/ faggot who can only draw barely passable anime with tons of flaws and uploads nothing but studies
                            t samefagging /pol/tard carbs  youre never going to make it your art probably looks like shit you and most likely dont and cant draw kill yourself
  crabs
  anime is gay
  nice comeback post your work faggot
  you first
  mastery levels become more and more lewd  is hentai the way
  3rd mastery is the best one the last 3 ones arent that good imo especially 5th is pretty bad and weird shading on the 6th
  i think the idea of it is less appeal but more of skill behind it the artist can obviously draw in all levels but someone whos at 3 cant do 6 while someone at 6 can do lower etc
  nsio is a retard that has no business talking about any kind of mastery the guy barely knows how to draw and only stays relevant by making horrendous tutorials for the lowest common denominator
  better than 80 of /ic/ most people here are unable to draw that head angle on the dude
  still better than 99 of /ic/ which unfortunately includes you and me    pyw before you dispute this claim
  makes a claim regarding the low skill levels of an anime artist  implying his nonanime styled artworks has better standards  nothing to back it up  cmon now you know how this works dont you 
  nsio sucks not even him
  i dont think its as much anime as it is getting stuck on one thing in general i know a number of people who do manga that moved forward into fundamentals and not only did their manga work improve but they became very good at other forms of art as well graffiti writers tend to have the same problem of pigeonholing themselves into a very specific genre and neglecting the rest
i stopped drawing anime but then i got addicted to crack and died 7 days later
  those look nice
    jesus christ this was me in less than 1 year too bad im stuck at tumbler tier
  this you know is full of /pol/ and /r9k/ larpers when these asoteric advices start appearing   you dont need to just work and study like everyone else no anon has this simple contraintuitive advice that will make you better than anyone else in just two steps   lazy people are always looking for cheatcodes instead of actually putting in the work whether it is not drawing anime for years or not masturbating or not drinking onions based products or being an autistic asshole on tinder all of these advices are signs of shutin spergs taking over a board and they will always fall for these memes because they sound easier and simpler than just working on yourself
   have been on this board since 2013 im literally a forefather
  if you want to shill hentai is limitless
  yeah we had retards since forever but they being taken seriously and their retardation being spread like memes is the problem im talking about  also everyone is an oldfag if you ask /pol/ they will all swear they are not redditors that got in from r/the_donald
by drawing anime you will never learn how to draw a nose
  true
hey lookit i drew muh first animeme
  if you knew how to draw a real head then your anime head would look good
  shit u right
reminder today
  pure anime is okay  2050 realistic anime is great
  dem some big ass chins
  you mean stuff like street fighter and lotgh
  exactly why is 5th especially bad not trying to be snarky here my beg eyes are just too inexperienced to spot the mistakes i do agree that 6th looks bogus and pushoverish even for these laymen eyes of mine though
  lmao  did someone traced the rock and made him a shitty superhero
drop anime ive improved so much and now i am so great at art  doesnt post work  i dont believe any of you until i see work posted i like to see actual results and not just claims without proof
daily reminder
  post the pokemon/sonic one
  thats the point anon op is falseflagging to make purist loomis bots look bad
your imouto iffy uh    loomis got da stiffy uh
  desu i wouldnt have learned how to draw a creature facing a certain direction without anime    that being said i dont draw humans i draw fucking dragons and my art style has been subconsciously influenced by spyro the dragon
  heres an idea  just stop drawing youre going to suck no matter what
  drop anime ive improved so much and now i am so great at art  nobody said that you stupid retard
  just stop drawing anime youre going to suck no matter what

  iffy nigga  hampton gang
  the third one is different character entirely
  its the same character
  it really doesnt look anything like her
  sorry buddy but you must be legally blind it is the same character same hair same hair accessory same dress     you might as well complain that the soul eater not series looks like like og anime
  does not look like
  i loved soul eater not    didnt watch the original though too kiddy for me
  just three different levels of rendering over the same foundationless garbage
honestly i stopped drawing overly anime things despite enjoying anime a lot i wanna improve as an artist rather than falling back on common crutches
  this depicts 4chan in a nutshell considering that its an anime imageboard
  its rather worth to pay more attention to those fuzzy lines
  those anime eyes are soulless
remember

    if you drop anime then all the /ic/ girls will come crawling to you i heard most women here like it if you draw animals especially dogs
  i dont draw at all i used to when i was like 15 i was pretty decent but my harsh fucking life has broken me down into the shell of a creator i once was i was into animation hung out on ng and wanted to work for disney now id be thrilled to even hold a job in macdonalds is there even any point in even trying at 28 i just feel like laying down in my grave
    i feel this to the core dont give up anon
  try at 28 instead of 48 dont give up
  yiff in hell
  i laugh everytime i see this pic so hard because i imagine how someone was so upset by shitposting that he had to make it
  till this day i still dont know what yiff means even though ive said it numerous times and i refuse to google it
bump to remind
basic anime style doesnt bother with nose cheek shadows and chin other than that i dont see major problems as far as i am concerned dadaism and cubism is the problem that should be eradicated
  or draw whatever it is youd like anime or not  which is what im going to continue doing
  yes but you wont progress
yikes
  redline it please
      should look something like this

daily reminder that the people who make these threads cant draw and wasted years learning how to draw with nothing to show for it
  cant draw  wasted years learning how to draw    so that means they can draw retard
  retard
reminded
  it really is
anime is holding you back from progressing     towards what /ic/ is full of people with no fucking idea what their goals are except the vaguest git gud    if you want to draw anime drawing anime will give you progress in that direction
anime kyle firez chris hart loomis  no anime illastrat jimmy ericc brian  different strokes for different folks
  no just stop having fun  grind fundies until you no longer like art that way /ic/ wins
    if you dont enjoy repetitious practice then ive got some news for you
  bump
  keep going anon

  repetitious practice
these pieces of art are drawn by 4 different artists  when will you be joining the /meta/ soft airbrush artstyle and make mad patreon bucks
  a mix of 1 with the proportions and face of 2 but keping the bg will be just right
  2 looks great 3 and 4 are eh 1 is inbetween
  imagine being the worst at the style you made famous
  the middle two even copied the way they sign their shit
  dam  now that explains why some artist are super stingy sharing their secrets or techniques
  less creative thing ever
  2 is the one with the most fucked up anatomy  btw overall are all very good my top  3142
  oh look another pointless sakimichan thread
  well what happens is first chick releases a tutorial on her patreon for first pic the other 3 copy
  why do normalfags like this bland shit
  because they are normalfags anon
  4th is nice and not cluttered with random shit i kinda like it the rendering on the body is clean it also has less of that sakimishit going on with flesh bulging everywhere  hate 1st and 3rd though theyre so similar too whats going on
  i like 2 and 4
4 seems to take less skill but is the one i likke the most purely because it looks less similar to the others its also less cluttered    also the more stylized face is cute
  skill also involves knowing when to hold back fourth is more skilled for that reason alone
4 is the only one that looks professional could be used for poster/packaging/splash screen the others are gaudy clusterfucks and if the crystal shit is supposed to be her tail it doesnt read that way at all on the first 3
  this shit looks so fucking samey its not even funny this is why i dont follow meme digital artists like this theres just no fucking point       many intricacies are lost with digital especially when everyone is using the same presets after a certain point everything just looks the same
i hate how the npc meme was appropriated to just politics bullshits when its more apt for this kind of thing
  this is depressing to look at  it doesnt look like any of these artists had fun at all
  but theyll be having fun spending their patreon bux 
  after a while you dont even care about money i have money as a data scientist but now i want more time to do other things
  degenerates
  why is even the backgrounds the same
  this is really funny  everyone wants those patreon bux    im liking far right its the most original out of those
  this
1 and 2 are somewhat different  i have a hard time differentiating 2 and 3
  she has 9 crystal tails its not a background
  you cant really steal and copy the secrets and techniques from an actual artist     you can easily copy sakimichan though since her process is just one of many simple basic digital drawing processes its more disturbing that some other chinks went their way to base their whole art identity on replicating her process thinking that her style is a key to automatic success
  this once you have enough money for a safe living style the real important ressource is free time      i really wish i was smart/good enough to learn those basic steps though not that i want to become a sakimiclone but 4 is actualy quite close to what im trying to achieve  i would need a written breakdown on it though i tried watching some of her wip videos but i dont understand it well enough
    this is why i was surprised sakimi would put out tutorials expecting op image to happen at some point same thing with that one chinese guy /ic/ loved that opened up a school they just devalued their unique aesthetic
the same people that shit on the semi realistic clones are the people that praise animu artists because theyre work is somehow unique  all art will look similar to something and will be inspired by someone else   the look of soullessness is bad but biting into other artists because there art is clearly influenced by someone when pretty much 90 of the art industry is filled full of artists copying one another with few people trying to push boundaries is pointless  its sad
  these pieces of art are drawn by 4 different artists  but only one of them gets paid     nobody cares about those sakimichan copycats because shes still there you cant be the second somebody when the first one is still alive
  the look of soullessness is bad but biting into other artists because there art is clearly influenced by someone when pretty much 90 of the art industry is filled full of artists copying one another with few people trying to push boundaries is pointless  while i kinda agree with what youre saying in general have you taken a look at these artworks its way past the inspiration stage at this point the 1st and 3rd paintings are pretty much the fucking same and you know they do that not because theres an artistic intent behind it but because theres a patreonbux reward  also what does anime have to do with this shit you know half of this board hates anime right
  my guess is that someone was going to find out eventually and likely cash in better that they do it and get their bux from what i can tell most of these popular digital artists all use a pretty similar process anyways

if you seriously are trying to draw now at 30 years old youll never make it just find another hobby the sooner you realize that is the sooner youll get to not waste your golden years
wrong pic related a drawing from a pushing 50s maybe older than 50 woman who decided to study at the atelier i was attending quit projecting your failures onto everyone else silly boomer
i started drawing at 30 and im now getting commission requests at 31 just finished my first commission probably not going to do another for a while more fun to make my own stuff arts not that hard to learn if you actually have goals and put in consistent effort
projection thread
  so shes a human xerox
  this    /thread
  yeah except that drawing isnt even photorealistic you fucking mong
  if youre europoor and 22 years old or more youll never make it just find another hobby  same if youre a manlet under 170cm or have a small dick just not going to cut it anon the sooner you realize that is the sooner youll get to not waste your golden years just bow down before the asian übermenschen that took hold of the industry in the past decade if your neuroplasticity is low youre ngmi too just quit anon
  thats just racist man dont be like that
  its probably too late for op because of his laziness and shitty attitude however for most people thats not the case drawing is a learned skill that anyone can do i dont know what age has to do with anything
    blog or gallery pyw
  my goals this year were to grind my perspective  anatomy  get a dose of style influence that i like im putting my focus onto improving those skills much more and also adding a variety of coloring techniques to my repertoire
  ayy another fellow that start from this year too  good luck man
  thank fren you too 
  people make a living drawing portraits like that you autistic jew
    might as well take a picture itll last longer
  crabs will say literally anything to justify their own lack of skill so pathetic
      anyone can learn to draw from observation like that with enough time its hardly skill
  this skill takes time to learn  hardly a skill  do you understand how retarded you sound literally any artist worth his or her salt can draw from observation none of your favorite artists started with construction i guarantee it maybe find a hobby youre capable of understanding like stamp collecting
  imagine posting on an art board without understanding that observation is the key to drawing
  literally any artist worth his or her salt can draw from observation    factually not true and you know it tell a weeb artist to do an accurate still life and they cannot do it     anyone have that in order to draw this you must do this image
  i said artists not weeaboo faggots and even they have spent time learning observing and internalizing the human form quit making excuses for your lack of ability and just go draw youre obviously upset about it and sitting around shitting on others achievements on 4chan certainly wont make you get good miserable bastard
  i said artists not weeaboo faggots    kay then your whole post is disregarded
  a pleasure  goodbye
  this 100 and i draw anime theres no way to draw passable detailed anime girls without knowing your anatomy you can kind of get away drawing chibis but if you know anatomy you can actually make them cuter honestly so just learn from real girls please
  shut the fuck up
based op dropping the red pills on these ngmis
  drawing  waste
  making it   hobby
  seriously    even moreimagine believing once someone learns to draw from observation they have not acquired skillto draw

why does trying to draw require so much mental fortitude i have to withstand harsh criticism from myself and others with no reward at the end its really hard
nothing worth doing is ever easy
thats why you let your depression kill your ability to feel emotions silly op
  draw fan art for a small community of non artists they will praise you and even if you know ita not worth anything it will make you a lil happier try a waifu threads
dont take it too seriously have fun with it i dont think anything in life should be taken all that seriously im not saying to not put a lot of effort or have self discipline and practice a ton just remember why you started to draw in the first place dont lead your brain get in the way of the joy of drawing
    let me reverse the question why wouldnt it and i dont mean that in a snide shitposting way but as a genuine question
  criticism is meant to adress the mistakes youre making right constructive criticism at least the reward would be you knowing whats wrong correcting your mistakes and eventually drawing better its not a short term reward and thats the hard part but heres when what  said comes in
  i dont know the answer to that /ic has always been massively negative towards my art too all those value posters theyre only here to taunt us i think its that youre happy with your drawing at its completion keep going and ignore the derision youll get there
    why take the criticism personally     it doesnt make you any greater a person if you can draw well persistence and hard work are better abilities to value yourself by and they will eventually lead to proficient drawing anyway
  just accept the fact that you wont be gud for another year and keep drawing if you havent made it by then just keep telling yourself next year
getting shat on has definitively helped in taking things less personally and getting myself more out there
   i have to withstand harsh criticism from myself and others  thats the fun part tho
  i dont think anything in life should be taken all that seriously  if i did that i would just shitpost on 4chan and smoke weed/eat icecream all day i know by nature i am incredibly lazy and would like nothing more than to be lazy and never produce anything even if you say you dont propose not studying in effect it is what you are proposing for people with a nature such as mine if i didnt take this shit in the most serious manner possible i wouldnt do anything
  if youre too autistic to handle criticism well why the fuck are you doing any kind of art form
  youre right you should just give up
  this you can find cheerleaders    you should only care about how happy you are with your art though    if you impress good artists with your work then youre probably doing something good
  cavatica stoutus  strong in body and powerfully built this thickbodied creature exudes a distinctly bold and delicious nose  
  give yourself permission to draw bad art
  not op but how do i do this  im not trying to say that is bad advice i think its great advice but so many posts i see like this boil down to  just change yourself  if changing yourself was that easy it would be easy to quit drugs or stop being lazy or whatever the hell  its like people that say  be process focused not result focused  but how can that be believable for me when clearly nobody actually thinks this nobody appreciates me for who i am they will only do so if i have something to offer to them that they like my own work
i like criticism and thrive on it if i dont get any feedback i lose the urge to keep improving     just a /beg/inner though
  my strategy has always been to set out to make a mistake normally ill be mulling over something i read or talked about and see if i can intentionally make the mistake and then see if it can potentially be interesting     and change yourself you almost certainly are making bad art as it is the difference is youre likely just choosing to do work as opposed to doing nothing and telling yourself itd be really good if you bothered   be process focused not result focused  yeah exactly the goal is to do work change your focus so that doing anything is your standard for success just draw and so on  but how can that be believable for me when clearly nobody actually thinks this  people that are productive think like this people that are lazy tell themselves theyre perfectionists   nobody appreciates me for who i am  why should they you know how many people there are    they will only do so if i have something to offer to them that they like my own work  eh if ive learned anything from a lot of the virgins on /ic/ a lot of them will just hate you for doing more than them     the reality is that almost everyone will never appreciate you for who you are no matter what you do no point giving a shit about it
  to be honest what i get from your post is that you agreed with me but told me to do a 180 on what i should think because im right what i mean i agree but i dont understand how this is supposed to convince me of anything new save for this one part  change your focus so that doing anything is your standard for success   but this just goes back to what i said its not that easy not for me anyway  i read this so many times now about switching your focus to the process but that doesnt work at the end of the day i keep trying to think that but the moment i look at what im doing i still see how it sucks i cant just magically change that by wanting it can i maybe other people can i dont know
  how can that be believable when clearly nobody actually thinks like this  ive seen countless people driven off from /ic/ who do think like this the irony being i think desu a large portion of the crab bucket type here could use a dose of it its good to remember /ic/ can be a bombastic stilted place   as for what    said you could set out to make a mistake or maybe try humor if you can detach from your art long enough to make a goof i think its a good indicator of your relationship with it and i dont mean a needling passive aggressive schadenfreude type of humor either as thats still the wrong focus and includes you in it the focus should be defocusing from your own focus if that makes sense  i think the whole premise of what youre asking though is really a lifelong process especially the being detatched from the selfin a knowledgeable good way and the being able to appreciate yourself before/without egotistical proof so to speak ie being a good artist the proof will accomplish nothing its just a crutch that will fail you at times which is why i think learning to enjoy the process and yourself/life is the key
the pain makes the long victory even sweeter    i hope so at least
  youre not clever youre not unique youre a brat pining for attention by signaling how quirky and special you are all youre doing is refusing to type like everyone else by insisting on posting desu in all your posts  youre not cute youre the image board equivalent of a furry going   wags tail
  you just have to tell yourself to stop giving a shit occasionally looking at shitty art also helps by giving you a confidence boost     youre not the shittiest artist out there maybe your art is still shit but its fine youre shit and thats okay because if you keep drawing you will eventually become not shit whenever someone shits on your artwork just think i already know im shit you little dipshit and proceed to correct whatever part of the art he shat on    dont give a shit and look forward to that glorious day when you become not shit
  is this a copypasta now    or are you the same person who posted it already and trying to redeem yourself by acting like it was a meme all along
  im actually coming to realize this myself lately and ive gotta say its a powerful thing rather its powerful to realize its fine to like what you make flaws and all and its equally powerful to detest yourself for not being able to draw as good as you want to    youve gotta learn to love you and what you do only then does art truly becoming rewarding/fulfilling
just stop reading tutorials and looking at professional drawings for a week and focus on drawing things you like fanart is my best recommendation just have fun and dont focus on what was wrong    just look at this i felt overwhelmed by tutorials and all of the shit i had to learn so i stopped worrying and just drew whatever i wanted its so wrong even my non artist classmates noticed his neck was broken and face was shit but i was proudly showing it off everywhere since i enjoy berserk and it was my first fanart then i started doing more incorrect fanarts not even looking at references so the faces and clothes were barely recognizable but i had fun drawing again after that sure i decided to improve my work with more studies but i know i enjoy taking a pen and doodling shit i like go do it reduce the criticism to 0 justify yourself saying you havent studied the thing you wanna draw so its fine to get details wrong
  are you content with the idea of not amounting to anything and be considered a disappointment and a drain on your community  im asking this because no matter what worthwhile thing you decide to pursue you will encounter the same harsh criticisms and the same possibility that it will in the end all be for nothing
whats the difference between how to draw anime art and appealing western art with a clear anime influence
  iove this artists drawings but i forgot what their name was
  nargyle
    nargyle  this is some nice dynamic stuff
  appeal
  thanks
  the gesture is strong in these but the form still feels strong and solid      how
  strong gesture and solid form are incompatible  
  design
  you try to be anime but you also try to be disney or western comics or something
  structure
  how to draw anime art trys to apply western drawing princples into drawing anime while art with anime influence applies eastern drawing principles into drawing cartoons if that makes any sense sorry if it doesnt thats just how i view it i might be wrong though
  draw spiderman porn
a bad western anime drawing is someone stacking underwhelming fundamental art ability on top of a misunderstanding of anime and appealing design    a good anime inspired drawing takes good fundamental western drawing style and combines it with appealing aspects of anime    basically one artist is informed one is not
  so literally design the answer thats always given and toroughly ignored because you faggots dont want to accept theres art fundamentals beyond what loomis wrote
  if you draw spiderman its like a rule to make his poses as dynamic as possible
    are there any good sources for learning design like this
  whose art is this my dude
  studies thats how the op pic learned it too she said she didnt use any anatomy books or instructional vids at first she just did studies of dynamic poses from anime she liked like the stuff from studio trigger the rest she learned by trial and error id recommend you do the same there are some basics to design like big medium small and what not but when drawing dynamic figures like the op pic it comes down to intuition gained through trial and error
  came here to say this many good westaboo artworks are still recognizably japanese while retaining western character design approach matters more than motifs and gimmicks but western howtodrawanime books focus almost entirely on gimmicks

    i draw messy anime stuff and shitpost sometime   also i got banned from instagram for posting asingular sketch of a titty
wwwinstagramcom/dalonhall/    pls no bully
  also i got banned from instagram for posting asingular sketch of a titty  seriously sound overkill considering the amount of attention whores and i follow a lot of artists that post their sketches full of tits and nothing seem to happen to them eh  cute goats by the way
  still fucking butthurt over it and theres a lot of art page that solely posting nude drawing  now i feel paranoid to even post slightly nfsw sketch on twitter
  you wont have any problem with twitter even if i like when people separate thei sfw stuff from the nsfw one might be annoying but cant you start an instagram again censor stuff and post the link toward your twitter whenever youd post smut

  stop trying to be a rapoza copycat    seriously
  not doing it on purpose but please fuck off
  well then youre lost  i withdrew my follow
  k
  i withdrew my follow
  lmao why are you copying his coloring style and characters tho
  having a power trip over withdrawing a follow
  coloring style i literally color picked from old sci fi comics like planet comics and their printing color sheets and color balanced it except with paintings which i do by just guessing colours because i suck ass
  dont play fucking stupid with us
  i dont know i dont see it in your paintings as much but that blue guy has a lot of overlap with star veil even the way you stylized the features and the character design in general
  this lmao what a fucking loser
      let him have his influences hell grow away from em eventually
  constructed using the loomis method i think my stylization is just a mix from my weeb years whatever else ive picked up on the way colors picked from planet comic again    as for the design helmet idea and the neckscarf thing i got from gatchaman specifically just wanted to try to do glass in comic style you can see it again in the zurkloid helmet which is inspired by even campier and older things shoulderpads are just generic as shit star because its a simple geometric shape and a bunch of heroes and protags from that era are corny and have symbols like that see pic therefore starman    also ive rendered with small strokes since dawn of time just scroll down boi
  imma upload a big ol video just to prove you wrong
      skip to around 25 minutes and you will see the swatches that i posted when i start coloring now go into your corner smartypants
  so how does this disprove that youre trying to be a rapoza copycat lmao

      look at all those people in the self promotion thread pretending they dont care about followers el oh el
  probably has more to do with you being autistic and announcing things like that
  just stop lol
anybody use nprint what are the recommended file settings
  shut up bitch or ill commit an act of the follow withdrawal towards you
  i like this new meme
  everyone must care deeply about losing one follower  hahahahahaha
withdrawing follows from everyone in this thread 
anybody who is relatively good knows not to post their shit here
anyone below this line will gain no new followers  
  she reminds me of emilia khalessi clarke
  to be honest i always thought this thread was for us to show our shit and talk about it i never saw it as a follow4follow kind of shit  kind of retarded that a lot of you seem to think that way
  im thinking 90 are baiting and acting retarded and only a few are f4f fags
  bro 99 percent of these cunties only want u to follow them so they can unfollow u in return theyre lazy its hilarious how they think by getting more followers makes them believe theyre valuble    theyre all normies who suck balls
  i just wanted to look at /ic/s art
        i always saw these threads as a way to basically be able to follow other artists from here basically as an user log instead of actually a way to gather an audience which would be at max minimal because this board is small af
  i followed some decent artists from here a got a bunch of followers but ironically in most cases it wasnt mutual
  
hey lads  
  this its a great way to get a snapshot of the types of people who are posting here     its also an easy way to link to your blog and work if someone on /ic/ wants to see more
am i just fucked    people are constantly reposting my images on instagram and such and they dont credit me my instagram posts hover around 50 likes while theirs get a few thousand my images are good it seems but i just dont know how to make people notice that those are mine an image of mine recently got the frontpage of reddit i tried to credit myself and i got fucking shadowbanned for posting links    even worse some people uploaded my images to redbubble and they sell well but heres the kicker redbubble decided to side with them to take down my gallery redbubble doesnt even answer my mails do i need an attorney    what the fuck is happening i just feel so helpless
  watermark the shit out of everything sing your shit and dont post such high res that redbubble can make anything out of them like 500x800 or something     but yeah you might still need an attorney
  oh yeah also make reddit/facebook/other social medias and make it into a huge outcry great publicity
  post links and well i mean at least i will make sure this is pointed out in the comments section of these stolen images
  i tried to credit myself and i got fucking shadowbanned for posting links    r/art mods are such powetripping nazis same happened to me
  fucking hell sounds awful but if you can be heard this should give you a fair bit of visibility i guess post your stuff here and examples of those fuckers  good luck man
trying to into background painting or layout art for animation     twittercom/gerdsart  gerdktmtumblrcom  artstationcom/berguukion
scifi dinosaurs etc        
    this is so awesome    brofist    very nice too    guys i just noticed im a few followers away from 1k on insta would you please help me reach it

  followed
  lmao    
  shittttt i was moving from tumblr to instagram should i just post wips and aggressively red bubble my own shit before it leaks
  there is this image i did a while ago and i recently learned that a chinese company is making a fortune by selling tons of products with my fucking painting on it flattering but here i am worrying about my next bill    welcome to the fucking jungle learn to defend yourself or perish
  just watermark and dont post high resolution make everything under 1000px before posting to social media besides traditional pencil drawings because nobody prints those
  
hey guys im trying to get into animation school do you think this will help my application      embed      anonymous 11/17/18sat182558 no104196028     i love playing soccer so i made a few about that too      embed      embed      anonymous 11/17/18sat182747 no104196064     i also really like sonic adventure 2 if you couldnt tell      embed      embed      embed      anonymous 11/17/18sat182848 no104196086     i also think a lot about weapons too especially big ones that blow up      embed      embed
took a detour into traditional the last month getting back into digital    
  reminds me of my days at an animation studio where everyone had access to the job application form we had so many people like this anon applying that we made a separate slack channel for these gems like seriously are you retarded autistic or just 9 years old
  why would you be so mean i am going to work as an animator and im not going to let a big meanie like you tell me otherwise
  by watching these i assume you are actually 1416 or autistic its okay to do cringy stuff but none of these will help they are all awful you should try to study animation on the internet read some books watch videos on youtube etc not just play around
  wil you people stop being mean i am 11 years old and completely normal and i am proud of my work and isnt the point of being creative to play around
    4chan is for 18 year olds and up youre a little young to be posting here but if you are not trolling and youre actually 11 i can just say keep going and draw as much as you can no one expects you to be a great artists at 11 if you practice well you can be really good in a couple of years
  your work showed your age if you start learning seriously now you might actually become something study hard kiddo     you play around in the creative fields but first you have to learn how to execute your vision which requires actual studying you have youtube and the rest of internet to find free resources for this you can literally just search animation tutorials     the autism part people thought assumed you were 18 or over and at the mental stage of 1014    also you are too young to be here see you in 7 years
              disregard pretty much everything   twitter of that youtube channel doesnt read like a kid and the videos are pre 2005 so probably made by a kid but around a decade ago
  really enjoying your study of the ffzok reference    
  i think im going to make it
  contrary to what my username implies i have stopped uploading animations and almost only post mashups of all the stuff ive done during my childhood    props on you chums im mirin your stuff                      
    
  im using my brothers 4chan account so its okay for me to be here but thank you for the advice i will start studying more
  yeah we already got the bait m8
  im a retard forgot the image
bump
    i just hope i make it

twittercom/pheranmilam    im going to die before i get good  im going to die before i get good  im going to die and all i will have done will not have mattered and nobody will remember my name    aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh
  that mindset is the only reason you will fail
  
  getting a heart attack in my early 30s is why i will fail
  then stop eating cheeseburgers
im up for making friends and sharing advice and stuuuff       
  i feel like the rendering doesnt suit the cartoony style lookup imilar artists and see how they do it
  here is minne
     hey man change that mind set and keep practicing    good piece anon i like it
cleared out the room of twenty or so canvasses and brought in four new stretched boards something is on its way
ten good paintings were destroyed some can be repaired all of them can be made again still there is some worthwhile art here amongst the smashed stretcher bars didnt manet also have torn up art their ruins may become a life of their own the future being undecided being an ostracised outsider is a marvellous position also the long walk of rediscovery of the self
  how about you paint one good thing instead of wasting 500 boards by covering them in shit jimmy
  my original plan madam was to not paint a single thing until spring however i have been given a request for a new work so i am making preparations
stiannartisttumblrcom
  some new videos for yall    
it is a new day i woke at three pm it is raining heavily and i should not like to be outside i have a clear white studio room and await inspiration
  nice blog where do i unsubscribe
its just random warmups for now fingers crossed ill have a day to paint again sometime soon
  i think the joke is that its a blog thread and he made a blog post
blog is back online  
  cool to see someone actually working on something keep going
    
dont post super often but i do my best       
  make an instagram dudeeee i really fucking hate using twitter 
how come tumblr videos dont load on phones is it because of the cp app store debacle
thank you for inspiring me to give up
  
  im currently experimenting with styles and doing commissions
        tumblr is one of those sites i wanna grow my presence on but holy shit the number of people just reposting stuff from twitter and pixiv
  yeah and most people like your stuff when its reblogged but dont go on your tumblr to see the other stuff you do so in the end few people ends up following you even if one of your pieces is successful shits weird
  awesome dude    btw im new to instagram  instagramcom/davinasmile
hey guys looking for a bit of advice ive managed to get 1000ish followers on twitter by drawing anime fanart but somehow my followers are almost exclusively japanese and i dont know any japanese so i cant communicate with them id like to start over on another platform where i can interact with the community a bit more can someone give me recommendations instagram vs tumblr vs deviantart vs other options id prefer to just focus on one platform at a time also
  im in nearly the same situation though my pixiv has most of my smut and has 2k followers and twitter has around only 20 but at least the algorithm starts to promote my tweets  it felt like being stuck in that twilight zone in which i can barely interact with the japanese audience with my halfassed japanese and the english speaking audience being scared off from interaction since i post in japanese
  try pushing you values a bit more especially highlights youre a little too restrained atm and its making everything flatter than it should be youre making solid progress  i bet youll be very good soon if you just keep grinding gj anon
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh i want a girlfriend i want a girlfriend i want a girlfriend aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh goddammit i am so lonely and horny aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh pleeeeeaaasse give me female companionship i need it i need it i neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttttttttttt aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  i dont know how to describe it
  hey  cute digits mind if i check em 
i used to post my tumblr in these sometimes but tumblr actually fuckin sucks in pretty much every way so heres my twitter    twittercom/ronnychem
instagramcom/justadudesdrawings  still doing a lot of different stuff
  want to do more characters but im also doing digital painting
  mostly sketches
i am nowhere good that ive packed up my brushes nothing can come of nothing when the earth has passed its shortest day i can only hope its astrological movement drags me with it towards a new zenith yet still i am fidgeting to draw and paint i am unhappy so why shouldnt my art be i could buy a half dozen cheapest linens and daub miserably sometimes it pays off honestly i have been here before
wwwinstagramcom/elektrolurch/    i ireguarily post stuff on ig so i havent found a direction jet
  i like that chicken
    draw mainly /co/ stuff
wait  i need a phone to post on instagram
i want to see if its true that patreon im just creating an account    
look at my stupid drawings      
trying to do about 1 a week     i post here less frequently but ive put some time lapses/sketches up      this is dope      i think we follow each other on tumblr nice to see you on ig as well       i like your aesthetic a lot      great shapes
          i dont post often than i use too but i do art mostly once a week or so
    follows anon    anon doesnt follow back    maybe anon is testing me
  who did you follow and who are you anon
  
  get over yourself no one is obligated to follow you
  follow back  cancer
  was going to post my gram but yall are so bad i dont wanna be associated with the likes of you
maybe drop a dm saying youre a d/ic/k so i know to follow you back i already follow a lot of you there anyways  
  lol git gud faggot
  i hate this shit ill follow people whose art interests me and i really really want them to do the same with me i dont want your kindness i dont care about meaningless followers  it may sound mean but its really great knowing someone is following you because theyre legitimally interested in the art you make instead of just for this dumb following back mentality like its some kind of favor and they owe you something
  hey i know you ive been following you forever
  get followed by a bunch of people after popular person retweets your posts lose each follower one by one for five days  what the fuck did you even follow me for    the politics behind the follow follow back bullshit is retarded and pointless
  yeah thanks for your support all this time man
c0hil
i draw all the time but dont post that much  
   the fuck did you even follow me for  to show that popular guy that they are good fans  something like that
  hobby artist engineering student  which engi  imma electric engi
  software eng
  nice my uni has got com eng instead of software eng and i kinda wished i had majored in that instead of ee more coding stuff which many employers seem to like  anyway quite liked how you draw facial expressions
    i only post on twitter cause tumblr has melted considering trying da again as well
  another art example havent posted this one yet though it was a practice of an ipad program other drawing was done in ps

chun
  what was the point of this drawing
i fucking suck  i hate my art and i always delete if right after im done
  to articulate a pose from a 2min life drawing pic related
  do something else besides whining about it then change up your style into something you like
  and im done with these drawings
  nice series haibane renmei is the best
  hehe that expression in contrast with her body made me laugh
almost done
  cute
  i hate that kind of mindset why post it then if you dont care for it why should anyone else care
  i wonder who drew this
  go to previous thread to get your answer
  no
  draw stuff outside your comfort zone until you like what you see
  fuck off
  actually forget that one  the leg is jank
  stop whining pussy why post your garbage then to gain sympathy points
still unsure about the composition    ohh i like this
  stop posting your copy garbage here
  thank you drawing cute haibane is the reason i started drawing
  found it thank you
  howd you learn to use value and colors like that
  thanks frend i like your style too
im not really sure what im doing when it comes to not using outlines wtf do i do next just keep mottling and refining color areas would a more textured brush help me out here    also do you like the yellow bg object like this or
  like this
  beautiful hatched koishi is in recline
how bad is it
  face is unappealing
  is it the nose
    not him but the face is lopsided noseless is possible to pull off but the face is almost directly facing the camera despite a significant portion of the skull hanging off to the left side of the camera and then the hair is just kind of lopsidedly plopped on to the left    to continue nitpicking the random cut/indentation on our right side doesnt make sense given the gesture and the arms are anorexiatier her left our right thigh attachment point similarly makes no sense bending out at an awkward angle from a hip position that makes no sense    tldr do more gestures and simplified skeleton spine/hip/ribcage studies    your rendering is half decent and you actually kept trigger discipline in mind though so thats a plus
hi i finished and gave up on my merchant because it could not be salvaged i do not understand form values anatomy or rendering and it is over blended 0/10 would try rendering a second time
  its great for a first time anon my first time was way worse
  also the rendering is great
  great job
shading with ink is hard
  do you have a blog
    thank you kind anones
  nice
do people normally render in grayscale and then color the grayscale values i saw it in a jap guys live stream but i dont understand how it works if your not supposed to shade with black unrelated image
  its something you can do but its ultimately a crutch outside of pieces with very complex lighting fuck around with your blend modes if i remember correctly overlay  subtract is a decent way to place local color and colored shadows
  dammit guys hes getting too powerful too fast we have to stop him
  cute major proportion issues but still cuteeee
how can i achieve this soft nicely gradiented look    the artist of this piece has a process video but it isnt really revealing since you cant see what tools hes clicking    
  another example different artist
    i still have no idea what im doing somebody help
  soft round or similar brush in whichever program youre most comfortable in bit of texture/noise/dithering on the brush too so its not all perfectly smooth either also clipping masks and temporary layers possibly set to multiply so you can clean up a shape to fit what youre going for without messing up everything else and then flatten it down once youre happy with it lotsa practice too dont worry i suck at painting as well but the first step to being good at a thing is sucking at the thing you gotta just keep at it brush technique unfortunately isnt really a thing you can teach with words gotta build up that muscle memory and intimate understanding of a tool through doing    also dont forget your color theory even tho this character is blue they look all warm cause they use warm hues to shade and highlight everything also helps add contrast
    major proportion issues  yyeah i am working on those    thanks anon
  i think his knees need to be up higher his arms also look a bit wonky i like the soft colors the only thing thats missing is the snakeskin pattern on his jacket
  love it great use of line weight on the mouth especially you got a blog
  no blog
  damn well keep up the good work anyways
  i hope i do
  that smile is so adorable makes me wish i had a gf that looked exactly like her
  torn between styles
hows this guys
  kinda boring and stiff
  was hoping the lineart would save it
  a nice paint job wont make a house without windows or doors liveable
  yeah but this is a drawing anon not a house
  adding fancy linework to a stiff pose just makes it fancy and stiff
  some small tweaks will make it less stiff the biggest thing that stands out for me is the arms move the placement of her hands a bit since both of her arms are at almost exact right angles in turn you should be able to pitch her shoulders up/down adding a bit more dynamism to the pose
a work in progress havent started hatching yet
  hands are too small/flat
  fuck
  right tight too long and the perspective on the left one is kinda funky
  not bad id really recommend studying clothing and drapery and the way folds work because youre adding all these clothing folds that just dont make sense and dont need to be there less is more anon
  made some progress i still dont know if im doing this right or not
  it looks really good from the thumbnail a little rough at full size i noticed a tangent though from the cloud to the footprints that you might wanna change as its a bit distracting
  what tool are you using if you dont mind me asking
  thanks didnt notice the tangent my other artist friend says if im going for realistic/semi realistic those clouds dont really cut it how wuld you improve what ive got besides tightening up things in general
halp
  i cant speak to how to make it more realistic since i dont usually paint but i will say the sort of style you have going on now is actually pretty appealing even if it wasnt your goal
  the toes  is this a furry
  you cant tell it might aswell not be furry right
  idk sometimes ppl on here draw human toes very silly and offalso theres no tail so i was not quite sure
did i fix her face
im a little tipsy but im enjoying the increased talent level in this general
    youd be surprised how much power you can draw from an overhand slash
  your drawing is boring and stiff because you forget to take into account gesture you end up with an awkward line of action through your drawing and it makes the character look inorganic loosen up anon bend those knees slightly give her dynamism and avoid stick figure syndrome drawing
  other than the short arms and long legs it is a better gesture for anon
  pigeon toeing  opinion discarded
  one foot is longer than the other your line weight is too uniform and the face is kind of iffy fingers are too thin as well and the armpit/arm transition suggests anorexia i like her design and colors and especially the dfc so id like to see more from you its a good start but not quality cutelewd yet
  based
  you poor thing you must feel really dumb right about now
  i think the pose on the left suits reis character better though the other one is more appealing
i noticed that she was off balance    thanks for the input thats a really bad habit of mine
  the redline is worse  not surprised  just look at the size difference on those arms  lmoa
  being a weeb  yikes
how can i do better
  more interesting subject matter  more interesting colors  occlusion shadows  secondary light source  reflected light  background/environment  more characters to interact with  more curves on those legs they look almost carved out of wood  drop shadow    all i can think of for now
  i like your style as it is stop thinking of better and enjoy yout current style to the fullest
  posting in a weeb thread when youre not a weeb  why dont you go to africa to complain about niggers
    big whoopsie on me anatomy and portioning is still something im working on the main take away was that  needs to practice gesture to make his drawing less stiff    that was a poor choice of mine its just typical for a lot of anime girl drawings i blindly followed the trope    should i continue redlining or should i just keep to myself
  would roughly fuck
  making your shadows different colors instead of toned down values would make it look more appealing i dont agree with  the brush looks nice
  yeah youre one step ahead with gesturing but youre still behind on foreshortening
  the right colors you will use should save it
  lol i love this cute face       when im back from my shift ill try and hel you with this more reis is always necessary
   thank you  i should have clarified meant better in regards to the rendering like how to make it look cleaner i just dont know anything about rendering      yeah youre right about toned down values i just used brush flow to color it like that
    not     but i like your pose it feels a little out of character tho
                update guys
  fucking kek
  the pose is still awful how is she standing her feet arent even on the ground
  im too far in man sorry
  i blindly followed the trope  glad were on the same page dont do it again
  kek
  why not just trace over the red line you got and claim it as yours
  maybe later
i think its done
  study from eva doujins to see how others have learnt to draw the characters
  any good ones
  yesss cuteee please maek blog alredy
  some critique since no one is giving you any  the face is a bit too low on the head and the curvature of the head off the hair make the head seem extended to the left too much the lower half of her body is too long and too far to the left making her look really off balance her left arm is too long and her left shoulder is too far forward  overall it seems like form and proportions are what you need to focus on  sorry if i seem like an asshole but your stuff reminds me of my art when i started posting here and some anon helped me out in the same way i would give you a redline to help you visualize these but im not at home
making an asuka drawing now after rei    hows this pose
  draw some asuka x shinji next
how the fuck do you make something look cute
  what do you find cute anon
which is better guys
  kinda stiff right arm and left leg are too short
    you started pretty good but you are messing up the face it feels flat especially your reis face felt flat think more in 3d
  you gotta rotate your drawings so their feet are actually on some sort of surface dude fix her weird lean
  a few things i also picked up on is the feet are small and the face feels flat the way they drew the hips is good and looks very eva but its the face and the feet thats letting it down and the boobs feel a little flat so maybe its worth them working out their 3d form some more on the boobs also for them to keep referring back to the model sheet of asuka
  where is your line of action
    here is asukas 3d forms i figured out for you   by tracing over her model sheet
heres a character ive been working on for a little while any thoughts
  cute genki girl demon noice
  looks good just be careful with your thigh gap there its making her stance awkward
artemis    trying to due some more dynamic shots with my art
  i like   are the horns covered by skin that is a interesting choice
what do you think
    this might help you on your next piece  
all of these lines probably werent the best idea for speeds sake
  you are very kind anon      it seems like form and proportions are what you need to focus on  yeah i also think so     sorry if i seem like an asshole  not at all thanks anon
  nice are the runes supposed to mean anything
  not yet haha
    these seem heavily inspired by a drawing from previous thread hmmm
  
  doing it with in a different way is it looking better or worse    i am trying to find a different method than hard round cell shading
hi
quick n messy but really fun      it looks diff an im happy to see you pushing yourself i need to push myself more honestly hashdf wish i could give any useful advice      i like these a lot nice muslces
  i like it frend i would make the hand outlines a bit darker but i like the style
  one minute fix
  hey frank araya how can you spend years drawing and dont improve at all
  i really like this one but i feel like you are really bad at lineart in general there are some really good lines and then you start scratching like you lost interest and just want to end the thing    are you using the eraser for the line weight
  you are very cute i want to hug and hold you
  wwheres the glasses bridge
  it was a stylistic choicei forgot to add it in
  although for whatever reason i think i like it more that way
  sorry i didnt draw the fighter i drew the girl with the gun kind of a recurring character of mine
  literally no idea who that is i think you have me confused with someone else    you may have jumped the gun with your dis there
  woah this is great
  i like this a lot
  fuck i love this nice colors also enjoying the left arm and the movement on the right hand keep it up anon good stuff here
  nice digits
  fug thats nice    this too love those feet and hands
  is that you yev
  another one    this one looks cool good job
the hand doesnt look right how do i fix it    love your colors senpai    cute koishi
  it is
  would you happen to have a resource on correctly doing simplified skeleton studies is it just finding reference images of skeletons in various poses and recreating them in shapes that vaguely resemble the skeletal structure
  wish i had a neck like that
  its not a lineart its a sketch hence why it ends up imperfect
  kara boga
i am just tryin to find an aesthetic man like what would make this more pleasing to look at pls
  i mean cleaner lines i think but ive had people say they like my sketchy look should i stick with what ive got which isnt much kek
      also finishing the eyebrows might help some fukn christ
  if you learned how to draw and stopped acting like a teenage faggot
  what aesthetic decisions did you actually make in producing this because it looks like none at all
    i think the main problem is that the handle is too big for her hand
  thats so cool
i want to make her design better what can i do  i still have to complete it i have to draw her daggers she has a tatoo on her hip  i want her to remind of a phoenix or something
  oooh i like this a lot
      i got inspired     gonna make something fun with it
    i would add some texture to the different materials to make them look different also add some interesting shapes to make it less plain    as for the phoenix you can choose a phoenix motif and repeat it through the character    i hope it makes sense
  it makes sense anon thank you a lot
      you brought me back from a couple months of artblock
  fucking kek
  mighty kek
  lel
  not an expert but palm looks too elongated and the ring/pinky fingers are too short foreshortening error otherwise i like it good job anon
  damn thats sexy
  thanks anon
  jesus christ
does the hand holding the flag look right something seems a bit off in that area
  its the same thing i keep doing the hand is too open you shouldnt be able to see that much of the fingers its like the pole is pulling away from her grip
  no need to follow all the steps but try to learn how to use colour directly as fast as posible
  cute those boots are fockin nice
  which ones man
  far better than my rei
i love making comics specifically of stick figures theyre goofy and fun
how is something like pic coloured it reminds me a lot of range muratas stuff which i love too
  looks like yellow color dodge with a soft brush     but maybe hes just good with color and simply paints in without any layering
    looks like its scanned from print which gives it a subtle texture something to keep in mind the original would look way cleaner
drew nami
  what will happen to her
  oh asdljf sorry my apologies yours is still cute too i actually made a bit of a redline thing for you    notes the faded out leg thats bent more is technically more accurate but is more so for fitting in a run cycle the exagerated leg extension looks more like shes leaping but it in my imo reads better and conveys more motion as a single image than the correct positioning does but the end result you want is really up to you also the far arm would mostly be obscured by the rest of the body in this position save having the elbow peek out a bit behind the back the main thing i wanted to get across tho other than the perspective and pose corrections is the way the torso/shoulders and hips torque during a run where the forward limb leads so that it twists like the simplified cylinder example i provided    hopefully that i was able to write that in a way that wasnt too confusing my apologies if it still wasnt clear enough lemme know if you need anything clarified          danke and yee i love hands so much nailing those kinda chunky proportions on them and the feet is my fave part with most drawings nwn      cute frog      kitty ears make everything cuter love these by the way      wait if im me then whore you      i love the way you draw eyes also your thin lines i wish i could be pro like that 
  your redline looks worse and you type in an exceptionally irritating way
  redline looks worse    the pose is an obvious big improvement why so salty he clearly knows his stuffs and his lines are neat
  nice redline blog
  shut the fuck up imp his redline fixed glaring issues that a monkey could see just look at the leg on the left for christ sake posts like yours are why /ic/ gets shittier and shittier year after year its just a bunch of apologetic shit tier artists circle jerking to each other and shutting on genuine talent and criticism at this point kill yourself
  really got your hackles up huh
  wow anon thats very unwholesome and negative of you to say uwu
  yup this board is nigh indistinguishable from da and tumblr with shitlords like this mucking it up
an all might 100 from memory i dont know how good i did as i didnt look at any reference
  nice buzzwords for im jelly and hate people better than me    seriously anyone that uses writing style as a triggering point means your mentally retardedrded
    asdfaf uwu youre such a meanie anon uwu sorry uwu asfdg
the gun gave me a lot more trouble than i thought it would
do i belong here sorry new to the whole everything about this
  cute work freind your animes are right on the cute mark
    really lovely good job
  definitely some issues in the shoulder area but overall its not bad however you shouldnt feel bad about using references you cant learn through purely trial and error
  hi smurf im surprised and pleased that youre drawing higurashi fanart its nice to see you drawing more than opm fanart the stocking was good too
  didnt u learn in anime101 that the face is the most important aspect
  from the thumbnail it looked like she had a nice dick with a cock sleeve on it or at least a strap on very disappointing
    thank you    yes i was inspired by shuten dōji from fate/go    added the legs and did some more rendering also tried to fix some of the hip issues
  hows my hard round brush painting coming along
  bowstring must be on the other side from the arm and there is some real fuckery going with the right arm
  really digging the mood and storytelling here hope you finish it    man this thread has so many cool pieces heres mine   im trying to improve my colors and create more dynamic shading can anyone help
  eh i know i can be a bit grating sometimes but hopef i was able to help them out some even if my redline wasnt the best w      nellipher  tho a few more of you have been showing up without me posting it for a while so now im wondering how yall are finding a blank twitter hahasd      is she supposed to be a giant cause if so thats asdlfj ver cute regardless i like her design a lot
  yeah i like to do stuff different sort of since its the same hcking character to keep it fresh      thank you frend it took me way to long to finish this so im probably not going to try this again soon desu but it was fun      yes please
boy i sure do love drawing some giant sloppy tits
  got some condoms on her nips
  just how i like em
  cuuute
  like it anon  just clean it up a tad more
i love this style anon good work
  ill probably have it done by the end of tomorrow helped to fill in the rest of it so it didnt feel like i was just polishing a turd
  its coming together very nicely just make the chain on her belt make more sense how its attached mostly and imo hyper render the stockings
  rad i love seeing fanart from shows when i was really into anime been seeing a lot of dokoruchan lately as well
  looks like he is pointing with his pinky at first glance
  is that brian
  me too
what do you think  im a bit proud of this because its better than what i usually do but i hate it so god damn much like you cant be more dull than this
  if this is anything close to what you usually do then you are really good anon i think it is a nice figure even if you think it is dull inspiration comes and goes to be honest just keep drawing frend
  i changed a lot sorry if it is jarring      i made a lot of changes assuming you are going for an anime style but disregard anything you hate the proportions were the biggest issue really    you have fantastic line art with great line weight however i feel like you rely on harsh lines to convey definition this isnt necessarily bad but overdoing it can lead to your characters looking more hard or old than you want them to it is generally used with more masculine characters if you want her to look super muscley than keep it in but id consider softening it up a good example of lineart shading where it isnt needed is the hip bone    its very intense remember in real life nothing is outlined     your coloring is good the way you drew a white streak of shine on her leg combined with the harsh shadow makes it look like its made of plastic however and youre inconsistent with shading     the biggest proportional issue was her head and neck as well as her left arm i couldnt fully fix the left art but the way the hand is forcing itself to face the viewer would be painful irl youre doing great anon i didnt mean to crush your tomboy dreams by making her a soft anime girl
    just an example since i did a poor job with my mouse of keeping the same amount of abdominal definition this artist drew super hard 6 pack abs with 0 lineart its an extreme example since most artists will use at least some amount of linework to show detail but just to put some ideas into your head
  you need to study anatomy the ribcage the pelvis and the limbs are all going in their own separate directions and theyre all out of proportion the shading is inconsistent but before you fix that you should try to do some gesture drawing and to practice forshortening
  this is neat
  okay i tried to make this better  changed the pose in something much more dynamic but im not sure if the anatomy is still correct  what do you think thank you a lot for helping i really appreciate it
  and done      lets say its up to your imagination
  pp is big and hard
  nice rendering  i always wondered how did you get such nice hair linework in your art i think its tough to just draw hair from real life ref since having to simplify them is a challenge in itself
maybe i will be a good character designer in the future
  shes not a giant quite the opposite
hi i tried painting in greyscale and then converting to color
  im brian thats why it looks like brian finished it
  stop harassing the youth brian
  i got places to be
  no you wont rush youre only gonna remain a jobless
  thanks mate ill do        oh yes thanks i dont mind youre being helpful    i wanted to make a fit girl but ended up with a less stylized figure than i expected and less feminine too seems like the more i study the more a deviate from animu its a curse  i read hogarths dynamic hands a while ago and since then ive been drawing really bulky hands and completely forgot how to make them delicate lol     i really like how you make it look less plastic by softening the transitions and widening the highlights     also the lineart in your second example is kinda my goal but it still escapes me how to achieve that look i have tried coloring on top of the lines and erasing a few inner lines but ive never got that right seems its more about rendering in the end    like here i made some changes but the result is not better but different now it looks more blurry lmao  i wont touch the proportions because i just cant bother at this point
  not bad honestly reminds me of bratz dolls so i automatically like it more due to childhood nostalgia
  murata use to do everything with markers which is where his texture came from no idea for this one
  this looksawful why is her head so small why are her arms so shrunken is she supposed to be a t rex girl or something
  this is worse you broke both her arm and leg this didnt deserve the added attention mate ihope you are regularly posting life drawings in the beginner thread becuase you desperately need to
  the trolling turns up to level delta nine penumbra
  this isnt outside of humanly possible motion range or not by far    beginner  implying
    its definitely broken if the arm werent so outstretched maybe id believe you but as it is now that position is not possible     what even is this pose what the fuck is she doing with her right hand you heard me bitch make sure you take your ass to the beginner thread and work on your shit
  are you so retarded you dont know about the virgin vs chad meme fuck off before you embarrass yourself further
a high speed ouchie
  hot
  ignore the other anon this is a huge improvement already your hands are great anatomically dont worry about not having your stylization down yet thats the fun part
      phew finally done
  since im at it little process gif of the coloring
  drawpile
  you arent funny and you art is still garbage dont try to play it off as a joke now that im calling you out on it this comes across as desperate and pathetic go to /beg/
  new thread  
  any blog
  thanks for the feedback the bowstring details been pointed out to me a bit    i assume you mean the foreshortening on the arm is a bit iffy
  i think its a decent meme but dont turn it into an excuse for not understanding form
  late as fuck but i just wanna say this is mostly cute but you really gotta work on those proportions her arms look really wonky and those feet and hands are really small and awkward looking  love the hatching and pose though
  kek nice
pirates art programs like photoshop   pirates art books and art lessons  steals the style of famous popular artists    but also  bitches about people stealing their work and art thieves  watermarks everything  whines commissions prices are too low in the market  overprices commissions and puts ridiculous conditions like you cant put this drawing anywhere    lol
  steals the style of famous popular artists  besides shitty sakimiclones despised by the rest of the art community is that even a thing kek  whines commissions prices are too low in the market  overprices commissions and puts ridiculous conditions like you cant put this drawing anywhere  have you been browsing da
  besides shitty sakimiclones despised by the rest of the art community is that even a thing kek  literally every single weeb on this board copies yoh yoshinari
  who is yoh yoshinari
  implying any of them could ever hope to recreate what yoshinari does
   about people stealing their work and art thieves  am i literally the only one who sees it positively it proves your art is good enough for others to want to be you
  overprices commissions and puts ridiculous conditions  came here to post this was appalled when some started to bitch and moan here when a client attempts to negotiate the price down under a hundred when its a sketch under a hundred being remotely close to a hundred for a sketch is astronomically over priced 20 dollars would be a more realistic price range but desu 20 dollars is already overpriced as it is
  anons who copy yoshinari  but dont animate
  draws licensed characters without creators permission  dont draw my oc
    lol those are very common
  good bait anon
    fuck off to /co/ jew
  huh never thought about it that way
  this
  since when is it wrong to study artists you like i dont see your point literally industry pros have studied him its not for his style its literally study ref    wtf does that have to do with anything hes an artist just as much as he is an animator u can study him regardless i am an animator btw but ur point is still wrong
  i wish
  people love having their oc drawn its a huge ego stroke for them literally never seen anyone do this
  its the money game anon   if you can get away with it you already win the content creators will try their best to stop it and to secure their income
what does it take to be as good at art as this guy
  unironically loomis
  (((good)))
    be autistic enough that you dont realize you are willingly presenting yourself as a proud pedophile to the world
loomis anime studies  im not even into it but id take loli art over modernshit any day by the desu now fuck off with this dumb thread
  the anime chad
hes not that good unless you meant that ironically
  this guys art is lovely followed  thanks anon
  hes exponentially better than you and everyone else on this crappy board  lol
  defending pollock
patreonwhores keep improving cause its their job  13 year old girls keep improving because no responsibilities and they all seem to have fucking natural talent  people working in art keep improving because its their job  me a future wageslave will never improve because i will feel tired as shit and frustrated everytime after work   is it over already
  future wageslave    what are you doing now anon    because i will feel tired as shit    i drew a lot more during times when i worked 5 days a week than when i had 0 responsibilities
get some testofuel  for real
  ive been neet since i quit my job 3 months ago but im pressured into working again  what about 10 hour workdays every day every week my dad wants to work me out in a hard job since all he thinks is to life is to work yourself to death we have extremely different hobbies
  do you live in some europoor country or something if not and youre an adult just get a job as a stocker in a grocery store or fast food place or something and lie to him hes not going to go through your mail is he because than you have a whole different problem than just art
me  an enlightened neet  improving leaps and bounds  wageslaves get cucked
  post yourre work
  not for wageslaves eyes
  fucking neets wont show me his path to success fuck im forever a wageslave
  recommend sleep after you eat and wake up early to practice it will help with tiredness
i bought a drawing tablet to draw while i go on the train i also mentally trace shit i see outside to understand forms better its better than nothing
  practice before work
just draw
   man i fucking feel this  im a 21 y/o custodian working 5 days a week  spend 8 hours of vacummingsweeping cleaning toilets etc thinking of what im going to create when i get home music/ink drawings  get home      god damnit   go to sleep     fuck capitalism    but then again i think im just an idiot
  you will never improve because instead of drawing you spend your time coming up with excuses why youll never improve  you are pathetic
  i hit these random moments of mass productivity and something like this happens but im still not satisfied     so it goes
  thats cause you suck otherwise you would post work cmon prove me wrong
  you made this
    i know that feel anon which art discipline do you pursue try to find a compromise people could paint simple pictures after work cause its not that time consuming like extensive illustrations or a full comic book
  being this desperate to tell him hes bad even if he turns out to be good  the way of the crab
be wageslave  work 8 to 10 hours a day  go to school 3 hours every 2 days after work  still have time to draw and improve    youre just lazy
  is this yours i like it except for the rainbow trail at the bottom
  cucked
  dunno if you are a zoomer or just trolling wasting all your energy in a fulltime job and drawing afterwards will result in not so good drawings drawings are a mirror to your soul not lying anon      not mine but hope it inspire you
i switched over to graphic design having art skills really gives you an edge over the competition but its tedious work
  been neet since i quit my job 3 months ago  youve had plenty of time to improve  dont push your failings onto others lazy shitstain
  kek pure bs      dont listen to the underage who label you as lazy go just for painting loose single pictures or sketching full illustrations or a whole comic books are incredible time consuming consider that fulltime artist need 1 week for only one page of a high quality comic same goes for high quality illustrations
  this guy gets it
  dude just dont have a job
  i wish i could stop jobbing and start drawing instead but i need job to survive  i know what you mean i often feel tired and find it hard to start drawing after work but often it also clears my mind i wont be able to study very hard but i try not to mindlessly doodle
i was a neet for 45 years and wasted it all mostly in the fear of it all ending
    testofuel    yes buy a supplement and definitely dont do exercise which would raise your testosterone with a whole set of other benefits for fucking free    i never said not to  you didnt have to
    this shitty discussion telling op to do drawings after work then exercising either choose 1 hobby besides a fulltime job or get fucked zoomer neets need to leave this discussion find a job first
be me doing it work 40 hours a week  study japanese during train commute  go to the gym 4 times a week  draw at least 2 hours every day and double that during weekend  do most of house chores because girlfriend do too many extra hours at her work  still has time to game  still has time to go out at least once a week  still sleeps 7 hours every night  still has time to shitpost on 4chan during work breaks    you have a lot of time to improve anon you just dont know how to dedicate your time to your passion
  start your day earlier drawing in the early morning  now your boss is getting tired you and you get the fresh stuff  also exercise is good if you can find the time
  how do you have the energy to do that  whats your schedule like
thank you op for that pepe
  those are what im working and while i just started learning to draw i guarantee if you make decent use of your time then you have time to draw if you let time stop you then ill just keep in my mind as i draw my poor attempts at doing these exercises that at least im not the shitty frogposter who probably doesnt draw in the first place
  hes either lying or hasnt been doing it for very long  i kept up a mentality like that for a few years but wound up burning out people arent able to work literally all the time and hes not really left much time to just rest in there
  im super serious when i posted this  i work 6 to 8 hours a day on me feet the whole time interacting with different people and carrying shit all day  i get home and draw for another 2 to 5 hours depending on what im working on  i draw standing up at an easel not sitting down    im older than most on this sight  probably 20 years older    first take the recommended dose for a month   you might be a little aggressive so prepare  then cut back to 2 pills per day  energy levels stay up and always in a good mood  it works im telling you    this coming from someone that was in chronic pain for 17 years and depressed for 11 years and did not know it    still in pain a little but am happy    still feel half crippled up when i get home but i have the energy to keep standing and drawing  sleep like a baby
    weekday  wakes up at 730  breakfast shower dress up leaves the house at 815  go to work work on my japanese during the 45 minutes commute  9 to 12 work  12 to 130  grab a sandwich head to the local library to binge on manga and comics im a super fast reader it helps  130 to 630  work  630 to 710  get back home play with 3ds / switch in the train too tired to study and yes its faster than going to work trains are weird  710 to 830 either go to the gym which is conveniently litteraly 2 minutes away from my place or do groceries / house chores  830 girlfriend gets home cooking eating  9 to 10 gaming currently playing dragon quest 11 after finishing to put a platinum on spiderman  10 to 12 drawing  12 go to sleep with a bit of sexytime if girlfriend is in the mood  fall asleep around 1230    weekend  wakes up around 10  either go to the gym or do house chores then shower  12 girlfriend wakes up breakfast  then gaming / drawing / watching series all afternoon and evening till i go to sleep  usualy either going out on saturday to go see friends or on sunday to see family rarely both    this schedule is nothing fantastic its just routine ive been doing the basic same since i started working 10 years ago only changes where that i added japanese studies before that i was gaming on the way to work around 4 years ago and drawing before that i was gaming or watching series more 2 years ago    the only times where i break this schedule is when i go on trips or during holidays so id say its accurate for 47 weeks a year
  ill give this a shot thanks for sharing    this is my schedule that ive recently adapted as ive been focusing on getting through my depression which has finally been kept under control i now have the mentality that art is part of my life and everything relates to it in some way or the other    im a little different now since i cant help but be antisocial however am social when it comes to the workplace but do whatever i can to keep myself away from people as im not really interested in them besides breaking down their character for a possible new character for my comic i plan to do someday so there will be times where ill do an social outing if im invited for a party/hangout but hardly ever    my schedule is basically this    every single day i wake up at 2 am   shower brush teeth all the hygenics within 15 minutes   write in my journal  what im planning to do for the day and self reflection   draw for the next hour and a half   leave for work at 420 am during commute ill read my textbooks because the bus gets bumpy and its fucking impossible to draw lmao   work for 68 hours sometimes more depending on if i have no choice but to stay ot   get home by 12 pm i make sure to walk half way when taking the trip back home so i can get some fresh air and sun   have dinner by 5 pm   draw/study till 845 pm and prepare for bed at 9 pm    rinse and repeat the good thing is i almost never have to worry about socializing and can just focus on what matters to me    weekends is the same but in this case ill do whatever chores i need to do and meal prep on sunday but i have the rest of the day to go outside and draw from life and draw pretty much the whole weekend    sometimes ill take a break one day and just do whatever so i dont go insane breathers are important even if i want to minmax as much as possible but its better to avoid the burnout since that will take you out of the game for weeks and hurt you more in the long run
dont fall for the cutting your hours of sleep meme go to bed early yeah but dont shorten your sleep
  those who say cut sleep and work after a fulltime job are neets shitposting porn all the time without even a parttime job
  when i eat i get this period where i cant do anything productive with any effort because im full but i dont know if sleeping straight after youve eaten it too healthy sounds like a way to get fat
  wakes up at 730 breakfast shower dress up leaves the house at 815    by the time ive got up put clothes on brushed teeth switched computer on got downstairs and made a cup of tea thats another 20/25 minutes  and i like at least some time to eat my fucking breakfast whilst reading the news headlines and checking /ic/ for new posts 10/20 minutes    takes me at least 20/25 minutes to have a shower    than last 10 minutes switching clothes and making sure i got everything i need    theres no way that can be fit into 45 minutes    you go to the gym after work when you havent eaten anything and your feet are aching after a hard days work    you cook and eat in 30 minutes does that include washing up and putting away   wtf do you cook in that time  most things take at least 25 minutes to cook
  by the time ive got up put clothes on brushed teeth switched computer on got downstairs and made a cup of tea thats another 20/25 minutes  and i like at least some time to eat my fucking breakfast whilst reading the news headlines and checking /ic/ for new posts 10/20 minutes  dont switch the computer on dont switch the tv on dont switch the radio on just check my phone for mails and texts  showering is 15 minutes and im taking my sweet time  eating is 5 minutes if you dont think about what youre gonna eat and the coffee can heat while you shower  dressing up is litteraly the time it takes to open the closet grab clothes and put them on  45 minutes in the morning to get prepared is slow for me i could get ready in 15 if i take a shorter shower and skip breakfast    you go to the gym after work when you havent eaten anything and your feet are aching after a hard days work    i go to the gym after work because has i stated i do it work meaning i spend my day seated and theres plenty of workout machines that doesnt require you to stand    you cook and eat in 30 minutes does that include washing up and putting away   cooking 15 minutes eating 10 minutes put dishes in the dishwashers 5 minutes and once again its slow i can microwave something and eat it in under 5 minutes if im in a hurry    nothing you said invalided my schedule it just made it obvious that you waste time where my routine doesnt i put all distractions away in the morning until my first break at work for instance makes discussion topics to speak of with colleagues i basicaly dont watch tv anymore except news that i listen in background when i draw only reading articles during the weekend
if you do vidya or tv shows just drop that shit asap i only do art and books for hobbies and i have plenty of time for both vidyas in particular are a huge rabbit hole of wasted time
  well it seems you rush and you eat like shit   such is the life of a wageslave
  it was over the day you were born
i just wish theyd never replied at all
  takes less than 10 mins to take a shower u fucking jerking off or something jesus    food is easy for me since i wake up very early and takes less than 10 mins to have breakfast and eating it takes around 7 mins i also prep my meals on sundays so i just reheat my brown rice  chicken with greens    i even have time to rip a fat one before work too lol    waking up early and not playing vidya  keeping it very exclusive like on a weekend for an hour as a reward gives you alot of freetime
  oof
  post your work
  ouch  sorry about that anon
  he thinks hes gonna make it pursing art barely even part time  there are people put 8 hours a day into art meanwhile you at best might put in 4 hours on a weekend into some barely acceptable anime studies how do you expect to make it maybe in 10 years if you made it a job to do art 8 hours a day youll have progressed more in a month than your current pace in a year
    hey shitfuck we looked at your work and it blows frankly you lack talent and you dont seem like you have a creative bone in your body that you even have the audacity to waste our time just shows us how damn unprofessional you are you piece of shit not only is your art ass you seem to lack any sort of experience  literally any experience at all  still nursing mommys udders as a rotten cherry on top of your shit sundae of a resume you live in some remote jerkoff place weve never even heard of go fuck yourself and never contact us or anyone else again    with warm regards  company
  i just wish theyd never replied at all  that is even worse   the reply is very polite
  kek
  after an embarrassment like this id better not    im trying to make a living out of illustration and heres my stats this month  32 inquiries sent by me to agencies and companies  7 replies asking about my rates luv your portfolio got no project for now but will add you to the database blah blah blah  1 trial project which i must have failed because they never gave me any feedback on the upside it was paid  1 downright rejection why would they even send this back at me wtf thanks for ruining my day    and yes sure im really trying to improve every day doing personal work tweaking those thumbnails on portfolio website gaining exposure from doing charity work reaching out to people on instagram finding more agencies to email setting up accounts on those dumbass online communities for freelancers sending out freaking postcards to previous clients to remind them im still alive well im not saying anyone owes me a project for doing all that all im saying is its getting very hard for me to go on
  you sound like youre on a good track anon i wouldnt be too down about 1 or 2 rejections its best to get any feedback from companies by putting yourself out there because then youll know what to improve and even better theyll have your name in their systems
  thank you anon im trying my best here
  just out of curiosity who are you sending portfolios to can you give some examples ive been thinking of doing the same just keep studying anon youll get there you got more balls than most here
  anon dont look at these rejections like theyre failures companies understand that artists will always continue to grow so having your name on files is 100x better than not and just realize this is a temporary thing if you continue working the same as you have youll have people lining up for your work
    play the long game anon be smart if you need to take a regular job job to pay the bills if you arent already work on your art a little every day remember that quantiy beats quality i have no idea at what level you are but regardless you will be way ahead of were you are now in a year from now if you just keep up daily studying look at some sketchbook of famous digital painters assuming thats what you do for inspiration spoiler they were all ass from the start if you have passed the ass level already then even better push through
  have full time job   about to go home a draw for 34 hours
  anon i get home at like 6am and sleep till 11am its easier to do when you are sleeping in direct sunlight but still you can work on 5 hours of sleep
  i mostly design vector characters and backgrounds for animated advertising videos so i send my portfolio to companies that do just that i also have one big project in brand illustration which i consider quite nice so i apply to illustration studios as well    and its really not that i havent got experience like that stupid agency above implied just checked the analytics and they clearly didnt even visit my portfolio ive been working in this very field for 1 and a half years and making decent money i dont know whats going on but it seems like no one needs me anymore      okay thank you for that im not giving up yet i have time and savings i hope something comes up soon ill keep working to make it happen      thanks i dont do digital painting and its really hard to come across bad projects from people who excel in the commercial illustration industry they remove them from their portfolio obviously one reason why i like the community of /ic/ is because people are not afraid to post something theyre not proud of or to write about their failures and frustrations you dont see any of that on behance social media gives you the idea that people do nothing but succeed in their career make beautiful work all the time and always get the best clients when obviously thats not the case
  i feel like theres a ceiling for each individual of how good they can get in their lifetime   and i also feel like i hit it 5 years ago as improvement has stopped   and it is nowhere near where i want to be
  can you post some art
  i feel the same i mean im not awful but i feel i will never a top artist even if i keep trying
      i really hope these arent just random shitposters i need something to laugh about      you and op wake up early and draw before going to work  8 hours sleep  810 hours work  8 or 6 hours for commuting drawing prepping or jerking off    oh and ps    when i eat i get this period where i cant do anything productive with any effort because im full but i dont know if sleeping straight after youve eaten it too healthy sounds like a way to get fat  1and whys that  2 eat light fatass also youre shitposting in an infinitely large library do you think or do you know eating before bed will make you fat
this is p frustrating im still a neet so theres a chance for me wish me luck bros
  you better save up lot of money for that one middle life crisis to improve your gain massively  til then keep working
  wanting to be alive in your forties or even thirties  naah not waiting decades to draw stupid pictures either commit now or just drop it entirely
  this sounds very nice good on you anon
    also me i hope you do well on your comic too
  it wont be hard if you are actually into drawing there are people that didnt put it ahead of anything else when they were a child i was one but the thing about the people that actually have them as jobs is that they have income and no worries about not drawing being a wage slave you have to worry about something you love and something that is providing you too that is also not making you happy ontop of that we dont know how much actual art gains those people have vs just random drawings they do so how are they really getting better
hey there  i just finished those 4 sketches today and i wanted some cc from you guys
better quality
  idk but i know one thing this aint worth a thread
oh okay i thought it has some purpose to post every pictures individually but it seems that the original pic with all the sketches is way better so no need for the rest    but heres a before/after between 2015 and 2018 i remember that i posted that actual drawing here if i recall
  is there a thread where we can post our drawings then  or i missed something 
  youre so close to being good and idk whats holding you back but youre def missing something that comes with fundies
  nsfw thread deals exactly with this
this is degeneracy
  your work has personality which honestly doesnt mean shit when your fundamentals are this trash git gud its a long road ahead
fundamentals  at this point that word is a meme for when you dont know how to actually critique shit
  it does feel like it thanks  i know my fundamentals are not perfect but honestly the fundamentals are the last things ill master in my life those are the hardest    id prefer more precises criticism because i feel like we can tell about any drawing do better fundies    but still thanks for pointing it out tho  i still plan to work on that
  is that mayo coming out of her ass
  i think these basically stand on their own as they are  and a good focus right now would be to work on composition placing each of these sketches on their own canvas and working them/using background elements so that youre making a scene and not an isolated sketch context will give your work more impact  i think what the anon meant about fundies was that your drawing lacks a certain line fluidity and little hints in the lineart that would give it more solid form but that will come to you gradually over time
  yes      thanks  ill take care of that in the futur
there have been a lot of good black friday deals what have you bought    i just got pic related its on sale for 17 and its usually 30 i have a few 600s but the rapid pro is weighted a little differently and with the lead extended the knurled grip section sits a little more than half an inch higher than the 600 the body is a rounded hexagon and the pencil rolls free which is also different than the 600 but given i often hold the pencil by the middle its more comfortable to hold its 255g 5g more than the 600 but it feels about the same because its a little longer the mechanism is clicktoadvance and it works just fine the lead cushioning only compresses when you apply a fair amount of pressure downwards its not held absolutely rock solid like a normal clutch mechanism but it takes enough force to get it to wiggle that i dont notice at all when im using it    apparently it doesnt fit a staedtler rotary lead pointer so i got a nice little uni lead pointer  its not as fast as a rotary pointer and if youre rough youll chip the cone of graphite but if youre gentle it works great it doesnt seem to leak graphite powder either    i also got a 2018 ipad and apple pencil for 350 i couldnt be more happy with it except if maybe the ipad had a microsd card slot so i dont have to use an adapter
  previous thread    a link to pull up previous threads  
just some paper i like drawing on actual drawing paper as opposed to the printer paper i used to draw on helps me focus and be more motivated as to not waster the paper
finally have enough money to buy this
i didnt get much on black friday i really wanted to get some art stuff but it wasnt much i wanted im a minimalist 
  i want the 102 acryla gouache but no way am i spending 33700 on it  i did find a small set of 12 on ebay i have coming   also want nicker poster color set but thats expensive too
tfw the only art supplies on sale were the garbage brands that are worthless and cheap anyways
  amazon sales in a nutshell
    a lot of pentel stuff was on sale yesterday pocket brush pens were 8 theres a tombow eraser on sale too
so i decided to get some more pencils and wanted to read up on some reviews  found this its pretty thorough        i decided to go for some tombows and staedtler mars lumographic blacks and a generals 9xxb and castell 9000s
just bought the whole set of 4 pentel graphgear 500 for 25 they were selling a whole box of sakura pigma micron with 49 pieces but i hardly doubt i would use all those so i didnt bought it
  did you like the lumographic black
  havent got them yet
my nibs came in the mail today 2packs of everything hunt 102 hunt 107 and tachikawa maru soft i like the hunt 102 the best closely followed by the maru the 107 was my least favorite and one of the nibs was actually bad doesnt split when pressure is applied its funny because 102s are known for having quality control but the 107 was the troublemaker in my case
trying some new grips for a change got any that youve liked i enjoy ripping the grip off the twist erase
i love pilots frixion needlepoint pen for mindless sketching or storyboarding wish they had a stylus on one end
  what brand are those grips and how do you like them im looking for something to put on my pen holder
  dolphin grips are nice cause you can twizzle them around quickly or grap the fin and veer off at broad angles      trisided grips are great if you want a clutch pencil to feel like a standard wood case pencil      hoping the urls checkout
  i enjoy ripping the grip off the twist erase  if you put a strip of 1 inch masking tape on the barrel running lengthwise parallel to the barrel it just perfectly fits and makes the grip on that pencil fit flush on the barrel    i have metal knurling or plastic on all of my drawing tools i really dont find squishy rubber things very comfortable      im still loving this rapid pro enough that i bought another one to hold other lead grades right now im using staedtler hb and 2b lead but im going to try buying some cheap chinese 2b and 4b lead in bulk within the next week an anon posted a thread with a guide to buying 2mm leads cheaply through proxy buying surfaces about a year or two ago that i have saved some idiot mod deleted it even though it didnt violate any rules i already have some cheap 4b chinese lead that actually isnt that bad there are hardly any binders in the graphite so its extremely dark and smudges very easily it doesnt hold a point at all but the lines it makes are very dark and its quick to sharpen in a rotary lead pointer      i used to use pilot v5s as my default sketching pens but ive since switched to pilot razor point iis not having to get a ball spinning to put down ink makes the start and end of the lines a little smoother and the pen draws with less pressure
  yup both the url and your digits check out thanks anon
  i have a rapid pro but cant find a good parkerstyle refill i like to draw with i like the way the sakura pigma micron ink feels to draw with is there a refill that would fit the rapid pro with a similar feel
  ive never really like parker refills or any of the more expensive brands ive tried the pens often write smoother but they put out too much ink and form globs too quickly    i didnt get the ballpoint pen version though im currently very happy with zebra f refills as their ink flow is just right for me the red f refill is easy to edit out of drawings and a red and black zebra f701 are just about the only ballpoints i use anymore except for bic cristal pens those things are a nearly perfect replacement for pencil in travel sketchbooks that youre never going to spray with fixative    if youre looking for something like a micron there are lots of cheaper fineliner type pens that have the same type of nib but with water based ink staedtler triplus ones are easy to find very smooth and you can leave them uncapped for a long time
heres my black friday deal
  wow whata deal
  thank you for your expertise
copic multiliner sp or lamy safari m with waterproof ink    this will be for my 300 gsm 140lb watercolor paper
is the rotring 800 or 600 worth getting
  what is this
  yes get them you wont likely regret it
  lamy you sure about that nib size though
  it appears to be a microsoft surface pro and a stylus with which to draw upon it
  well the watercolor paper i use is pretty rough and textured i figured a wetter nib will give me more solid lines am i far off thinking that
  this will be for my 300 gsm 140lb watercolor paper  im using the blue xl sketchbook is the purple one that much better
  got a link i dont know which one youre talking about
  try the 600 if you like the weight then you are good if you need more go for the 800
  its a surface pro 6 8th gen i5 processor in tablet form factor
  i was thinking more of the damage to the nib rough watercolor paper isnt the kindest to fountain pen nibs
  rough texture wc paper will destroy your nib jesus hrist
  fibertipped pens are disposable and the more textured and rough the paper the shorter they will last and one of the worst offenders is watercolor paper depending on how heavy you use it and the size of the nib 003mm will die in hours on ordinary copy paper 08mm will last much longer and youll probably go through ink refills faster than nibs the sp nib is probably going to be dead in a few days max a steel tipped fountain pen has a lifespan of a few years of heavy writing on normal paper unlike more expensive fountain pens which have a tipping material made out of a super hard metal alloy      i have a few different safaris ranging from extra fine to bold and theyre good pens ive had a few problems with quality control issues and getting bad nibs but the vendors have always replaced bad ones at no cost watercolor paper will wear the nib faster than something like marker paper but its even if it dies in a year which would be a really early death for a fp nib you can buy replacement nibs for less than a new pen    id recommend platinum carbon black ink by the way and if youre looking for a decent pen with a slightly broader nib jinhaso x750s are less than 3 each on ebay with free shipping i had one defective cap in the 4 that i bought but theyre nice broad nibs that lay down a really bold juicy line the line they make is about the same as my broad twsbi eco actually i personally prefer to refill cartridges with a syringe but a lot of people prefer converters and the safari doesnt come with out      ive heard a lot of complaints about the looseness of the 800s mechanisms but ive never used one 600s are nice but heavy you can tell that by looking at it obviously but at least for me it gets fatiguing    fuck im autistic about this stuff
  this looks like the perfect place for asking  would you guys please recommend me a good sketchbook to use with markers  recently i began to practice with copic markers and its relly rough with most of the sketchbooks i have save for a moleskine and some canson somebody gave me  thanks in advance
man someone like 2 months ago recommended me a pentel fude brush pen took 6 weeks to get here for some reason but i am fucking in love with this thing god damn been having a blast doodling lately
  i got a medium and its great for filling in bg but too broad for character outlines
  i can see that its pretty easy to vary stroke size though
got the namiki falcon and leather notebook recently the noodlers ahab is shit i hate having to fuck with it just lost my mind and splurged on the namiki     im poor now and wont have food for the next two weeks but god damn sketching with this pen makes me shed tears of happiness
what should i ask for for christmas anons i have lots of sketchbooks im thinking something pen and ink related
  get yourself a dip pen holder a variety of nibs and some nice ink i personally really like my tachikawa holder and deleter 4 ink     if you like markers you can try out copic or wn brushmarkers copics are hiking in price in january by a dollar so if i were you id buy some while theyre still under 5 dollars a piece deleter neopiko markers are also pretty easy to get now
post artists with cute styles anime or not anime doesnt matter    i like nurzhan bekkaliyev
  amputated feet
  theyre just really little
  wish i knew how to do ambient occlusion like him
  isnt it a simple concept in theory  im a painting /beg/ tier fuck but i always try to keep in mind where the ao will be   thanks for posting this artist i love their work big eyes are my guilty art pleasure
    simple but not easy
  amiami is probably one of my favorite artist ever
  ambient occlusion  this    what even
  cute  remember when this buzzword didnt just mean overly sexual and erotic  i sure do remember
  stfu grandpa
  i meant in regards to bekkaliyev    i can understand why it comes about but its pretty difficult to use it in such a convincing way sometimes i just have no idea whether to add it in at certain crevices or not
  dumb boomer when are you going to have your weekly heart attack
  stfu toddler
  oh yeah i totally remember that my 8 year old self said the same to pic related when i was playing street fighter 2
  ao doesnt even real wtf are you talking about
  doesnt even real    what are you even trying to say
  i love the way the legs and feet are drawn
  those legs are legit terrifying
  soooooooooo kawaii uwu
    i hate looking at his stuff sure the forms are interesting but the tiny feet and soulless expressions that illicits a fear response from me
daisuke richards drawings have a cute atmosphere
  i love the lighting but the grotesque proportions freak me out
  yes officer this post
  i like pastelly colors but this hurts my eyes
    why does hi rendering/volume look so good  pls explain to a /beg/
  cant find this guy with reverse image search does he have a insta tumblr twitter
  romancing saga  on gba  huh unless thats a wonderswan
  amiamic
  thats a wonderswan you can see where the single aa battery compartment is   tguy that owns 2 wonderswans
  why does hi rendering/volume look so good    good values clear separation of light and shadow
  jelly desu
  wish i knew how to do ambient occlusion like him  just say shading or lighting  ambient occlusion is a computational technique to approximate global lighting and shading you cant do it while drawing
  i find this sonic covers pretty cute maybe for the color palette
  the way he does it is quite distinct from typical shading in the form of cast/form shadows were talking about ao as a synonym for occlusion shadows which i think is valid in spite of the wellknown 3d origin      its clear in the leftmost girls sleeves and skirt very dark spots within the shadow
  rightmost
    i like to think about ambient occlusion and occlusion as terms similar to celshading in that even tho you may not be actually using acrylic paints on actual cel sheets or rendering with 3d software the term has come to represent a common look or visual method that people now use that term as shorthand for
  cute legs but those must be some really flat asses
    this use your brain and dont sperg out about using words wrong it is useful to understand where the terminology originates though
  at least post a picture of the right game if youre gonna try to act superior
  ok then
  reminds me of old ff tactics art
  thanks for reminding me i love akihiko yoshidas art definitely belongs in this thread
  gonna spin my bird to that thanks
    kamitanis style i know that some people are put off by the weir proportions but for some reason it really appeals to me i would really want to see guide to his drawing process or something that emulates it
  i dont think its necessarily cute but it still looks really good
    i never get why people like those fucking ugly horrible shit designs and extremely fucked anatomy if they can make it anyone can make it without any skill
  vanillaware has some amazing artists you might not like the anatomy of dc but they also made other games where it was just fine not to mention they are not supposed to look 100 realistic   if you honestly think the vw art is easy to do then you are retarded
  fucked  its clearly stylized you /beg/ pleb kamitani is a nearly master level veteran disliking his art or being offended by it only says more about you than it does about him
  oh
  lmao  this retard
  ha ha
what drugs do you take to help clear your mind for a night of heavy drawing
drugs  clear mind
  drawing is literally my drug you cant get that type of stimulation anywhere else
i cant name a painter of merit that was a committed addict
  who said you have to be addicted
  if you have to take drugs to clear your mind for a drawing youre addicted
  it was my own musing
when i was taking ec stack to try and lose weight i went on a studying binge and didnt sleep for four days i made a ton of progress but i felt like shit
  just starve yourself and reward yourself with food after drawing
if i take drugs i lose the desire to draw
coffee
  lol    who needs drugs  drawing is my drug  blah blah addiction          nope coffee
there are so many ngmis on this thread that are so escared of drugs
this is now a coffee thread
cacao powder is a brain food   i do it everyday for work
drugs are for fucking stoners  what i mean is that i refuse to touch any since my family has a history of mental illness and substance abuse and im not that stupid
  you are the biggest nonentity to ever shitpost on this board all you got from this thread was fucking coffee and youre still trying to angle it like people use drugs aka stimulants aka literally anything in combination with art face the fact that most artists dont use drugs because they dont need them you need them because you are not a fucking artist stop taking drugs and the fake druginduced inspiration wears off and there will be nothing left than your pathological need for attention
  this reminds me of someone that is an unemployed daily weed smoker drinker tool fan and macrodoser of lsd and other substances pointed out to me a mere sober citizen that indeed my internet use was well within the definition of addiction and now this coffee thing my life is literally falling apart
  water hydration is key
tkmiz and hornyposter are pretty deistressful
coffee and oreos and milk and cold water
  i go talk to my councilor and theorist once a week i always paint better with a clear conscience
    this is pretty solid bait to be honest    put sage in the options field
drpepper  pot when painting sketching  sculpting just drpepper when wood carving
tea once in awhile i might have a beer when im drawing in the summer used to smoke cigarettes when i took a break but quit years ago     i smoke weed occasionally but never when im working
  coffee or sometimes weed but only if i have colouring/rendering to do the next day and no heavy line art
drugs are for recreation not for work   if you dont know the clear distinction between those 2 youll have a much higher chance of being a failure   yes theyre people who do drugs and end up successful but not a single one of them use drugs while working exception being cocaine and adderall but both can backfire depending on the person
  nootropics especially phenotropil   the others arre also somewhat helphul but phenotropil specifically gives you a very notable clarity of mind     also amphetamin in moderation
i stopped smoking weed solely because it was fucking with my art which is a shame because i loved being stoned but i just could not stand how markedly shitty at drawing i became even if i smoked weed 3 or 4 hours before trying to draw it really messes with my eyesight i used to smoke all day every day and then drink all night every night acid and mushrooms on the weekends ecstasy here and there coke semi regularly among other drugs now all i do is draw
  how are you not dead
lol is doing drugs meant to be cool or something
  water and iboga
cocaine for motivation cigarettes for short breaks here and there to ease wrist pain
  i used to eat a lot of acid because i thought it enhanced my creativity in the long run as early as like a year or so actually i found that it actually ended up making me less creative somehow there are better ways than drugs to tap the right focus to do art
coffee mainly tried beer a few times but it just made me more distracted sleepy and horny whats been a real good deal has been the cannabis butter some family friends gave us dont know any of the mechanics but a pot brownie periodically helps my focus
  plenty of water and a good nights sleep
its just a quick sketch so could you do it for less than 100    it looks great one small change thoughinsert a paragraph of revisions that basically amounts to redo fucking everything    i want these 10 characters to be visible in the cover as well as this city on the background    can you make my oc spoiler generic degenerate shit
  maybe if you drew to spec in the first place
   you make my oc spoiler generic degenerate shit  this one is fine  s just a quick sketch so could you do it for less than 100  this one depends on what you price at already and how quick of a sketch it is
gotta love clients who think a quick drawing job means they should pay less
  whiplash portrait studies  i had the same idea i even chose that exact facial expression from that scene funny coincidence
  based
  ill be that client for once    commission something from an artist i like  he isnt amazing just decent  he shows me the sketch looks average much lower quality than his usual stuff  ask for correction point out the failed things  shows revision barely any changes  fine fuck let me redline it  show him the redline  he asks for the full price anyway  give me a discount i did a good 1/4th of the work there fixing your sketch im not paying full price  then you can fuck off  who was in the wrong there
    clients who tell you how to do your job are the most obnoxious fine fuck off and do it yourself then
  so did he refuse to take your money    imagine if word spreads that you can get discount from artists by redlining  he was in the right
  so did he refuse to take your money  id have gladly paid him the money i like his style  but i refused to pay full price since i worked on it myself  besides it was a commission for a sketch which he prices at like 10 i just wanted 2 off im not that jewish to care about two miserable dollars but it was a matter of principle  though i guess you make a point but its often people who cant draw them who commission others and they are not capable of it
    are you 14
  anyone who buys or sells 10 commissions is always in the wrong in any situation
  10 bucks comm
      how dare you not spend 200 on a drawing lmao  no you fags i am not 14 it wasnt a recolor an adoptable or a ych on da or any of those shitty things   his sketches are just priced low because theyre sketches and like i said his art isnt the greatest either
  amateur artists on ic tend to think their art is worth an insane amount of money shitty little sketch no color one layer rough draft only yeah thatll be 150
   im not that jewish to care about two miserable dollars but it was a matter of principle     hands
  why would you commission someone you dont think is very good play stupid games win stupid prizes
  im not that jewsih  immediately pennypinches
  fucking kek yea that whole sentence was the most jewish thing said on this board
  his art is a 6/10 usually but its not about it i just like his style a lot but the sketch was a 34/10 much lower quality than usual
  i want a discount on a 10 dollar commission   im not a jew  huh
  muh principle  literal kike detected
 this account is inactive  the deviantart home page may help you find what you need  is there anything more sadder than this
will creating and following a schedule help me in any way ive been thinking of making one but i dont know how to organize it or how many hours to dedicate to each thing and im not even sure it would be any help at all maybe following someone elses schedule would help i dont know  please respond ive had glacial progress in 3 years and i dont know what to do to stop being shit
what are you doing to improve
this is one of the few remaining positives about art school it forces you to be on a schedule and to have structure
jesus fucking christ are you an idiot its not that hard just set a number of hours to draw if its too hard draw less and if its too easy draw more    do i need to tell you when to go to the toilet
  copy pose from croquis cafe  try to work gesture anatomy shading perspective  look up muscle/bone diagram when i feel lost  copy another pose and do the same  do a head and try to work the same things  try to do a pose from imagination and fail  do hands  watch 30 minute tutorials on youtube  try to figure out how to work digitally  do drawabox excercises  try to draw porn and fail or do a bad drawing  iim learning    i shit out like 5 drawings in what feels like 3 hours ive hit a plateau i cant escape from i dont know how to study  tfw someone posts a study that looks like a fully rendered picture while my studies are fucking ugly scribbles  i just dont know
  draw something it looks like shit  wonder what i did wrong everything feels wrong  guess ill just grind spheres for an hour  draw something again and it still looks like shit  grind how to draw hands  but first perspective because my hands look like shit  waste time reading or watching tutorials  2 hours for 2 shit drawings  mommy i feel lost please change my diaper
  any time you ask for help with progress they should post work so we can gauge your improvement your improvement rate might or might not be glacial since your own perception of yourelf is often skewed  also     but to answer your question making a schedule could indeed help if you actually follow it i personally cant do schedules i end up resting and sleeping when i feel like it    what works for me is a sort of todo list for every day for example 20 one minute gestures and 2 ten minute ones read 10 pages of vilppu and watch 30 minutes of a video series on head construction draw to apply new knowledge after reading and watching things  you also need to have an overarching plan maybe this week youre focusing on noses so add 6 nose studies per day dont have to be that detailed next month you might want to learn color theory  you could have one or two days per week where you focus on master studies and neglect your normal schedule except for maybe warmup  good luck anon
  grind spheres  like with shading
  yeah
  kek for some reason my retarded brain went to think wow this guy just draws circles all day  probable because i need to get out of my comfort zone and do some rendering
  as long as i work with my plan no matter how arbitrary it is its still good right say this week i notice that my eye placement is shit so i can work on that for a week then move on to another problem i have and work on it for a week  am i retarded for interpreting your post like this or for not thinking of this until now
is there an exact clear cut process to rendering in digital programs like krita  is there a go to loomis type of instructional thing involving rendering that can apply to any form of rendering i wanna git gud quick
  the render/digital painting resources are huge  check the gfxdomain tutorial or render books to find out but first learn how the digital program work
  no rules just tools as long as the end result is liked you are good
  anatomy is really fucked up on that pic anon
  it is not the anatomy is mostly fine the big problem is the perspective how her foot is not on the ground but floating in front of it
  the anatomy is mostly fine the big problem is the perspective  the beginner mind is a wonderful think because it gives us quotes like this
  then redline it fucker to prove how the anatomy is fucked up oh but of course you woont do that
  op here i just pulled out a pic from my fap gallery to draw some attention to my question not all of the pics are quality lol im a shitty dirtbag lmao
  what are you talking about do i really need to red line this
  sometimes i wish i could be as blind as most of you fuckers here are   or in your case blind ignorant fallacious shitty at art etc etc etc
  there are a lot of problem with this pose but isnt really that bad    i tried to fix it on my phone
inb4 u guys r just nitpicking lol its fine and better than you could do
you guys are just nitpicking lol its fine and better than you could do
  op i highly recommend scott robertsons how to render even if you havent read his how to draw book which is the first in the series it is an exceptionally good book for generalized rendering techniques i used to use krita and have since moved to photoshop but i found what he taught in that book could be easily applied both digitally in any program and traditionally with most media its a huge read but well worth the workthrough
for me much of the difficulty in rendering was not the rendering itself but 1 not understanding what the bazillion buttons and dials do and im talking about in a simpler program like sai and 2 not understanding form light and value very well so learn your program first which is part trial and error part research a lot of it works similarly across programs then draw and observe a lot try to mentally separate the forms in a photo and figure out where the light is coming from understand what cast shadows and bounced light etc are so you dont get overwhelmed then think how to abstractly represent different lighting scenarios    also marco bucci he makes all this clear in a way thats unmatched in my experience its epiphany after epiphany watching his videos
  feet not on ground
  i dont have that ironically ihave scott robertsons how to draw    whats a good way to practice right here right now
  go to the bloody sticky and download the fucking book
  it got taken down m8
  go to the bloody artbook thread and look the links or fucking ask politely for one
  get your fucking loomis books here    successful drawing is the one you want to read
  this is laughably bad  especially what you did with the left hand you honestly have no idea what a resting hand on a leg looks like and assume the drawing implies something you made up  you dont know shit and are talking out your ass
  joke    your head      are you new to this board perchance
  if youre trying to prove a point then making a mockery of the wrong critique doesnt help your case
    ahh youre just an idiot then  carry on
  are you serious
  yeah no tool is gonna help you if you dont know what youre doing you just outed yourself as another beg
  that fucking duck face is pissing me off
i cant tell whos baiting who   
the top two are obviously symbol drawing what im asking is if you draw symbols even with guidelines through forms does that count as doing the bad thing about symbol drawing
  thats not what symbol drawing is
  then what is if not drawing just whats on the surface
there is no such thing as symbol drawing its a meme dont even worry about it
you need to learn what the fuck the terms youre saying mean before you can talk about them
is symbol drawing just drawing what you know instead of drawing what you see
all drawing is symbol drawing
  bingo
problem with drawing with your eyes not your brain    if you just look at shapes all you will know is how to draw the same image not how to draw anything new    but apparently thats how youre supposed to do it according to 4chan /ic/ bible drawing on the right side of the brain but that teaches exactly that drawing based on shape not what you remember    so yay now you can solve any art probelm but wait you now have to draw something impossible without any reference but whats in your head but you cant draw anything other than what you see with your eyes but drawing with your mind is bad    can you see where im going with this
  drawing with your eyes doesnt make any sense your brain is the one doing all the processing learn how to draw with your brain idiots
    no
  then what is it
  most traditional classic painters only paint this way nothing wrong with that if you just want top notch portraits    hf with ur boxes its always a combination
      oh man i cant agree more you use your eyes to accurately place the instrument upon and across your medium where you want and nothing more you envision what the line or mark will look like and you look at that area while you envision it from your mind this is how you double check and then you look at your god damn tool while you use it    reference drawing is somewhere in between tracing and art    pic related      its the habit of drawing simple heiroglyps you mastered when you were 5 instead of actually taking your time to manifest an illusion of how things actually look
  thanks a ton    may i ask related since it goes with drawing shape how silhouettes and negative space work when drawing from imagination not for being clear in composition/staging but for getting the correct shape on a rotated form that wouldnt have the same exact silhouette anyways is it just for checking copies
  i dont believe i quite understand what youre asking anon i myself am by no means a master of any art yet    are you talking about light theory and how to cast shadows over shapes here are a few pages about that from that book you can find these tutorials online for free at wwwtheetheringtonbrothersblogspotcom  here is negative space next post will be shadows
  shadows
  the compare positive and negative shapes section over here        the artist here brings it up in a number of studying areas  
  i believe what youre asking is more along the more intermediate theorys of casting illusion after rereading your question in answer im not anything special at it for the most part i assume that since i made the attempt and you can see the shadows are consistent its good enough for the audience only experienced artists will be dismissive with imperfections in shadows   whats most important is that theyre all cast in canon with the light source but honestly if this is what your asking this is a form i myself am barely dipping my toes into  pic is da vinci
  oh yeah i dont understand any of those forms i build with geometric shapes and contour lines then define details and draw the illusion over and erase all of my building shapes and contours    refrencing while im working isnt something i do much of i only try to reference if i absolutely cant produce an illusion with my own understanding of shapes and contour    honestly links and reference drawing is a dead end road as far as developing creative problem solving     i dont think about negative space i think more about what perspective can i fit the characters into the page while still leaving enough room for a few plants or a couch or whatever scene stuff to keep the audience in the scene then i just try not to overcrowd it overcrowding is a form in itself though sometimes and it isnt always bad    its kinda like tetris     but anymore i almost always have big blank spaces of a varied assortment of crosshatching filling almost everything i dont like to draw balanced compositions very much myself not right now at least
  literally no one has ever said referencing will help you with creative problems like composition or design id really love to see your work after typing all this strawman nonsense
    it does makes sense if youre not a pedantic autistic asshole everyone knows what you mean and you dont come across as clever for having reached the insight that information is indeed processed in the brain
  thats not symbol drawing its stylization/cartooning    symbol drawing is only referring to a beginners mistake when theyre not yet able to draw what they see so for instance if theyre attempting to drawn an eye they will draw a simple almond shape line with a dot at the center theyre drawing what they think an eye looks like instead of how it actually appears with light and shadow hence symbolically drawing rather than realistically    with stylization you are choosing to make an impression of something rather than representing it realistically for the sake of design so in the case of the simpsons a flat cartoon drawing suffices for a character instead of a more natural drawing of a man this is done for many reasons one is to convey a comedic caricature and the other is to have simplified forms to animate    the difference is that the former is a lack of ability to observe and draw what is seen and the latter is a chosen form of expression by an artist who is usually already familiarized with observation and realism
  im not being clever youre just being too stupid and ignoring the obvious
  oops
  here another
  last one spidey swinging past limp dicks and shitty tits like you   your turn bud
      this is the art of a guy larping as an authority on learning how to draw  hahahahahahahahahaha
  been drawing my whole life dickhead did you go to school or something wheres your single session traditional work  show it already anon  i dont want to see your 25 hour digital mock up wheres the work where your hand places pigment upon medium from memory
  unlike you i spend time drawing from life and building my visual library so my imaginative figures wont look like the dogshit you just posted sorry but if you honestly think what you posted is good christ either the people around you are lying to you or youre lying to yourself
          digital or analog made with an algorithm or your hands  its still shit and what youre saying is just embarrassing
  different anon but so have i and i never went to school but honestly a 12 year old could do better
  ohhhh well the strawman caller strawmans aswell ill bite  wether you think you do things i dont or not we both study form and composition i referenced lorenzo and da vinci then explained how i like to express myself with creating illusion never did i make any authoritative claims on anything in fact i was quite clear that im studying these concepts still myself   if you dont understand my sloppy way of having fun with line volume thats fine  but to ask for me to share my work and then dismiss it as dog shit is a clear reflection of some sort of napoleon complex you have with between you and your own lack of skills  i get it i bash reference and thats all you know sorry i made a stab at the only tool in your box   you dont know my studys before my turn to more abstract focus on chiaroscuro in line volume to create illusion   what im doing and the way im doing it is new atleast to me it is ill admit it isnt perfected yet but youre a soggy tit for the things youve typed here karma of the artistic and social form is the most ruthless and it will be served back to you im sure  all you can do is ask for work trash it then talk up your own work without showing anything you my hopeful peer are not only the larp you accuse me of being but also an artlessdodger
    more artless dodging
  defensive name calling stretched into a whole paragraph    you suck dude stop typing and go study the basics
  your basic moms already here explaining it all to me where is your art dodger
  ur mom  lol are you retarded or something
               come on you artless dodgers you showless critics  im willing to bet not a single one of you has anything besides a 25 hour digital mock up of a single character
  never looked into it are you whats it like
  lol whats the point of calling people out like this like what are you going to do once someome posts something way better than your trash make more excuses try to rationalize that its not real art shut the fuck up and sit down  stop embarrassing yourself
  if its good ill say its good and ask who your influences are if im interested in learning what youve learned then you can pay yourself on the back for proving your not an artless dodger
  lol so youll back down into your place like the beta bitch you are lmao  who would ever care about proving themselves to a retard like you
  you guys on discord together arguing over whose got the best piece to show or what
  yeah cutsie word start showing less typing    there really isnt a worse insult then artless dodger
  lol good luck bud
  yeah yeah   let this be a lesson to anyone whose a wallflower in the world of art the second you put yourself out there the artless dodger has already won  even if your selling your art they now have your art and you have nothing but money  today they got my work for free
  lmao nobody has ever paid for your art
  yeah huh first one was my grandma my aunt just traded me a couch for a bob ross painting
  lol
  made 18 on the twitch stream for the bob ross too this isnt the one i traded a episode or two ahead it was a bit better
is this thread just longform shitposting at this point or what  say yes so i can cringe a little bit less please
  just stop im dying
  kinda but this shits all true i like laughing about the reality of it too
    check out my rabbit and the couch i got for the bob ross honestly she probably would have given it to me but she knows how good it makes me feel to move some of my art her new couch that replaced this one is rad
  the thing is hes the only one who is being an authority instead of just saying youre a wrong autistic retard who needs to reed bridgeman and leemis    the whole you need to draw with your eyes not with your brain pretty much stems from a good chunk of threads ive seen    also bob ross is kind of cheating at least for drawing exact things abstraction is kind of cheating it could be a tree but it could also be a long brown brick
    alright but the problem im seeing is once you start on something original you have to use what you think an eye looks like     even if using reference if the finished drawing is at an angle the reference is not you technically are using what you believe an eye to look like just helped a bit by the reference
  bob ross is the same as reference drawing but he uses all application techniques so its something i hope instills a foundation of the application of oil paints  people on twitch like bob ross painting and talking too along as your not some weird dick bob says some funny stuff man if you can paint halfway decent    thats the bummer about all these artless dodgers when i used to paint rolling stock my buddy told me ill teach you all the ways to paint how to maintain structure and pick out color schemes and youll be able to paint with the kings but only if youre respectful and cool but i cant teach you that
  jesus christ buddy you dont have anything to teach anyone
  thats why nobody buys your work
  i guess walking with your legs doesnt make fucking sense either since your brain is doing all the processing you fucking retard
any use of construction without a reference would be symbol drawing flat lighting in tv or cartoons makes everyone forget about bounce light light difusion secondary lighting sources etc if you even draw a man at the proportions we know hes still a symbol no ones 8 heads tall
  t headlet
  obviously a joke shitpost but man  imagine if somebody actually believed something this completely wrong
  no you draw certain symbols to summon a demon its all in th bible
  okey do this now anon look at this picture and draw the rabbit dont look at your paper just at the rabbit and raw it never ever look at the paper or your drawing during the process and when you are finished post it without cleaning it up
tfw too much of a brainlet to understand the painting theory going on in this thread   i just liek making pretty pictures
  ive done this 6 times now each picture turns out about the same resemblance but always contorted in unique ways not a single one is the same
    like i said theyre all wildly different
  literally me
  neither does the people itt its all shit and dont listen too it
  show us what isnt shit    talk is cheap on this thread artless dodger
  thats not true    its a meme the statement that its always bad  symbol drawing when done consciously is basically stylization    mignola is the best example of good symbol drawing
    it looks ok you need to slow down mate then you wil measure the distance better
    okay grossly intrigued and also having a lot of fun with this technique few questions    how long should i ideally be spending on each rabbit drawing not too long right i googled drawing when never looking at the paper and all that came back was some sort of brainhemisphere contour line study    i do notice when i think too much about the next line i kinda forget where i was i can feel the momentum of certainty fade as i focus on where my hand is placed upon what ive already drawnalso the core of my being is doing everything it can to not look upon my medium is this feeling the hemispheres of my brain arguing over control
  using a two value scheme isnt the same as symbol drawing at all you mongoloid
  your art sucks and its embarrassing that you think youre so good that you frame what is probably the worst art ive seen on here today i wonder what your refrigerator looks like
  how long  as long as you think you need to draw the whole rabbit but if you want to set a limit go with 5 minutes  brainhemisphere contour line study  yes this technic is for learning to draw what you see and not fall back into the i draw what i know or symboldrawing phase people tend to start drawing what they see but after a few seconds dont even look at the thing they draw and just start drawing what they think it should look like you force yourself to stop that and actually draw the rabbit and not some image a rabit should look like  i think too  the only thoughts you should have while drawing this is how can i draw this shape or wich angle next   is this feeling the hemispheres of my brain arguing over control  sort of yes you feel a need to look at the paper but never do that
  you force yourself to stop that and actually draw the rabbit  oh and linecontrol you start to control you prencil better get in sync with your eyes
        lol angry rabbit
  you idiot i frame it because its my art each piece i framed i reflected upon dearly the next day and saw new achievements i had not yet achieved before so it got a frame these works are framed for me and are hung throughout my gym with my bathroom that has a big walk in shower  i reflect every day upon the achievements of my past even on rest daysi love my walk in shower  its this mindset that allows me to look at myself in the mirror and understand the true pursuit of casting illusion upon paper  it is because i regard art in this fashion that i make sales with my toolbox and nearly any other of equal contingency while you could not  do you see how i can speak a little art you speak in nothing but farts have fun drawing insanely rendered anime boobasauri and being a belidgerent fedora tipping slob that you are wondering why the world cursed you          dang thats good this is definitely something im going to be doing from now on is this reference drawing
  you sound like a delusional narcissist your art in reality scribbles is bad and youre impressing no one
  besides those are just my plain frames heres a mosaic collab i did with someone i feel like they kinda rushed it but it still looks awesome
  id rather be a delusional narcissistic then some mean jerk with a chip off their shoulder anyway
  is this reference drawing  no referenced rawingis when you thinkab outa pos e you start drawing from imagination and when you hit a point where you feel lost you look up a single part of what you wanted to draw   for example killer rabbit with iron claw fist  first you start with the basics the posture and gesture of said rabbit then you start drawing what you know about anatomy and or what ever it shall look like start drawing the fists and so on do all this without looking at a photo or reference draw very very lightly then you look up on google images rabbitmetal  fist claw and so on and you build up your picture with what you see in the reference without copying it 11  reference drawing is not or shouldnt be about copying
  dude if you ever painted that ugly shit on a train you should kys now learn the fundamentals before setting yourself up for failure putting ugly art into the public eye attached to your name
  bump
  are you mentally challenged
tumblr  your post was flagged  your post was flagged  your post was flagged  im guessing people with 1k followers would be pretty pissed
  havent you heard tumblr is dead no more nsfw
ive been on tumblr for more then 5 years do you know how much content that is fucking bullshit no way i can go through all of it this algorithem suckes the most ridiculous shit is flagged what pic related i dont draw on my phone so i dont use instagram and twitter is boring shit
  ive got sfw content and a fuck ton got flagged their bots are retarded fuck that place
  this is fucking bullshit ive been building up a following for almost two years and now itll soon be gone its my faul i guess for just sticking to one sight i shouldve posted on other sites like most artists do
adapt or die
super ironic while most artist here stuggle with fundies to draw cute anime girls or struggled when they were /begs a shitty drawing of a frog is more popular than anything ever done in a place dedicated to art
  false equivalence
  anyone can make memes though years before i started drawing seriously i drew some that are still regularly posted on /pol/
  ill admit thats quite interesting in some way  i dont want to be known for shitty drawings though so i dont really care
  almost got me its all about meaning so memes arent art without meaning absolutely any visual representation could be considered art and at that point the word might as well not even exist     of course i cant get into definitions and i wont risk making an error while thinking them up
  holy shit you post on 4chan and dont even know what a meme is
i would be willing to pay for a tutorial or something that explained it    its amazing how she manages to have a skin so smooth in her paintings    i would love to learn unfortunately her patreon tutorials dont explain that much    does anybody know    pd 4chan banned her name for some reason but you know who    also i dont care if you hate her or think she ruins art or whatever thats not the topic nor the point
  its a soft opacity brush literally shows it on her vids she also smudges from time to time
  you mean soft edge not being a smartass genuinely curious
  a soft edge brush just has a soft edge you need one that is soft to the core the reason is when you use a soft edge opaquely it will be hard at its core while just a generally soft brush will be soft through out you also have to take note that the spacing also affects thissai is an exception you dont wana use a soft brush below 20 spacing since the the round brush will starts to behave like a soft edge brush
  thanks for that
  wow i feel so dumb thank you so much that explains why my soft edge brush was useless    thanks
  sakimichan    am i banned now
  looks like airbrushing good color choice and sticking close to reference desu
    look up pirated versions of her patreon reward packs you can find full resolution versions of her images in those i have found that most of the mystery goes away when you can see how something is painted at 100 the perceived tightness of a resized digital painting fools the brain
  no i mean that if you out sakimichan as a title it doesnt let you post it or it didnt let me do it it gave me an error mssage you can post with that topic or somthing      i will thanks
  did i actually just learn a brush technique on ic    fuark me thanks bud
  learned about the subtlety of spacing in an /ic/ thread  welp as a sai user i dont really get it i should probably start to get interested in the finer points of customizing brushes one of those days instead of only playing with the default ones
  op just look up her videos on youtbe she has tons of wip and process videos uploaded on that are now available for free
  while this bit is interesting i have a genuine question  how do you use this brush    i mean what kind of color do you use it with what kind of strokes on what kind of layers etc    because i often see people saying heres are my brush settings but rarely explain how to use them to me its like telling me here at some point leonardo used that brush now go paint me a mona lisa
  
  how about you go try shit out instead of insisting that there is only one way to achieve the results you want and that they are spoonfed to you i guarantee that your drawing ability and understanding of values is so poor that it doesnt matter what brush you use on what layer and after you see that you are shit even with these setting youll just go look for some other magic bean to compensate for your laziness
  you know anon you could try leading me to real larning ressources that would teach me all that if you actualy tried to understand the question you would maybe get that im trying to learn all those details not because i want a fast way to get result but because i dont actualy have a clue about what purpose they serve precisely  its exactly why i used the brush of leonardo example i dont want you to give me the brush i want you to teach me why i need it and how to use it      this looks helpful ill watch it when i get home thank you anon
hire me anon ill teach you
  this is the perfect example of painting in automatic mode
  looks really good  are those just the default brushes anon im still trying to find some that feel right
  kek but even asking for shekels over the brush is a bit much
  there is no magic brush its all default hard and soft round the trick is the technique
  d 4chan banned her name for some reason but you know who  they banned the word sakimichan
  really but didnt the guy earlier say its not the default soft because that one is only soft on the edges
  theres many ways to get similar results  which is why just telling which tool to use is not enough
        her
  shekels over the brush  its the technique you fool  how long how you been in the digital painting
  im not the guy who asked and of course it is also the technique but i doubt the technique works with a 100hardness flat brush   also i barely used digital so far because it seems way harder than traditional and i am pretty much lost
  im not sure because i havent tried it yet but couldnt a hard brush with pressurecontrolled opacity then resized down to smooth strokes be used to achieved similar results    thats the feel i got from   the video quickly shift from you should use the hard brush only to fuck explaining just look how awesome i am using only the hard brush
  yes really
  ok i will bite i am not the op but name your price
  depends if you want actual lessons or a video demonstration or what discord  hot buttered cooter7994 lol if youre really serious
  welp as a sai user i dont really get it  thats why i said sai is an exception you cant edit spacing on there because you dont need toall you really have to do is make it a soft brush through the hardness tab although i mostly use that soft brush to glaze with just use the watercolor brush to render soft edges and hard edges while also using the marker brush on new layers for harder edges and to glaze with
when sakimi paints with one brush  really makes you think
who is original creator of wojak
  you can literally just google that you stupid eurocuck
  its wojak
god tier talented artists of /ic/ have you ever made a shitty drawing a /beg/ tier drawing       i refuse to believe some people had to grind like we shitty beginners had to
when they were children and teenagers
  none in adulthood
  there are those who have made a shitty drawing at one point in their life and then there a liars   you dont improve by making flawless artwork
  if you havent shat a masterpiece right after coming out of your moms womb then youre never going to make it op simple as that
  if you havent made your masterpiece before coming out of your moms womb then youre never going to make it cuz you already started to lose neuroplasticity the second your umbilical cord was cut
good artists make bad drawings all the time but they usually dont post them sometimes they do though either because they dont see the flaws/dont care and then /ic/ roasts them see the yoshinari threads because /ic/ puts good artists on an impossibly high pedestal i remember on his twitter yusuke kozaki drew ryoma from fire emblem with a really big chest and everyone gave him a hard time for it these are human beings who make mistakes too and arent always in the right mood as ive gotten better ive realized its not linear one day it comes easy the next it might be hard i might be able to draw an extremeangle pose because ive practiced it but struggle with a basic sitting pose from a different angle keep working on it and spend some time warming up first
  yes i have
this was from 5 or 6 years ago
  i remember on his twitter yusuke kozaki drew ryoma from fire emblem with a really big chest and everyone gave him a hard time for it  do you happen to have the picture
  wanna preface with saying that i am in no way even close to god tier due to my typical work flow most things i draw suck ass until i fix them and i have tons of drawings i just couldnt fix fast enough before i gave up and started over completely again if its been a few days since i drew either other work got in the way or im dealing with a random bout of extreme exhaustion cause my body is garbage i pretty much have to go through an entire day of making suck ass drawings just to get my hand back into the habit but then as long as i just keep consistently drawing things i can sorta at least usually work my way from a bad drawing to a good one over a few hours
  im still not anywhere close to sniffing pro tier so take that for what you will
  i think this it he apparently redrew it a few times because the criticism was that bad theres at least one other corrected version with the hair down and chest reduced if you reversesearch that image    now at the pro level a bad drawing doesnt necessarily mean a /beg/ drawing but the point is artists are imperfect and arent always satisfied with their work kopinksi talks about trouble drawing hands and other problems  kjg says he doesnt worry whether a drawing is good or bad after hes done and moves on to the next suggesting hes capable of drawing badly by his standards
jim lee drew this a few months back    something tells me that he wouldnt had published it if he wasnt streaming the process
  i refuse to believe some people had to grind like we shitty beginners had to  thats stupid everyone has to grind through it
  thanks the arm immediately caught my eye above everything else definitely a rushed piece or a bad day for him    and to address op incredibly skilled artists make bad pieces too what matters most is time and effort see pic related elder godtier cartoonist bengus work when has none
i know art schools a meme when it comes to learning and anyone can git gud on their own without them but what about making connections in the industry how much are those worth enough to offset the exorbitant tuition costs should people look at art schools as connection factories rather than as institutions of learning
pls
  like 50 of artists in the industry are selftaught anon if you can spend that much money and youre deadset on making this your career then do it but otherwise just selfteach
  so are the connections made through art schools not worth the tuition costs then
huh thats how its suppose to be you dont go to school for learning you go there to work on projects with people to get a feel for the industry and potentially get interns
at my art school there were about 25 people in the faculty and 3 of them were getting work constistently from the teachers others were left out i didnt make any significant connections there but the international exchange program for students helped me get my first job
if you have to ask you wont make it
  citation
if you go to one in a city filled with art galleries youll make connections easily im a turboautist and i still managed to get acquainted with some local artists the only problems is around half of them are generally insufferable and i dont want anything to do with them but if youre sociable youll be fine
        there are industry events and workshops you can attend
  if only i lived near anything like that shit even the only life drawing studio within 2 hours of me is closing down by the end of the year
  but what about making connections in the industry how much are those worth enough to offset the exorbitant tuition costs should people look at art schools as connection factories rather than as institutions of learning    not at all if you travel out to events you can easily find and meet people its whether youre a sperg or a weirdo or your work clearly shows a lack of dedication/passion thats the determining factor
depends on the faculty im finishing my aa this semester and it was a meme and im not finishing the bachelors but i made friends with a few of the faculty who have been fantstic for critique and exposure got my work shown at a local art cafe and met a few local artist miami
  its whether youre a sperg or a weirdo  where do you think we are
take the money tuition would cost and hire an agent to do that for you
  dont agents want established artists as well
which industry are you talking about the gallery art world or the film/concept drawing industry
  yes
what does /ic/ think    hes not bad technically but i feel like something is missing
its boring
  pfft come on nigga
  post your work and lets compare
  no nigga im fr its boring
  i prefer a chunkier broader more expressive style
he needs to remove aspects of the drawing and choose which parts to focus on to make it a good piece of art instead of a photo copy do you have the reference pic
did they pass the examination
  i imagine only derren has that    thats pretty much it anyway
the left eye and the nose look fucked
  the nose and mouth are not lined together otherwise good work anon you are getting there
  so photocopied that the background almost looks blurred utterly disgusting
  happiness happiness is missing
  reminds me of those portraits people sell to tourists on the beach
  its a ptohocopy instead of understanding the structure of human face you just copied it and it feels lifeless
  this you can see subtle asymmetries that betray a lack of understanding of the underlying form    inb4 nobodys face is perfectly symmetrical it gives it character and individuality    yeah but this one just looks off and wrong learn underlying structure before diverging from it    also it lacks overall artistic license as many people have said already its a photocopy nothing has been artfully simplified or interpreted by the artist its mechanical and overly literal with no value simplification
wished the artist made the subject look prettier   i wouldnt put that on a tinder profile pic if you know what i mean
what should i offer as my rewards if im a fucking poorfag
your amazing art
offer to suck dick
porn and lewds
what if i dont offer anything
i dont think theres any need to have rewards youre already making art for your patrons youre not obligated to make rewards at all if you still want to reward then you could draw/paint something patreon only
if its just a tip jar fucking nothing
i have four tiers    tier 1 has reddit flair and a discord rank it doesnt need to be fancy
fullres psds private youtube links to the process video  maybe a commission above a certain price  as long as youre not huge its pointless to think about  some people dont even do rewards and post everything but i dont know if artists do that though it tends to be other media for some reason
  your patreon link
  you have a reddit and discord about yourself wtf
  patrons are invited to your private discord  patrons get an exclusive drawing every two weeks/month/whatever  patrons get to see the art before everyone else  the following are fag tier but it works lel  patrons get full res versions of your art instead of the lower quality you give everyone  patrons get nonwatermarked version of your art  also offer a 1buck tier with no rewards besides your gratitude youd be surprised how many people are interested in just that
  my tumblr followers asked for a discord  i think its more about having a place to mingle with people of similar art interest swap related pictures etc
why not just do it per illustration
        its for a webcomic id need to be a lot more popular for that other thing
    i thought they were crying at first
  if you changed your handle to a unisex one removed your picture and all information regarding your gender you could easily double your 
  that is what the tattoos represent yeah      if i was going to do something like that it would be better to become the ghost artist for some girl who takes a lot of selfies then split the profits
  only mentioned it to you because hiding your face/gender doesnt really change your identity or hurt who you are you arent pretending to be a girl or anything it only adds to your well being
  i dont think theres any need to have rewards    theres not a need but the truth is if you dont offer additional value most people dont donate    one thing i think is the best bang for your buck is giving people votes in strawpolls and decionmaking stuff for a monthly drawing or like a raffle for a free commission its one drawing a month but if youve got a decently interested following you can get a lot of people wanting to be involved in the process
  porn
is trusting /ic/ for art advice a bad idea i mean none of you actually made it to the level that anyone here wanted to be
what about teal guy
  whos teal guy i only drop in here like a few times a year
  ic is great for critical thinking when you post work and one guy tells you to go kills yourself and one asks for your blog its helpful to consider both and whether or not they are just crabbing
use your head if its a proper critique then you should be able to observe it by comparing and paying attention too
  why is that animus spine broken
/ic/ has good principles even if they are listless worldweary and lazy pieces of shit interspersed with fedora opinions on art history    lessons /ic/ has given me    work hard  study fundamentals so that you have the freedom to bend and break rules  study so that you can actually see whats there rather than symbol draw  pursue naive and truthful vision this applies to all walks of life  break down and observe the techniques of artists you admire  if they wrote a technical manual or diary or recorded videos even better  remember that appeal and pleasing art is a balance of subjectivity and objectivity  be honest with yourself about your skill level lose the ego when youre self critiquing dont draw hands in pockets because you suck at hands  be a multidisciplinarian  if you draw moeblobs go out and do some plein air if you paint with oils try sculpting your subject first its all training the brain  dont get swept up in the machines of modern art education  if its a free tool to practice your own art fine but the debt and degrading atmosphere and losers youll be surrounded with might not be worth the effort when 90 of your art journey will take place inside your own head anyway  there is no objective best art even terrible modern art can have moments of incredible appeal good colours evocative moods japanese art can trump the best western art in its flow and character the best western art wipes the floor with any korean render god etc but they all have merit and more importantly each one tries to be inventive  revere classical art its good shit and full of good lessons these people had big brains and were adding onto the cumulative developed ideas of beauty that for the large part is no longer valued/ people think can be discarded or skipped nowawadays  life draw you lazy fuck photo references dont replicate the process of transferring a 3d thing viewed with 2 human eyeballs onto the page
  because redjuice is a fan of the ass and tits pose which consist of breaking the characters spine to display all of her assets to the viewer at once then rendering it well so you dot see her pain  granted hes for from being the only illustrator guilty of this
lets make a taste should you draw the dick when figure drawing
  based post saved
  why save it that means youre not internalizing it stop playing games and jacking off so much and maybe youd be able to retain information that matters
  why wouldnt you
there are a good handful of people who are quite good just look at the self promotion thread two of them are professional tier and who knows how many lurk so there is a chance you are getting a crit from good people but either way good or not you should be able to discern whats good and bad critique for yourself what is a critique based on fundamental errors and what is a critique based on aesthetics and taste
  more like the majority of illustrators have been doing this for ages
    technically he could say oh she is a robot she is not human there is no spine to break
   draw you lazy fuck photo references dont replicate the process of transferring a 3d thing viewed with 2 human eyeballs onto the page   draw you lazy fuck   this is actually way harder to actually achieve in real life than one thinks
  good old hawkeye initiative stuff heh  at least widows spine is not broken on the top pic
old /ic/ yes  only good thing from /ic/ is the sticky for resorces nu/ic/ became shit like the rest of the site took a little longer than other boards but it happened
  while this post is a good way to think about the study of art i feel there are some things to keep in mind in terms of the business side of art     good design is what the client wants  people look at concept art to create concept art  once you hit an acceptable level of quality the rest of the job is speed and communication  people who dont see your work wont give you job opportunities  art students have more free time than working artists   no one is obligated to respect you  art events are specialized to sell merch to educate or to provide a space to network  the quantity of fanart being created exists in relation to the demand  the job title of good artist doesnt exist
  teal didnt learn shit here he came to teach and the few who where there to learn got the secret to hot anime cuties  then he left and the secrets of anime left with him    everyone with any ammount of potential leaves this shithole
  
  im on my phone right now so i cant make a quick sketch to explain it but ill try using words    this photo proves that yes even if its not a confortable pose you can have the ass face and tits on display at the same time  but now compare your photo as a reference to the drawing take a particular attention to the hips and shoulders planes youll notice that ops drawing not only twist her torso but also bend her spine way farther than what the photo is doing
  yes i know the drawing is stretching the pose too far my point is simply that tna poses are not all spine breaking though i guess the anon meant the artist was into spine breaking tna and not saying tna poses in general are spine breaking
  anyone that has a mirror and isnt some fat inflexible fuck can easily do this too
      ignoring hyperflexible people like contortionists the human spine is perfectly comfortable in positions that can achieved during motion but not held during a forceful turn the human spine can easily twist such that the shoulders are at a 90 angle to the hips    the drawing is perfectly fine the shoulders arent even turned a full 90 degrees
  /ic/ should only be a supplement its the easiest second pair of eyeballs youll find on the internet though like if youre rounding your lower back when deadlifting it doesnt take a fitness coach to check your form also you learn that citing fancy art book  anonymous opinion
  this i am a male and even i can pull that pose off for a short amount of time a female is way more flexible so it should be easy for them tits and ass is impossible is a fucking meme made up by amerifats who cant turn their bodies 10 degrees without breaking something
  to be fair i think what started this broke back meme were superhero comic panels where the head was turning against the torso this created an unnatural tension in the drawing that nonartists dont fully understand but can still notice intuitively    this is why understanding gesture and line of action from an animator perspective is so important people who learn classical figure drawing often miss out on this because they use references and live models so heavily
  not exactly but close  the ass and tits pose was a staple of the 40s and 50s pinups with many photos and drawing depicting this pose but in a static realistic way  it then crossed over to comics where the trend kept going but the girls werent posing anymore they were becoming action girls and that pose becomes quickly exagerated when you stretch it too much also comics werent really aiming for realist anatomy cough liefeld cough  when the audience started to get aware of the female objectification trend part of the crowd fighted it hence the superhero broken pose meme of course it was objectification from the start it just wasnt a problem to objectify women in the 40s
to me ops image feel like broken spine because at first glance due to how the proportions and style is used the twist happens to what to my eyes feel like the lumbar vertebrae fall and lumbar vertebrae do not turn much at all most twisting happens around thoracic and cervical vertebrae for what i know of anatomy books    but everyone is different and theres contortionist as some point out that push the limits of what we find average or normal so you cant never say impossible but it feels freakish    this was kind of helpful for me  
  yeh the pose is fucked desu
  whatever happened to redjuiceguy  did he actually become redjuice
  judge the advice on itself not the person a professional artist can give you a bad advice as well
  this
  been wondering about him as well lately
  x board has become shit  things that have been said every day since 2006 for 1000 thanks
  the proof is in the work if you do some retarded sycransio voodoo magic and it somehow fixes a problem with your art then you should keep doing it dunningkruger means you yourself are not qualified to judge if you have fixed your problem

does anyone have any good tutorials on how to draw good porn
  look up for doxis tutorials
  id rather you didnt hes a massive douche with a huge ego
    dont doxy is a hack who can only trace stuff from other real hentai artists
  you gonna back that up
  he traces and copies uno makotos work all the time and only adds slightly different faces not even radically different ones he cant even draw hands his works have the hands almost always hidden and nothing that is below the thighs are shown
  look up some javs and kinda sorta study off those alternatively it always helps to have some technical knowledge when illustrating porn if youre interested in doing some longer form stuff study doujin artists  pic unrelated i remember just drawing from memory on this one
  so even if that crap you say is true his tutorials are still very useful
  doxy is good at teaching appeal on a technical level id say he plateaued maybe 24 years ago
      post your work  newsflash you wont
     this was also me    dont know what you might gain from seeing my stuff doesnt discount any criticism or compliments i might give doxy
  lol you draw the exact same shit as he draws and you are calling him out  gtfo
mfw i want to commission vu  too nervous to talk to her on discord
why do people keep hating on my faces
    if youd calm down for a moment youd notice i stated both a compliment and an observation i really like doxy and he does this as a full time deal not surprised he hasnt had much time to study up on the technical stuff hes in a comfortable space and doesnt really need to in my opinion      those doa pics werent kyles nicest pictures       please commission me i like money but also ima close commissions once november is over
  why are you closing commissions
  i want to take a break for the holiday season ive been doing commissionsblog promotion stuff since february and want to start organizing my sfw pursuits
  so youre stopping commission for a very extended time then
  2 months isnt much at least i feel like it isnt
  ill send ya in a bit then and are you ever going to race in the /v/eekend races again
  what is that
is there a discord where you guys talk
    the only real /ic/ discord that gets advertised alot is 
  i draw futanari if anyone wants a commission mckaos18tumblrcom yeah im shilling my site across boards big whoop
  omfg thats really bad
  i like your stuff but the left arm is super long in that one
first timer  sorry for sloppy digital edits dont have a scanner    who else into dryads / deer centaurs  i tried to capture a bit of that frustration from not being able to reach the torso when fuckin from behind
  yoru torso seems a bit too on the centaur the human parts spine doesnt look like it melds seamlessly into the deer part    dont take this as anatomical criticism we are talking about centaurs after all
  you dropped an adjective there it seems  and yea by all means i love me some constructive criticism
  he meant to say the deer part melds into the human torso too low try to set it above the tailbone that way the spine can curve better
  sorry i am drunk as fuck    what he said
i think i fucked the torso trying to do an up shot
why no loli
sorry to keep posting these something still feels off slightly but i jus cant quite place it plus i wanna color em but my lines always feel too thick to work well with anything other than flat colors and maybe some texture      not sure if plateaued is the right word so much as hes reached a level of quality hes maybe not necessarily happy with but is good enough for what he wants to accomplish and is now focused more on increasing the speed at which he can achieve it at least thats what he always talked about in his streams and videos where he has voice on      super cute is the bowleggedness intentional cause shes riding link so much that sounded dirtier than id intended cause if so heh clever but if not knees tend to not really be able to part like that with the heels right next to each other also i really need to work on drawing vaginas myself but i feel itd benefit from a sliight bit more care to the lines and how they express their definition at least if one is trying to go more for sexual appeal      dick attaches to the bottom of the pubic bone you might wanna move it down a bit      giftart for bigdad  the perspective is a bit all over the place in this piece unfortunately i miight be able to redline it in a bit but i dont wanna accidentally get your hopes up if i pass out or am too busy but ill try
        you degenerate fucks better gib blogs now i literally need to masturbate to all your drawings
  the first one has their  in the image juste_vu and the next two are by them as well but as for me im afraid its a bit of a monkeys paw seeing as my twitter is blank    gonna post things soon tho  maybe
  furfags get out
  nice hands brah how do you even
  i saw your halfling princess in the towergirls thread that was you right  gib blog your stuff has appeal
man so far my most liked pictures are the ones with the faces cropped out    i did it on purpose too to confirm      really like that perspective on midna
  you suck kyle    if you have to ask youll never make it
  no actually but he actually followed me after finding it somehow my expectations are low but thanks for the thought      practice and making the hand pose myself when i realized i had two of the best hand references on earth i got noticeably better      never did towergirls ive always seen the threads though ill have to check it out
  vusan what was your primary resource for studying hands i love the way you draw yours and feel theyre very emotive oshiete kudasai uwu
  please go being autistic somewhere else posts like that can give people cancer
my first pixelart
did tumblr delete anyone elses blog for no reason
  ill plug your oesophagus with my cock and cum directly into your stomach oniisan uwu
  these drawings are months old im a bit better now    twitter juste_vu  tumblr day_job_vu  discord daijouvu8477    havent drawn midna in forever    it helps to understand 3d shapes first then try studying feet along with hands at the same time as you draw one youll solve issues that you find with the other
coming down home stretch
drew the oracle princess for the towergirls thread
  your faces are always so unappealing and disturbing
  everything is nice but the penis its very very sharp
  sharp so pull the tip back more like this
  some thing is off on how those breasts attach
  he loves that character and drawing her much like you did also as promised here is a asdlfj an unfortunately kinda shitty rushed redline but basically the main thing i wanted to fix was that with boobs that large at this angle they would obscure most if not all of the shoulders and also a bit of the face as well along with the cup leaning a biiit too much forward where shed spill her drink       these drawings are months old im a bit better now  oh hasdlfj sorry for that but also hell yeah at improving i hope i can always be improving too
  why so many dick girls on this threads
  i really like your redline blog
how does one get references for the womb
  girls with dicks are cute      cute      nellipher
critique my degeneracy pls
i cant draw faces please help
  why does that girl have a dick
  becasue every girl should have a dick besides their vag
    full package futa bro  based
  wouldnt the breast also be closer together and basically become like one object if the cloth is pushing on them as hard as implied by creases on the sides
rough sketch
  yeah youre probably right tho i tend to think of the big fake drawn smut boobs as like super heavy yet super soft and tend to exaggerate them like that but im still pretty sure that youre right in that they should be getting squeezed closer together main thing i wanted to get across was the perspective at that angle but i was rushing cause my friends wanted to play overwatch 
minion smut
how dose this looks so far
wip
  nice style anon only the hands are a bit strange
wip
heres another study fellas not really porn but i think people appreciate swimsuits new to doing fluid effects worked off a photo but ill have to figure out a more efficient method
where do yall niggas find poses for reference porn
  please tell my how you do the lineart
  add more sag to your breast youll be bbc soon dont rush it
  youll be bbc soon  soon  lmao
  mommmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
  weird hands but who cares with titties like that
  wouldnt it be horrible if your uncle molested you using this hand it would totally ruin et
  terrible learn how to draw first before doing exaggeration and way before doing rendering
in what platform can i even post unsensored porn with popular anime characters who often are 300yo or a clone made yesterday but dont really look like it    i know da can get anal about a fictional girls age dantewontdie left da after they took down his lewd asuka   what about hentaifoundry pixiv is anal about uncensored content twatter i dont want to go anywhere near tumblr thats just bots following bots who follow bots
  jesus just stop drawing little girls getting dicked and youll be fine  if they look like kids then its normal that they will be considered as kids
is it bad to reference and study 3dpd
    its not weird its broken and rotated in the wrist
  in a weird way
  no
  little girls  literally every single popular character from any popular anime is 14 and diva from overwatch is 16    im not talking loli or anything just the usual stuff   if i post on pixiv i will have to use at very least the translucent censorship da wouldnt tolerate a naked asuka hf does take that from the popular approved artists but what about unapproved ones  can i post them on twitter
  why are you namefagging
  to make it a little easier to trace my work
hey just wondering how far off the shoulder neck area is im thinking i should have shortened the right arm maybe
  it really doesnt matter how old they are lorewise all that matters is how you portray them and if you run into autistic fans then tough luck just stay safe withing the laws of your country/state and youll be fine
  dva is 19
i havent had fun with a piece in a long time once i started working on the motorcycle but i cant but feel something is off about the piece as a whole id really appreciate a critique and some suggestions to incorporate the lighting in my background reference
  it looks like the viewer has a candle in his hand and thats the only source of light in the picture so in this case there will be no light on the background
  fuck americans there values dont matter
tips for drawing porn
  draw tips
  be good at drawing in general and youll be good at drawing porn too  also dont be a brainlet that helps a lot
  download tons of porn videos in hd take screenshots try to not fap and use them for reference
  try to not fap  do you seriously need to pull your dick out as soon as you see sexual imagery how much of a dickbrain are you
i tired to make something fappable in under 2 hours the result is no line art why am i so bad at lineart it always looks so sterile and bland
  poorly done lineweight
  i agree im not sure if its a matter of confidence or just some missing knowledge my line art is my weakest fundie skill right now
  i love this is it slime/cum
  a matter of confidence  missing knowledge  confidence is born from knowledge
  ever tried coloring your lineart with a darker hue that matched the colors around it
  yeah i just didnt get around to doing it with the shorts  hair
  how do you put out so much content
  i just know how the average 4chan user thinks
  xavier
  skin metal leather have the same texture
  people want to see cute faces yours seem to not be by design and dont look anything like midnas
  who
continuing this ffxiv piece after a quick nap anything about this strap on sex scene piece will be added soon that needs corrections or a quick fix
  nice  your improvement is motivating
  do you draw these from imagination or do you reference 3d models or poses
  this is freaking sexy gib blog please i need to touch my weewee
  her head does not look attached
  the pose seems right but it is the most boring and neutral moment in the movement sliding the body back with more arch in the back or forward with head going up probably would have looked much better
  its too far if you want it to work you should move her left arm farther to the right and rotate her chest a bit toward the viewer
  worst case of the pillow shading
practicing
  the lighting and shadows are fine just the boots the tires and the back of the bike need to defined more
  the lighting and shadows are fine  not really theres no way to tell where the light source is coming from right now this looks like very bad ambient occlusion
  all he has to do is punch up the lighting coming from up around corner on the ground and bike and boots    what about this being bad ao
  the figure looks like its being occluded by some sort of obstacle thighs and face habe this strong soft shadow on them that is coming out of nowhere but the scene is set in the open  makes 0 sense also the majority of his other artworks has the same issue
  thank you i hope to continue to inspire and improve over the next year      i will rework the draft with your suggestions in mind my family comes first this weekend there will however be an update monday      specifics        i agree the leather needs to be reworked but i do not see the issue with the metal are you speaking of the composite hull of the bike based on f22 and f35 aircraft        mileage and fundamentals my process currently is to start with a bunch of rough gestural sketches pick one then apply perspective guidelines to map out the underdrawing/mannequinization     however this is not very efficient after a period of study scheduled during the holidays i will draft some tutorials for you guys to weigh in on        how so      the commissioner wanted me to combine a postapocalyptic science fiction background with a pinup shot lets say she is taking a selfie of sorts using a drone or some mechanical servant to rally her troops to justify the light source and fulfill the commissioners order what would you recommend to better sell the scene
you guys kept us on 4chan the draw thread sends its regards

  kinda new here but i have seen your stuff around and i think the two biggest weaknesses you show in this painting are value control and atmosphere through light  lemme explain what i mean if you for example were to look at her thigh you can see that you know what bounce light is and you know how to shade in general but the transition from high to low value are way too fast this could either man you are going too far up the values or you want to include almost all of them i made this mistake too when i started out but i am slowly beginning to see this mistake going away  atmosphere through light is a bit more subjective in a way because what i mean by that is that the lighting itself looks like someone used a flash on a cellphone to take the picture meaning the entire bike and figure get illuminated intensely  my personal solution would be to let the bounce light of the bike do the work for you meaning her boots arent even hit by light that much which of course goes back to value control  basically what i mean is create anything other than a front light that illuminated the general forms and go for a more artsy lighting scenario as dumb as that might sound  i see a ton of people calling other people crabs on here so lemme tell you that im personally extremely jealous of how good your lineart is if you got any tips shoot lmao  i love the designs tho so i hope to see you come back stronger next time
  nice linework anon are you drawing over your own stuff or someone elses
  my stuff
im new to drawing porn just started this today but i just want sum feedback its not near finished yet
  oh god her legs
  where do you find your references if i may ask
  your anus is where the pussy should be and the pussy is in the front of the pub lol
  starfire
  bro you say youve read loomis but you keep pillow shading
is there a way to fix this mess
  please gib blog _
  rec femdom artists please or yourself if you do    bonus for lezdom
i just finished this today the shoes suck but im happy with the way it turned out
does roblox even care
  its oil but can be any liquid of a similar viscosity    this picture is a fetibox gallery image but generally when im studying skin tones i look for images that provide a good variety in a single image alone
resized
  wtf is that shit
  its not really good but its still more interesting to me than a lot of polished turd that being said reconsider how to make a coherent style 
  thanks anon i need to find an artist i like and model after them who are your favorites
  i would add more highlights to the hair and more shading to the body
  who are your favorites  it doesnt matter make a map of your favorites even the ones that are not considered good artists or whatever just what you find cool then analyze why and/or incorporate elements of their style into yours    or just see the world through your eyes and look for your style by drawing a ton and analyzing    or just plin copy one style you like and tweak it later    not one solution findthe one you feel the most confortable with
        is this some kind of autistic samefagging
  penis placement looks weird
  the torso on the most left one is kinda fucky
  i cannot figure out whats wrong her face i know is a bit off and i wanted to give her a twist in the torso but i dont know how to make the picture more believable
  resized
  not my most accurate drawing really enjoyed posing the figures though
study
  them feet
  really like your colour choices for this and i like how soft/well blended it is    only thing i would note is that at the moment the thigh/butt on the left feels a bit flat like its pressed up against glass     also the darker lines on the shins/ankle that are in the light feel a bit out of place    i personally like making things more colourful and think it would look nicer if it had a soft blue/green light in the shadows to make the fleshy tones really stand out
   where can i finds refs like this to study
  hehe thanks im still getting used to painting
  please for the love of god do some fucking reference studies stop drawing this garbage and actually learn something for once
  /s/
  i dont know whats worse his art or your critique
  
  facebook
      thanks every time i find refs its old wrinkly woman with gross vagines
  tried to just do a little edit to show what i was talking about with colour left is 50 dodge layer and the colours i used are on the right original in mid for comparison    this is only how i like do do stuff though trying to make things look shimmering/more beautiful that reality rather than doing just a stylised version of reality
  i paint on one layer no dodge/overlay thanks though
  i used to do the same but found it easier to experiment with colour effects like this and the using hue/saturation sliders i plan to head back into using one layer when i have a better understanding of how i want the final picture to look
how do i into proportions
  hahahahaha this is awesome
wip
  have a short stack reference
  what the fuck are you talking about
  dude her face lmao
  i couldnt find them
  til hentai is just illustrated midget porn
  you saying thats a bad thing
  just finished it
      there are more scattered around the web but this is the best place to find them iirc there are a bunch on patreon that you can access through yiffparty
  why do ur dicks have tumors
kirlia
  to be fair some people do have really pronounced veins in the dick its usually only one or two and im pretty sure its very rare but it does happen
  what is this supposed to fucking represent  the glute are you dumb above it are the serratus and internal abdominal oblique
  got a source for this genuinely want to stock up on this type of ref
anything that needs to be fixed
help how do i fix it
  a little boring pose wise but i like the style
  something about those feet feel likes shes not standing on a floor
    i think the one on the right needs to be foreshortened more
  give up
  no that is a leg muscle the quads make that contour glutes are flat when flexed even on the most exaggerated body builder physique its a relatively flat plane that contour isnt even visible to anyone with a reasonable amount of body fat and you have to flex a shit ton to even get it    the dude uses hard lines for everything his characters look like robots the lines show he doesnt understand any of the anatomy and just understands symbols     pic related is probably what he referenced if he referenced anything and even then he completely failed to understand what that contour is supposed to be not only is it only this visible with oil and bright lights but it also is a subtle plane change mans just needs to stop using lines for this shit these things need to be implied through basic rendering
always act like a super lewd guy online   draw girls in provocative poses   people who like my art assume i will draw some porn when asked like its no big deal  in reality i have never drawn any porn out side of a few sketches   every time i try to draw something overly lewd i get really embarrassed / shy by it    i feel like once i draw some porn thats it im the porn guy forever
  how the fuck are you doing this totally jealous
  rofl
can you guys recommend me other artists who are this good at drawing juicy pussy
  can you just be satisfied with the answers you got in the thread you made and not spam this shit everywhere
  the idiots we get on /ic/ are truly a special breed  its like they think that reposting the same threads and posts multiple times in an hour will somehow speed up the board and get a bigger reaction
  pussies are disgusting
  this
  nigga you gay
  your faggotry is showing and with that i dont mean that you are a homosexual guy
where do i post my trap art
  to yourre moms email fgt
  not here fag
  right here fag
  theyre undeniably one of the worst looking human parts im not gay but dicks are way cooler  pussys design is terrible
  nah i just go into midget porn threads and save the good stuff have another
  getting the proportions right is the hardest part of drawing short stacks
  my name is kyle though i doubt im the one you want
    right now theres very few colors and even with a pale character like this there would be more subtle colors like dark purple or something within the skin rather than just straight up grey and whiteeven with white human skin there can be reds tans oranges etc   another thing i notice about the shading is that its very flat there should be a greater contrast between the shadows mid tones and highlights which should also be on the face and ass btw just be a little bolder id say   there are other minor problems like the line art is kind of boring but i notice there is a clear highlight on the hair and although muted and pillowey the shadows and light have a direction ie at least you understand the light source also the buttblush is kind of weird lol   i understand that the style you were going for was mininmalistic but you can still shade the hair a little bit even if its just a gradient or whatever because right now it kind of looks like a solid block this also applies to the dress  also your to subtle with the pussy cream/piss i didnt even notice it at first and when i first did i thought my screen was dirty its super tiny  another thing to improve on is anatomy maybe you were trying for simplicity but things like the head and arms could use more shape and definition right now the head just kind of looks like you drew an oval with the circle tool you can still have an ovoid head but i would study heads more if i were you    all in all youve got a long way anon but i wouldnt squander all hope just yet    tldr add more colors to the skin bigger contrast of shadows buttblush is weird more pussjuice but you somewhat understand shading also could improve on anatomy
coming down home stretch will resume after some ffxiv just got to refine the ellipses of the glass and touch up the hands
wip first time in a few years since i picked up the pen trying to practice colours and cleaner lines and yeah i know sadida dudes have their face covered im adding the hair once i finish up the body
  blog please i really like your brush work

  the thighs are too short bro
  i tried to copy everything i could from screenshots and i actually measured her head though there is a lot of issues with the shadows if i make them darker they look posterized as in bands of color appear instead of being gradients
  i will draft some tutorials for you guys to weigh in on    fucking nice i hope that you find the time to do so as im very interested
update fire away
  how long did it take you to get to that point in the drawing
  i drew a little bit here and there throughout my life but i only i began taking art seriously a little over a year ago
  bands of color appear instead of being gradients  idk dude it could be the brush settings if youre using photoshop id turn the hardness down for shadows but if not i really dont know and i dont want to tell you the wrong thing  imo its hard to pull off a guaranteed boner with a style like ruby gloom i didnt even know the cyclops was a character in the show up until your post and i guess im not the ultimate authority on hentai or whatever but if you tried to make it look like a frame in the show you did an ok job super hard to pull of though
im currently studying how to properly draw a nice pair of tits any suggestion/ reference on how to draw nips i like these ones but variety is cool from puffy to inverted they all look nice
  how are people supposed to help you if you dont show your art
    awesome shes like a pocket wife      sorry i wont have time to redline it but the middle one is out of balance falling to the right either shift her upper body to the left or move left leg to the right or make her hang on something from the left
  this sounds kinda odd but i like how you drew her underarm in the right panel its not needlessly complex but shows the biceps definition    also its great in general wish i knew how to draw on a tablet like this
  youre right be brutal im a beginner and should probably spend more time in the general currently on paper may spend money on a tablet once i get decent
  i am fapping to this
  learn construction and figure drawing first buddy  learning nipples now will not help you at all
  aight thanks ill go basics first then
  dont go into a drawing by outlining start from the basics learn how to construct the body with simplified forms sycra has good videos that break down the simplified forms whereas proko has great indepth anatomy tutorials
drawpile is hard
idk im pretty unsure how to do stuff like this but this is an orc im attempting
look   if your trying thats the first step and i personaly love it even though i am a faggot
  thank you the worst thing about this is that im going for that orc loincloth that just makes her look like shes wearing old woman panties
  why does she have a concave ribcage
  what brush settings are you using
  nigga thats just tristana with wings
  stabilizers at like 10 itrs a custom nip pencil from clip studio    yeah its not perfect drawpile does that to ya i was aiming for the rolled forward shoulder look
  link to that brush
  idk why but the fake that her pussy is so detailed really freaks me out
  blog
  xavier renegade angel hes a character from an adult swim show the bird guy in that pic looks really similar to him
  sorry for the shitty redline    your muscles are pretty decent so far at a glance the biggest issue is probably the abs they feel flat and are all about the same size the abs should stretch from the lower ribs to the pubis  try placing them with those landmarks in mind make sure to vary the sizes and emphasize the corners where they meet     the leg muscles are good just make sure youre paying attention to how the muscles are connected and fit together before you render the prominent ones also your knees feel very round knees are boney dont be afraid to use straight edges to strengthen your drawing    and just a quick note  i know they arent included much in your drawing but the lower leg muscles bulge out on the outside and then the inside lower down
  having pelvis bones on the same level with navel     duudetheres the whole bottom 2 pack between tthem   abs go like   4 pack on the top  navel  2 pack   pelvis  the bottom of the 2pack connects to the groin
    wow i was not expecting such a detailed response i did take inspiration from the wow orcs and the abs did feel iffy when i drew them hips and legs have been a real struggle for me as well so thank you for showing me the details i couldnt perceive i really appreciate the critique and redlining
  this was more just me playing around with it really like your line work though
  very good suggestions only problem i see is the right figure is a bit too thin around the stomach now compared to left and middle
what should i work on besides fundamentals i meanfirst if i want to be basic commissionlevel like emulate a certain style that sells more tha the others maybe any other suggestions or general tips
  daijouvu  clever
  there is not enough r34 midna in the world that would seem to satisfy me
first time on /ic/  porn thread  boy theres a lot of /d/ in here
  more please
                    that should cover you  on to the art i think the trap is too high on the fat ntr man he should be just a bit lower for him to penetrate him properly at that angle it looks like hes trying to fuck him with the bottom of his belly the random pillow is kinda awkward uless theyre on the floor and youre just doing dutch angle to make it lewder
  source is literally on the image
  you were influenced by bbcchan too
    theres something horribly wrong with you people
  source was literally not on the image i quoted
  i think its pretty useful for fantasy beings like imps
  have the femboy rubbing the big mans nipples with his toesies
  
i dont know what to draw for christmas im still behind on my halloween stuff
  wait whats wrong with their critique
  i like her face but the rest its awful anon look for some reference to correct her proportions
    i think its fine enough obviously its already done so theres no point in wasting hours of your time constantly fixing your art for some anon make sure to post it on her birthday the only glaring problem i have for it is the neck and shoulders obviously no normal person would really care so just continue to study and fix these problems in your next work
  he ask for critic and/or opinions you dumbass is not like he has to fix the pic for anyone here
  its a bit messy but any better
  i dig it
  i like the shading makes my penis tingle

lets see so i went ahead and posted same face syndrome as the op pic for this thread and surprise surprise   you didnt fail to disappoint months later and after countless critiques on your crap you still continue to post your plateau halfassed uninteresting work but then again why should anyone expect anything more of you to be honest thats a tough life to live i imagine having to wake up every single day of your miserable existence and consciously know that this is the best youll ever amount to that you take no pride in the work that you do with absolutely no progress whatsoever     youre a failure in every sense of the word and no matter what ridiculous reply you try to come up with to answer back know this youre going to wake up tomorrow sit up on your bed and think im going to draw the same garbage today as i did yesterday and im going to do the same tomorrow and the next day and the next two weeks from now im still going to live in the same miserable existence of my work until a month passes and i will have nothing to show for it    you have got to be one of the most laziest artists i have ever come across in my life in fact to call you an artist is an insult to those who actually manage to make progress in their work to call you a hack is to voluntarily give you some accrued praise for the pile of shit you continue to pass off as work     your work is a disgrace to the fantasy realm and community but not for the reasons you think your lack of effort is what makes your work such an eyesore and anyone within that community who truly values the genre will be one of the first to tell you to quit theres no salvaging this thing you call an art ability kiddo try as you might however youll medicate your mind with some lame excuse never batting an eye to the harsh criticism and wake up tomorrow ready to draw the same bullshit again     your work speaks for youand it sucks to be you
ah and then theres jay chris jefferson the greg land of the thread youd be wise to do your research on who that artist is then youll know why i make that distinction between the two your life now revolves around tracing and heavy reference jefferson and its clearly evident in the work that you post here because lets face it your attitude has gotten you kicked off more other social media platforms than anyone else hosting their career up over their heads     you started off as abitofcrumpet on hentai foundry only to end up here polishing these heavily referenced burne hogarthesque pillow shaded pieces that have very little interesting value im not surprised if you anonymously post after the fact just to keep up some form of appearance by the next brit boy cuck chan replies youve been given to your posts here youve been drawing what a year now and this is what you have to show for it  greg landesque heavy reference developing your own brand of stupid grin cheesecake looks to your work as if every drawing you post is magically sexy in some manner theres no magic to the amount of work you put out jefferson all you to is trace the work  you just hide the reference layer when you post your work here so that you can give off this impression of look im using the same skeletal framework that the rest of you do so if i can do it so can you     please spare me the impact font jpeg youre going to reply to this you can go back a few months on your namefag on google and see that youve actually gotten worse with your work and sure you can put out lame excuses like you always do cancerous in nature i predict withing a year youll still draw the same mark my words a year from now much like you are now youll keep riding the plateau top to absolute mediocrity     greg land should be proud to have someone follow in his footsteps like same face you both share in the laziest attribute any hobbyist can acquire
even more vexing is this new entry into the codependent cycle of drawing halfway shit  to posting old work to try to justify namefagging the entire thread for themselves  only to draw this garbage   effectively showing the regression of ones own ability to draw     but at least youre honest about your so called painting techniques   much like jefferson you share in the greg land style of learning which is copying or in your case painting over a reference picture how quickly you posted the actual photo you copied so that no one could call you out on your crap but notice how that clearly shows how you cant draw a thing without you having to rely on copying much like the cancer jefferson creates the proof is in your work just like jefferson same face and every talentless    to be quite honest i take that back you all have talent it takes talent to come up with the kind of crap you do it takes talent to selfmedicate yourselves with wave after wave of endorphins when someone calls your work out as shit only to gravitate on by like if nothing was wrong     and i imagine you too are going to come up with some poor lame excuse but ive noticed that rarely do i get a reply from my posts which is your teambased response to the harsh words of salty kun dont reply to the troll it clearly doesnt know how to draw so how can it judge us were above the hate    much like i did for same face jefferson gets to be the op picture next thread vus had his chance and so has brit boy cuckchan were going to watch as each and every one of you gets a chance to shine as op pic only to further my truth that none of you have the balls to get any better participation awards all around  because everyone heres a winner     i rather enjoy seeing you all hit the proverbial wall with your garbage there is no god here to save you from your miserable work
      based and redpilled
  do those artists usually post here
  lobsterkiahl aka i cant handle critique come here everyday and post her disgusting art why im assuming is a girl because she have that attitude of i dont care what you think even when she is one of the most hated posters here she keep posting i assume she do this because she think she is somehow trolling anons she ignore every critique even when is good and keep her art the same without any type of improve she is like that pic of a anime girl bitting a fish i gonna post this every day until you like it    hardstones mcflintcock aka manamah jeff bbcchan wannabe somehow this man managed to be even worst than lobs why because everyone knows he trace/high reference all of his art and is so souless boring and stiff that the only thing that opaque that is his pillow rendering he dosnt know the difference between skin steel/iron or leather he render everything with the same texture his dream is to become the next bbcchan and he claims to be already because he samefag his art with replies saying shit like you gonna be the next bbc but he isnt even the shadow of bbc because the 3d models he use are too stiff and bbc art have more flow and less perfect anatomy/perspective he dosnt fuck with these for more appealing because he dont know how to do it    daijouvu aka walmart mahmapuu/eigaka/gloss keep trying to copy these guys trying is the keyword here
  im glad only one paragraph of this observation was a complaint towards my technique compared to the other guys i guess that means im doing pretty well    yeah i did a photo study using a photo reference i was practicing skin tones i think you might be missing the point of a photo study i dont paint over the photo i keep it on the side and use it as a reference when picking colors the pose was merely for accuracy to the reference material     as for regression cant really argue against that ive only been posting for maybe a few months now its reasonable to say not all my drawings are going to be better than the last i dont always put my all into each and every sketch my work from last year though was pretty awful and id like to say ive been improving  pic is dated to november 2017
  if thats what you were making november of last year youve improved quite a bit vu    also if i drew some fanart of your boy lieu would you mind if i sent it to you directly on discord or twitter
   theyre gonna think im samefagging with a reply like that just keep calling my stuff shit its actually more productive that way youd be better off asking me stuff through my dms im constantly shilling my blogs you know where to find me    if more people posted their work here id be happy to give any advice i might have
  shit sorry asldfj i wasnt really thinking tho i can prove im not samefriending cause im about to maybe post some of these soon and ive been here long enough that im sure anyone else whos been here as long might recognize some of these
      pyw
  oh hey its the toriel belly bump guy really dig those pics
  oh saltykunhad i known you felt so strongly for me id do a little something for you or should i be calling you redmatzoo since you have posted similar screeds under your handle before sometimes using that loud house jpg    its like whenever you hear the handle saltykun ptsd flashbacks flood into your hormoneaddled mind and as vapid as your rants are at least they offer the value of thisdark kind of humor projected at everyone who triggers your insecurities very few have managed such a consistent level of fail    but you kind of squandered your entire rant by repeating the tired accusations over and over hoping theyll come true and elevate your work instead you repeat the same nonsense as you did in the past kicked off social media with the exception of tumblrs nsfw purge almost all of my accounts are intact your accusations of tracing and heavy reference is a joke at this point the two pieces you isolated do not support your asinine claims the first i referenced from a wow screencap and relied on my own knowledge for the bust shot the other roughed then constructed from memory after doing my usual routine of thirty second and two minute gestures    as for the 3d models accusation i have only used skelly never used anything else except a bad experiment with the models three years ago back when it was known as manga studio    but whatever floats your boat
  wait did you not call doxy a hack or was this  not you
  i used to follow doxy and i think i even gave him money on patreon at one point i dont really use his tutorials anymore because ive started to move in a different direction stylistically i would never call doxy a hack his work has inspired alot of people to try and strike it on their own and anyone with that much success must be doing something right
  apologies then i was wrong
  lol never change man never change
  danke hope to keep my work consistently on that quality if not better from now on also working more on color hopef
is this erotic at all i feel like im not exaggerating enough    on a less fundamental note i havent started the hair yet and my brain explodes whenever i think about how it should move im currently working on restyling it
  wtf man look for help immediately
  ive been looking for a while but no ones ears are able to fit me someday anon someday
  is this erotic at all  no  on a less fundamental note  lets stay on the fundamental note please work on everything before trying to make arousing animations itll never be arousing until you do study your anatomy and draw it in perspective foreshortened etc and imagine it as 3d forms
is this worth continuing
  i think your actual problem with defining muscles with harder lines is that they are too small for that check out tradd moores luther strode to see how it is done on guys who have inhuman levels of muscle definition and how it stacks up to normal characters in the same series     you would be much better off with adding a second shade of grey to each of the characters and using cell shading
  good point will keep in mind for the future will also break out my strode collection cause its been a while since i reread it thanks
  only if you make huge changes her face is completely symbol drawn and nothing is in place the mouth in particular is falling off the side of her face also boobs that size wouldnt touch like that theyre currently being held together by an invisible force id recommend flipping your canvas while you draw quite frequently
  id say so i had a quick go too if it helps at all
hey guys i posted this in the other thread too  i recently watched flcl alternative and theres literally no good porn of that show on the internet  what is it about flcl and especially flcl alternative that artists struggle so much with
  insanity
  so youre saying that most porn artists are too normie to do it justice
  either too normie or their cockroaches are not in the right alignment
  the show sucks and nobody asked for it
  its quite like norasuko sp   i like it    k so this is probably bait but im gonna bite  just to give you a piece of sage advice   dont get so worked up over other peoples creative pursuits sure you can like or dislike works but try to ease up on the holierthanthou attitude towards critique     furthermore have you ever considered that improvement isnt necessarily the goal for all people at some point   perhaps hitting the wall is simply another way of describing comfort     heres an analogy and not a food one   when you are looking for a partner you try to improve your game your attractiveness your conversation skill   you dont just throw yourself upon the first single person you meet do you   you develop tastes and interests you maybe date a bit if thats your bag   eventually you will settle for a person that meets your requirements tastes and situation   you dont then keep busting ass and dating in the hopes to find someone better rather you settle     art can be a release for some people and is subjective  so to make it into a massive struggle to be the best is pointless and selfdefeating    i hope your life becomes more fulfilling and you have a run of good luck so that you can have a bit more positivity in your sphere then maybe you wont feel the need to express yourself with such a detracting intent     in short i hope you chill and have good reason to do so cos you realise this is all kinda pointless
  noodle  fucking saved
  mitsuki    my nigga
  as i asked redmatzoo your associate i will ask for proof of your piggybacked accusations and a fresh line of bullshit that dribbles down afterwards     on a side note the metal being the same texture accusation is hilarious because everybody else discerns it right off the bat the folks on discord have been helpful with their advice on rendering leather take note if you actually give a toss about helping artists improve    if you want to know my inspirations ask
  blog
  the original flcl was made back in the early 2000s with a few episodes so i can see why   people from the newer generations wouldnt draw porn of it  its sort of hidden even though its loved by many fans  however the newer one isnt that good and the characters are too boring to draw porn of  all i can say is keep looking
  show sucked and didnt make sense anyways same goes for the new season
  i can respect your opinioneven though i liked the first one   i felt that the original was more experimental with the animationthe newer one is just dull and lifelessthere were no scenes where i can say yeah id go back for that
  well id assume people who draw anime porn are more into anime than normal people  thats why i was wondering i think i saw some flcl porn on a japanese twitter recently
  try to look on pixiv too
  you can stumble upon untagged flcl lewds once in a blue moon if you follow a lot of japanese artists on twitter i think a lot of them have migrated from pixiv to twitter these days so its a bit of a treasure hunt
  flcl is my favorite thing of all time for some reason this makes it really difficult to try and draw lewd things of it i could probably draw cheesecakey fanart of characters being intimate but i cant really bring myself to draw them actually having sex wait shit i just remembered kitsurubami brb
  haruko is such a tease though her entire character is sex appeal
  yeah but her whole point is shes just playing with naota using him even when she does start genuinely caring for him its more so as an older sibling it starts getting too deep in my brain with my weird dumb feelings for others and how i relate to intimacy lol
  thats the point you wanna fuck her cuz shes playing so much payoff
im not at all an animator but ive always wanted to try its kinda fun
  do a blaziken with fat tits
what should i draw
  more bum
  this    draw 
  not them but sure ill do this when i wake up
  probably gonna give her a big fat cock too tho so b reddy
  i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt even matter
  here ya go
  goddamn that was quick shes great can i get a link to your blog
    by blog i mean your tumblr/twitter/linkedin/whatever man im tired
    i tried  im sleepy hope you dont hate it
    thats epic
please people i cant decide which pose to choose ive been stuck at this point for a while now  ill pick whichever people like the most if any
should i just start making a manga that is the pure expression of everything im feeling right now    should i make a manga regardless of my skill level right now if i was to create such a thing what website would i place it on right now      should i make a manga that is pure self expression should i make a manga that is the mixing pot of my depression     would anyone care if i made a manga right do i even dare to find it in myself to make a manga right now    are crabs just going to tell me to kill yourself or to neck myself for expressing thoughts of wanting to make a manga right now would they even understand thats already how i feel right now    could i take actions to make my dream real right now i wish someone would tell me you can make it real right now    should i make a manga right now
this reads like a dr seuss poem
  sure
do it faggot
    holy fuck just draw and post your work
  if i do that wont you anons just say im not going to make it and that i should just kill myself
  draw your manga then kys
do it right now anon  right now
  yes if you can start it today and want to start it today then there is no true benefit for pushing it back to a later day
how much money would you gladly pay for this beautiful craftsmanship
i dont really commission creepy uncanny valley cyborg ladies so there is no amount that i would gladly pay sorry
theyd have to pay me at least 500 to take it
  deal
check /r/hungryartists and compare
  10 rubles
a toe nail some dirty sock a old lemon head a dime and some lint from my tummy
  pay more for it than firez ugly work
  is it me or her right hand fingers are freaking long
  this faggots name is jay chris jefferson some autistic 30 year old degenerate who relies heavy on tracing he charges 140 dollars for this garbage shit on his work wuth extreme prejudice
  ic is not your personal army
  not a dime    everything is too stiff and the feet needs work
whats /ic/s views of bad artists using expensive supplies example copics
  why do you care op its their money if theyre enjoying themselves what does it matter to you
  i dont have a opinion on it other than it being slightly cringy to see it i just want to see what others think in my opinion i dont think having expensive tools makes a great artist its how the artist uses these tools
im /beg/ but i have a cintiq 24 pro
  it looks a lot fucking better than if they used crayons
shouldve posted with something more attention grabbing like 
  i just got my refurbished cintig 22hd and i can barely operate it on my laptop and am beg tier but hell its alot of fun even i wont waste my copics though
  yeah buying expensive shit mean there is no turn back   a good way to motivate yourself   too bad im too poor even for that
  dont care because im not an insecure fag
  everyone has to start somewhere copics arent an easy or cheap medium to work with so if you want to make your drawings look more professional and appealing might as well splurge on a decent set and start practicing looks a lot better than crayons markers
  they make sure my favorite suppliers dont go bankrupt
  ill be the first to call out my mental gymnastics here but i find it very easy to interpret the price someones willing to cough up for their tools as a reflection of how much they think their own work is worth which makes them come off kinda arrogant i strongly believe that tool quality cannot affect art quality in the slightest hb pencil drawings on maths notebook paper have left me speechless the same way overblown garbage has left me rolling my eyes countless times
  this isnt true at all a lot of cheaper art supplies can hinder beginners because they often have challenges that you have to overcome a lot of art classes have beginners buy high quality materials so theyre not for example struggling to blend watercolors when theyre using the same technique as the teacher quite a bit of beginner short comings when it comes to rendering is because theyre using cheap materials and then they get discouraged
  i am intermediate but i have wacom bamboo
  what the fuck does this thread even mean
  it means we style meme
  read the subject
      
  i dont understand your statement
the mind is a playground of the devil    a 16 yearold senior named kyla didnt knew what she had for herself when everything went downhill she goes through a journey where she faces consequences and new discoveries about her self and to test her faith    hi please watch our short film trailer gamay on youtube thank you so much     
10000 usd  get videos that are shorter and of less quality than nma  one three minute critique a week if youre lucky  who would honestly be stupid enough to pay for this
this is cgma btw  theres no personal interaction with my teacher and thats a good thing
  better than schoolism shit   most schoolism couses are shit with weak foundation and reply videos are even shitier   and courses cost like 998 each for like 78 weeks most   which about almost about if not more than this cgma program   i dont know how good these courses are but most cgma instructors are pretty good artist and famous instructors   they seem more professional well structure  nma are just too good for self taught neet though
  cgma  can you save the videos
  doubt it   you can only hope to screenrecord
  cgma has hampton he alone is well worth the price of admission i learned a lot more with him than hours of nma and proko
  i dont think hamptons videos are available there anymore
  could it be that the feedback instructors changed but the videos stay the same   since it would be a waste if hampton just remove them and never post them somewhere else
  this i checked the program and its basically hamptons order
  im not sure exactly what this means but
    so wait  the prerecorded videos are the hampton videos but you pick from the three instructors above to review your work
  there is used to be an hampton analytical figure drawing 1 and 2 course there but now there is none   now there is only 1 analytical figure drawing course but im not so sure if that is the original course
  seems to have the same order as hampton
no torrents for any of these
  there is a mega
  where
  what a god damn scam
  ron lemen is so underrated
  it depends on the teacher i payed for 4 classes on there so far you will get 3 minutes of feedback if you dont do as the teacher asks of you to do for example ron lemen is the strict son of a bitch and demands word for word homework for your own good dont do it get a short critique do it get a 10 minute critique christian nacorda is very lenient on feedback he will give you longer feedback no matter what but asspats no matter what hes also the youngest one there rey bustos is the underrated one on there yet explains things very well and gives the longest feedback unironically     no its the instructors own videos again it depends on the teacher some dont update their prerecorded stuff and others update it each semester it says it right there lectures by x
  even ten minutes of feedback is absurd for that price seriously
  qa is 1 hour you can watch others crits and from what ive found all the beginners have very similar beginner problems everyone makes the same mistakes while in the qa people end up running out of questions to ask because everything has been cleared up in the qa    if you need a crit longer than 10 minutes you either have low iq or just need to draw more its the questions you have that need answering not does my x suck cause of course it sucks you and everyone else taking the class
  whatever you have to tell yourself  t atelier instructor
  yeah and im trumps son
  heres an example
i penciled this piece of the joker for joaquin phoenixs upcoming film colored it in ps    thoughts
  i think that were living in society
  i should laugh but i cried because your art has passed me by
for the drawing nothing much its not a masterpiece but its fine if you keep it up youll be good soon enough    for the coloring though let me give you some advice after scanning in the pencils give them a threshold pass to make them pure black lines then put them on a multiply layer and color on a layer underneath them    never color on the same layer as your linework it will always look awful
  or use the line art as an underdrawing and paint over it
mfw i am ready to render
render that wojak if youre so ready
  what is up with all the prude stuff going on lately why are back in the 90s
  its advertising they need their site to only host advertiser friendly content since almost every site is dependent on it now for income noe
  thats really shitty because it was one of the few websites where sfw and nsfw art could coexist  so twitter and instagram are the best now
wasnt this apples fault or did someone else complained about it
  the fuck can i use for my art then fuck twitter and instagram theres no place as good as tumblr for getting my shit out guess well have to wait till something new pops up to capitalize on this
  wait  nudity found in art such as sculptures and illustrations are also stuff that can be freely posted on tumblr  so all this affects is 3dpd
this is solely apples fault and the appstore why do so many people bow to apple to get in the appstore
  welp  i mean everyone knows that tumblrs been on the decline but this puts the nail in the coffin and digs it another 6 feet under
  they must have reasons if they desperately want to stay in there probably traffic and adrelated
  i mean kids nowadays are literally growing up with goblin porn and are looking for more extreme ways to differentiate themselves from the rest aka are becoming delusional sickos so i guess at least one of the big platforms purged their shit and western twitter will probably follow    nsfw artists will have to find a platform thats dedicated to that kind of content like hentaifoundry or even da not mainstream social media like its kinda surreal that it was even a thing up until now falls into the same hole as pornstars suddenly playing games on twitch its just weird and a huge exploitation
  only lewd art drawn by people who have been dead for at least 100 years counts as real art obviously
  aesthetic nudity not animu porn faggot
so were going back to blogger/blogspot/wordpress   twitter is cool but not good to find stuff in the ephemeral timeline format
  so twitter and instagram are the best now  unfortunately yes also try artstation/deviantart/pixiv/any other platform submit to everywhere and even make your own website
  dont they ban porn too were kind of stuck with twitter since everyone is going there
explains why some anons here never got their accounts unterminated
im gonna have to save a lot of porn like several dozen archives worth
  tumblr is schizoid
why is everyone on twitter blaming apple
  nsfw content scares away advertisers  websites get their revenue from ads  websites ban nsfw content so said advertisers wont get scared off and they dont go bankrupt
  its because tumblr as a platform has been a failure for yahoo and has been making them hemorrhage money ever since they bought it it doesnt help that its the one property yahoo has that actually has a considerable user base and even that is shrinking by the day because tumblr has become more and more of a hassle to use that just cant compete with twitter couple that with apple being prudes and yahoo being desperate for adbux and you have this shit storm of terrible decisions
  because tumblr doesnt want you to think that its their fault  twitter somehow avoided all of these issues and works with apple easypeasy
  100 this  its just yahoo being so desperate its pathetic
  gender confirmation surgery  kek  rot in piss you piece of shit website
  tumblr has become more and more of a hassle to use that just cant compete with twitter  but unless the person is retarded tumblr galleries are really nice and easy to browse when it comes to art twitter is a pain in the ass for looking back through old stuff
  both are terrible
  for now twitter has fuck you momey but even it is at risk first sign of sdvert plaforms jumping ship    open one on twitter da pixiv insta whatever but also have account on the free communities like mastodon these instances are privately managed and decentralized so less chance of it falling due to policies but still possible cause these instances do have admins     always back up your work and if possible have a personal sitem    the western web has become dangerous disgusting place and you should prepare for the worst
    large ios install base and the fact that apple locks their platform down so much means its probably one of the few ways to guarantee your ads arent blocked like you could do on desktop/web browsers and android apps for tumblr    but hey most nsfw artists i know have moved on to twitter anyways and twitters main problem is just an over abundance of unironic actual nazis but that doesnt seem to bother most of the people on this site or even the people who actually run twitter      i have never actually enjoyed the way any art site structures its galleries unless the person posting their work goes the extra mile to organize things in a way that actually takes advantage of said sites extra features which twitter does have as well just nobody bothers with that usually because twitter prioritizes the way it promotes you to other uses based on new posts as opposed to a body of work at the very least twitter does go very much out of its way to help you build an audience if you actually use the site and understand the basics of how its algorithms seem to function      this if youre really serious about hosting your work online nsfw or otherwise always always always make a personal site if you can afford it even just a basic gallery and contact info will get you a long way once you manage to establish yourself
  like its kinda surreal that it was even a thing up until now  my thoughts exactly it would be like if youtube decided to allow porn why no has created a porn version of a social media site is beyond me maybe after twitter does the same some one will get around to making one
  twitter does have as well just nobody bothers with that usually because twitter prioritizes the way it promotes you to other uses based on new posts as opposed to a body of work  does it actually would you be willing to elaborate
  pornstars suddenly playing games on twitch  and making less money than the girls who started on twitch and never did porn what a world why ride a dick for pocket change when you can make bank with a little cleavage
  welp  i was already getting no traction in my tumblr so i guess that does it them  shame cuz i liked posting and talking to people there
  how come there isnt an archiveofourown equivalent for art yet
  females showing reference  kek even references and figure drawing will be banned tumblr is completely dead now
  fuck i meant to write   females showing nipples
  feels good mine was deleted years ago for posting pokemon hentai
  written content such as erotica nudity related to political or newsworthy speech and nudity found in art such as sculptures and illustrations are also stuff that can be freely posted on tumblr    adult content primarily includes photos videos or gifs that show reallife human genitals or femalepresenting nipples and any contentincluding photos videos gifs and illustrationsthat depicts sex acts    so no sex or rl nudity but nudity is ok in art if i get it right
  it has this feature called moments and in that feature you can put more moments moments act as folders basically but you can arrange the tweets there however you want to sadly only vertical you could also use tags and such on your own posts and then provide links that use twitters built in search function of fromtheirminusthe whatever the persons tags or keywords they use are but youre limited in space and also the fact that you cant edit your post to change or add other keywords later its not much but moments is definitely a feature ive seen some japanese artists and western animators use to organize their work separate from the rest of their content of retweeting and food pics and what not    my boyfriend also showed me recently that on your end you can make private lists so that you can organize who you follow into different categories which ive been meaning to go back and do cause im following like a thousand people right now lol      most likely will just be tasteful nudity as in say youre just drawing some naked person standing there or maybe cooking but theyre not engaged in any sexual act or erect or what have you
  i see appreciated anon
  most likely will just be tasteful nudity as in say youre just drawing some naked person standing there or maybe cooking but theyre not engaged in any sexual act or erect or what have you  well its like a monkeys paw thing toc should be explicit as they can be they didnt say anything about it being a specific kind of art so nudity in illustrations should be alright from what they said
  toc  i meant tos
  you know it isnt anon and so do they    sure its vague so what yoy ginna do sue them its a tos they can change it at any time to fit their needs     face it twitter wants to appeal to teenage girls and slags not you
  shit meant tumblr twitter is cool so far
        
  theres no fucking way people are going to go back to newgrounds
  fucking kek
  sure its vague so what yoy ginna do sue them its a tos they can change it at any time to fit their needs  all im saying is that you can technically still post illustrations with nudity if they change it to be more explicit or flag your content as adult youll know what they really mean i never used tumblr so i wouldnt know
    whats wrong with it
  so nudity in art is okay they mean tasteful nudity right  is lewd art still allowed at least or is this china censoring bad
  whoever runs their social media is on the ball
  hentaifoundry already exists
  i give it a month
what the fuck i need a place to post my gay animo stuff 
    absolutely based
  the people are saying its ads but thats not the case with tumblr  the real reasons are   apples app store doesnt allow any apps that provide a way to view porn   tumblr had a huge cp problem and removing the option of uploading anything explicit will get rid of a whole branch of needs for moderation
where the fuck can i go to post loli stuff my hands been itching to draw lolis again but no place will accept it  if i make a website to post lolis will it get deleted too or is it okay to post anything in your websites  i built a wix one sometime ago but never posted anything
  i mean they still have to moderate to get rid of the people posting porn the site is still going to be plagued by porn bots and literal cp i doubt this will do anything to fix it
  they said theyre hiring more human mods to help filter nsfw content
  pixiv retard
  keyword here is reallife    i think theyre shutting down porn bots once and for all while keeping all the fetish western hentais    thats a great thing desu
  no its ads  twitter allows you to share very nsfw stuff no issues
  at this point given the current circumstances i can see newgrounds coming back
  nudity in the context of fine arts is still allowed  my time has come
  fuck dude im posting there
  mastodon
  yes the baraagnet instance officially supports loli i am personally worried about it getting investigated by actual authorities
    it elaborates on artistic nudity right in the same post    not that i think itll help much when all the systems for moderating adult content are usually done with such a broad brush that even 100 sfw blogs will inevitably suffer
itt kiddies upset about not getting cartoon tatas and sausages  you should all be banned
  where do you think you are
  rip 3 and a half years of fanbase building  oh well ill survive i guess
  oh i missed that but yeah its gonna be hard to tell whats considered sfw for artistic reasons and what isnt like this ref for example
  and twitters main problem is just an over abundance of unironic actual nazis but that doesnt seem to bother most of the people on this site or even the people who actually run twitter   you know theres just as many idiots from the other extreme of the political spectrum shitting up things there too right
  im not upset about not getting them just slightly affected by getting deplatformed many of us had our tumblr accounts as our main platform for years im sure most of us had a presence in other places but still tumblr was the most successful one
  kill yourself faggot
  am i the only one that uses piczel tv
degenerates btfo
based newgrounds we never should have left you
deviantart shall rise again
  only for sfw fetish like bondage
  twitter is the last bastion its the last place where artists and normies meet after that theres only specialized sites
  hot
  sites already worse
  squidbiscuit   i see that the degenerate artists are already moving in
pixiv is dying  tumblr is dying    we 00s now      only thing missing is eeryone to go back to angelfire/geicities
  oh great now can i get preached about woke bullshit in both twitter and newsgrounds  its just never gonna end isnt
    literally says illustrations dont be delusional anon
now that social media is going the way of network television will we see a renaissance of the forum and homepage based internet of the 90s
  i pray that this happens
  deviantart only allows softcore tho
  digital artists getting btfo on the daily while i can post this on instagram and nobody cares
  fuccccck most of my following is on tumblr by far /
we need to make our own artsite
  tumblrs not even an art site and art station still exists and its for artists retard
  we already have this one i wouldnt mind not having the degeneracy of the alt/porn threads though make this a proper traditional painting forum good riddance
  having a free pass for being a nigger isnt something you brag about
  artstation is for industry artists working on big shit retard  it also lacks a bunch of features that make for a good art site
  front page is for industry artists because theyve made it get good and do something worthy of the front page then instead of your shitty hentai that youre clearly complaining about because youre in this dumb thread
just
  pixiv is dying  tumblr is dying  we 00s now    newgrounds is back
  newgrounds needs to merge with picarto
when people talk about mastodon  do they mean pawoo are there decent western instances
  what happened to pixiv
  site owners are retarded and keep locking shit behind payment and keep redesigning the site every other month to be worse which is driving off people  japs are also hilariously xenophobic and many have stopped using pixiv because western artists started using it
  i dont think you can post uncensored stuff there anyway
honestly loving this less cumbrains on that site now
  keep locking shit behind payment  deviantart did the same but worse
  this
  japs are also hilariously xenophobic and many have stopped using pixiv because western artists started using it    yep also japs are paranoidly not capable to handle the competition
  we need to make our own artsite    the reason why tumblr and twitter was so great for artists is because theyre not artsites
  not using a paid plataform and not one that relies in ads  ngmi
  they mean baraagnet most likely pawoo is pixiv so it has weird censorship rules
  thats fucking retarded
  how fucking dumb are you tumblr and twitter are good because its flooded with different types of people who use it for different reasons so it has a way bigger audience then something like pixiv which is solely for artists its also made to spread shit around with likes reblogs retweets ect so even more people will find your shit then just a page dedicated to you like pixiv hentaifoundry or deviant art which are all also artist focused websites  use your goddamn brain for a second and you wouldnt have to be told something so obvious you mouth breather
  same here anon    tumblr fucking up big time guess its time to go back to da and ng and so on
  he thinks da only allows softcore  you literally steal art and say you stole it in the picture description and nothing absolutely n o t h i n g will happen to you even if a gorillion people report your shit  you can upload copyrighted porn even with a watermark and again nothing will happen  you can upload straight up furry porn or dick pics or spam like a billion poos in loos do already and again nothing will happen    da is less moderated than 4chan and thats not a joke or exaggeration
  its also made to spread shit around with likes reblogs retweets ect so even more people will find your shit  which is why trying to find artists and art you want is like searching for a needle in a haystack right retard  these sites also regularly fuck with artists and delete their work or accounts so artist friendly amirite
twitters feed goes too fast theres no archive and the image compression is horrid and the thumbnail previews always cut off  pixiv is jap oriented and has almost compulsory censorship  hentaifoundry is slow and sluggish and has huge waiting times for submissions to be accepted low userbase and dead ugly 90s looking forums  mastodon is not big enough  newgrounds is literally a site for teenagers that the average nonartist person doesnt browse  deviantart is just a dead shithole that doesnt allow nsfw but literally has its main page plagued with diaper bbw crap  instagram is sfw only and has terrible image compression issues as well    worst time for nsfw artists to make a living rn theres literally no good platform anymore
what about paheal
  too true
  its only digital porn artist that are affected by this
   is not big enough  precisely why more people need to migrate there
  porn roboblogs are a huge problem on tumblr
  what is charging furries mad dollar to draw their shitty oc on patreon
  japs are also hilariously xenophobic and many have stopped using pixiv because western artists started using it  to be fair the 95 of the western art i see there is genuine deviant art tier garbage its embarrassing
thats a big oof from me senpai
  newgrounds doesnt support loli so pick your poison the argument is because theyre worldwide now and have to because its law in some countries but that just means its gonna go to shit in the future too
whats twitters official stance on lewdness ive seen a fair amount of explicit loli/shota stuff there from japanese twitters with thousands of likes/retweets i guess people there are less sensitive about that stuff and dont report
  my art has been deleted on it for having an erect dick lol
  worst time for nsfw artists to make a living rn theres literally no good platform anymore    fucking finally the market is saturated with you disgusting fucks and your degenerate artwork
  you can upload straight up furry porn or dick pics or spam like a billion poos in loos do already and again nothing will happen      dicks will get you banned on da
  oh no stock went from roughly 53 bucks down to 51 how tragic
  livestreaming is great picarto and picarto keeps growing and pic    stream commissions are the next paradigm shift
  furaffinity artists still making money despite having a small website
  seconded
  pixiv is good in terms of content but yeah you have to show some signs of censorship attempt natives deal with it a bit harder i literally put like a 5x5px red heart over a clitoris or a small black line     dont take my word for it but others have said they dont give very many shits about consistency if youre clearly in the west just do something even if its almost nothing    also make mastodon great
  two threads on other boards although i guess both are faster boards than /ic/    
  ive been posting on pixiv for years now with not censorship and so far everything is good ive heard that if you do get noticed they just send you a message saying pleas start censoring so its not that bad
  well fuck  does anybody knows about some good tumblr image extractor or something
  my main reason for censoring is so people realize were trying to fit in and it doesnt cause xenophobic culture shock i think itll impact you if youre really big only its still hands down the best site when it comes to politics and probably even fanbase growth
  this works  
  yeah but i see no reason why you would even want to associate with the japs or not upset them i guess they wont give you money anyway
  tumblripper
why is there no consensus between nsfw artists to move to mastodon yet it seems to be the only thing with some potential that still has a normie population
  because twitter exists
  they give money if you offer avenues for it fantia and enty are their patreon things i think fantia is more artistically free too     even then a huge percentage of users are western both western and eastern people seem to appreciate my efforts about the same east just a little quieter about it due to language barriersor so they think because i can into runes a bit
      neat gonna check them out
  i dont know i know japanese too and i used to post in japanese back then and one time i got asked for a commission and when i told the guy in japanese that i was a westerner he deleted his massage and unfollowed
ive seen a chinese bootleg tumblr that had copied all its basic functions and layouts whilst searching for art but i imagine its heavily censored and you seemed to need an account to view full blogs so you probably have to give them your mobile number and location like with weibo
  sorry to hear i know theres shitheads on there but ive been lucky enough not to encounter any yet    ive seen them harass other users though
well this certainly explains a lot
  the thing is tumblr was the porn social media
  twitter has larger reach by an order of magnitude and literally allows anything unless incredibly obscene you can even get away with loli if played right and currently mastodon featured quite limited and dont replicate twitter well at all    and its certainly not used by normies unless you want to melt their brain trying to explain to them how decentralized networks work and why their posts dont appear on certain places
  real life has nothing to do with this anon it is abut advertising and and the legality that requires remember these things are never about real life people they are about numbers an legal texts
im not a porn artist but what is a good place to learn japanese so i can start using pixiv
coincidence
  you dont need to know japanese to use it
  mastodon  i just looked at it and im probably moving there desu    i dont even do nsfw but it looks like the right place to post art and it has a tagging  reblogging system which is all you need to get exposure
  posting a pair of tits is wrong    mutilating a babys genitals isnt
  mastodon  whats up with this app shit phone posting is bullshit i would use it if i didnt need a phone
  this is why we need to make our own website
  that was my first thought too  newgrounds always struck me as that flash game/toon site
  you dont moron how do people like you even function
i feel like i did a huge mistake like i missed the wave i was posting on pixiv up until now because i wanted to sort things out and like have enough time to post consistently so i was waiting until my real job  hours where ok i was going to start a tumblr and start posting this winter and now its over i feel like only people who got a following from tumblr will follow them on other places in significant numbers  is it over i just wanted to start doing some cheap commissions and get started fucking hell it feels like furry is unironically the only option left to start out now
  oh wait i think i found the non phone version
heh
  the first site that comes up when you look it up is a phone app site with no link to the other one
  honestly ya just tried it out and its just right for art
  oh okay i thought it might help at least to better understand the website and so that i can make real connections with my followers when i move to the site it would be nice to make a few manga artist friends on the site
    mastodon  theyre super procensorship though just look at their code of conduct        its obviously meant for apps which makes it shit for every normal use
  wow thats really dumb but they allow porn to be posted as long as its tagged so really its just tumblr before the shit storm
    pornhub  pornhub  pornhub    it has the most normies and youre shit wont get censored and your animations will get millions of views
  from what i can tell here they just want u to tag shit so it seems okay
does pillowfort allow for nsfw
   tumblr had a huge cp problem  what ive been using tumblr for a while and never heard of this unless you meant loli/shota
  toms going to have to pay for a fuckton more server space for ng to sustain all the new 10 year old bugeyed beanmouth spam only for 90 of them to leave in 3 months
mfw seeing all the fucking roasties commemorating this  i see something deserving an actual fucking purge
  anyone wanna bet wed get an ao3 equivalent for tumblr before the end of december
    twitter nazis they exist but they have to be crypto about it if they want their account to stay up  nevermind the mob of people with literal hammers and sickles in their names who only have to conceal threats of violence if even that   okay at that point it just comes down to who bothers you more
  i havent seen 1 person like this even the liberal people i follow on twitter dont like this
blogging        gallery hosting  
  nah its not just loli/shota stuff there are a few western tumblr users that draw cp of characters from western cartoons i dont get involved with this type of drama but i remember seeing some call out posts on twitter of some artists calling out tumblr cp artists
  its a free market its not like the gubbernment is doing cencorship you can literally found your own website and post your shit there literally nobody forces you to use one of the top 50 normie social media websites to spread degeneracy and its their very right to add a guideline that prohibits porn and enforcing it how they want
  ive seen several several fucking roasties
  no one gives a shit    go start your own bank then faggot
  no one gives a shit  okay then why not stop complaining
  because no one is complaining about their rights being violated corporate censorship is still a form of censorship and anyone who doesnt like censorship doesnt look corporate censorship this is not rocket science
  it could just be lots of people on tumblr that dont like loli and dont mind the collateral damage to purging all nsfw on the site   then again if roasties were particularly antiloli thatd make sense considering that theyd probably hate younger women in general for not having blown the fuck out genitals
  cp means photos/videos of actual children you tard western drawings of western fictional underage characters still fall under the loli/shota category
  post screenshots the only people i would assume be against porn are people who think its the devil
  i mean look at how many retards in this thread are happy about this and calling porn artists degenerates     the only people i would assume be against porn are people who think its the devil    well they literally think its the jews and their world domination master plan so
  95 of the western art i see there is genuine deviant art tier garbage    i would say 80 of the japanese art is too
  yamero    i like newgrounds and would like to see it hold on to a good chunk of its new userbase when its been on the precipice of disaster for well over a decade i must say its interface does seem a bit dated and claustrophobic though and wonder if people will find it appealing enough to stay long term
  okay my bad yeah tumblr has a bad loli/shota problem but it doesnt have any cp on it at least that know about
  i agree but there is a level of quality japanese typically meet much better than westerners maybe its also because compared to deviantart theres no third world faggots uploading memes and other garbage like renders or transparents
  twitter is too big to fuck with  all the celebrities and even trump use it as their main way of communicating with the public its a rare scenario where apple is the little guy/low man on the totem pole and not having twitter in their app store would actually impact their marketability
  what ive gathered from the discussion surrounding this recent tumblr retardation is that they actually had real cp as well which was a big part of the problem not sure who to believe because i only ever used tumblr to dump my anime tiddy drawings and didnt bother with the rest of that shithole
  true japanese artists always upload work that looks like a finished thhing on pixiv i dont see them rarely ever upload wips or unfinshed work even if its not the best drawn they make sure to finish it
  thats a specific mastodon instance that you should avoid but thats not mastodon itself just join a nonshitty instance like pawoo and youll have no problems
followed 20 different nsfw artists on there  now theyre all breaking off onto different sites now     how annoying now i gotta go make a twitter account to follow half these people
  i think he means how theyre fucked for phone surfing if you phone surf they try to make it so you cant reblog/like or message people unless youre using the app and if youre using the app you cant use archive mode    that and how they kept fucking with their algorithm to hide nsfw content unless you turned it off in the settings and then theyd turn it back on without asking you to be helpful and improve your experience and then they implemented the best stuff first policy which was sort of the same thing as the last example    plus the stupid way you log in where they started trying to get you to have a confirmation code sent to your email instead of entering a password for some idiotic reason
  its a free market its not like the gubbernment is doing cencorship  wrong actually financial institutions like banks paypal etc threaten noservice to force websites to comply with their demands and those institutions are monopolies thanks to government backing and extreme levels of bureaucracy that prevent competitors emerging
  the ads control almost if not all the free part of the internet
  there is its called fetlife theres a few others too like whiplr or the gay specific ones like hotbottomsnet or spankthishookups theres a few other ones too but those are the best
  you can literally found your own website    except you need to go through domain hosts and registrars which are also private companies     the reality of the situation is that the entire internet can only be accessed through and runs on private companies you are at the mercy of         whats this about pixiv censoring stuff ive never heard of that before
  yeah no lots of muh child pornography muh revenge porn happy with this as well you also forget how many libertarians exist on /pol/
  old old draconian law japan wont remove that requires all genitals be censored like porn kiosks on the vegas strip the reason javs are pixelated garbage and doujins have hilarious censorship attempts but you dont need to try very hard
  its a free market  he asked why theyre doing it not why theyre allowed therea a difference between those and saying they can do whatever they want doesnt actually answer the first question
  financial institutions like banks paypal etc threaten noservice to force websites to comply with their demands  who says cartoon porn sites have to cooperate with banks and for what reason
  the internet is open you can just setup a web server and build a site that anybody from anywhere around the world can access merely by typing an ip in the addres bar youre not at the mercy of other parties also domain registrars rarely give a shit about what youre actually hosting on your site
  great so now newgrounds can have a bunch of newfag tumblr niggers
  apparently they were the ones calling to shut it down to begin with     also shit nigga lets be real newgrounds probably had a userbase well under a few thousand people by this pointif it even had that one way or another this is for the best im just hoping i dont see tom become a cuck in my lifetime seeing schmorky turn into a tranny diaperfag rapist pedophile was hard enough
  if there was real cp its fair that they get rid of it and purge it off the site but to block all nsfw content is going a little to far instead of just hiring a team to moderate and look out for real cp on the site and report it to the police
    its the foregone and logical conclusion of political correctness and social justice
  more so because other sites already exist where people already had accounts before like pixiv and twitter
  wow youre an actual fucking idiot
  hes right
  get an argument sjw
  y tho  social justice types dont like sexualized representations of femininity in media and dont like the male gaze i wouldnt take it for granted as some kind of fact that all leftists love freedom to make the kind of art you want
  why do people keep repeating this idiocy how are you gonna find clients from an obscure as fuck site the point of posting on these ultrapopular sites is to get as many people to check out your work
  you cant blame the eradication of nsfw on leftists either this was decided by apple execs and advertising companies could have some old conservative asshole
    this is one of the kinds of shit that both mudslimes neoradfems and /pol/tards agree with we are literally against the 3 most radicalized groups in the world
  the only leftists who arent sex positive these days are the radfems who get along better with right wingers
  lefties bitching about muh objectification or literal child porn because of naked nintendo squids are partially responsible because theyre loud and capitalistic executive fucks listen to them they both suck
liberal capitalists get the bullet too
  you realize that the child porn tumblr was worried about was actual real children right
  if only those groups actually were consistent but im not referring to them specifically anyways im talking about as an existence on most popular social media theyre the same as the massreporting alt right faggots with roman statues for icons
  if something happened i dont like its because of sjws    banning porn and criminalizing masturbation etc has always been in the wheelhouse of old white conservatives     the ones /pol/tards think they worship but reeeee when they get a taste
the side which fought for the sexual liberation are now acting like modern puritans    dumb hypocritical white liberals
  capitalism is good you retarded faggot
  sexual liberation when it suits women puritanism when it harms men
i seriously hope you tremendous retards are not going to migrate to twitter  they dont even host the original file like tumblr after they removed datatumblr_raw    use a website that respects you and your art  spoiler none exist build your own website
  this   these are the same people that said to stop fucking your husbands if they vote for trump and stuff like that
  newgrounds does    i can tell because when you click on a piece you cant see shit because its so fucking enormous
  capitalism also brings pedro and his 50 filthy spawns to america thanks raising up costs    enjoy lying on the bed you made /pol/turd scum
cant wait for the next big site the current choices now are trash
lots of people are actually creating ng account  come on people dont be that desperate
  i have been on ng for a while and its a nice site never had a problem with them
  the only argument for communism is that it will inevitably destroy the economy and make the country inhospitable and/or unappealing to the swathes of people youd otherwise be demanding immediate safe passage into your wifes bedroom for were you not arguing with me now    kys yourreself commie brainlet lmao
  their art vanguard are very much against photography and especially work containing photographic elements    my glitch art got removed because of that
  glitch art     and nothing of value was lost
  reeee im being oppressed by the jews  oh i know better fight back by supporting the system that allow jews to fuck whiteys over with    go slurp the semen from trumpbergs cock you worm
  theyd probably hate younger women in general for not having blown the fuck out genitals  thats not how vaginas work
   glad my only notable presence exists on da
  twitter and pixiv
i fucking hate twitter but it will have to do it feels more impersonal and cluttered i liked the ask box on tumblr and the recommendations so many were on point
  what is up with all the prude stuff going on lately    people are saying its about advertisers but thats really not tracing the problem all the way back to its roots studies show that millenials are having a lot less sex than previous generations too and thats not the fault of advertisers its a combination of rising obesity rates and feminism imo the majority of western women now are overweight and 40 are obese and theyre mostly feminists who resent men and are angry that men dont want to fuck them porn triggers them
  yeah no a lot of artists like to post sketches in fact theres a japanese tag for it and it has 32000 hits
  dont kid yourself pixiv is still very very active most jap artists have a pixiv account and they use the site to post uncompressed versions of images that they post on twitter since the latter artifacts the fuck out of them even with the orig trick
  what site are they using instead asking for a friend
  senpai how retarded are you people arent having sex or babies because its too fucking expensive for both women are having plenty of sex tho
time for all you faggots to get a job i hear mcdonalds is hiring or wendys     with all the time you idiots wasted on your careers these jobs are perfect for you
  which is why trying to find artists and art you want is like searching for a needle in a haystack right retard  generally artists who have a twitter post it as a link in every other site they have like tumblr and pixiv if you know an artist you can find their twitter usually the benefit of twitter is the exposure getting retweeted means everyone who follows that person will see your stuff so if youre starting out its very helpful to tag your stuff and draw some popular character so the big artists notice you and retweet you so that you get a bunch of followers  these sites also regularly fuck with artists and delete their work or accounts so artist friendly amirite  tumblr does right now obviously but not twitter which even allows loli
  youre deluded people are having fewer babies because babies are expensive were purchasing houses later as well if everyone is fat people will lower their standards enough to fuck since everyone is the same
  this has no effect on artists doing well on patreon whatsoever    furthermore you can still crop porn and link to full image
  twitter will remove loli if it gets mass reported
   is jap oriented and has almost compulsory censorship  you can just ignore it its really not that big of a deal in fact most western artists on pixiv dont even censor their stuff and its how you can identify them right away
should i pick baraag or pawoo
  that its worldwide study that when people have a higher standard of living they have less children or no children
  baraag has a western community pawoo has a lot more but theyre all japanese    you can follow pawoo users from baraag and vice versa if they see you retweeted/boosted but not on a local timeline or anything
  women wont fuck me so that means women arent fucking anyone
  feminists who resent men and are angry that men dont want to fuck them porn triggers them  that pure unadulterated projection kino
  sometimes i feel like you fags make up these things  oh yeah i have a wabumabu and doobiewoomie account too
  straight off their tumblr page   q in light of tumblr now no longer allowing adult content like nsfw art/pictures will pillowfort still allow nsfw content as long as it is properly marked because that decision has pretty much destroyed my already little faith in tumblr    a yes we plan to allow nsfw content with very few restrictions i dont have any particular insight into why tumblr is making this decision but if i had to guess its because allowing nsfw content conflicts with their need for the site to be marketable and safe for advertisers pillowfort on the other hand plans to derive most of its revenue from user subscriptions meaning that we will be beholden to our actual userbase and not outside advertisers and can therefore have more leeway in what we can host
  anon you cant expect an incel who jacks it to cp to know what a womans vagina is like pls be considerate
  studies show that blablablah shit i made up   women wont have sex with me so i will pretend it is me who wont have sex with then
  theres an english option pretty much all you need to know for the sake of making sure your art reaches as many people that is are the japanese names of the tags related to your work like character names and stuff its not hard to find them and copypaste them especially with all the english submissions on the site that often also have japanese tags inside
i hope tumblrites dont swarm /ic now but tumblr already sucked for nsfw shit because you had to make an account and log in to be able to view feeds with lewds
  lol
  tumblr already sucked for nsfw shit because you had to make an account and log in to be able to view feeds with lewds  dont tell me this actually stopped you
  hypocrite you blame someone for thinking its the sjws while at the same time you assume this is because of the other side of the spectrum    do some research this is because of apple not liking tumblrs porn bot accounts that plague the site california is cracking down on this too with sony would you say california is conservative come on
  wabumabu and doobiewoomie accounts when
  yeah no  
  just a small fyi stocks will go up and down after any announcement a company makes good or bad you have to wait until the end of the next quarter to see how bad this will affect their stock i see people always posting shit like this when its not accurate
  twitter is good for exposure and due to that its the reason most artists are there people tend to have another account where they post their uncompressed art like pixiv which they have a link to in their profile description    newgrounds doesnt allow loli and the site has server issues now imagine all the tumblr porn userbase going there tom fulp is gonna have to eat leaves tomorrow
  picked both thx anon   i kinda hope baraag stays small so tumblrfags dont try to call it a place for pedos and get it shut down
  its advertising the whole reason tumblr did this is because apple threatened them due to the porn bots plaguing the site nowadays so tumblr panicked and did this drastic measure
  its surprisingly full of them but they all have the special interest to keep safe digging drawings of little boys and girls so i guess enemy of my enemy etc etc
  what is it with you people thinking that people only use one website people posted their tumblr stuff on 4chan all the fucking time and even the ones that didnt just posted it on other sites like twitter and pixiv
  a bunch of comments on a fucking news article from normalfags laughing about some shitty ecchi game nobody cares about not being allowed on playstation   this was your leading example  embarrassing
made a pastebin to help artists migrate and pick a new host any suggestions are welcome    
  people who use roastie dont actually think that being a slut makes your genitals roast beef its a funny thing to call retards like this  when their labia gets in a knot when someone is flinging around incel as an unironic insult you know youre dealing with a salty cunt
  oh shit better start stockpiling on lewd tutorials before they go away forever
  god bless you anon thank you
  s just an over abundance of unironic actual nazis    you say this like its a bad thing never mind the other side of the political spectrum literally calling for the genocide of white people the nazis have to constantly be coy about their speech less someone doxxes them then starts harassing their workplace and families
  muh free market    fuck off lolberg this is why nobody takes your shitty ideology seriously anymore all you do is suck corporate cock
  it was tumblr ages ago
  saw this for things related to loli/shota which obviously means nsfw is allowed    
  sometimes it did yes because i hardly ever went to tumblr and could never remember the password to my dummy account and couldnt be bothered to look it up so i just said fuck it its like when im trying to creep on someone on facebook and they want me to log in to view their photos fuck that shit
    actual nazis just mean white people who dont want to become minorities in their own homes and obviously that was always going to be a repercussion of floods of brown welfare parasites into white countries
  trips of truth
          third position is best position you fucking losers     ein volk ein reich ein führer
ids habbening ddd
  fug
  thank you added e621 hiccears and commiss
  twitter has non stop blatant antiwhite rhetoric from verified users and has begun purging people for not conforming to the new infinite gender fad and youre worried about an abundance of nazis its amazing to see people living in totally different realities i feel like im popping in and out of different dimensions sometimes
  youre fucking retarded if you havent seen the nazi communities on twitter the fact that both sides scream about how much twitter sucks proves that its not that biased one way or another
  the fall and rise of newgrounds    i wish tom would release an archive with all flash animations    tfw watching final fantasy sonic x and sonic quest for power back in 2006    fuck i want to go back
      i cant wait until the white genocide happens so you can finally shut the fuck up
  this
  if you do then please upload that shit to mega or somewhere else later
  show me the verified users who proclaim to be nazis or call for the erasure of jews or whatever
  so you can finally shut the fuck up  because all the niggers will be dead and ill have nothing to complain about
  youre first
  im part jew so i get a free ride on whatever side i choose p p p p
oh will somebody please think of the poor nazis they just want to kill billions in peace   what a direction for a thread about tumblr to turn lol     is right though white genocide is a good thing so we dont have to hear nazis whine anymore if they want to be the victims so bad then let them be they deserve it
  sjws have been against lewd for fucking years now its a long running joke that they have become the new puritans in their quest to delete everything thats problematic or objectifying newsflash its not the fucking ebil old white males who demand that your videogame titties get censored its the ones calling themselves progressives its a fucking clown world and theres nothing we can do to change it
funny how conservative feminists like andrea dworkin were actually ahead of their time
  whats ironic is most of them like looking at porn but at the same time do that
  system that allow jews to fuck whiteys over with  posting marx while posting that  you retards havent openend a single history book in your entire fucking lives have you
   will somebody please think of the poor nazis they just want to kill billions in peace     legit nazi here at least by modern definitions would call myself an ethnic nationalist dont want to kill anyone just want to have the right to live in peace without people persecuting me for my skin colour and what my ancestors did a couple hundred years ago    i believe every ethnic group has the right to establish and maintain a state where that ethnic groups interests are put at the absolute forefront of policy making both economically and socially i dont support genocide or ethnic cleansing i dont support imperialism colonisation jingoism or interventionism i support the idea of peoples choice to live within a multiethnic/multicultural state if they want but dont force me states run better in peace time with open international markets    most people including myself who identify as le ebil nazbis and arent just edgy highschoolers used to be just flat out libertarians but you get labelled a fascist for having libertarians ideas in the modern day just please leave me my loved ones and my money the fuck alone    hurr durr but the only reason you have money is becuz muh white pepol colonisation  the earliest and most prolific colonisers in the world were spain and portugal  borderline bankrupt with massive civil unrest  country which was very late to colonisation and then got its empire dismantled twice and bombed into absolute oblivion less than a century ago germany biggest economy in the eu now  countries with almost no colonial history denmark sweden finland and norway some the richest and nicest places to live in the entire world
  the issue is that complaining about muh nazis on twitter while completely ignoring the literal fucking marxists who openly fantasize about gulags and killing people really reveals where your priorities lie
  well the whole reason the app was taken off of the apple store was because of actual child porn that slipped through the filters
  the reason is porn there was a negligible amount of cp if any but porn  even adult porn  is not advertiser friendly
  lmao were going to get rid of all the minorities by just asking them nicely 
  can you fucking mouthbreathers discuss anything without strawmanning
      tumblrs app vanished from apples app store on friday and on monday it was revealed that it was taken down because child pornography had been slipping past its security safeguards
someone should get a bunch of the nsfw tutorials on tumblr and make a pastebin/mega of them id do it myself but im having no luck since i lost my account
  ethnic cleanse yourself
  i said i didnt support genocide or ethnic cleansing im open to expulsion if people dont leave    im also open to living with minorities granted they accept they will be given no representation in government and no say in policy making they are free to enjoy the prosperity of the state and contribute to the prosperity of the state i wouldnt stop them from doing that but if they want representation go to a multiethnic state or their own ethnic state
  so i guess thats your answer then
  this is so cute meanwhile whites are getting outbred hard everywhere leading to less representation everywhere muslims trans etc are actually starting to get representation in politics  liberal universalism will only intensify
  what will you do when theres no more whites paying for your shit
  doesnt concern me whites have always been a minority in terms of total world population people like the kurds are basically being genocided on all sides for decades now with the world absolutely refusing to recognise their ethnostate but theyre still going strong
  is that the only retort you npcs always have you arent paying shit got a job
  can we talk about tumblr alternatives now grandma
  go on npc
    nno you guys are the real npcs  like clockwork
  twitter do save the original size theres an extension for that too
pixiv is still alive    not a single fuck was given that day    hard to feel anything when my dashboard been dead years before this announcement
  kek made me chuckle
    is there a mobile app for baraag or just mastodon in general im aware pawoo has its own app linked to pixiv but im really lost with these websites
  do not use twitter for anything besides promoting yourself or talking with fans it is extremely likely to crack down on adult content in the near future  you can hide your nsfw content in privatter its a 3rd party site you can link to twitter
  why the fuck are fat enabling tumblr and the generic sjw trash is still on tumblr the fucking piece of shits
  whoa now billy
  monopolies are a result of free market but not of the gov intervention in the market  lol
what about vkcom
  tfw your anatomy is too bad to be liked on newgrounds or hentaifoundry and tumblr would have been your only outlet
  lmao freemarket capitalism is literally the worst system for corporations that depend on the state to thrive
  fucking kek
man i feel like the whole internet is changing whats the big deal is there something going on relating about ads first 4chan splitting into two and now tumblr banning nsfw
  platforms dont want any nsfw shit on their sites because corporations get intimidated and dont wanna run ads on nsfw content be it porn gore or just adult oriented themes in general and when corporations threaten to pull their ads sites go into panic mode like tumblr did and delete everything nsfw because they are after the big revenue bux that they can only get by corporate ads
tumblrs post even got flagged

  lmfao
  trans is a race now
i have a qualm with college none of the professors are any good let alone draw or do a real demo ive literally never had a art teacher in college do a demo anyway each semester i take classes for my art degree and each semester i get more and more disappointed with college heres a little story about my figure drawing teacher demoing  take figure drawing class from different teacher at college  first teacher just sat there didnt draw the whole semester and would walk around the room once saying something like more shadows  its 4 weeks into the class and not one demo  at this point i just watch jeff watts on youtube and study everything he does and says i can tell im making progress because of this  teacher stops class and tells us to gather round  i think oh shit a demo finally  he literally goes outside and picks up a stick comes back and dips the stick in ink  literally tells a student to set a timer on his phone to 5 seconds5 seconds  tells him to start timer  he begins drawing really fast with the stick  timer ends   he holds up a shittily drawn what i thought was a foot but it was the human form  says this is what you can accomplish in 5 seconds if you put your mind to it  class goes oooo wow oooooo  tfw i realize im surrounded by npcs and college is a meme  the only thing keeping me from dropping out are the degenerate fuckable art girls ok your turn anons
even the art teachers i had at community college were pretty good they have plenty of demos and genuinely tried to be good teachers and they were good artists themselves maybe youre just at a bad school
  t projecting npc
  be me  be neet  drawing everyday   didt fall for college meme  making gains everyday  best life
  dont blame us for your shitty life decisions
all those tattoos    ruined
  literally projecting blame and bad life decisions not going to make it anon
ive had 3 art professors   first was mandatory art class for my cs degree but i opted into the intro to art for art majors for fun was very artsy everything is art type bullshit which made assignments fairly easy but she still expected you to be able to put in the work and technical skill behind it or she would knock your grade down hard she never really demoed except to give us a quick idea what we were supposed to be doing nothing impressive because it was all fundamental practices   she did stage painting or whatever its called for outside stuff though it was good but its stage painting which is already limited in scope so im not sure of her abilities and never really gave a shit to find out    had a second class i took for fun waste of time learned nothing and did nothing but a rehash of the first class only worse teacher was a grad student who didnt want to be there    last class was a full time drawing course for people who wanted to draw but werent art majors didnt count as a credit so everyone there wanted to draw but kinda sucked   it was kinda the same deal as the first teacher not many demos because every project was life drawing or a full on project so he couldnt really show it much he put on proko and a few other youtube videos to show us how to contour draw and basic gestures and he did do a few examples but it was much more an experience class where we were forced to do life drawing and he gave us really good critiques afterwards it was probably the most productive thing ive done in terms or skill because of how much life drawing it was and how solid his advice and critiques were   i looked him up after he mostly does meme sculptures and some are decent the few drawings i saw were decent nothing amazingly impressive but decent enough to get a job   i really enjoyed his class though im a bit sad he got fired though because the art department downsized
  yeah it has to be a bad school first day the professor tells the class i shit you not dont try to get me fired its literally impossible to get fired here
  youre gonna make it
  when i first started drawing i emailed my community colleges drawing teacher for help he set up a meeting with me gave me a rundown of basic techniques and terms gave me some fundamentals to work on and then ended the whole thing by letting me borrow his own earmarked textbook for the drawing class i went back a couple of months later to return it and he critiqued some of my art and then pointed me to some online resources and tutorials that i hadnt been able to find on my own ive emailed him a few times since whenever i wanted advice or critique and hes delivered every time dudes really cool and one of the biggest reasons i even kept drawing
  a good gesture can say a lot about an artists skill it can also be completely misunderstood by amateurs its hard to be sure unless you post a pic of the teachers piece or your own work anon
  npcs  college is a meme  it is you who is retarded dont blame your school
  t npc
majoring in btech  draw on my own time  draw daily  loomis books are my professor  real life observation is my inspiration
pyw you sound very over confident and you are most likely dunning kruger the fact you are even going to this school without any research or forethought says a lot about youre character if you dont like something just stop doing it if you dont like the college just drop out and learn on your own instead sticking around and growing more and more bitter its not that difficult to understand
  do you not know how to read faggot literally the teachers dont fucking demo its all all art has merit bullshit so theres not critiques with skilled people the teachers dont draw or show you their work how the fuck do i know if they know what theyre doing even jeff watts talks about how most professors dont know what the fuck theyre doing and sit on their laurels because they have a degree i mean they could have gotten an art degree making shit pies that represent the existential crisis of humanity then they go to teach an a figure drawing class also you are suffering from cognitive dissonance the tell is you thinking you know what other people think fucking kys cleft lipt third world nosed fedora tipping anal extrusion cuck
  the teachers dont demo  and so what theyre not there to show you theyre there to teach you and for retarded beginners like yourself you need to be drawing it doesnt matter what but drawing a few cubes in perspective isnt something worth demoing about obviously they can draw or they wouldnt of been hired its not like artists can pick and choose any job they want and the stable well paying job of a professor is something only the worst of the worst want    post your art kiddo
  this would even be a retarded reply on plebbit please go back
life drawing time is time well spent seems to be the takeaway here not really interested in bashing art professors anymore than im interested in hating modern art
  the guy said post your art
   teacher just sat there didnt draw the whole semester  he literally goes outside and picks up a stick comes back and dips the stick in ink  literally tells a student to set a timer on his phone to 5 seconds5 seconds    yeah he knows hes terrible at drawing and has major imposter syndrome thats why hes using the stick and keeping his drawing to 5 seconds  so that when it sucks he has plausible deniability because hes using shit tools and only spending 5 seconds on it he wants you to imagine that his drawing would actually be amazing if he used a real tool and spent some time on it     theres a reason art school is considered a meme hope youre not spending money on it
  its not that expensive i figure i can get a degree out of it at least thanks for understanding its like most the people on this board are cock sucking faggots who lick anyones boots that have any sort of authority
     its like most the people on this board are cock sucking faggots     the point of this board is to shit on everything including stories about terribad art teachers nothing personnel
  tips fedora
  are your retarded my post in no way encouraged you to stay at the art school and i wasnt defending it my post was more about how you act  the fact you are even going to this school without any research or forethought says a lot about youre character  what im saying here is that you didnt look up the teachers or students work before you went you just went to it you didnt inspect the quality or look for alternative ways of learning art you didnt go to an atelier or trade school like cda or brainstorm you just sit in your bitterness and let it fester in no way was i defending art school it does sound pretty shitty but you sound like you fit right in as a shitty dunning kruger faggot also i like how you still havent posted your work you brain dead over pompous shit lord
  my art teacher at the community college i went to before i knew what i wanted to do was qt lil redhead with a killer body
  honestly she has an amazing body  why do women do that to themselves to get back at daddy
  research only goes so far the same fucking retards oooing and aweing over the 5 second stick demo are the same ones writing reviews on how great the retard professor is also you keep projecting kruger really makes me think
  sorry but have you posted your art yet    nobody is going to buy how super skilled you are unless you prove us wrong    it sounds like the professor did a gesture drawing and youre literally such a brainlet you are incapable of seeing what he did   i went to college and hte professor drew stick figures what a scam
  where did i say i was super skilled again showing you have cognitive dissonance you fucking dumb shitskin nice plebbit spacing as well abruptly kys
  genius level post anon   post your work
  im too good for the shitty program i got accepted into  then why didnt you get accepted into a better program
    not him but i dont even have to see your work to know what level youre at    it sounds like the professor did a gesture drawing    wew
sounds normal most of what college was was heres your assignment little individual talks while working everyone shows work and class critiques theres not a whole lot of hard knowledge in art
im an ee junior but i draw anime in my notebook during lecture i dont know how to draw anything but head  neck  shoulders profiles  looking at and drawing cute animes helps keep me sane when learning electric circuit theory and design
  theres not a whole lot of hard knowledge in art    theres vast amounts of it actually
  was in some bullshit art foundations class   like maybe 12 people in that class  turns our the professor has maybe been in america for like 3 weeks  shes saudia arabian   cant understand a fucking word she says  mumbles color preference over and over  dropped that class so fast
which one should i get the new ipad or huion or xppen any recommendations or suggestions going from non screen to screen
i have a gt191v2 and i love it it depends on what do you need to do anyways
  i just need a replacement from my nonscreen it doesnt have to be mobile since i will use it at my home desktop all the time
glass screens are more slippery so you either need to get used to it or get a matte protector if you want to use it at home only then theres really no point to go ipad though you may end up appreciating the mobile benefit worth noting theres not a good way to use it as a cintiq unless your own a mac anyway    so for you i think id prefer go xp pen ive heard good things and i think its still on sale
  i have a big ipad pro and it rules so hard take it everywhere with me i take photographs of my sketches on paper sketch in procreate airdrop customers reference print wirelessly have all my photos in the cloud store shitloads of ref its such a great tool the texture difference is really nothing you can just tweak the brushes if you find it makes you jittery
itll never happen but god damn it i really wish paint tool sai was on mac nothing else feels as good as those brushes procreate photoshop corel all pale in comparison
ipads are fucking overpriced even a refurbished 97 model  after being retired from stores  is a few hundred    but i love the thing    photoshop wants you to learn a hundred menu options and key shortcuts i was always drowning in technical details my art has improved so much faster with an ipad because procreate shrinks the learning curve between you and actually making finished digital work i get things done quicker and easier    but sometimes it feels like a toy you cant use gradients or text or antialiasing the developers are always updating it with new features but until real photoshop whatever that means comes to the ipad in 2019 the functionality ceiling is comparatively low    finding workarounds for the ipad is still preferable to using photoshop and a nonscreen tablet imo
  this picture triggers me  new pro with old pencil
  i felt the same moving from sai to procreate but i got used to it on the upside theres a decent collection of users making custom brushes so you can probably find some sai brush clones
    feels like a toy    whats a decent upgrade from a surface pro 2 being spoiled on wacom pens and all
  i dont know what they mean by feels like a toy yeah software wise procreate can get a few new features photoshop coming soonthe ipad pro is more than capable specs are great can video edit and everything the pen itself is just as good as wacoms tilt rotation etc
  but sometimes it feels like a toy you cant use gradients or text or antialiasing  sketchbook pro has all of those and its what ive been using on a samsung chromebook their website shows it has an ipad version too i have a list of software im going to try once i get an ipad but ill probably stick with sketchbook for sketching because of the neat gui and the way that the legacy pencil brush behaves is perfect i started using sketchbook years ago on a shitty wacom bamboo and ancient pc the gui really shines on a tablet computer
new ipad mobile photoshops gonna be booty
  do you really like sketchbook i cant seem to get into it the gui is off putting to me and although i try to not care about those things i cant seem to give it a real chance honestly procreate was off putting at first too because of how minimalistic it is i thought it was going to be a very basic or hard to use app with everything hidden to keep the minimalism
  get a pc screen tablet if you dont absolutely need to use it on the go ipad  procreate is nice but it still cant keep up with photoshop/csp/etc
  do you really like sketchbook  it takes some getting used to but the brush engine is really very easy to configure and i usually hide most of the interface except for the color selector puck anyway im usually not missing much from clip studio or photoshop that i cant live without i have all of my inking pen presets that i use in csp ps and krita rebuilt in sketchbook and it only took a few minutes to do at a certain point the ability to make basic paint strokes and mask off an area to airbrush along with layers to use is really all you need free transform tools are essential for photobashing and sketchbook handles those fine the current chromeos version which i assume isnt getting updated any time soon has some kind of fucked up line simplification algorithm that works after youve drawn a line to smooth it out like how inkscape handles smoothing rather than a proper delayed cursor line smoother not that big of a deal but the chromebook pro stylus is tiny as hell and my huge ass hands cant grip it like a normal pen
  i just a gaomon recently bitch is big and slippery im still in the process of buying a matted screen protector for it     it has its own stabilizer and i get to use my whole arm instead of just my wrist
cant believe im about to drop 1500 cdn on this fucking device the buyers remorse will be insane
  this is absolute bullshit likely posted from someone who can barely draw a loomis head a shit ton of professionals are using ipad as their workstation now and its easily capable of producing commercial level work not to mention photoshop is coming g soon and csp essentially has a full pc version in the app store
can anyone rec a decent standalone tablet thats not ipad pro wacom or surface ad at least 13
  how are the drivers i just got a huion kamvas gt156 and its great except that no matter how many times i calibrate it it still feels a tiny bit off specially when the pen is tilted had an ugee before and never had that problem
  bump please idk what term to look in english im esl to find a tablet that doesnt need to be plugged to a pc to work
  they share the same word as far as i know i dont know what to tell you why do you not want the main brands the only thing i can think of is to get an android tablet and a wacom pen meant for them  something like this    and this      that tablet comes with its own pen it might be good enough to not need the wacom one
op the only brand i recommend staying away from is gaomon since the one i bought broke after a month i hear huion is good but you really need to make sure you can get a refund if things go wrong     like this for example        is this fake it says its 150 euro so maybe a chinese counterfeit it seems a lot of the other stuff hes selling is the same
  perhaps stolen ipads or a scam like he listed a single limited edition of a ps4 with an unique number its already been sold 17 times in 1 hour
how is the samsung galaxy tab s4    has anyone tried it
  whats the problem if its stolen the guy has a 100 rating what are the chances im being scammed if i do end up buyying it do you think
  is chinese counterfeit for apple phones i have seen several videos on youtube where they are reviewed probably there will also be tablets
  dont i just got an email from ebay saying its was a hacker that stole an old account luckily i canceled the payment in time before the guy accepted it
which stylus works well with the ipad or does apple fellate themselves and make it only work well with the apple pen
  just fine i disabled the wacom driver i had on my laptop just in case i need to switch sometimes i need to recalibrate when i fuckup the screen extension or i switch from extended to duplicate screen and vice versa     what happened to your ugee
  the apple pen works well like its made by them for their product it obviously is probably the best option  but no youre totally free to use other stylus like those wacom ones pretty sure procreate has support for more than just the apple one but not sure i cant give any feedback though since ive only tried that one
  what happened to your ugee  it was the 19 inch one it had great pen performance but the screen itself was pretty shit neither hd nor ips so doing color work was a pain in the ass sold it and bought me the huion
    just got my black friday ipad and apple pencil the screen is great and im so used to the sketchbook pro brushes that i can tell the pencil is working perfectly i like it more than the wacom tech on my chromebook pro and its a big sized stylus that fits my big hands i cant wait to give photoshop and clip studio paint a try    honestly its hard to believe that you can get tech this nice for 350 ive never used an apple product for more than a minute before this but this is a slick machine fucking kids these days have it too nice
  curious what youll think of procreate in comparison its only ten bucks so its not a huge investment
  ipad pro  this is the level you can exist at  it has access to anatomy apps obviously  also a perspective zoom function under settings that always keeps your drawing in perspective
  and this should be on /gd or /g
  this is about as stupid as saying paint brush discussion should go in diy faggot use your brain for once in your life
  ipad 6
ipad still doesnt have professional animation software  decent pro illustration support with ps on the way  be illustrator wanting to be animator  better off getting screen tablet but ipad is the best screen ive seen in my whole life    god fucking dammit just port toonboom already
  you could go full applefag and get a macmini and astropad to use animation software
  try azpainter its been ported to mac the default brushes are not as good but an anon on here shared a better set    
im shitposting in this thread with an xp pen 22e its good but you need to buy an autokey to be efficient
people who draw character fan art of airing shows who pair characters who have the weakest link in chemistry   you people who do this are disgusting do a little more research beyond google images or keep up with the shows youre drawing fanart of or just dont even bother this infuriates me to no end
okay
  thank you for understanding
  back to tumblr faggot
  or people can draw whatever the hell they want  theres something to consider
  my autism
is something to consider
    imagine being this autistic
    this is a legitimate problem that needs to be corrected
what do you think will get you more publicity a drawing of the most popular ship to compete agansit tbe lions share or being the one artist for a crack ship
  crack ships are just excuses that the person doesnt know the source material and is just dumping their idiotic interpretation they threw on a dartboard in their pureref onto my dashboard if youre good at conveying doesnt just have to be technical skill you will get the 1ups you so want
  your autistic rage sustains me  ill draw more shippy stuff just to spite you 
  not into homoshit go for it
  t autism personified
  its a smart way to sell your art and gain that necessary exposure and people want their chance of being the goto artist everyone has for a particular ship nothing wrong with finding two chatacters attractive and wanting them to fuck    now its only gets ridiculous when they start getting riled up and heated with each other about their little fictional pairings and write pages long essays complete with screenshots and diagrams about why the characters who looked at each other one singular time are soulmates or worse that there is some social justice element to it all that serves only to strengthen the pairings existence thats pretty autistic right there
  example understandably a lot of faggots like sakimichan have not a clue about the stuff they draw only money and easy fandom followers are all what theyre interested in
      here is one example this particular artist may not write long essays complete with sceenshots or maybe they do how the fuck would i know im not totally fluent in japanese nor would i know somewhere on the japanese web he is doing this but he/she constantly draws these two in sexual acts despite them having 0 zero zeeeeeeero chemistry in the show despite dokipri being the gayest seasons in its franchise     today there was some goblin slayer art by an artist i like but i dont want to post his gallery here and expose him to /ic/ because i genuinely like his stuff and he should remain unkown but he drew goblin slayer with x girl and im wondering why not this girl or this girl why her i favorited it but then thought about it to myself and unfavorited leaving a dissatisfied taste it was the pose that put me off more than just x girl being in the pic
imagine seeing a pairing of characters from different shows even 0 or the protagonist and antagonist     what is wrong with you people
    i dont care about that just dont do it in the same universe
  you must be a girl  look up ntr  its hot because its so wrong
  youre like the 100th person to call me a girl on /ic/ i get it i might appear to complain like a girl online but im no woman nor act like one irl
  yummy
whats the point being an artist if youre not drawing your own crackships and other things that shouldnt be
  cancer
  show me on the doll where the shipper hurt you  memes aside one of the things i enjoy about art is that you can draw wathever the fuck you want and it takes a single second for people to consume it and maybe they remember it
  who cares its all fictional in the end youre taking this too seriously why do you feel the need to control people stop it let people draw what they want as long as the image is well enough made/appealing in someway there is no need to complain about fan art
  who cares  i care  its all fictional in the end  doesnt make it right
  then youre dumb now get off this board
  doesnt make it right    so its immoral
  been here far far longer than you have half the threads are mine
  he drew goblin slayer with x girl and im wondering why not this girl or this girl why her  have you ever considered that artists have the right to have their own opinions  maybe x is the hottest  wouldnt expect less from a gs autist this this thread come from /a/ or something
  lol okay now i want you to leave even more also thats not really something to brag about
  i am this board you cannot remove what is the foundation
  i am this board  pyw
  holy shit you are autistic   normally i would laugh at you and then move on but you seem pretty argumentative so let me explain basic human behaviour to you so maybe you can correct your autistic ways    people draw characters fucking because they look hot not because they think its the most logical pairing based on chemistry shown in the show when you are shipping you are diverting from canon anyway so why do you care so much about the realities of the show
    my latest masterpiece
  thats too advanced for /ic/  youre not really the embodiement of this board
     kys
  when you are shipping you are diverting from canon anyway so why do you care so much about the realities of the show    because its clear the artist doesnt watch the show now stop with your baseless arguments
  drop dead in front of your parents
  unironically using the word chemistry  throw inane jokes later  go back to 4channel
    you seem to be acquainted what 4channel is like when you go back tell them i said hi
  where do you go to discuss gs but in 4channel  keep trying to rule over the tastes of others i wonder if you are already on the stage of enjoying your asshurt
  taste does not equal accuracy you cant draw fan art if youre not a fan of something i mean you can but you cant get it accurate to whats been setup     cant see why you cannot see such a simple concept
  why not this girl or this girl   because the artist likes both specific characters and wants to see them together  i get what you mean though if you are an actual fan of the thing in question seeing two characters who never even had a conversation passionately fucking makes no sense  on the other hand if a character i hate has the most chemistry w/ a character i love i would choose to draw them with someone elsepic not related
  i mean you can but you cant get it accurate to whats been setup  glad to see you learned your lesson artists can do whatever the fuck they want its up to you and the fandom to get angry  can you stop them no and thats why you stay silent as the cuck you are
  literally you
  because its clear the artist doesnt watch the show  but you are an autist how on earth could you say that the thoughts of others are clear to you
    yeah but you also proved to me they arent fans of the fanart you just played yourself
  were not talking about thoughts here were talking about people drawing parings when they have no chemistry in the source material almost as if they looked on google images fired up photoshop and cranked out a turd for likes in a fandom they give 2 shits about
  this is so autistic
  not an argument i see that im right and pushed a nerve once again in the minds of /ic/ losers
  its autistic in the sense you care about pairings of fictional characters its like chris chan teir
  not him but what if we told you that youre technically correct but we simply dont give a fuck what hardcore fanboys like you would think ill personally start to mash characters together just to spite you this is how insufferable you are right now
  so im not allowed to care about something even if its meaningless to you are you trying to tell me how to think isnt that what youre arguing against here    how on earth could you say that the thoughts of others   and dont give me that   but im not that person /ic/ isnt one person    youre all the same to me
  you said that its not about thoughts then went directly to asume what they didnt watch the series  are you seriously this dumb
  okay this was all bait good job let this thread die already
  because they dont watch the series ironic lostpause tier weebs exist in the artist community
  i will never see the light of day your work in a booru
    yeah i just rebound your post and you realized you got served up now the only thing you can do is call it bait
  just for that ill mash them with other original characters that are /pol/ related or directly from /pol/
  guaranteed 1 star to be buried and never seen again quite possibly even removed from the site for poor quality youre only wasting your time
  t increasingly nervous fanboy
    doubt you know what my interests are
  and ill be drawing them either using or shilling random shitcoins from /biz/
  but he drew goblin slayer with x girl and im wondering why not this girl or this girl why her i favorited it but then thought about it to myself and unfavorited leaving a dissatisfied taste  lmao this dumb fag
  youve seen nothing
  you dont know what my interests are enjoy drawing nearly every anime per season to narrow it out just so you could piss off 1 guy
  お前はもう死んでいる
  and i can assure you that i will enjoy it thoroughly
  あなたのお母さんstupidビッチ
  look out boys op is mad he shit posts so hard he fills half this board
  he shit posts so hard he fills half this board    you actually believe that lie
  not him but i honestly believe that the vast majority of shitposts in this board are indeed coming from one person
    youre a dumbass
  thank you for proving my point
    you had no point to begin with
  nope but its so retarded i cant not address it just the fact that he is complaining about what he is while saying he is an old fag proves hes lying
    also on the slim chance it is true and if i can get one sped so mad he would fuck off for awhile and free ic of 50 of its shit threads would make my day
  its not true    iit is true though  it doesnt work like that you either show youre a dumbass or just clinically admittedly retarded  and if i can get one sped so mad he would fuck off for awhile and free ic of 50 of its shit threads   if only he knew
  oh yes youre a true hero you makes us all realize the true
  you mean all 1 person which is it i thought /ic/ was just 1 guy making 50 of the threads 50 of the posts
  youre making just as much of an assumption as i am also i never said it was true i said on the off chance it is like what if i like being optimistic you should try it instead of being just as autistic as op
  you should try it instead of being just as autistic as op  but i am op   youre making just as much of an assumption as i am   like clockwork folks folks are we just talking about you and me
a pack of goblins with literally any of the female characters is best ship
are you that one guy who like two weeks ago was asking for people to post their mal profile to see how much of an anime experts they were
   i am op  that explains everything no way there could be 2 anons who are that tism stricken in one place    dude why dont you just try to enjoy stuff more is it that fun to come here and complain about literally nothing ffs give it up your opinions are just not right
    that cant be me after all /ic/ is just 1 person but now that you bring it up you should post your mal so i know im speaking to someone who does exactly what the thread header mentions
  my opinions are greater than yours give it up    you dont sound any more noble
  yes they are because your opinion is i dont like this thing whaaa why dont people do what i like shelve that bs you know it is
  if its hot it ships
  why dont people do what i like  these people are doing what i like drawing and drawing in the fandoms i like what is your point youre trying to make here because it seems to me you keep dodging the whole if theyre not a fan they shouldnt be making fanart of a series     the reasons states why already itt youre the one who needs to shelve your blatant dodging
  i did tell you what i thought about that so let me expand on what i said before a little i said youre dumb to get upset over it why does anyone need to be a fan of something to draw it who cares what the artists opinions are even if they hate the ip but just want to pander for popularity  trends which would be a little shallow and attention seeking but thats what most artists on social media are sharing their work for there shouldnt be an issue with that because its just so nonoffencive    and who makes these unwritten rules you are there more and where are the lines say if i just like how a character looks but nothing else about a series does that mean i am not allowed to draw it this is gatekeeping nonsense and its just plain dumb    dont forget youre here because you got upset about something that really doesnt effect you or anything at all    i dont need to know anything about something i want to draw other than how to draw it go sell that stuff to /a/ artists do not have to be fans they just need to draw
i find it depends on the shows if theyre realistic written and character driven shows then its unsettling but if theyre shallow archetypes then i dont care
brain meme  drawing mainstream otps  drawing unconventional ships  drawing couples with 0 chemistry   drawing couples whove never met from different works
  why does anyone need to be a fan of something to draw it  a yo retard see the picture   and who makes these unwritten rules you  it is a written rule its in the name itselffan art   say if i just like how a character looks but nothing else about a series does that mean i am not allowed to draw it  no but if youre going to draw the character you need to know their personality beforehand less you make another pinup that looks trite and not actually how the character behaves you sound like you draw porn and porn is tasteless and not really fanart just mindless perversion   i dont need to know anything about something i want to draw other than how to draw it  but this is where youre wrong  artists do not have to be fans they just need to draw  i already explained do a little bit more research etc etc in the op pic less you get it wrong i think youre just lazy
  this just shows your insecurity to no end m8
  insecurity   wrong choice of word that should be my line try again
  cringe
i dont make fanart of ongoing anime or american cartoon series because im a fan i do it for the pixiv artstation views i havent followed anime since sakura wars from 2004
    30 year old boomer
  t boomer
  lol are you child thats some weak shit
  why do you care if im a child or not are you some kind of paedophile stranger danger stranger danger
  oh so youre just retarded got it
they draw mainstream meme crap for reblogs / views they dont give a single shit about the characters / shows they draw and youre an npc for supporting them because xd they a fan just like me xd  faggot
  oh so youre just a pedo got it
  type proper english please i have a hard time trying to figure out what you mean
  t faggot who draws mainstream shit for views
    thanks for simplifying your garble for me i already said you dont know what im into     twice so you cannot assume im into mainstream fandoms hint im not actually i like drawing characters from older shows for myself more than recent things
  wooosh are esl or something how can you possibly be this stupid
    why are you still talking to me pedophile
  you are a child on the inside not literally and i am still talking to you because its fun
  you are a child on the inside  do you mean mentally or inside a moist hole if latter we cant go that far stranger
  you cant be serious of course i am saying mentally why the hell would i intend otherwise
  original characters that are /pol/ related or directly from /pol/  does such levels of autism exist  what are /pol/ related characters
  chirst chan
  how about instead drawing ships that everyone redeem is toxic abusive and morally wrong thus ending up with your inbox getting filled with death threats and hate mail yatta am i internet famous now  still gonna draw it cuz im one of those cancerous shipping fags that love me sum problematic ships get those boring ass canon ships away from me you people with no imagination offends me     people should draw the fuck they want just be aware where to put it so the wrong kind of audience doesnt find it        people draw characters fucking because they look hot  sometimes yes thats the case but you need more motivation than that for continuing spawning several thousand shipping art  to me its more about the potential these character could have with one and another how their individual personality will affect another thus ensues character development how their relationship will affect those around them friends/family/society how much hardship they have to overcome thus the sweeter reward  to me shipping is more than wow hot character having steamy sex wow like it very much it more how their relationship will affect the plot of the story    thats why 999 of my ships are pretty much protagonist and villain ships
  you are a child on the inside not literally  can you elaborate
  he means inside a moist hole
  people who draw character fan art  you couldve stopped there its barely art if you saw some shit band at the pub do a bunch of cover songs youd never take them seriously
  using the power of fanart to do something that the show will do  using the power of fanart to do something that will be done to death by the fandom
  diverting from the source is cancer
  ebolachan murdochchan and the norf
  it begins
  lol did you make this i like it
i kind of agree with you op especially when they end up shipping nonsensical pairings just for the sake of making the character gay  because down with straight
are there any forums for aspiring contemporary artists
every living artist is a contemporary artist so yes you are on one
  i meant a forum for the conceptual bs which /ic/ hates
  gtfo
  oh i think i know a place   its in the gutter in the 80s dying of aids
so /ic/ what other stuff keeps you busy instead of drawing and work  how do they influence your process  ingmi because i do to much other shit
im studying for my cpa accountancy board exam its like im pretending to be straight when im gay
reading and music desu   album covers influence me somewhat
  thats great i enjoy visualising the worlds in books   and to let music influence me while drawing
  masturbating
firez became an actual top tier artist  meanwhile youre still the same mediocre anon as always  how does it feel
  pretty good desu hes worked hard and glad to see him leave this place and out to market himself wish him well and happy to see someone finally make it out
  firez pls go
  we joked about firez making it and threads being made with memes just like this way back when look at us now
  screw you i like firez
  he definitely not toptier yet  but got potential
  im proud of him too
  if he was female he would be 200 percent better cruel world innit
  is there any noticeable artist girl on ic
  youre trapped in a room for a day with one of ics most insufferable artists which one could you put up with for 24 hours without losing your sanity    if you dont make a decision inside 10 seconds you are forced to share the room with all three  firez  nosebro  mal
  the chick that made the smug anime wendys drawings posts here
  vetyr is the only one
  there was a girl that got into fzd think her name was iris hopp not sure if its a pseudonym      have personally talked to nosebro hes fun to talk to sometimes but i wouldnt choose him because of some personal issues  i dont know anything about maldraw other than his art but he seems pretty insufferable  would definitely pick firez seems like a nice genuine guy
  replace firez with brian and you got something there i wouldnt mind mal since im not chabs though mal did chase after squidpucci which is concerning
    i havent seen him a while where is he
  nosebro and gesture battle for 24 hours it will be great practice
  firez pls go
  whos mal
fuck off firez
  he doesnt even know how to fucking gesture he just does contours every time      maldraw apparently hes also a /pol/fag ive never seen him post on here but i only found this board 2016 ish he has a shitty comic called the adventures of christchan        stop that
  far from making it
  i wish he still posted here he is quite helpful over discord
  the hate was getting ridiculous so i can see why he left
  4chan hates anything popular thats why the guys that made undertale and risk of rain left
  hate  more like jelly butthurt
  awful
  its more of a tall poppy syndrome thing
  i liked the uncolored version better desu
  there it is that dead looking skin tone lol
  firez pls go
  top tier    literally who and thats pretty beg desu
  what has the dude who made undertale to do with 4chan
  based
  pyw embryo
  yaaaawn
  firez pls go
  which discord
  i had to
  firez pls stay
  looks like a jojo character
  i dont think it is done
  doesnt matter his render doesnt save the drawing its already shitty because the colors are awful and the perspective of the head is wrong the head is facing in profile but the eyes and cheeks are at an angle from above
  theres mrpurin professorsugoi and mercy
  snib snab

  theres a bunch of cute girls drawing in /las/
  am i going to make it decided to take thigns seriously now this is me

  a niche community on /vg/ likes and supports a dude and his work  this is /vg/ everybody hates them and what they like and rightfully so  surprised when /v/tards shit on dude and his work  surprised when /v/ shits on anything  maybe it was just shit all along
  firez pls go
  dont bring the ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh im so fucking horny and lonely ahhh guy there please

cant believe i actually wasted time on this shit
  dead looking
  dude it was better before you touched it
  implying thats not just you and subtly promoting yourself
    im a cute girl 
  gratz you actually made it worse
  i made it worse to make that other anons mistake more apparent you autist
  do it better fa
  what mistake you moving the eye up showed nothing
  why turns every nice black and white drawing from him to shit when he colors it
  adventures of christchan  shitty  kill yourself faggot taocc is top kino glad he went libshit otherwise his stuff is purged like all the good /pol/ ocs
  hi maldraw how have you been its certainly been a while have you been keeping up with your loomis
  haha ur the artist  what the fuck is this meme
  youre not fooling anyone you may not be aware of it but you have a peculiar modus operandi that is easily recognizable
  vertyr and mobble cant think of many more but its mostly because the sample size of artist whove gotten good on /ic/ and frequently posted is not very big
  they dont even look similar
  animu  cringe
  firez pls go
  iris hopp    her work was utter garbage like literally amateur tier
  for how long has he been drawing now feels like ages  that makes me want to get good even more i swear ill fucking make it anons
  gesture battle me    here    personal issues  thats code for i dont like it when nosebro tries to convince me to become a christian father of 7 beautiful children with my loving wife
  mine and one or two others
  thats code for i dont like it when nosebro tries to convince me to become a christian father of 7 beautiful children with my loving wife  you actually do this shit
  ya i help people with their jobs homework resumes investing advice their art finding themselves confidence building bully people into losing weight  havent succeed with anyone yet etc     free of charge because im so full of love of course
  im not saying im good just that youre drawing outlines instead of actual gesture i can gesture battle you if you really want but only on weekends and im sure ill lose    thats code for i dont like it when nosebro tries to convince me to become a christian father of 7 beautiful children with my loving wife hahahahaha you have no idea dont make me bring up your jailbait exgf    i change my mind you are indeed insufferable      he has autist humor
  well shit fucked up my formatting somehow am on mobile feel free to roast me    also wow trips

  you really sound like an anime character   i need to join that discord of yours someday sounds like fun

  because firez fell for the everything is just advanced symbol drawing meme
  post your work
so shitty he can draw animu girls on a phone
  firez  symbol drawing    sure this place is jelly
  doubt it will take him long to reach up to a decent income given his work ethic    stay in the bucket
  why is he so bad at drawing heads
  post
  yeah its not symbol drawing its advanced symbol drawing you can see proko falling into the same pitfall  he consciously knows construction is good but mentally he doesnt trust it enough to use it properly to the fullest extent and instead chooses to noodle his drawing with transform tools and liquify for weeks until it looks kinda good enough thats why his drawings are always slightly off in some weird ways  im not saying hes bad but this part of his mentality is holding him back from fully flourishing
    is anyone else excited for him as i am cant wait until he is swimming in pussy like ruan jia looking alpha as fuck meanwhile all the jelly fags will keep nit picking at him making threads to circlejerk with each other over minor details i want him to succeed
  cant wait until he is swimming in pussy like ruan jia  stop making me cringe
  yikes
  firez pls go
is this a repaint thread
  just another thread about firez catching up to and outrunning ruan nothing to see here
  this made me wince  firez pls stop
firez pls go
  wow look at that he didnt respond what a shocker
  it is now      teach me senpai
  damn
dunnin kruger the thread
he is very productive it seems
  that hilarious hes actually regressing from 2013/2014
im confused  is it a meme to hate firez it seems like their general skills is above a lot of the posters here
   the dude cant render to save his life he cant render skin and he always fucks the perspective on his drawings somehow and the only decent things he draws are photostudies everything els is /beg/ tier
  he used to post here notch too
  hello /ic/ i want to play a game
  no illastrat  shit list
  inb4 firez shilling his own thread to get more patreon followers    ill bite
  first lesson  add more milk
firez has a slightly above average rendering skills but his pieces are so fucking dull and boring thats just it its just sameface girls doing boring poses      those feet look disgusting
  gtfo
  you again
  firez  cant render    sure dude maybe someday you will know how to render
  everyone complains that his skin rendering is lifeless  posts pic of a statue    hehe i see what you did there anon
  firez pls go
  i actually like how he does feet
  ugly and fat
  i was talking about feet not about you anon
  ill grind until i become one of the noticeable artist girls
  hhot
    girls dont exist on /ic/ anon only pedo trannies looking to dick down boipuccy ugly bitches fat bitches and lesbos if you claim to be a woman you gotta suck dick and swallow    also if youre actually a girl post your number and email i promise not to share it because im not like the assholes here on 4chan just reply to this post if youre serious about getting in a relationshipoh and i respect women
  oops im a lesbo moving on
  ha got em

  bigfatthighsgmailcom
  lel i feel sorry for who ever falls for it
    bigfatliesgmailcom
  firez pls go
  every single fucking face is the exact same wtf
  meh i could do better
  give it a try dude we all need some inspiration to get going
  i feel like firezs drawings look out of perspective or that the forms dont look like they interact correctly she can render but perspective and composition are still weak areas imo
  she  hmm
  oh now all of the sudden you faggots will start to put firez on a pedestal after all this time of giving grief just because you caught wiff of pussy kill yourselves
  read this    watch this      you got that quite wrong gender and critique
all these dunnin krugers shiting on firez based on early wips keep bitching idiots
  i cant really make sense of how the skull works in this one i feel like eye sockets dont line up
  so thats the power of his finished work lol how is it any different from his early wips lol
  thanks for proving my point    keep bitching dunning kruger
  i feel    sure anon watching the time lapse it is a pretty solid drawing
  if you think so personally i think firezs drawings look like they wouldnt work if someone sculped them in zbrush or something
  what about that guy that posts his cold dead looking paintings of memes hes pretty insufferable
  i dont know who this artist is op but you sound like youre projecting a little bit from your second sentence
  im so happy for him his art is good and yet everyone seems to shit talk him /
  im hoping if i dont acknowledge him hell go away
  oof
  you didnt see the whiteknights defending him  i would said it 50/50 firez whiteknights/crabs at this point  with a couple truly happy for him
    firez pls go
  ngmi
  sugoi cant be a girl way too good
  dat boi climbing up    firez is from a poverty stricken country right so the 77 mo must be nice
  imagine if he takes commissions
  firez plz go
  whatever keeps him going is good    you can see he is passionate and works hard and his skills are getting better    im legit happy for the guy he is gmi material
who the fuck is firez and why the fuck you faggots care so much about that nobody
  firez was an artist who was sshit when he first started eventually he grew tire some so he took the degenerate route where he draws same face anime girls being naked    cant  draws niche naked anime girls  start patreon   only friends donate to him so they can get friends only ary    op is firez himself shilling his thread so he can get followers he lives in a bad country so he really needs the money   one day hell stoop low and draw loli
  but most of u faggots cant even draw that
  aight bet nigga
  are getting better  he hasnt gotten better since 2013 he platued since then
  niggavibjust explained what he does here
  firez was an artist who was sshit when he first started    there exist artists who were not shit when they first started      eventually he grew tire some so he took the degenerate route where he draws same face anime girls being naked        he will grow out of the same face thing as he does more head and face studies from life you can see his studying in other areas led to an over all improvement      he hasnt gotten better since 2013 he platued since then    scroll down the archive to his 2013 work compare it to his 2018 work are you blind    this isnt a shill thread this is a hate thread get out of bucket you silly crabs    firez is a good example for /ic/ of what consistency is all about his archive speaks way louder than any crab crit here
  its a me
  skin tone  what faggots cling to to feel superior is astounding  how pathetic
    duning kruegers never disapoint
      hi firez
  firez how pathetic are you that you have to police this thread every day learn some basic perspective and you wouldnt get your nuts roasted all the time
i have never attempted anything like this before but it was incredibly fun i want to learn more about this type of stylization   t trad realismfag
  the face was really bugging me so i tried to fix it
  cant believe it somebody actually did improve on his drawings for once nice job anon
  youre a fucking dunce
  post your work cause you sound like you have no idea what you are talking about
  i still want to punch it
  girls dont exist on /ic/  a lot of the actual girls on 4chan in general dont constantly shout about it because they arent little faggy attention whores  of course i only have anecdotal evidence for this  typed with my vagina
  firez pls go actually dont i like your stuff
  big if true
  omochabox but that was a long time ago
  seconded have been around ic since 2013 and have typed every post with my vagina
  you just made her look younger is this what you retards think a correct face looks like
  hi firez
  most chicks dont say theyre a grill so it could be anyone
  actually they just made her face slimmer im not saying that its correct but it looks better
lets enliven /ic/ theres too much degeneracy happening firezfags mangafags pornfags digitalfags prokofags you name it post good art examples
  there is no good art here anon on /ic/everything is terrible
    joel corcia    animation concepts / backgrounds
did it teach you to draw
no
done a little bit of the 3ds one and it didnt really teach me anything i didnt know though it expanded on some traditional concepts i had never really learned how to use properly like blending    though if you go into it with 0 art knowledge it will definitely teach you how to draw it starts easy to give you confidence and gives you a slow drip feed of info the whole time like about lighting teaches how to use a grid how to use traditional tools etc for 4060 bucks its not too bad if you think of it as a sort of guided tutorial with no feedback the issue is how good will you be at drawing after that judging from the first few lessons you should end up pretty good at drawing from life and other references i dont think the format will really support teaching how to draw from imagination but i could be wrong
  its a complete rip off i dont even know if i learned a single thing
who are your favorite female artists
    cynthia sheppard is one of them
  dont get it    are you saying females are objects lol
    no dumbass it exemplifies how if women takes pictures of something to share on social media they make sure to include themselves in it
  tattoo  dropped harder than a rock
  i see yea so what are your favorite female artists
  is there a problem with that    are you one of those neck beards who are scared of vaginas
    claire wendling        making an observation is not a judgment in of itself but it does make women come off as conceited when they do so
  were interested in whats being taken on the picture but if its a roastie taking it she would make sure she plasters her mug superimposing the more interesting subject its supposed to highlight the fact that roasties are shallow attention whores who would tweet and post on instagram about their child being burned alive first instead of saving them
  claire wendling    i like roasties
    share some roasties    give me some roasties that are infamous for doing this
kek     roasties
  oh my god youre back  
  kinda cute    tats  dropped
    meh tats dont bother me if its something original and meaningful
uhh sakimichan lol theres no competition
    holy shit    this thread is gold and heated
  not me but kek tattoos are gross
    youre replying to the wrong person
  tattos are acceptable if theyre done professionally     artwork covering an entire area of the body arms legs chest can look pretty good and the style has to be top tier    chicks who get dog foot prints on their legs a butterfly or something else stupid and make it painfully obvious on their body yeah no thanks cover that shit up or finish off the entire area
miyazaki maya she would be much greater if she actually finish any of her manga
  no you degenerate scum all tattoos are ugly you will understand when you grow up but it will be too late by then
  wylie beckert    toptier comfy
  this when some bitch in some porno has a tat near her vag that says the gates of hell or some shit like that i instantly lose my boner
  i eat pussy all the live long day  i eat pussy all the live long day  i eat pussy all the live long day
      if i wanted ot make a thread about girl and tattoos i would have how fucking retarded are you    i was making a thread to find female artists hopefully getting some new ips jesus christ    this board is filled with neck beard autists
  wylie beckert  ty
  thank god its not filled by dykes like you
    your feedback is irrelevant to the topic of this thread shoo shoo

  dont you love when tattoo artists can only symbol draw
  tattoo artists are low tier theyre not academic artists
  no youre just a tasteless incel sperg faggot
  a nobody but shes great
in the credits of pretty much every animated series ive ever seen is a woman called caroline choat who is listed as a character designer i know next to nothing about her but she was extremely prollific throughout the 80s and 90s working on everything from extreme dinosaurs the real ghostbusters and the hulk animated show to the godzilla animated series of the 90s i wish i knew more about her she seems to have designed some awesome stuff
  then just go back to plebbit or kys  it aint hard
  laura brouwers    you know youre dealing with a full blown roastie when the google search for their name results in as many selfies on them as pictures of their art
  dont think you know what incel means try again faggot
  tasteless incel sperg faggot  gog damn a 4x multiplier

  thanks  i like her stuff  looked her up  atelier training at gage academy from juliette aristides

ctrl f  no kamome shirahama
   some tattoos compliment people very well even just in aesthetic terms find some good shit and quit complaining about trashy tattoos that everyone agrees are hideous
   this person isnt even pregnant we dont even know if this person is a woman
  hey shes pret  tattoo   never mind
alena aenami is an ukranian artist i have almost all of her paintings in my desktop background folder
  ah yes low budget loish    loish i pretty good though even if every other girl is copying her
mia jane harris      i cant believe people are taking this seriously
anne magill
  theres this one girl who visited this board about a year ago she posts very little her lines are great though im pretty sure she has a dick
karla oritz i guess mainly because of her graphite stuff
almost all female artists i follow became a they/it/he in the last year so fuck hem  if even women believe notwomen are superior and better why bother
  love her stuff
  there is so much background and story in this image
  there is nothing wrong with a good tat    theyre just being retarded
   at least shes consistent about her gender on other sites she just likes drawing girls
  there is nothing wrong with a good tat    i think it partly depends on the context youre a samoan warrior who follows the symbolic tradition of your ancestors fine thats cool youre a purple haired suburban thot who loves to travel and tattoo yourself to signal your uniqueness not so much

not enough weeb in this thread
  oh yeah her name is akiakane
  the fact youre getting so triggered over some random commentary of their appearances says more about you than the people doing the commenting fuck off to reddit
  damn came to post her but forgot her name her work is great unless she is trying to copy manet or something her own personal style is way more enjoyable
  she has autism and thrives on attention and patreon bux but thats obvious with such a self entitled roastie
                                        why do girls only draw girls
sakimichan
  dont respond to old comments roastie

  well i do it cause i find girls eaiser to draw
imagine licking a female artists pussy while theyre drawing or painting
  i want to have sex with her
 is pretty alright
  everyone likes girls even girls
  i only draw guys for what its worth
  maybe she only has one happens
  behind the other
tatyana kupriyanova         im in love with this woman
  do girls with ducks count
  based
some to come
  too soon
kathleen caddick    i hope i gave you some nice ones
  gorgous work
   i draw only animals girls are just pretty but the subject matter itself is not the problem what really irks me is that these artworks are saying nothing besides looking pretty loish has a lot of potential as an artist but she never pushes herself toward meaning
   oh yeah shes the best
      absolutely based
me im the best artist in general

  i made so many waifus because of this thread
  post drawing
  but dont most guys draw girls too anyway  anime generation draws little girls and older generations draw pinups and heroic fantasy shit    i think its because womens bodies are just more pleasing in general more curves  cooler/sexier looking
firez
  i think it turned out fine but the fat stretched it out note the llama howling to the moon
  i follow a lot of female artists so its hard to pin down one as my favorite but i can say agnes cecil inspired my love of painting it depends on style and genre for me i guess
who is everyones favorite female environmental artist
myself uwu
  oooh you
  good ideas honey
einzberns pixel art is almost great she has a refined sense of stylization too bad she cant get through her ngmi stage even with thousands of followers praising her shit she probably will kill herself eventually
  im honestly trying to draw more guys personally but girls are way easier to draw because of character design potential such a shame most folks limit it to cute girl with accessories     like some pics haodan has done mostly but im bias since i like people with tanned skin and the like

i dont really follow art that much but i happened upon some fanny churberg works in a musem some time ago and it was pretty comfy
rate my drawing
  put more effort into it
15 out of 10
  thought it was a sad monster pierced by nails with a weird mouth from the thumbnail
first of all im sorry if pixel art doesnt belong in this board    i want to get into pixel art but dont know if its harder or easier than normal art  i have some years of practice doing digital art at an amateur level not looking to be a huge pro but i do want to get good enough to do decent stuff  recently i wanted to try my hand at doing pixel art and short animations because people really dig those and ive always felt a slight interest towards it    what fundamentals do i need for it  what are the steps towards a simple or normal sprite
depends on your preferred size of the sprites and technique  smaller sprites require less work but require more knowhow to make it actually look good  ive never worked with big canvas sizes on pixel art but i am certain that theres a lot of ways to cheat with different programs so that it wont take literal months to get a piece ready  or maybe most of pixel artists are just incredibly autistic and work months upon months to get each pixel right    i dont see pixel art as difficult as something like proper painting skills but it certainly has its learning curve
  id like to achieve something similar to paul robertsons work like these examples
  we have good pixel art threads every now and then but the pixel artists here are either doing other forms of art as well or maybe dont lurk here enough to have a constant general its not harder harder or easier but helps if you draw and paint well for example your pic has a pretty good and consistent light direction that reads well a good painting will also read well from a considerable distance similarly it would be helpful to learn how light and form is read by the brain to make great pixel art the reason you think it isnt difficult is because pixel art is a low input medium however if you want to translate high information in that medium it would be probably less time consuming to study traditionally
  that isnt difficult in the least to achieve  you can literally get yourself to do similar shit in less than a month  id aim higher but you do you start practicing now and youll be doing that before year changes
op here thank you for your comments so far    i decided to give it a try right away mixing what i know of normal drawing and pixelifying  i see myself getting more in depth into this given enough time might actually save me some frustrations of normal digital and analog art
download graphics gale  ask yourself  what hardware do i want to imitate  what aesthetic do i want to archive  but beside that pixel art is just digital painting at low resolution
did this as a quick test i could see myself animating in the future
  try smaller canvas that barely looks like pixel art
  looks good but your curves are a bit too curvey to get that pixel effect look closely at the girl in the reference you provided and youll see that theres almost no diagonal pixels that make long lines try simpler drawings using only straight lines connected but a single diagonal pixel youll probably pick it up pretty fast
  read these          first one is a tutorial of the basics the pixel art fundamentals so to speak second one goes into some theorywhat pixel art is youre not going to retain 100 of it up front but try to absorb the big picture for now  from like first grade to mid high school i drew in ms paint all the time eventually moved onto sprites got pretty all right at it only after college did i start seriously applying color and pixel theory to it though  the two biggest mistakes i see beginners make and which i made for a long time are 1 bad aliasing and 2 bad colors  bad aliasing is almost always too much of it and in the wrong places aliasing serves a purpose its meant to ease sharp color and value transitions but beginners see it in well designed sprites and think thats what makes them look pixely so they place it everywhere sometimes in long ugly parallel strips banding my advice would be to almost entirely avoid it as youre starting out well designed pixel art doesnt need aliasing  bad colors is a topic in itself colors are so important to pixel art that there are whole guides devoted to the subject essentially standard color theory applies so if youve read up on that youre mostly set some simple hue shifting will make bland designs pop instantly and clear value differences are the foundation of readability  pixel art is a more drawing than paintingfocused medium so if youre like me and you like drawing and hate painting you may enjoy pixel art i see youre using aseprite good dont be like me and stick to paint even in 2018 its so feature poor ase is cheap and worth every penny
how hard is it to go from just making sprites to making animations
  thank you so much ill bookmark these links and study them to heart      thanks not so bad for a first try ever i guess      will keep smaller canvases in mind thanks
    pretty solid drawing youre already better off than a lot of people new to pixel art because you have some drawing skill ill second this  not so much because theres some rule saying pixel art has to be tiny but i think when starting out you want to get into the mindset of 1 pixel at a time not always you can still rough out a design but stick to 1 pixel width and refine with care smaller sizes also mean much less time spent refining your design is a bit rough around the edges literally read up on jaggies its in that tutorial    main thing i wanted to show is what i meant by hue shifting making a design pop these arent necessarily the best possible colors and it doesnt have to be this saturated this is just an example of how you might go about it a good practice is to place the approximate flat colors without too much worry then colorpick/correct ases color and selections are incredible for that it barely took me any time to clean up the jpg artifacts in that which is another thing always save sprites in a lossless format like png or gif good luck
found this on /wg/ it looks like a photo from the thumbnail
      heres a ton of small tutorials
  op this is cute i think you can do it hug keep fighting the good pixel art fight
  thanks and your example of my test really makes it look better ive got to play a little more with colors    i felt the urge to get into pixel art because ive noticed each day im having less and less patience for fully drawn pieces of art  pic related is how i usually draw but the more i draw the more i notice how i hate struggling with lights shadows or complex parts   i thought maybe getting into pixel art to make simpler drawings would be a good way to find something i might be good at superdeformed characters are just perfect for pixel art and i have a better time drawing those  this is my horrible art blog sorry for the tumblr link   i didnt even feel compelled to finish inktober for the reasons explained above but this as you said is going to be a good base skill for me to start      thanks these seem pretty good
  that was drawn with a pixel brush it is not true pixel art your placement should be deliberate
  so this is out of the question
  yeah  the whole point of pixel art is placing each pixel intentionally and usually individually in order to create a flawless and exact finished piece any variation in line width color value etc should be deliberate and controlled
pixel art doesnt belong on this board because the same few fuckers who post their pixel art in these threads are the same people who think they dont have to learn how to draw so long as they do pixel art because its their style
    what a stupid pointless post
  were having a lobster buffet ignore the salty crabs anon
  every pixel art thread every time
  the guy who made that has some pretty nice info on his da    
  thats triggeringly dunningkreugered up
so how would you go about making environments   graphics gale looks more like for just characters and effects animation
  if you want to be authentic make tiles then fit them into an environment  if you dont care about that just paint
  the whole point of pixel art is placing each pixel intentionally and usually individually  sounds dumb if you can achieve the same effect without doing that
  you cant though but i think people get the wrong idea about 1 pixel at a time means in that forest image for example the artist definitely didnt place each pixel of the trees core shadow literally 1 at a time instead he blocked in the basic shape and laserrefined the edges its like very precise painting with no blending very shape and edgefocused to the point of being more akin to drawing
  my favorite part of every pixel art thread is grumpy pixel anon
  so i take it this isnt real pixel art    
op here decided to practice a little  i guess i should be somewhat realistic because i almost got too frustrated    started doing a couple of swords and explosions but then i went i want to animate a titty monster like paul robertson and spent the other half of the day drawing that horrible morrigan that ended up on nothing because i thought if i struggled this much to do this badly im certainly not going to animate color and draw each frame so i ended up doing that two frame standing little morrigan    i wanted to do something like this  
i always wanted to do pixel art but i dont know how what programs are good for it also any tips when doing pixel art thanks     i have try but i almost always have fail its hard for me for some reason
  read the thread a lot of programs and starting points have been posted already
bump
   i notice how i hate struggling with lights shadows or complex parts   youre still gonna have to struggle with lights shadows and complex parts if you wanna make good pixel art but try it out maybe it will fit you better
  i mean yeah but i mean using traditional or digital tools to achieve super pro rendering styles and shading  going pixel art means ill just have one tool and one color for shading which is way better for me at least to shade    open question should the ultimate goal for everyone be animating huge sprites like paul robertson or is it completely valid to do static pieces with minimal animation like eyes blinking
  the ultimate goal is something like metal slug or pic related  but youve seen that forest pic in the thread its not animated at all but looks great you can still just do static pixel art just has to be more detailed than animation which has the movement making up for detail
if anybodys played any of the mother series games looking for a style like pic related and wants regular commission work give me a (((you))) with quotes  im about to board a plane so if someone replies sorry about the wait
  pixels are just a medium you should treat it like normal drawing and painting
  do you have any other examples of your work
  is this ironic
  i dont have much on my phone this is about it    no do you mean whether im serious im super serious
op here done screwing around with aseprite during the day
  seems like you just used a pixel brush to draw your outlines again
  for this case yeah i found it useful for this kind of bigger drawing  ive been also practicing with way tinier characters typical indie stuff two heads tall this time pixel by pixel instead of using the brush  ive been also practicing antialiasing its way harder than it seems
  you should only be using the brush to set up roughs and then go back in and refine every pixel and pixel
  line and pixel
  you do realize thats just a 3d model traced with minimal 2d editing right  just look at how lowdetailed the face is in comparison to the rest of the model
  get aseprite and cosmigo from cgpeersto they open registration 2 days each month    cosmigo pro motion has tons of tools for makings background tiles animations etc   
  you need to bone up on just drawing for a while loomis and all that theres no application of any fundamental aspects of drawing on that thing its all just random fucking guesses at where things go
  same most of the tutorials are garbage and the ones that do have good information dont really go indepth with it then there are those that just tell you to learn to draw first
  see   and 
made this today
  not pixel art
  maybe theres a reason why people say to learn to fucking draw first
  pretty good
  how many heads tall is she by eye i think its 4
op here  tried to do a better version of my initial attempt this time working pixel by pixel instead of just using the brush as a brush theres still a lot to improve but im getting the hang of it
  much better op good job keep it up and try some dithering
      that was just a rumor
fyi one of the best things you can learn about w/r/t pixel art is antialiasing      mortmort/mnrart has several good tutorial/tips videos for pixel art and the first video on this playlist changed how i looked at antialiasing for the better      another good aa tutorial
  yeah its 4
  damn good videos anon thanks for that
  yes they are i went and did this after watching several of those videos but the first aa one on that playlist was the most helpful    this is based on a preexisting image i found via gis btw
  hey that looks pretty detailed despite being so small nice
made this trying to improve drawing and animation
  fool      youre looking at the apex right there have some respect months per character it was so painful  laborious that snk lost a lot of money to achieve it and they still dont have the courage/budget to do it againunfortunately kof14  snk heroines are a clear proof of that
  not pixel art nowhere near
  still not pixel art
  bretty good anon some quick notes  the up position happens too quickly just extend it a few frames and it should look good  that hair bump she has is only there for a split second then disappears makes it look like some kind of tumorous growth pulsating ever so gently either get rid of the bump entirely or add it to every frame  her back is doin a pixel jig you gotta make a solid decision of where you want those dark red pixels to be and stick with it cause theyre a bit over the place    keep going anon
  also made this a couple of days  animating is time consuming i can only wonder how much time did it take to animate some of the more complex metal slug bosses
what can be improved
  pretty much everything   this is the sort of pixel art you get when somebody thinks that they dont need to learn how to draw in order to be a pixel artist
work for school im really new into pixelart so i would appreciate some advices if theres something wrong
  nice has an old pc game vibe to it i like it
  i would appreciate some advices if theres something wrong    the overall designs are good but the execution is a bit wonky primarily in the outlines      give this video a watch then look for places where you can alter the outlines for a cleaner look    the shading is pretty good save for the muzzles/snouts of the furry characters add a bit of shading to the underside of their snouts for a bit rounder look    oh and one more thing never save pixel art in jpeg format with enough compression applied a jpegd piece of pixel art loses its pixelperfect appearance unless your work has animation in which case you will need gif save in png for the best preservation of your work    your work shows a lot of promise keep it up
is this pixel art  
  it evokes pixel art aesthetics and i would guess that the graphics were initially made with a pure pixel art presentation in mind yet i would hesitate to call it pixel art something about it feelsoff to me in that regard cant really explain why
    i guess this is as much pixel art as octopath traveler is
  octopath actually used pixel sprites from what i can tell  but it also used a graphics engine that allowed them to be displayed as if they were 2d figures walking on a 3d plane similar to paper mario games a pixel aesthetic to be sure but again not something i would call pixel art
i am new to pixel art how do i go about shading images better
  make a surface that is exposed to light have brighter colors literally all you have to do
  give this a read 
  thats a pretty damn terrible tutorial
  that is likewise damn terrible  making up fucking random rules of where to put lights and darks because you dont know how to fucking draw is not how to go about making pixel art
    post your work
     added more shading to the midsection to make it less bland any suggestions
    specular reflections and hue shifts also you are symbol coloring for lack of a better word just because guns are black doesnt mean you paint hem with black paint
  the biggest sin with this piece as it stands right now is a lack of contrast the outline reads like a gun sure but the full image strains the eyes when trying to pick out details on anything colored black/dark grey a few tips on how to correct this    1 do not use pure black ie 000 black for anything but the absolute outline of the image and even then try to use a slightly brighter black  2 contrast contrast contrast if you want your work to be more readable you need to have more contrast  not just between the black/dark grey colors and the nonblack colors but the black/dark grey colors themselves here are two pieces from pixeljoint that while not the best pixel art out there demonstrate what i am trying to say w/r/t your work     3 antialiasing as i pointed out earlier in the thread is your friend the yellow lines on the magazine on the right for example would look smoother with some minimal aa    your work shows promise though the outline/silhouette is readable even in thumbnail form and the general details that i can make out look solid in form give it some proper contrast and a little aa and itll look much better    also a little tip try not to post scaledup versions of your work if this is indeed a scaledup version a piece of pixel art is best judged in its originally intended size
  ive made a few more of these
  cute but it kind of looks like shes churning butter might want to nix the movement on the staff
  thanks for these
  1 do not use pure black ie 000 black for anything but the absolute outline of the image    aaaaaaaaaaand we can safely ignore your opinion on basically everything thanks for having that piece of bullshit was your number 1 anon appreciated more than anything you actually gave as advice
  do you  take  commissions
  youd be surprised how well a helladark blue/purple can work as a shadow color and still seem like black when compared to the overall piece pure black is a bitch move in that regard besides an impure black can help with palette cohesion take a look at this image both are the same sprite from the incredible hulk sega master system but the one on the left uses pure black and my edit on the right uses 05010d as the shading color can you really tell the difference without zooming in    i should have been less absolutist about the way i said what i sad about pure black yet i stand by what i said pure black can generally be avoided for that matter most fully saturated colors can be avoided too if you want to use them feel free  my word is not law  though i will always suggest trying to avoid them or at least avoid leaning on them as a crutch incidentally i edited the hulk sprite to use lessthanfullysaturated colors does it really look any worse
  it looks better ignore him anon anyone worth their shit knows pure black is better off avoided /ic/ was just being raided by cumspewing idiots
  was
    wow you guys must have really cool looking games made xd can you post some links to where i could check them out thanks
  you first bitch
why does everyone who does pixel art want to make games
  oh wow with the reply everything you said suddenly makes perfect sense and you dont sound like an autistic little shit with a fundamental misunderstanding about the shit t hat youre spewing about but rather as a learned man who understands all aspects of art and how they apply to pixel art xd nevermind
  i wouldnt mind making one but i dont have the time or the skills at the moment if i had to guess why id say it has to do with a sense of nostalgia mixed with the desire to do more with pixel art skills than just making sprites and icons and such      you said it not me
  i assume most people get into pixel art because they like retro/indie games most people who like games want to make one dont they
heres one more      i was thinking the same thing but ive grown attached to it i accept butterwitch      i mean sure depends on what youre lookin for though
  animations of the same art style youve been posting  tell me what youd charge for 6 animations of one character same size no bigger than 32x32
  id say itd be around 100 since each animation takes me a few hours send me an email if youre interested  eustaceofanotherrealmgmailcom
op here its nice to see how this thread picked up  ive been practicing different things these days now i tried my hand at portraits trying to improve my antialiasing and dithering
  impressive work the only issue that stands out at least to me is the uneven curves watch the jaggies section in this video to see what i mean 
  thanks anon  heres bigger ill keep an eye on the jaggies is one of the things that worried me the most when i read about them in the links posted here before
im back again i darkened the creases and tried to do some anti aliasing on the magazine
  heres a bigger pic
    an improvement over the previous version to be sure it still looks a little too dark for my tastes but thats me ymmv dont take my preferences as word of god here the antialiasing on the magazine looks good save for that stretch of three pixels at the bottom though you might want to try limiting the twopixel aa spots to one pixel and see how that looks instead but judging the two larger versions backtoback the new version definitely looks better  it has more readable details and improved contrast between the blacks/greys and the yellow on the magazine made better with the aa good stuff man    also for the record when you resize your work do it with 11 precision  200 300 400 and so on resizing with inbetween percentages eg 150 or outofaspectratio percentages eg resize width by 200 and height by 150 can result in the image becoming distorted you seem to have been going for around 7x size so the proper resizing would have been a 11 700 the result of which would be 1176560
  thanks man i had no ideas what aa was before this thread
  so you read tv tropes    spoileri do too/spoiler
    your opinion is basically wrong and detrimental to everyone you give it to
  and no one has to listen to me if they dont want to listen to me dont like that doors to your left
  psure the idiots youre giving advice to are even dumber than yourself rofl   like how do you even take a look at the shit that pixel artists post in these threads and then try to give your myopic autistic ass advice in return   do you fuckers live in a bubble where art doesnt exist but pixel art magifuckingly does somehow   but not even good pixel art made by people who know what the fuck theyre doing but indie pixelshit
  how do you even take a look at the shit that pixel artists post in these threads and then try to give your myopic autistic ass advice in return    by typing out a post then hitting the submit button
  responding to someone who wont even post his own work  why bother
  yeah why did you
hey im just gonna leave this rat having a stroke here but dont mind me please continue
    way to be toxic and serve as a gatekeeper to your sekrit pixel artist club
  have you not seen the work done by the people posting their own pixel shit in this thread this is just an overflow /beg/ thread for people who know even less about drawing than those poor bastards with people giving even less useless feedback as well
  being toxic and an ass towards others isnt better youre making yourself look like a hating elitist
    toxic
  i really like the use of colors and antialiasing here its a really pleasing sprite to look at
  hmm this post is really problematic  thats gonna be a yikes from me  left swipe
  gave you an upvote my man  glad to see someone sticking up to these toxic assholes
                        epic

ive ran into this problem with ps that im trying to resolve but dont know how to fix im trying to use a 4 pixels sized brush to make a drawing 1920x1200 but i dont know how to make the brush stick to a grid when i draw a diagonal line for example i get the effect on the right when im going for the effect on the left    is there any way around this ive tried messing with the settings in ps with no luck
  you cant because thats not how things work
  hmm is there a way to upscale a 1 pixel brush in ps to a 4 pixel one instead while maintaining the grid im trying to draw something like this
  you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a grid is and how brushes interact with them   if you want this magical skipping power that you seem to think should be capable you will likely have to go to something like aseprite which has special tools and settings to accomplish that
  fucking peruvian
      kof sprites in 12 and 13 were ugly horrible colors and most animations are bad 14 even worse animations and style but thats because probably lower budget from snk being purchased by china
  hola canlli
made this in like an hour and a half
  fucking nice work
bumpe
  thanks anon
  you probably want to draw it with 1 pixel brushes and then scale up
wip
  i dig this a lot  only problem i see is her left hand im assuming thats her pinkie finger but it looks like a thumb
doing this for a friend but has a i dont know what that i cant exactly pinpoint  any tips or suggestions so far
  hurry up so i can masturbate
  update
  gonna dump the witches ive made
  this one is really good holy shit
  and this one i just finished today gimme suggestions for more witches
  your animation has such a pleasant flow good work anon how bout a moon witch
  how the hecc
  teach me
i feel like i would do better in pixel art than art how to start
  what software do you use
  congratulations your brain is a low resolution 3d engine
    learn art
  this   pixel art is just low resolution art
  its like saying learn pop music when you want to learn rock
  no its like saying learn to play guitar before playing rock music
well dang glad you guys like em      i use krita it has the most basic animation functions and its all ive ever wanted      do what  says ive done barely any pixel art before but ive studied a lot of animation
remember to keep pixeling and ignore the crabs
  learning to compose boring simple shit in 4/4 in one key only before making actually good music is actually how lots of composers learn though
pixel art threat  roast me
  if youre going to outline with black do the whole robot the head and hands look outofplace by being the only parts that arent outlined
  does liking this make me a pleb  press a to vote no  press b to vote yes
no roast me
  lighting / random marks  thats like part 2 of loomis bro
theres a pixel art digital book called pixel logic by michafrar jontrons pixel artist which are super good and has tons of good examples on how to do stuff and what shit to avoid    youll have to pay 9 but you just pay once and will get the future chapters for free and personally im confident of its value  id also want to charge for making something like this had i made it
  personally i like them a lot  like the other anon said lightning seems a little random on some sprites like the sword and the dude above the chest but i like most of them anyway
  can you post a full page so i can see if its worth getting
      each chapter focuses on a different topic and are released as theyre done
    heres another one this is the last its from the same chapter
    looks good thanks for sharing
    heres a resource lad 
if you are a /beg/inner in art please use this thread to post pieces for critique or ask for advice we should not have to make new threads or post in the drawthread with our fundamental exercises    previous thread  crossthread    feel free to post even the smallest exercise you have done to show you are still trying do not give up make someone proud      read the sticky if you need guidance when you havent even started    sticky     try to give people some feedback  many studies are left unredpilled which is a bit sad and can be quite demotivating for the people that try their best to improve but are left directionless    remember if youve just started out you work will not be good it doesnt need to be just get in to the swing of actually drawing and learning how to study most of all enjoy it
references for drawing
i think ive slowly been improving how do i fix this or place the torso/hand
  start by drawig some reference lines her heads so squashed
  royal lineage probably
does anyone have a guide on drawing realistic fur
concentrating on increasing my proportions and accuracy using the dorian iten guide any feedback/tips will be appreciated more or less i need to know if im on the right track and just need more time practicing    this took roughly 50 minutes using a knitting needle and pencil
dont try to be the best  dont forget to draw for fun  do some scribbles silly cartoons stick figures and other doodles   stay hydrated  get enough sleep   smile while you draw   you can do it if you want to  you will get where you want to go   i believe in you
aim to be the best the competetive alway flourish  draw to better yourself through studies so you can eventually draw what you want to  once you have mastered the traditional method develope your own style and look into existing styles  dehydrate if youre entereting a bodybuilding competition  its not enough to want you must do even when you dont want to   if you wander the roads youll get nowhere without a map  the fastest way will become apparent  dont believe in yourself believe in the me that believes in you
  cringe and bluepilled ngmi    based and redpilled gmi
my art style is boring and tumblrish i dont know how to improve 
  use reference
  stop drawing hipsters
a practice from yesterday
  yep   this one
  youre already better than calarts grads
  i think some corpses are better than them
  it sounds like a compliment but in now way actually is
how should i learn to draw legs and hips better they seem vague muscularly if you feel me the knees always look weird the calves are never right should i just do a bunch of reference drawings or do you think i should study anatomy more ill get around to all of it eventually but i was wondering if you guys had some helpful concepts to guide me
  hhow
  both anatomy and references if you will do only one of them it would take more time to learn it
how do you study anatomy with digital art is it okay to trace do you just look at the picture in another monitor and try to recreate it    what if i suck at using digital art programs how do i get good enough at csp so i can start to do anatomical studies
    learning digital tools is something you must do anon there is no way around it the same way you need to learn how to drive a car to drive a car fret not the basics of csp isnt much different from photoshop or sai or mspaint really if you know nothing of digital tools then t will be a pain and likely take a long time like a few days up to weeks depending you have got the time but it is a skill that pays massive dividends in the long term while you are in the process of learning digital you can study anatomy on paper too the web has a ton of tutorials loomis has anatomy tutorials too    now on digital tools    if you have no access to booklets and dont want to take a course and no other option are open i suggest scouring youtubeor google for tutorial pictures there are plenty of newbie tutorials around for almost every popular software that teaches you the basics of using digital tools    i would suggest starting with paintool sai because that is the most basic digital painting tool that is not shit like mspaint that is really useful and widely popular and since it is free there is likely the most tutorial videos available    goodspeed anon
  also csp has a free online manual and other guides in its website            
i really like inoue takehikos style and would like to be able to draw like that some day will following the sticky get me there or are there any specific books i should read also roughly how much time would it take to get there
going through you can draw in 30 days to get a little bit of a grasp on fundamentals is the book alright ive delved a little bit into keys of drawing but i probably wont tackle it 100 until im done with this one    either way drew a chest for day 5 any glaringly obvious problems that im missing i know im not the best at shading
what do after fun with a pencil
when people say practice doing loomis for an hour a day do you just mean picking some random picture as a reference and then trying to get the anatomy down after going through fun with loomis im a bit stuck as to what a common exercise would be that i could do for an hour each day
  roughly how much time would it take to get there  around 1500 hours of hard focused work
  i wouldve thought much more than that 1500 hours is about half a year at 8 hours a day im curious how you got that number
    after fun you go into perspective made easy and then other loomis books
  1500 hours is about half a year at 8 hours a day  yeah it is but dont even dream about it though   you wouldnt even manage to do it for a month   you will burn out and give up after a week
anyone use sakura microns just ordered some and wondering if theyre any good
  it is impossible to tell how much time you will need to get there life can pull obstacles into your face any time that will hinder your progress
  youre right now that i think about it its one of those pointless questions knowing the answer wouldnt make any difference ill just try my best
  its my first work i just started to learning how to draw even if know how much elements in here are done badly i somehow like it maybe cause i feel a little of movement
think this pose is okay
  looks like that guy who doesnt know how to do hadouken
in the running pose i didnt put her leg at a bad angle right shes meant to be a clumsy runner
  i have a hard time with hand and feet what seems to work for me is drawing triangle and square depending on the position
  no telling i started as a kid and im still learning straight up learned how to draw because a guy on pbs  not bob ross but i did watch it  i cant remember his name but he did basic cartoon drawings using shapes and thats how i learn spent hrs after school learning different style from comic books to lowrider art time
  so i want to start drawing stuff im not in any way gifted i just really fucking want it and i decided to start with buying a drawing tablet because why not i have the money i also have an ipad so apple pencil is an option  considering that apple pencil costs 100 is it the best option or could i get a better drawing tablet for that price
  well yeah obviously
  what do you mean exactly
  i wouldnt buy an ipad but since you have one get the pencil
  okay then thought so thanks

  something i did yesterday
  pencil and paper
  when i was a kid i did this with jcpenny mag and any clothing mail mag at the time i took the pic and separate color and shadow by pen its a good way to understand highlight and shadow
  not a /beg/ please go
  huion q11k
  look for and learn everything you can about gesture
  a drawing will last far longer than your pathetic life if you think theres no difference between portraiture and photography youre kind of slow maybe find another hobby you can understand like collecting stamps
  totally /beg/ stay
  what was your workflow on this and blog
  never forget defining traits  you missed them and she looks like another character cosplaying
have been studying hamptons book and feel like i got better with body what do you guys think
  lol
havent drawn anything for about a year was bored the other day and decided to draw this was the result
  you really need to work on drawing clean and more deliberate lines
  now thats definitely not /beg/ looks good dude
i have no idea what im doing or where im going
  tell me who this is meant to be if you say bowie i swear to god
just starting to get back into drawing heres a few from my sketchbook any input is appreciated
  its no one in particular
  thanks but i still have a lot to work on
  top right has a real handsome squidward vibe going on
  very scratchy and stiff keep up the work though not too bad
whats a good book on hands i feel hoggarth is beyond my skill level right now
    ive been using clip studio on and off for a while i know how to manage layers i know how to select transform rotate etc  but i only use their default brushes because i assume i can do most things with the default tools but i really dont know how to shade or render or do much of anything i dont even know which tool is brush is good for sketching or what stabilizer setting to use     youtube tutorials are mostly it seems either 20 minutes explaining how color wheel and layers work which i know or they are the polar opposite and assume you know everything maybe i just suck at finding the right videos tho
im ngmi guys how the fuck do you keep what you read and watch in your heads as much as i try to apply what i learn it doesnt stick
  by taking breaks often anon i know this sounds weird but taking frequent short breaks is an essential part of the process remember even vilpu said that art is basically problem solving if you just stop and take a break while you are doing your construction/planning/sketching/etc to tear your gaze away from it and break the concentration process and clear your head then come back in 2 minutes without looking at it your mind had enough time to readjust itself to a more critical and problem solving mindset and get a more objective view on the work    just try it do it the pace you feel comfortable take a break in a timed manner like every 20 minutes or take breaks at certain step of your drawing like when you completed the base planning but havent put down a solid line yet or when you are starting to feel frustrated with it whenever it happens take a short break and let the steam out and ease your mind into critical and problem solving mode then come back take a look at it from far away and think do not just jump right into it stay an think about you typical mistakes you know about if they are there
  try this vid on brush and rendering/shading      default brushes are fine yes you can do almost anything with them unless you need a special pattern or something stabilizer setting is should be set for yourself to be comfortable with and not get too laggy or artificial
trying to draw a warrior dwarf girl  is that feminine looking
  not really you should try looking at a real face while drawing and also watch videos of someone who can draw a face draw a face
  sorta i guess    imo eyes are too large compared to face forehead too small even as a dwarf try to get your proportions right i know its a meme but fun with pencil  loomis    entire drawing looks 2d go find prokos videos on eyes ears and mouth and look at how he constructs each feature in a 3 dimensional shape    dont even consider details like youve put with eyes until youve blocked out the basic shapes
  thanks a bunch
what should i do after drawabox also why is it controversial
  i am not good at cartoons at all but here are some ideas anon    your characters seem to all be meek and bored give them more lively poses and expressions make sure their posture is balance and not falling over    simplify you seem to be lost in the details details are good if the basics are sound take a step back and simplify your characters give them dot eyes for awhile until you are comfortable with them    proportions styleiziation is fine and all but unless you go for abstraction there is a limit on how much you can go before your characters turn into static caricatures instead of living and moving ones try to keep the basic proportions of the body in mind like torsoleg ratio armleg ratio armbody ratio etc if you keep these you can draw a lot different looking humanoid characters and still make them look alright    perspective put your characters on the ground make their feet angle downwards since that is how the ground appear if you look down from a standing perspective use curves and circular lines instead of straight lines using straight lines can make a picture look very flat
   advanced symbol drawing
  if youre trying to draw realistic proportions then the middle third is too long
  that is what cartoons are anon
so i bought a beginers wacom like a month ago and this is the first time that ive used it i wanted to start coloring my sketches because i never use color    anyone knows a good book about colours and colour theory i really dont know where to start
  these 3 are pretty good the first especially          
  thanks brah
  the dakside of the cheeks and those baggy eyes make her look malnourished and zombielike maybe she is undead i dont know i would put more meat on those cheeks to make it rounder fuller and more lively
  you are trying to draw a woman with the body structure of a man    mens shoulders are wider than their hips and womens hips are wider than their chest so your characters shoulders are too far apart    oh the traps are way too big as well unless you want them to be that size of course then its fine
  okay i see what the problem is thanks ill keep at this and shorten it up a bit
some timed figure drawings im not sure if im approaching these right i keep wanting to use the same method in the longer poses as i do for the 3060 second ones which are focused more on the action of the pose rather than proportion and anatomy    is there like a specific mindset i should try to be in when doing the longer ones
    based
how am i doing /ic/  trying again after a long time
    thought id have a stab at it anons hope you dont mind
quick sketch experimenting with new brushes any advices 
  vary the brush size so that it gets smaller in areas you need to be detailed/precise with some areas of face and larger where implication is enough areas further from the focus    pretty gud some of the proportions are a bit weird and the gesture is somewhat stiff if i were you i would do some gesture drawings and work on simplifying the body down to fewer curves for ease of understanding
    needed this thanks for the advice anon  gonna keep going for you 3
  thanks anon
  understood thx anon
i just started learning how to draw last week and this is my first attempt at something if i want to draw manga someday do i just focus on practicing how to imitate anime characters and how do i get rid of chicken scratch
  i like the idea and the figures but the background and composition need a lot of work  just now saw i was in /beg/ so this is really good man
  heres my thinking on the issue i have a lot of free time to draw so i like to split my time between doing genuine study and practicing the things i like  so i might spend an hour doing traditional figure drawings and then ill spend another doing freeform sketches  youre more than welcome to copy art you like if it helps you learn just dont try to pass it off as your own but also keep the fundamentals in mind  as thats how youll get the most out of it  try to reverse engineer the art youre copying and figure out how they did it rather than just making a raw thoughtless copy    chicken scratch is easy enough to iron out just try to accept the lines youve drawn rather than assembling it piecemeal
  i dont know if i fixed the problem or not
  the lid is too small to cover the box
    can you fuckers help me already
  okay what do you want help with specifically
  the standard help package
  read loomis and stop shitposting
  why would i listen to someone who cant even take their own advice
  no u   ngmi
i never finish anything any help
  fun with a pencil all the way
  how do you find vanishing points for images like this i dont see any landmarks to do it so id completely eyeball it
  the virgin artist      michad angelo
  i found horizon near the tree in the back sketched rough base outline and used perspective ruler
  what is a perspective ruler
      which of these books should i read first
  keys to drawing or loomiss fun with pencils
what should i do to expand my visual library  i can draw boxes and ellipses but my visual library is lacking
  draw what you see and take mental notes
  thanks anon ill keep this in mind
  working on it
  good keep at it and youll git gud faster than youd think
i have no clue on how to colour things i think this is the best colouring job ive done i dont know if im autistic or something because when i google colouring its the whole dont just use a darker version of the main colour which isnt too helpful when i dont know where theyre supposed to go i want to have it have that 3d look that a lot of anime illustrations have
how do i draw short lines straight long ones are easy to get straight but i tend to overshoot is it just something that comes with drawing 1000s of lines
  anon start by selecting the base colors and then choosing a light source or two maybe and then you can find the shadows and lights much much easier
anyone here have any advice on working with 3d stuff
still very much a beginner despite three years of artschool    i am lacking in a lot of departments i mostly stick to drawing and penmanship in which i am no means a master either but i want to branch into more painterly aspects    im having a big issue of creating contrasting elements in my pieces pic related    are there any specific theories or ways to approach my issue ive seen some links in regards to color theory but i also wanted to hear a general critique as well if anyone is up for it    thank you
  ghosting
whats the best way to learn colour theory im having a hard time getting colours right while painting 
  check 
  drawing and general painting this aside work on your values before you even think about color your value range is limited as hell so there is no contrast pic related yours on the left with the darkest and lightest value on the right after i played with the levels for 30 seconds dont put the cart before the horse and work on your fundies
im trying to get figure perspective right i did this   character from an above point of view but i cant shake the feel that she looks like a midget clear indicator that i got the perspective all wrong i think something is wrong with her legs or i went overboard and made her butt way too big  would like help
  its pretty good anon would fap
  why is her ax so small lmao
  it looks like theres a bit of a fishlense effect going on in her middle area try rotating her legs from the ass down a bit to the right with th epivot being at her ass although ive fapped to that doujin many times and will do so again thanks to you
    thank you would you say that starting with greyscale might be better for me to better detect/establish values
can someone add some more anatomical landmarks to this self portait im working on its hard to see all the bone mass and structure in the mirror im using right now im just not muscular or skinny enough to see all    i have a few anatomical books im looking through but what i need help are just the neck muscles and the arm id appreciate it
    oops stupid phone pics
self portait
  nigga you look like my undead mage in wow
    i want to say id be interesting in knowing what you look like but it would probably give me nightmares and make me believe satan walks the earth
    nigga its just a sketch for a painting im going to do over it nothings final really just getting the pieces in place i get anatomy to an extent especially if i can see what im doing in a model but its harder on yourself when youre just a normal looking person and you have to exaggerate and imagine certain things
  literally nothing about your drawing looks okay
  i get anatomy to an extent  im not trying to be mean anon but no you do not
    yeah no i demand a reference pic because holy fuck
     its exaggerated im on here to ask for help with adding landmarks        but i do i never took a pic of the more finished version of this but i did it in italy in school i think even the unfinished version proves more than enough that i have an idea of anatomy this was 24x36      as i said before its an exaggeration i wasnt even bragging idk what all the fuss is about
  actual cringe from me bro yikes
  i mean if youre going for impressionism then alright sure    if youre trying to do genuine anatomy youre gonna have to study your shit more my guy
    yikes 2 u bro         lol im not chum bum i came on here asking for help with adding some more muscle landmarks because i do have limitations with my anatomy knowledge i am going for expressionism as well its by no means supposed to be a michelangelo or courbet or school study
  any thoughts
first ever time holding a graphic tablet or actually trying to draw anything properly im really having trouble with perspective a part of the charger is in one perspective it feels like and the other in a whole different one what can i read besides the sticky to help on the matter
  giving it a shot
   but i cant shake the feel that she looks like a midget  thats beacuse the proportions are off she is like 55 to 6 heads tall which means she has the proportions of a child  goog job otherwise
  which means she has the proportions of a child  hhot
      oingo boingo brothers
  she could just be a small woman which is nice
/ic/ actually inspired me to do some semi realism today id like some feedback
alright i decided to finally open up any one who has a quick second please give me feedback im still working on it i havent studied and focused on colors but this is my raw skill if you can please be brutal on me i want to improve and i want to know what you anons think   i didnt spend enough time on lips
    you need to study noses way more
  i noticed one nostril is bigger
  just be yourself       gauge how far away you are from your goal practice for a while and check how much youve improved based on the difference in your drawings over time spent learning and use that rate to gauge it you may be surprised just how quickly you can pick up drawing skills with dedicated practice dedication is the only hard part       pencil and paper is always the way to go imo because pocket sketchbooks are easier to bring along with you everywhere irl to do quick observational sketches and dont rely on battery life       get rid of scratchy lines by drawing in ink traditionally
  kind of a vague question
  such a sexy mommy
  push your values more the face looks really flat as it is for example pic related may not have super dramatic lighting but theres still enough variety to create depth dont just focus on darks lights are important too
welp time to fucking quit i didnt realize it before now but looking at this i see i am just completely hopeless
  hyperrealism is a joke
  noted ironically i thought i was lacking ln darker values but overall would you say im going in a good direction i definitely need a lot of work for sure
im 20 and the only drawing ive ever done was little doodles when i was a kid is it too late for me
  no u retard start drawing
  nah time to start start now and you will progress keep stalling and you wont go anywhere
  yes become an architecht
  no im 25 and just starting too join the struggle anon well both make it
hows the pose  feel like the legs should be positioned differently but idk how  also def feel like the boxing arm needs to be redrawn feels flat
  head is not wide enough cranium is too thin eyes are too high features are not defined symbol drawn juicy lighting / value pattern from ref isnt defined and line work is messy
painting no 4 or 5
  fellow mid20s beginner  im also starting as a complete scrub its definitely not too late  we still have a good 30 years to git gud at drawing its a lot of time to work with  hope to see your progress in a few months
  i would try doing this kinda angle
  fuck thats dynamic  but i dont wanna steal  thanks tho
  feel free i dont mind lol heres the transparent lines layer
first time trying 8b charcoal as well as 2b graphite  i think the inside of the hand especially around the 3rd finger couldve been darker    also my detailing on the 3rd finger and pinkie seem blegh  proportionally fingers are a bit too long  any more feedback welcome
starting off with fun with drawing after finally getting a tablet and wondering if i should really stick with it i see myself using the circle tool very often to try and get a perfect head but not really too sure what im doing here some of the things he does later on seem really complicated and come out of nowhere with the amount of details he puts into his stuff i kind of feel thrown into the deep end of the pool should i have started with keys to drawing or drawing on the right side of the brain first
   i see myself using the circle tool very often to try and get a perfect head but not really too sure what im doing here  why the point isnt to get a perfect circle but a near enough approximation to measure the rest of the features    try prokos how to draw the head from any angle on youtube maybe the circle drawing will make more sense after seeing a live demo
  that has problems of its own      just learn to draw and how to think about values first
how do you know how long arms are supposed to be
  oh okay just checked that out thank you ill continue practicing with that
  the head is not a perfect circle
  1 google human proportions  2 find a reference photo for a human and measure relative to other body parts    depending on genetics arm spans could be massively different relative to total height so there is no one right answer    if your character is not facing directly at us/perfectly profile then remember to foreshorten
want to draw goblins and orcs and other fantasy shit  all of these youtube artists saying to start with realism and then work my way from there
  what  said is all valid some more finer details on the nose lips and eyes can go a long way keep the light direction unified and then use the faces surface to put in some more shadows
  this isnt wrong anon the advantage of learning to do realism is that you will be able to produce more varied faces of different races from multiple angles and lighting sources otherwise you run the risk of only being able to do one single face it is a hassle butit is well worth the time invested
  what do you guys think
  define realism
  its pretty good anon except the goofy teeth
  ops pic looks good why is it used for this thread
  not sure if this is supposed to be male of female but i assumed male    it is good usual advice is to push your values and study the nose as  said the nose is a real bitch to learn but it pays to do so    pic my shitty attempt without ref to make it more manly making the face more angled and giving him a more flat and wider chin not sure if you used a reference or not if not then really good job
  by loomis she would be aprox 44  meanwihle actual botw zelda is 57
  nice
  what would be nicer is drawing link like that with a big strogn man next to him youknow like a fahter
  yeah a father that could teach him a thing or two
  its never too late im turning 24 in a couple days and im somewhere between advanced beginner and intermediate  learning new skills is hard but you can do it super fast with dedication and discipline
  be less gentle with the pencil theres way too much white space making the values nearly unreadable
  yeah it was supposed to be a guy really thanks for the in depth critisism anon i saw  but really wasnt sure what anon meant and stayed quiet i see what you both mean now that nose has way more depth i could have stretched that nose and mouth more for a more visually sound expression as you did im noticing i also love what you did with the eye too i used a reference for the hand but otherwise i was just throwing some things together
  awesome this is all helpful thank you for your time
  also interested in this im currently practicing the head and i cant for the hell of me get further than a somewhat okay symbol head all those details he adds just come out of nowhere
  basically make them the length you want as long as you think it looks good the human body is so variable that even if you drew a freak a worse live one has already seen the day on earth
  how long have you been drawing senpai
  wip    what do you think im trying to find my style rn i suck at realism
title    seriously ive seen people bitching about michale hampton drawing like legos and the like sakimichan sucking at anatomy loomis being outdated garbage fuck off      theres some helpful advice here but no matter how good you are as an artist you will find someon that will bitch about something      inb4 you buthurt lol no retard i just lurked
the background is too dark in that picture
  people would criticize even if rembrandt asked for criticism
  this 100
  unironically making an appeal to celebrity    youre right though the worst part is that beginners come here read all the criticism and take it to heart as valid without realizing that very few people on this board know what the fuck theyre talking about
  you buthurt lol
  people would criticize in the wrong way  after hitting a certain level of mastery with the fundamental tools of drawing etc you get good enough at them it becomes pointless to nitpick the nuts and bolts of a drawing and it makes more sense to ask about artistic direction and intent instead  people who are comfortable with the basics need to be told what to draw what they want to achieve what mood and effect their work should have etc not some misguided attempt to undermine the basics  whats cool is that people of all skill levels can make meaningful comments about what effect they think a piece has even lowlevel shitters
  well she does suck at anatomy if you cant see that you might be one of the people who doesnt know what theyre talking about
  but thats wrong you retard
  /ic/ in a nutshell
  brush strokes spread too broadly over key areas makes the likeness kind of mush he painted his own old face the way i would approach a more youthful face and it leads to an unsuccessful likeness for the age he is attempting to portray not my favorite self portrait of his he cant into older faces but thats obvious from his self portraits when he was older its good he challenged himself though
what was the quality of mirrors in his day and age
  they were still 240p standard definition so not as clear as today
  very good as good or better than consumer offerings today on most accounts you have to consider that mirror making was a craft that artisans would specialize in if you look at most commercially manufactured mirrors youll likely notice areas that warp your reflection hand made mirrors from good craftsmen would be flawless pic related a 1700s mirror
  obligatory
honestly i think its one of the worst aspects of /ic/ mindset people here seem to only focus on flaws and completely ignore all of the virtues of a painting or drawing
  no matter how good you are as an artist you will find someon that will bitch about something    thats what makes this board great anyone can kiss ass but a toxic anonymous board full of crabs will always find something in your art to shit on theres value in that
  well she does suck at anatomy    sakimi is actually fantastic at anatomy if you cant see that you definitely have no clue what youre talking about her work has flaws but so does any artist who works from imagination flaws dont mean an artist sucks all art has flaws try drawing some sexy poses out of your head some time i guarantee you its extremely difficult sakimi is really good at it flaws notwithstanding
  its true its not just here though literally anywhere else people will find something to criticize
  do you have eyes
  putting sakimchi next to loomis hampton and rembrant  you absolute fucking nigger neck yourself  i really hope youre baiting
    weak bait
  she actually decent at anatomy since she learned from school and shit it just that after years of painting without careful construction and constant exaggerate her paintings become pretty fucked up
  bumping this old compilation bc op has a good point
  i actually like her work but the perspective is absolutely fucked on that image
  wow those anon criquing da vinci are reallyy reattarded bet they are just begs
  i knew this was an epic moment when i screencapped this makes such a good example of the ignorant cess pool that is /ic/
 be me   19   desperately draw everyday   must become professional animator   dont want to get boring desk job   mileage mileage mileage   be me    24   burnout   stops drawing for a few months   starts drawing again but considers giving up drawing in totality   continues drawing habit   acquiesces into desk job   be me   now 27   drawing every day again   have day job   generally more happy drawing is now exploratory   have improved leaps and bounds in the past couple of years than the few years before      im a fortunate person in that i was able to take up another job in a field i can jive with but ive found that drawing out of some existential desperation pigeonholes you into a tunnel where you cant learn what you want    anyone else have some similar experiences    pic unrelated    any of you guys
since 19  post work
  youve matured and realized this whole art thing is going to take a while to get good at so youve become complacent with having a day job wage slave im almost 25 and feel the same way and a little more happy that i know how to improve after failing the whole time     although the whole wanting to be a mangay man phase hasnt left me yet i dont think it ever will
   stuff from my sketchbook pt 1     i just started picking up ink as you can tell and im still learning
    pt 2
  i too want to be a mangay man
    drawing 7 years for this
  be me  born as a little fucker immediatly start drawing parents tell me since then i had talent  14 years  saw comics from my father badly wanted to draw comics too  started to draw comics teacher at elementary school keep telling me that i got talent  start to date girls telling me that drawing are for kids and laughable  skip to into 28 birthday now  break with last gf done with girls so far also stated that painting and drawing are useless  alone again start with painting/drawing found my original passion again  fucked because wasted years for improving  also fucked because people said that art is only a waste of time i used to believed it low self esteem in creating art
i am kinda giving up on drawing my work isnt that bad gonna keep it maybe as hobby but probably have better hobbies than this still
  it looks pretty good
be 18  be great at painting but bad a drawing  be 20   full time neet used most of the time to improve  be 22 now  pretty great at render and drawing but still a neet  i wonder what will happen 3 years from now
  there is always room and time to improve you just gotta want it
   to date girls telling me that drawing are for kids and laughable  oof
   must become professional animator   dont want to get boring desk job  these two are excusive  t once a full time animator
  pyw
  i think youve done something wrong anon something reeeally wrong
be me  be 16  get my first wacom tablet  start doing horrible airbrushedlooking bullshit  none of the teachers in my art highschool understand what im doing  no art community in my country because its 2005  give up and go study graphic design  hate graphic design and give up on school  work horrible shitty jobs for years  be 25 and get into game design school  quit school because got a job at a production company doing 3dshit  work for 1 year and get laid off because of restructuring  29 getting fat/gray and losing my hair  some 19yo russian kids are better than me  angry at the world because i was born 10 years too early for this shit  redoing my portfolio and giving my final shot at illustration next january  not sure if gmi
    op here i dont doubt it
  youve wasted your life boomer
    probably i dont deny it
  almost everyone has wasted their lives boomer youre one of the lucky ones you can catch yourself in your 20s
    i guess ill keep wasting my life only one way to get better at wasting my life
  why did you have to establish who the story was about three times we fucking know its you and using it at the start is already a shit meme yet you had to use it three more times the fuck is wrong with you  anyhow what was the question
    how about learning to fucking read before you decide to comment shitlord
  you honestly think someone would ask what a topic was about without just reading it again  does the concept of jokes illude you
  asking to repeat he question ironically isnt a troll anon its a joke one that has existed before the internet  you seem to have some basic understanding problems
  the joke getting so wrapped up in criticism unrelated to the topic that you lose sight of the original meaning  for example asking someone to repeat the topic jokingly after going at something at length that is unrelated   now either you are actually retarded or this is some layer of irony in that posting a comic about pretending to be retarded is you also pretending to be retarded in which case good show
    sorry nobody understood your comedic masterpiece anon
  just you really dumbass
  its ok anon you can always try again next time 
  ok dumbass 
      lol imagine being this buttblasted over people not getting your shiity joke
  imagine being so stupid you cant tell if someone is being serious  its ok anon your parents wont stop loving you just because youre an autist
  fucking kek im not even any of the previous anons i just got to this thread that i thought was interesting and instead it got shitposted by an anon who is so unbelievably angry over people not getting his amazing awardwinning joke  just get over it and move on jesus christ
  its ok anon most kids with aspergers dont get sarcasm why dont you grab some crayons and get drawing thats what you came here for right
  he can open a private tab  good boy youre learning like the big kids
  god man i really dont understand why youre so buttclenched over this but i hope for the best of you that youll find something better in life
  so says mrtotallynotasamefag  i think thou dost protest too much
  youre so angry about this its honestly fuel to me keep going anon
  im laughing at this pathetic disrgace of a human being who not only pretends to be someone different but is trying to act disinterested yet still hasnt stopped posting  no sense of irony
  more anon more
bored now youre a one trick pony
  noononono anon dont go where can i get my source of highbrow comedy now
well this thread got derailed
op here something i drew out of boredom am i gmi
  better than 68 of /ic/
  thats pretty precise man
    you two are complete autists and probably underage but i do agree with terriblejoke anon that the other guy is samefagging  both of you try harder next time
thats extremely poor improvement over so much time what the hell were you drawing anyways
be me     18 year old novice artist     been drawing since the day i was born      just now trying to take it seriously     major green eye monster problem     i even think stick figures look better than my art     basically depressed at this rate     begin to cancel projects when my art doesnt live up to the hype     just made this yesterday my first form of submitted fan art since foreverof a obscure video game character
  goodluck man hope you get the job
wah wah wah shut the fuck up and fix your life and stop going on 4chan
  obscure  you are not only an obnoxious little run but a retarded one
   drawn since kid   passed up opportunity to go to art school   went computer science   pretty much guaranteed a job from multiple internship connections   but still regret giving up going 100 art   and i fucking hate programming  i am just 21 so im probably being a big baby but im scared of my future being an abyss of loathing anons
  you made the right decision
  dude if you hate programming you might turn into an alcoholic but thats ok bc you will be richright
  t brainlet who didnt even read the post  christ what a fucking comedian
  bottom face looks like bird person
  hes probably stuck in freshmansoftomore coding classes and has to do a bunch of lame intro stuff coding is interesting when you get to your upperclassmen level classes and get to design your own code to meet specifications for a project    coding is not fun whatsoever when every line is scrutinized and youre only writing code that is tested on specific exercises    but still id rather do something i hated for 40 hours a week in an air conditioned office with unlimited coffee and a cafeteria/snack machine on standby and make six figs than do something i love for a living but have to stress about making ends meet besides if you make enough in your 20s and early 30s you can retire early if you are smart with your  and dont spend it on dumb shit
  when you get older you also get smarter and wiser with that you become more disciplined and can focus more easily  what you experienced is pretty normal
  21  plenty of time
lmao this thread is full of losers  be me  18  140 iq  tfw too inteligent  started drawing as a hobby  meet artists who got 1000  by just drawing  started drawing seriously everyday  be me   19  improved a lot  won a small contest on twitter  got 200 followers and 40
  yeah thats my bad i apologize i was in a bad mood
  doesnt post work
  if you really have that iq then you should get an engineering degree and continue art as a hobby
  besides if you make enough in your 20s and early 30s you can retire early  you anons have a really boring vision of life no great deeds no glorious achievements no our entire purpose is to get the stablest job possible because whats important is that we rack up enough money to buy the latest gadgets till we die
  if youre not living paycheck to paycheck your life is boring and without adventure    lmao what
  hey im glad we got cynics like you makes it better for us that want to die with some dignity
  youre aware that this is an art board right hobbyists dont make good artists you either take the risk and give it your all or spend your boomer years reconciled to the fact that you never got gud
  this is an art board which means everyone who studies art either as a profession or as a hobby is allowed to participate    you also can achieve much success in terms of artistic development without being an artist full time even if you were an artist full time you will be tasked with drawing things you dont want to draw meanwhile a hobbyist artist can focus solely on areas they want to improve on without pressure
  can you name some good artists who are just hobbyists
  wagecuck who has given up dont share your loser story with us who are gmi
  be me  19 and in my dream animation school  realise that i maxed all my stats on illustration and not actual 2d animation therefore i am behind everyone else  get depressed af  too depressed to work on my 2d anim skills anyway  skip to 23  get job at animation studio despite doing jackshit with my 2d skills  i made itpng  first day at job tfw working in animation is like working at boring desk job but worse  working on project you could not give two shits about overworked and underpaid  looks like animation industry in my country isnt gonna get a union any time soon  quit after a month  now  full time neet drawing every day  110 self indulgence with everything i draw  considering going back to college to get boring desk job degree that doesnt overwork me and pays me salary thats more than minimum wage    spend  on degree and gained back problems to realise i just wanna draw as a hobby
    op here    in a sense wandering i spent the first couple of years trying to go for a caricature job and i made many a shitty caricature    then i wanted to do animation and started studying lots of animation tried do do this for a couple of years then realized how time consuming it was and how little actual knowledge i had burnt out and had to reorder my priorities    now that im drawing again im putting in concerted effort to study anatomy and the body in 3d space    also attemping to learn how to ink pic related something i drew yesterday
tumblr nsfw ban and general exodus discussion    old thread 
  female presenting nipples
  female  presenting  nipples
  i keep hearing pillowfortio get thrown around is it any good
  it doesnt get mentioned enough that even sfw content safe in the truest meaning of the word is getting mass flagged people who would have been neutral on this are now also making accounts elsewhere
not sure if anyone on the old thread mentioned it but the nsfw ban is largely because of the huge child porn community that was on tumblr  instead of beefing up their moderation to hunt it down they just abandoned ship and said no porn period
      the nice thing about privatter is that you can use it to potentially grow your twitter account if you have your nsfw posts set to only be viewed by people who follow your account or by people who mutually follow you
  remember twitter is just a temporary replacement
  pornhub is better
  so whats the reasoning behind this who is pressing tumblr
  pleasing daddy apple
  seems way too radical i bet theres something else
  been telling piczel creator for months to fix his ugly looking site  says thinks looks arent important  twitter exodus happens  people would rather go to newgrounds and twitter    twots if youre reading this i fucking told you
    theyre probably also trying to be more advertising friendly
what are you guys using to make your own websites  any suggestions for something cheap for people that dont know how to program that lets you upload whatever you want please
tumblr is where i was getting the most momentum
  squarespace actually makes creating your own website quite easy
  as every single podcast and youtuber can attest
  ive heard audibles a good website too and skillshare
  indeed anon i actually tried their shit out and theres a reason why it gets shilled so much its pretty decent especially for those who dont know a thing about coding
  this kills the tumblr
  and i get my food from blue apron and i shave from items from dollar shave club
  this  baraag had the same privact settings too
what is the best option for posting daily sketches i liked tumblr for that because of the archive and the general freedom of how i can design my display but i draw occasionally some nudes figure studies and getting nuked for that frightens me
  you know what else is great crunchyroll and you can learn more at the great courses plus
    can i use squarespace for free like bigfatfurrycockmastersquarespacecom  i need a website but i cannot really justify the expensive for a paid plan atm
              use newgrounds
  im honestly out of the loop but can someone explain why people think its a good idea to run a website for posting fanart isnt it extremely decentralizing
if ng capitalizes on this to make a comeback that would actually be so based the best times of my life were back in the newgrounds era of the internet
how much traffic is tumblr actually losing through all of this so far  just a minor dip that they will grow out off or a serious hit which could kill the site for good    well if you run an independent website only the server operator could shut you down and if you run the server yourself only your wallet running dry could shut you down
  people are already spreading that newgrounds is evil and has cp so its not gonna take off old internet is lost forever it seems
  just wait until the 18th
lol you guys seriously making newgrounds accounts
  tfw no female will ever present her nipples to you
  i had mine since 2004 
  newgrounds is evil  why
gd i wish that were me    cyancapsule is on ng now cool his work is pretty much my goals though im a sfw artist and always will be    edit 4chan wouldnt let me upload the pic because ng lets you save that raw and i cant edit it with my phone lmoa
whats a good follower count on twitter on newgrounds  i had like 27k on tumblr and i think it will be hard to get back there
  for twitter 1k  for newgrounds 500
  mfw i have 10 twitter followers  its only a matter of time
  i see i think those are reasonable goals ive only had about 100 transfer over to twitter and a handful to newgrounds so there is a lot of growth to be done

  ralph david abernathy sr was an american civil rights activist and christian minister as a leader of the nonviolent civil rights movement he was a close friend and mentor of martin luther king
new challenge when  
awetos you disappoint me with that furry crap stop that    inno thats ok if you want to spend more time than is required though i assumed that the challenge was to make speed drawings in essence you come off as a tryhard    usausa if youre not copying youre one of my favorite artists but i assume by default that everyone does    everyone who missed deadline you dont deserve to have a job i would fire and blacklist you on the spot
love your 3d sculpts bezdomny as well as your paintings theyre really comfy  welcome to /dad/
  its the spergy lunch puncher defender again
  looks like someone is uppity about losing their streak try harder i guess
upeeity get it
  never next
all of you are bad i am the best dont  me
  1
  skipped
ugh some how family heard i started drawing and they made me show them my beg tier shit at thanksgiving they all said they liked it but ive been just replaying it iver in my head oh well motivation i must get good by next year
    youll be the same level next year and have the same experience
any of the people whove been posting since this version of las/dad launched present   whats driving you to keep going at this point   do yall actually think youve improved at all
  show us something
  ive definitely improved a decent amount since dad started up even if its not some kind of 0 to pro in less than a year magic like some people seem to expect out of this    could i have improved more if i worked smarter/harder/longer absolutely but that slow and steady progress is what has kept me around since the start of las plus it gives me a kick in the ass to draw at least something on days where it would be so much easier to slack off so really theres no harm in keeping it up
  this is the closest thing i have to a hobby im way better than i was last year and the year before that so i might as well keep drawing also i have to admit that i enjoy the schadenfreude atmosphere of this place in a masochistic kind of way so i keep coming back
  0 to pro in less than a year magic like some people seem to expect out of this  desu i dont think anyone in /ic/s history has ever achieved this
hi anons second time in /ic/ treat me well
    yes
  nuh uh because i just spent a months wages on a cintig 22hd refurbished on the black friday sale so now i willl good for sure
  youre just like me your cintiq will just become another luxury monitor in no time
  ive been attempting to tackle my weaknesses more than ive ever done in my near 3 years of being here im only going because i know if i stop drawing further down the line like 35 years id want to draw again i dont need another damn if only i kept drawing throughout highschool scenario
goblin slayer challenge rarest badge ever  congrats to all niggers who partcipated
  rarest badge ever  really
  i want to be accountable with how frequent ive been drawing i dont kmow if thats the right term wtv if i stop posting im afraid i might go back to drawing only 23 times every 6 months
  forgot to add  do yall actually think youve improved at all  yeah by observing other dads submissions and learning what i should study instead of mindless drawing whatever on my own
ahh i thought i had another day for the challenge
psa putting down the efforts of others under the comfort of anonymity are prime examples of bitch moves made by certified bitch mades    thank you for reading and god bless
  its not enough that i succeed others must fail
  psa
  thank u anon
  on the contrary my streak right now is very nice and healthy but thank you for asking
  my streak is clear liquid too
dabbb on these bitchszzzzzzz

  definitely not you clover
  rude
new challenge please join

  best challenge  end date  november 25 2023      amen
draw your workstation challenge when
over 200 days and all im doing is regressing i thought the figure/gesture challenge would help me improve bu i can barely get the proportions for my bodies right this is a very cruel joke im quitting once the seasonal challenge is over i need a fucking break already
  rarest badge ever  nope rpg challenge 5 badges
  im in      go 6 days to weekly frequency anon i didnt regret it
  thats an amazing idea anon
anons have a billion challenge ideas and the one that gets made is by the pee poster  lmao
can anyone recommend drawing software ive been using photoshop for years and when i recently tried krita on a whim i noticed that inking was better somehow unfortunately krita runs like ass on my laptop are sai or sketchbook any better
  clip studio paint is great
  cuddles with you
good morning anon
  based me poster made me laugh goddammit
  try adjusting the settings with krita turn off opengl worked for me
  this was my favorite meme last year
peter piper picked my pizza
  i fear that the novemberspective badge is going to be even rarer
dad awetos is drawing a vagoo and not censoring it
  get me my mallet
  im next
time for an official dad poll  of the completed challenges which did you enjoy and/or learn from the most multiple answers allowed          
oh my thank god its finally over
  should be prestige fucking 5
  is it a bug challenge end tomorrow
  never next
  i accidentally put the badge to be awarded one day earlier im not very smart
  welp
wait i dont have to draw figures anymore yay
  based kazoo  treat us with another challenge of your choice please
  i actually started to enjoy it
  me too anon me too  get ready for part 2
  same thing or some alterations
  what kind of alterations would you like
  what about everyone studying the same figure on top of the usual gesture and figure drawing
  i was thinking of making one for pixel art structured a bit like the november challenge so it eases people into it but its kinda niche and im not sure people would want to join its a bit selfindulgent because i personally really love the medium so i probably wont end up doing it maybe masterstudies could be more interesting and relevant to peoples interests and as practice
    yeah same glad you guys enjoyed it too i feel i learned a lot
lewd challenge
  grow up
christian challenge
      it sounds interesting probably we can put all those ideas into another challenge    it will be a magazine with differents rubrics/articles  in example   can be turned into a correspondance column where several anons post their fan art iea study of a specific model   and   can be an illustration for a any rubric    each participant will have to illustrate one specific part of the magazine   cover  editorial  sport article  nature article  scientific article  people article  romance article  movie/game/music article  politic article  correspondance column  1 page comic  7 differences game  news in brief  necrology  horoscope  advertising   what else      no constraint of time spent or style but you will have to fit the thematic and the layout    ill provide the base layout and a mock up at the end of the challenge hope you have some articles in mind
time to flex everyone
  related to this what if we make a digital zine we specify the theme and the format a5 for example and each one of us makes an illustration for it
i need more food challenge drawing food is so much fun
  apple challenge 3
  sammy chamlleng
  sammy chamlleng    edible device challenge    
  dadzine  laszine
  sure a global thematic sounds reasonable any idea
    dad of course    articles or no articles  i feel it would be more interesting to produce illustration in relation with a given article
  yeah something like that      something generic like fantasy art i personally dont want to draw people drawing or something like that   we also should make the challenge with enough time for people to draw as good as they can and make a nice finished piece tier 3/4
    in the example i put water as thematic but i think ill go with urban vs rural if the challenge works we can do several magazines with differents thematics ie fantasy vs scifi or swimsuit   
  draw a box challenge is missing
  they must not have enjoyed it
  i like water lot of interpretation and ideas the challenge could be named dad zine 1 or something like that and we could upload later a pdf with all the entries
  draw a box  isis
  wtf i thought it was just getting started  i was about to move from gestures to detailed figure drawing    man time flies too fast
  tfw people vote for a challenge you created  i am so happy to be part of this community
dammit genzai dont lewd the gems
  isnt this poor gem fucked by everybody though
  water it will be  im currently checking issuu dot com for the pdf import also im wondering if people should draw at 72 150 or 300dpi
good morning anon
good job chums
pretty excited for this dadzine
  not me
im currently aware of a bug that causes certain profiles not to be viewable the ones with flawless streaks  i will fix this as soon as i can
  thanks banana
  thanks banana
  thanks banana
abernathy
 dom    if youre gonna upload the same piece thats rendered out more on the same day just resubmit the damn thing instead of spamming
a temporary fix to the profile viewing issue has been made in the form of expanding the dad levels to 20 winter challenge 2018 has been added a more permanent fix will be made when i have the space to do some really hardcore dev    side note / note to myself since my job requires extensive ruby on rails development and ive learned a lot in the process a lot of the shit i wrote is making me cringe hard i really need to refactor this mess before making more drastic updates like topic challenges discussion of which ill open up at some point somewhere on the site itself    im still in the design/draft stages of working out my vision as far as comments go and i think ive settled on something stay tuned
bless u banana
  nonono the flawless should be only viewable to otber flawless the rest of us are unworthy

___________    sammich breaker

  sonny managed to stay nsfw implies that it was nsfw and remained nsfw
mommy daddy please stop fighting 
  no that statement alone implies that there is a chance it could be a blue board
  please tell me your name so i can save some of my favourite submissions
  why wouldnt it  did some other boards get changed from nsfw to sfw or the other way around in the domain split

bonjour joan my colleague and i will escort you to the chateau of the dauphin or else we will die trying

i want to rip a big one but im in a bus full of people  they probably wont find out because girls dont ever fart
  too bad its one of the only games out there that dont suck
  yeah thats true except only fat girls fart so now i know youre fat
  ahh me so lonely me so horny
  what about fortnite
  br
  lol god no rather not play running simulator
  play darkest dungeon
awetos why are you drawing dead girls and why is it taking you hours to color it
  i genuinely believed this when i was little and thought girls had pee pees i would share a story of a time but id rather draw a comic of it one day i give away too much story ideas on this site
is new masters academy worth it new users only pay 11 the first three months atm im kinda interested
  playing mobas in 2018  there is no greater waste of time aside from playing bethesda games reflect on your actions sinner
  shut up vsock
  you can probably download all contents and share it which is interesting
  i dunno if you can download as easily anymore last i checked half a year ago they switched to another videoplayer one could screenrecord though if they dont mind waiting
    pay the 11 and see for yourself
  make sure to cancel in the second month not the third after getting what you want because supposeddly they charge your card early and you may get got with a full price month
  thanks for the tip
  but literally every other game in the market sucks
  oh wow thanks for telling me i chose premium and im not really into spending 50 bucks on this
  suck my sock
  tfw you fail your own challenge  good job bunnyburger enjoy your superrare badge
  what about the v
    bento im so disappointed in all of us how did we fail
  such a simple challenge too bad time for me to draw less i need refs ofnaked girls on boxes to make me feel better 
  its the curse of challenge creators
should there be penalties for people that dont complete their challenges  as an incentive
  they get peed on
  is that really a punishment
   its unacceptable they should draw boxes for a week
  banned from dad for life without parole
tribunal when
  never gestapo

  man  
  you finally get out of the bus
good morning anon
  thats a nice drawing for once morning
bump
  why would you do that you bastard
  uhm hi good morningn
  i pooped myswlf on the chool bus once it fell out if ny shorts and rolled down to thefront of the bus when it came to a stop a fat tarded kid took the blame and i got away scot free
  they should have noticed on the daily butthole inspection though
  peeposting is ok but pooposting is going too far
many great japanese artists who stream on pixiv with like 25 viewers but you cant ask questions because you cant into moonspeak

i used to hate literal fags i still do after working with one gay coworker for almost a year i realized how creative his conversations were i can see how theyre the ones with the best fashion sense in design some of you gays are alright some
  theyre really alright to me its the fat entitled lesbians that i actually hate
  yeah the fat ones no way i mean the ones who make it their duty to shove it in their face that theyre gay are just annoying    but the 1 gay guy was alright there was another female lesbian but i feel she was just pretending to be gay so no guys would hit on her
    fat entitled lesbians    i dont think ive ever met an attractive lesbian in my life ive seen some relatively attractive gay men but its always these morbidly obese women growing body hair everywhere that are the lesbians
  the girl i knew was a little on the chubby side but no obese and certainty not bad looking a 6/10 at best and was a closet weeb who had subtle anime stuff on her desk that only i knew it was from
  oh and had a nice voice i guess
wtf everyone fucking died

good morning anon
  dont listen to him im the real bus fartposter
  get yourself a porta potty
  hello welcome deviant art dude
  i have no mouth and must scream
  i have no mouth and i must good morning anon
    speaking about buses there is this girl i see at the bus stop everyday but because im socially weird i have never said anything to her she probably thinks im a weirdo but she also looks like an even bigger weirdo i even try not to give her eye contact but in the moments that i do end up looking at her i immediately look away but shes smiling at me just yesterday she broke the npc barrier by doing something shes never done the months that ive been taking the bus route by deliberately sitting in my usual seat she never sits always stands because her stop is short i was so confused and almost sat right next to her that i lost my spaghetti so to speak and sat behind her in a frantic state     i dont get it im only giving her space because i now im a creepy perverted person
  know im a
  stay away from her shes slowly trying to steal your gains
    succubus stealing your gains  worth it
  probably i just dont get women sometimes i hope shes just not doing this because she wants me to say something to her to make the bus wait less awkward then that would be my fault for making her mornings a pain i can see shes very friendly as she always says thank you have a good day before getting off the bus to the bus driver but man she has this weird aura about her always listening to music walking up and down the sidewalkshe might truly be a succubus

goodbye thread
  i will kill you in your sleep    watch with one eye open nigga
  please do i ready to go
is it even worth spending my time on contests to get famous
  an /ourguy/ got his manga serialized in japan from winning a competition dont remember his name
  nope since nobody except artists care for them and not the successful kind     then again it depends on what contest it is if its something like jump a lot of people will see it and you might make a name for yourself if youre good
  serialized  in japan    phew lad
  only if youre good and the contest is big
  which one the dracula one
  where can i find stuff like this for illustrations i would love to have an excuse to draw more and maybe get some exposure
    ive done several art contests and ive got a real love / hate relationship with them on one hand theyre very exploitative of artists and essentially getting a bunch of people to create finished work and then only paying one however if you manage to win some then they can undoubtedly be good money  exposure though if your only goal is to get famous then they is not worth your time      ive won several art contests through them and made a good chunk of change in the past year fair warning though  they are the worst people ive ever worked with and will string you along for as long as they can before they pay you this has happened to every single other winning artist ive talked to      has ongoing design contests for all sorts of different things if youve got a style appropriate for apparel and such check them out you retain all rights to your work even if you win they used to payout 2k per selected design though they changed it up in 2014 now its a monthly royalty payout  if its for a particular themed contest      is fantastic you dont get a whole lot of money but they have a twiceayear call for art that is printed on their beer bottles and packages you retain all rights even if you win  they encourage submissions of already completed work easy 200  published portfolio piece super friendly crew and ive even got a commission or two out of them from getting work selected so much today nov 30 is the deadline for the next one so if youve got a completed piece thats just sitting around on your desk / hard drive its worth submitting up to 3      has an annual art competition thats pretty big a lot of competition but theres a few winners top spot gets a whopping 10k  their work printed on over 3 million beer cans
i thought about entering the ruth borchard self portrait prize 2019
    i dont remember the name at all a thread was made about it a while ago
pens paper ink paint whatever post what youre most proud of or what youre recently working on traditionally  since we dont have a thread like this
made this doodle couple of days ago not really proud but i like it
  did you take that from /cgl/ or is that your work
  its my work bruv d
  get an image resizing app for your phone you can make sure orientation is correct and you wont make fuckhuge pics on computer
how can i take better pictures of my drawings
self portrait that im working on and was proud of but becoming increasingly irritated by it the more i look at it
  i would be irritated looking at that face as well at least you wont be accused of making yourself look more attractive than you are
  i knew i should have added i guess i know how other people feel now
  t no artistic talent in an art thread
  
thinking about doing commissions but i think people want tablet stuff its kind of infuriating to learn digital art when its much more natural to work on a single layer    anyway i drew this recently and it came out pretty nice
  i was going to repost it but i forgot
  gesture battle me irl not online faggot
  post art or begone
tell me what you think
  personally im not a fan of the entire bottom portion of the picture the face and its fracture looks fantastic compared to the lower half    i think her teeth may also be a little iffy but i cant point out why i think theyre coming off as a frontal view when theyre supposed to be angled like the rest of the face    oh and a cloud is clipping into her hair on the right portion of the image
  any tutorials on how to photograph traditional work without having it be too edited my phone pictures of my watercolors look so bad compared to the actual work
  traditional commissions are totally still a thing in some instances good traditional art seems to be more valued than digital of the same quality its just you need to present for digital viewing onscreen or for print that means getting a scanner and learning how to edit in ps once you do that your work will look 10 times better    of course you can always offer the original artwork as a selling point which is a nice benefit over digital
  ive been trying to find a scanner for a while im expecting one on friday and i hope to god it doesnt suck ive gone through two printer/scanners and they have this horrific quality the older models used to do some fantastic scans but i digress    i am happy theres a market for traditional drawing though in some sense im apprehensive to study digital because i dont know how to start without guides at least traditional can be selftaught by observation ive also been told that traditional usually doesnt get paid much while im not drawing for a livelihood this drawing took 9 hours and was roughly ten dollars maybe im just undervaluing myself because i doubt my skill       i guess its just a matter of how willing am to push
  i like it its got real emotion to it and the eyes have life
  look like youre on the spectrum my dude
  like 90 percent of 4chan
  exactly im glad that im part of the 1 unlike you fucking idiots
  was proud of but becoming increasingly irritated by it the more i look at it  can relate lol i think it is a good thing cause it makes you raise your standards let it happen and get a feel for why you dont like it
  90 percent  1  the absolute brainlet
    thank you ill keep working on it and hopefully get it to where im happy with it itd be a first
  teach me the ways of /cgl/ how do i draw cute clothes and hairstyles how do i draw lolitas with nice coords and how do i draw with appeal for girls
  he fell for it    anon if im a brainlet then youre not even human
  based i was only pretending to be retarded poster
a motherly character for a game that im making not a furry btw
  did you draw on a napkin
  its probably watercolor paper
  good birds i like it
been fiddling with this for a bit but have given up due to the spear going off the page am gonna have to mspaint it onto the main structure
holy shit i hate charcoal so much
  what happened to your insta
a little dwarf i drew and rendered during a university class
heres one that im working on it isnt my best
  thats bretty fucking cool anon just post a smaller picture next time cause it doesnt even fit on my screen
soccermomsmug
  way better than anything mr spammer grid hack has ever posted
  reposting from life honest crits please
  its now lunaticmoonart   d
15 min sketch while watching portrait master study of lady agnew so kind of a copy of a copy
  that is a fantastic nose
  its a good sketch but its unfocused which comes from chalk i guess squinting down the whole apparent impression of light and shadow i get changes  therere a lot less dark spots than i assumed at first glance  try to make the light and shadow patter clearer and include more varied edges in your drawing  pick and choose what i said though i have never seriously worked on black paper      i really like this
  little quick cat oil sketch i did right after this
  resize and reorient
  cat looks angry for no reason very realistic work
i inked jacket from hotline miami in fluorescent ink during inktober then i burned out because im a fool
            i like these in particular       i think its okay but could be better the foreground should be more detailed and the blobs of whatever at the bottom look really strange kind of like the idea of liquid dripping but not actually looking the way it would in real life if that makes any sense i see what youre trying to do juxtaposing nature and the city i think thats kinda neat       you can still do traditional art commissions for sure as another anon pointed out your work would go for a lot of money for the crowd of people who want detailed drawings of dnd characters and the like       and for the love of god dont even lift a pencil for a client unless theyre paying you well for your work no one knows how to price or value art which gives you the freedom to value it at what its worth 9hrs  90 bare minimum probably more because what youre doing requires training and study it isnt menial work that any untrained person can do
  at what you decide your time and effort is worth
went way too light in the shadowed half of the face and now it doesnt look like its in shadow anymore fuck me
  nice work anon
  thanks for the crits anon ill try to be more conscious of the light pattern and edges in the future i think it will help with the feeling of presence in a scene
  do you have social media/blog/website i really want to see more of your work
  i do but its just bland portraits and bad excuses so i wont post it  but there are a ton of interesting portrait painters on instagram if you are into this stuff
  fuck das guüd mane
reporting in
  id like anyone to crit this based on whatever they want do you like it or not what is wrong/right just your subjective opinion    a bit dark and unrefined but there is a feeling of space that i like
  nice choice of medium but you arent really taking advantage of it and the subject itself is pretty boring the roots are kinda interesting but the lack of contrast between them and the rocks take away a bit from them and the rest is really bland like the tree trunk that is pretty uniform then somehow it just turns into leaves  and the composition is really bad  and why are some parts of the black lighter than the others shitty camera or stained by the white looks very amateurish
first time using charcoal it was pretty fun to use albeit hard to control is their some easy way to stop this from smudging now that im done with it
  you need a fixative for charcoal most common and easy to use are the spray ones   you can also use hair spray as a last resort but it stains the paper
  its my preferred medium by far the drawing was made 90 at the scene and the rest at home with no ref i agree with most of your crits and ill remember this when planning the next drawing the light and dark patches is on the paper its not the camera thanks for the crits i really need to get some input cause imo it looks interesting in a way that it keeps me looking and im pretty happy with it even if it seems unfinished/amateurish i can definitely visualize this as a better version of the drawing thanks to the crits ive been getting keep em coming
  use hairspray to fixate
just drawing whatever feel free to tear it apart
        please respond
ded thred
  another oil sketch
this thread is going to have trouble competing with the sketchbook one
  why does it do this
  see  
pic aint mine    what are some common practices among most professional artists to just improve muscle memory / creativity / quality    some ive picked up are  drawing with your hand on another paper to avoid smudging drawing with your whole arm not just wrist draw lightly first wait a day or so before finishing a drawing
  do stretches
  muscle memory  draw a lot every minute you can  creativity  that ones a bit different for everyone i know that because a lot of pros talk about where they get their inspiration most will tell you to go out and travel to meet people to read depends on what you want to draw really personally i like to just read and watch a ton of shit and take notes of random ideas popping up now and then  quality  pump out more finished pieces fix or redo shit you did wrong each time you fuck up
  creativity  find things you like and find lots of it search every nook and cranny
would somebody like to comment on it
  sage and hide
    hide thread    thank you 4chan
  you are better than firez
sage
  i know
  sage
  you really are
asymmetrical skull awful
  thanks most people are including illustrat
  please stop making separate threads for your artwork and think more about your lighting values need work too stop just highlighting every edge in white no matter where it is  outside that this ones an improvement if you just spent more time learning than shitposting
  you always just argue with whatever /ic/ says why do you pretend like you want comments
  i like it looks much better than your other stuff  keep studying and focus on construction of the head
  moving up in the world chauncey
  let us know when you have one
  no also sage and hide
  sagehide
you are the best illastrat
  sage and hide this nigger shit why do you even come here you dont want critiques
bump to get people in if this interests you
  tfw when its no different than talking in /ic/
who keeps drawing dicks
  whoever the blue guy is fuck him
dang no good on phones
    woah cool thread    can we always have one
  so this is the true power of /ic/ looks like i overrated our drawing skills and seriously underrated our collective autism
minus the dicks this is actually really fun
  this is why /ic is superior
  the white board should be permanent so post the link again if the thread dies
shes mine bois
tfw edge of map drawing a cute gf for some anon to come find  tfw some anon finds it before i finish
  you want the attention moar
    omg so hot
  yea whats your blog or instagram i love that style ahahah 3
nice
ii finally got a gf this is the happiest day of my life
  its a dude drawing those hahahaha probabaly some scrawny japanese boy
  tfw no japanese shota bf who draws free gfs for lonely and horny anons
bumping cause this is great
   holy shit muh box got raided
did everyone leave
all of the best drawings are by lonely and horny posters   huh who woulda thunk
  im better than all of you tho
  i spammed pls be my gf at every girl drawing ironically though
  only if youre a horny and lonely poster    no you ironically ironically spammed pls be my gf
legit fun also anons are fairly talented all those cuties
this is great really fun being able to directly interact with other anons some people were getting live critique and advice as they were drawing pretty cool
i would join too if it wasnt for some homosexual drawing dicks everywhere
  the dicks have calmed down for now
  where is she i need a gf
  she isnt real
does anyone remember iscribble
  time to draw some more dicks
well looks like someone nuked the board time to start again i guess
        anons have fun and draw  someone who cant draw comes in and messes everything up  sums up the history of /ic/ pretty well desu some of the other stuff is still around if you scroll tho and my hidden gf is still safe
    anon was kind enough to clean the board for the next round of drawings   besides thats the point of screen captures our work is saved here
  the dick drawing survived  absolutely based
  the  singular  there were so many dicks they cannot die they are like soviet soldiers in ww2
  dick wip
fucking squarefag he destroyed our legacy are you here anon cun no homo
  i am here squarefag deserves the worst   no homo owo
  do you have any scrrencaps this character was bretti cool i miss him full homo

strange farting sound
  lel
i cleaned up a lot of poop
i dont know who gianluca is but you seem to have some obsessed cyber stalker that keeps filling the entire thing with a message about how he loves youi removed you name like 10 times and its always back as soon as i look i recommend staying away
  anon but thats probably some anime girl lel
  gianluca is a boys name though
apparently it was a femanon but with a drawing of a girl next to the message i guess the drawing mightve been by someone else

who let the underage r3dditor loose who erased the ahem pepe  you have to go back
  
i didnt snap everything
  i watching that pepe fuck the anon who ruined it
fun
til if you hold shift you can scroll sideways with the mouse wheel
  heres the full thing lets do make this thread a regular thing
the ahem pepeerasing sperg keeps following me and erasing everything i draw and write for some reason  is that you janny
  man im so lonely and horny should be the motto
drawing in secluded corner  window freezes  refresh  its gone  im done with this semen slurping server
  tfw someone drew better sailor moon than yours and embarrassed your pathetic skills  wew lads feels bad
  everyone is at different levels dont worry about it anon

  consumer model and still coin operated milkin the betas in the future ahhahah
someone is erasing everything
great job you fucking autist
  i tried censoring dicks but someone kept undoing it  how come they cant undo erasing
  cant be upset the board is temporary in nature
god please is it possible to clean everything up
that autistic faggot who is trying to erase everything for 3 hours
  we can start a new board if theres a poop overload
  we should in the new thread
eraserfag here thanks bros had a lot of fun 
  i said more numbnuts
telephone chad vs smartphone virgin
  as far as i can tell it automaticly cleans the oldest strokes
  sleep well
  i erase random strokes that ruin good artwork
this is pointless if faggots here are allowed to erase whatever they want
  this
  youve obviously missed the 60 images posted from the board so far in this thread    only times its a problem is when the artwork is in progress which is rare
  yes im probably missing 800 images cuz faggots keep erase them
  kek there are not that many people drawing there are about 35 actual artists drawing shit and they only do 12 works a day
holy shit    all the original art is gone    wtf nooooo
  at least he gave up of erasing everything
  ahhhhh fuck im so lonely and horny ahhhh
what should i buy to draw with a stylus are you drawing onto a flat monitor so you can draw on th image or on a pad
  most use a tablet without a screen such as a wacom bamboo or intous
the dev has reached out to us on the board and would love feedback on how to make his site better for us drawfags please list any ideas yall have
  
  i think it would be good if others cant erase your drawing
  ask /g/ for help lel
  i could see that being horribly abused
a few ideas foe dev   blinking cursor when user is typing   optional cursor at users mouse position something like flockmodcom   optional user names display next to cursor   colour picker   shortcuts for tools
  to many dicks
  the dicks are great imagine irreversible squarefag
  how can we solve thisblacklist
  as it turns out theres a max number of elements that can be saved
  im not sure i think only the dev can see specific users all boards are public so theres no one in power that could enforce a blacklist
  the dev would need to implement the ability for users to box off their own area obviously with some max size limit    then users can choose to make it a white or blacklist by denying/allowing users even better is if each user had their own layer and some subset of layers for just them
  i also think some area where it opens should be default public like it is currently     the dev can get many paint editor tool ideas from the various programs out there already priority should probably be transparency/alpha layers and brush types but feel free to add as i am new to drawing
  i cant even use layers in a normal program  feels bad man
a normal eraser would be nice
  room for comments outside the box
  not sure how drawing programs work exactly but this might be difficult because the board is vectorbased  every stroke is a curve not saying it wouldnt be possible but it might be a bad idea on such a large canvas erasing a single line like how you would with pixelbased tools would create loads of different curves and apparently theres a stroke limit so this could be easily abused
  tfw thats literally me excepting i have a senpai  oof
  seconding these color picker and maybe username cursor stuff like flockmod would be nice  also a better erase tool one that doesnt erase an entire stroke at once but just you know erases like erase tools in any other drawing program  if thats too difficult/impossible to program then maybe just being unable to erase other peoples lines or if this would be abused just being unable to erase another persons line for a period of time   would also be nice if there were some sort of ban feature say if 3 users blocked another user they would be kicked from the room/canvas i really dont know how this stuff works though  i also found that i would often accidentally erase lines i didnt want to eraseand sometimes others lines when i hovered over them after erasing the intended line i suppose thats just how it works but it seems janky and definitely not optimal
  same
ccan we do this again i missed it
  im drawing alone where are you
  i dont even know im just looking at everything trying to dodge all the penises
gj for the anon who did it the cat and the rataouile guy
my contribution
  idc i want her still
hi dev here    answering a few questions     there is indeed a maximum number of strokes that can be stored in a board this is currently set to 32 768  i implemented it mainly so that the board does not take too long to load let me know if you would like that number increased     im done with this semen slurping server  its not the server its me each time i restart the server because a new feature is added for instance your page reloads    having a way to ban misbehaving users would indeed be great this is on my todo list but this is not trivial to implement    smaller features like adding transparency will come sooner    i saw people complaining about my awesome line smoothing algorithm does it annoy people  would you like to have a way to disable it 
  add some kind of map or pointers where are the people actually drawing at the moment  peeps just scatter around and you cant draw together with them
also if you want to translate wbo in your language you can post a file with the translations here you can use the reference franch translation 
  line smoothing isnt bad but i think its too strong and its hard to make more detailed or wobbly strokes
  is that proko
  an idea would be having areas be unerasable for a while if enough users marked it as such so nobody will copyright his trashy dick scribbles while good drawings can stay up for a while  implementation wise maybe once a user selects such an area via geometric shape or preferably lasso tool have it be marked and clickable for others with a simple yes or no button for saving it or not also maybe instead of temporarily being off limits it could become part of the background so you can paint over it but if you erase the saved drawing comes up
another suggestion for dev regarding erasing  maybe some sort of local timer could determine how much a user can erase at a given time for example if a user just joined they cant erase anything apart from their own strokes as time goes on they gain the right to erase more and more
    get rid off the eraser tool    anything that has been drawn for more than 5 minutes should not be erasable that way it gives the artist time to fix stuff
is anyone else annoyed by the super large drawings theres no need to zoom out all the way and draw that big
  yeah theres no point to drawing that big i think its mostly done by epic troller folks
  saved this glorious image for future use thank you based anon
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh im so lonely and horny why cant she be my gf aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh nonononononononononoooooooooo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
  im sorry shes long dead
i think we need a real eraser but also an undo function that replaces the current eraser
  lol nice rip to our nigga ratatouille    im having a lot of fun with this program perhaps a little too much fun if you see what im sayin its a similar feeling to writing on a bathroom stall
paint bucket puhleaze
dev i would make the board erase drawings after a few days rather than a total element count if the board gets full then there will be no room to draw i also think if the board was constantly changing it would cause people to come back to see the changes and not have to search through hundreds of old pieces
stop making the canvas bigger ffs
the art keeps getting better and better
hi   what do you call a normal eraser  is it just a second pen tool that would paint only in white    its easy to do but im not really sure i really want that the number of strokes would increase dramatically the drawing are vector graphics as opposed to pixelbased it has several advantages such as letting you zoom indefinitely while keeping sharp edges but is has the disadvantage of having to keep all strokes even these hidden by other strokes   the good news is that the drawing code is currently quite suboptimal there is room for improvement when i improve the rendering speed i think i will allow more strokes and think of adding a whiteonly pen     a fill bucket would indeed be nice but i have no idea how i could implement it in an efficient manner     i put up a list of feature ideas on github    feel free to contribute
  no this would be a terrible idea imagine how badly this could be abused
how do you guys get actual smooth no lag drawing it takes like 10 seconds to draw a single line and i can only do straight lines fuck my shitty laptop cant do fucking anything fun in browser i guess
i am working on performance improvements the line drawing code is indeed slow and does unneeded work   if it doesnt help enough i could even disable line smoothing completely on slow devices
  yeah i think people just want an unerasable white brush tool that would be difficult to implement in a vector based drawing program and youre right about performance as well idk what a suitable alternative would be the fill bucket isnt that important imo and it has the potential to be easily abused/fuck up the board
  honestly it could be mspaint levels of tools and id be satisfied but honestly my issue might still happen even if you adjusted things this has been an issue for most any browserbased drawing sites on my end cant even do swapdoodle or any guess the drawing type sites  wish you the best in development though white boards are always fun to hang on    image  salty attempt to pretend i drew on the board
    1  no bucket tool op i dont imagine this going well in any way people can just fill shit in with a regular pen tool or something hell ive accidentally fucked up drawpile boards by accidentally using the bucket tool  no bucket tool man no matter how many people request it
  fill bucket could be limited to a certain area pretty easily alternatively having layers would solve this problem almost
is the board not loading for anyone else
  to be clear having a lower layer you could fill in easily without having to worry about going over lines outside would need some cleanup but this method would eliminate 75 of the work
  ive noticed that some drawings get messed up if they are too close the boarders sometimes to the point where they all get smushed into one line
    couldnt you just adjust the line formula by adding exclusion zones ie   fx  x2  2  10  x  200  based on eraser border positions when used   how much storage would be required     i think having one click erase for an entire vector is nice helps clean up poop much faster without erasing work beneath it and then a spot eraser for touch up    the problem with painting in white is that if we add layers to this program it will be hard to see and manage where these white spots are
  i have the same problem its probably bad connection
  its fine here
i contributed
i say just keep is as simple as possible no opacity no layers no paint bucket which could easily be abused just simple vector drawing
  the main problem with a spot eraser is that it would create extra curves which because of the stroke limit could have adverse effects on performance and the rest of the drawings on the board think erasing one line into 100s of smaller lines 100s of other peoples strokes would be removed as a result
  this no need to complicate things i personally like that every stroke can be removed just by clicking on it things would get very messy otherwise and hard to clean up
  it wouldnt create extra curves because it is still the same vector/element visually yes element wise no
    also the board still wont load for me
the board works for me which browser are you using do you mean that the page doesnt load at all or that it loads but you see the board as blank
  see    not that guy but im not sure what you mean by spot eraser do you mean just drawing over existing curves with white curves which would in turn create more curves than necessary i assume you mean instead of deleting the entire stroke you would be able to delete portions of it which yes would create additional curves / strokes
  chrome or vivaldi board is blank
  example
hey uh snap person can you post some snaps
the canvas keeps getting bigger
lovasoa  suggestion  maybe add an option to limit the canvas size
is the site down for anyone else
  yep
  workin for me
  502 bad gateway for me  using updated firefox browser maybe i should clear my cookies
  nevermind all my hard work is gone because it didnt boot me out after a 502
  i wwas making something nnice for the board
  502 for me as well
  im also getting a 502 lads ffuck i knew it was too good to be true at least we had fun while it lasted
  still drawing locally     relax desu the dev is in france and is probably asleep right now
  fuck
looks like its back up
yes i restarted it when i woke up im going to investigate on what happen but i do not have much time now i also have a paid job 
  
  he does it for free
  based thank you
anyone else hate everything theyve ever made and feel like a complete failure and imposter
what ew no
    yea its called being an artist     that feeling will never leave you you could be the next ruan ji you will hold onto that pitty for ever
no ive made some outstanding art i am going through a difficult patch though
  i actually really like my work i just feel like everyone else hates it but i would never admit that insecurity irl because im too prideful
  ya thats normal if you like 1 out of 10 things you make youre real lucky
  only with commissioned pieces
a lot of it yeah some things i still like though even months later i think one reason it happens is when you stagnate i had to admit to myself recently i was avoiding painting digitally not because im a line artist and thats my identity but because it was hard for me i feel better now that i confronted it and am learning new skills maybe try doing something totally different from your usual
  its good to have some level of selfawareness that your art will always fall short of your ideals its better than being a delusional turd its good to have balance though and not take the selfloathing too far your art will suck most times and thats okay everyone elses will too
  yes but not really i just operate under the principle that literally everything i work on will always be a wip so i often hate things that ive done and mistakes that i made on a painting but i still kind of look at it with a happy nostaligia about how it happened and i often like them for what they can still potentially be next time i work on them
why its hard to learn to draw in a nutshell    pic    of everything ive tried to learn art is by far the hobby with people being the most stingy with knowledge you can learn programing music and math free with ease with drawingwell i dont need to tell you most of the tutorials out there are crap or how many successful artist paywall their knowledge    sure some are just crap teachers but a lot specially the youtube edutainment crowd dont actually want you to surpass them     i am not bitching about not knowing what to do im grateful people here recommended me loomis vilppu and hampton or i would be lost those are some of the few great artist that actually share their wisdom    but as a /beg its easy to get lost with shit udemy courses crap tutorials on youtube or as i have read some people spending thousands of dollars on things that are free great artist sharing tutorials with info you can get fro free in da    tons of tutorials that make dependent of there teachers    there is some information out there worth it you know the usual hampton proko loomis but overall yeah
  its another conspiracy thread that puppet masters at the top keep control of the /beg/s    heres a goal anon why dont you just get good and then expose these tactics to the world and to /ic/ go find the perfect learning solution to art
loomis wasnt the only good old school tacher but the fact he wasnt stingy is probably why loomis is a legend to this day
  what the hell its not a conspiracy theory i am not saying the ilumunati or some shit are involved i am simply saying most artist are stingy as hell with knowledge      heres a goal anon why dont you just get good and then expose these tactics to the world and to /ic/ go find the perfect learning solution to art    nice strawman like i say everyone already gives good advice here
  then find out what theyre being stingy about and expose it to the world because the best advice ive ever heard from almost ever single one of them is to continue drawing everyday
  no shit sherlock
  then stop giving shitty unwanted advice i am not asking for art advice     everyday    not shit sherlock
  every master at drawing tells you the same draw everyday and you can see they sucked dick at the beginning   hurr durr people must be cucking me knowledge because i cant reach their level with 2 weeks    drawing is hard to learn because it takes a huge price emotionally thats why people who start early have this advantage because they already drew 100000 bad pictures before when they werent selfabsorbed    and you compare your early work with the masters and feel bad     even tho you ignore you dont have the muscle memory to reproduce the same work of someone with over 10k hours in their craft    just stfu and stop bringing down teachers and people who try to make the art community better for everyone
  nice strawman you defeated the argument i never made nobody is saying drawing a lot is bad advice retard      make me
   can learn programing music and math free with ease with drawingwell i dont need to tell you most of the tutorials out there are crap or how many successful artist paywall their knowledge    this is because by comparison to everything in that line besides maybe musician making a living as an artist is incredibly difficult even if there are a lot of jobs work is most commonly projectfocused not formal employment and can often leave gaps where youre making no money teaching is one of the few ways an artist can smooth out these bumps in between roles or generate passive income    they dont care if you surpass them because that implies they care about you or see you as a threat and having taken several classes with really good students they dont they are mostly just trying to make their profession work for them so they dont have to work in fast food or whatever     artist sharing tutorials with info you can get fro free in da    the important bit da lacks having taken several classes from far superior professional artists is workflow and mindset     to expand on the above pros use a fuckton of hacks to deliver high quality results in short timeframes and may feel too embarrassed to share their tricks publicly online because they use it in their work and like a magician when you know the trick the impact is damaged its less that they are being stingy then not wanting to admit things like   im embarrassed that i use a single photoshop brush for trees i made five years ago no ones noticed yet heres how you do that heres how you color them quickly and never draw trees again its a huge fucking waste of time when you have deadlines
  can you please direct me to the best resources for learning music for free consider me to be a complete layperson
  i think drawing itself is not the hard part but its developing the eye to see thats difficult
  taking life advice from the dilbert guy  how about no
  bruh you can learn music theory anywhere the resources are endless but knowing theory wont make u a good musician deadmau5 can make great shit and he only knew basic music theory go learn frequency modulation instead its more of sound design then music but you can build that on basic conceptstempobeatrhythm accent ect
   i am simply saying most artist are stingy as hell with knowledge    literally dozens of them sharing knowledge regularly on youtube you dont even need to read books anymore
random 14 year old korean on twitter  draws amazing street fashion inspired anime girls with hyper realistically rendered shoes and his ipad    bitter /ic/ anon  grinds loomis for 10 hours per day  draws concerned looking men with fedora and constipated looking soldier men with numb pencils on checkered paper after hes done with loomis in order to have his portfolio appear serious and employable  blends his pencils with a wet finger
i wish i was korean
dude get inspired by something    try your hand at some street fashion art
  aka something that isnt just loomis
loomis and grinding fundamentals will not only make you stop enjoying art but in general regress your ablities
  grinding loomis for 10 hours a day isnt going to make you a good artist its just going to make you good at copying loomis
  thats literally how most asian people are taught to learn   rote is the asian way  but it can only help so much you gotta break the conditioning with some severe mental fortitude and get that creativity flowing       also ironically when choosing artists for my old work in advertising wed rarely look at the subject of the drawing rather the flair unique touches or approaches general mood and artist profile   a serious portfolio may actually be detrimental
  so i have to copy other people
  yeah just copying one person all the time can be detrimental try learning from different information sources at the same time this worked better for me at least
  checkity china the chinese chicken   you have a drumstick and your brain stops ticking
    not exactly try to learn from various sources and places maybe try learning the basics until you know how to properly copy other art styles but if your looking to do your own art style  just study anatomy or take influences from other people
  10 hours per day  how many days id give you at most 2 weeks at most of study based on posted work    this isnt a sprint youll burn yourself out before your skill reaches a meaningful milestone  5h of focusedno cheating work might turn out to be far more beneficial if you add an hour or two on searching something interesting to add to your tool set or something new to learn    also your mental attitude is as important as your skills willingness to putting in the work is something you can augment with right environment people you surround yourself with and correct frame of mind    steal like an artist steal from the little korean shit when it comes to draftsmanship there is no copyright
im an eit and make good money i like to draw anime boys as a way to decompress because cute anime boys are pleasant to look at
so im seeing a lot of beginners now and the threads have moved on from how do i draw like x which in most cases is just an excuse to make a thread about a certain artist to how do i draw in general a huge amount of these threads are just filling the board with unnecessary questions that are already answered in the proper places vg beginners thread the fucking sticky and plenty other generals so we need to make a bigger thicker and massive sticky so that it actually sticks onto faggots so that they can learn how to read once and for all
current small sticky serves as a pleb filter people who first come onto the board and actually read it are gmi while newfaggots who post their garbage as a new thread wont keep it as is
  from the mod stickied post   realization that nothing happened   were at round 3 now  also there was an attempt at something     we need to make a bigger thicker and massive sticky so that it actually sticks onto faggots so that they can learn how to read once and for all  i half agree but what youre saying sounds like it will just end up being a big sticky 2 that just has a list of more resources and vague ideas but that isnt any more specific on how to learn ultimately the current stickies and most advice given boils down to read everything draw a lot and figure everything out yourself and that leads to people understandably coming back to find ways to make their journey clearer and easier a get good guide in a similar vein to the book lists or aguris guide but with more specific actions and study tips is what people are looking for when they make all of those threads the devil is in the details and we all have our own ideas about learning art effectively so whether things could actually come together in making that guide is uncertain    well if something actually gets created here anyone could use this thread to submit in the feedback page  like it says in pic related getting ids for this board is more important though
  the new sticky is actually a pretty good resource if you havent seen it already  
  getting ids for this board is more important though  learning how to draw instead of wasting your time with this prattle should be of utmost importance t b h
  thats what i was referring to when i said big sticky its respectably widereaching and it touches a bit on what people are looking for here and there but it doesnt put it together and still boils down to read these resources to learn more      agreed but learning and sharing with others makes learning to draw easier thats why this board exists and why so many are desperate for good art communities ids would give us that an environment with less shitposting having people collaborate on a better guide would help with focusing more on drawing and less on is drawing this really helping me or am i doing it completely wrong again and not making any progress so its worth a bit of time to attempt to get the ball rolling
  i never knew that feedback page even existed at all is it even being actively checked or not
give up /ic/ was a different place when the sticky was made  its on its way out nobody cares about it anymore
  agreed except for the dickord shilling
  the bigger the sticky the less people are going to read it    it needs to be concise not longer
  is it even being actively checked or not  who knows its apparently where the mods will still send people if you try to ask for new features on their irc channel according to /qa/ a month ago
  both stickies are awful its like reading a table of contents about illustration it lists all the points of progression without going in depth on any of the starting subjects there are no comprehensive lessons for a noob to follow    instead of recommending loomis keys drawbox /ic/ needs its own beginner primer if it wants people to take the sticky seriously people here dont even believe in these resources so noobs wont either    its probably too much to expect from this board since no one is owed anything besides that the sticky seems to be written by people who have little to no teaching skill to start with
there also needs more removing on certain threads that just shits the board
  i found the sticky when i was 17 and helped me a lot retards that are handed free resourses that tell you how everything is made but cant be bothered to read it or even look at the pictures and think for themselves are beyond any help
you guys want me to make a small sticky too like just a list of exercises what would that look like    i feel as though going down the road of super precise mentoring and hand holding will lead me to write  draw 300 gestures  draw these 10 paintings here are the images draw an image of x and post on alt for advice    but obviously thatd be more soul crushing than the big sticky    alternatively if were trying to dodge the how do i draw like x i could put a big disclaimer at the top but realistically that wont stop them    i think its fair to say everyone who has read the sticky with a love for learning comes out of it equipped enough    tldr what do you guys want a second  small sticky a hyper specific guide on how to draw something else
  reddit spacing    also we really do need ids it would save us the people most vehemently opposed to this are the shitposters anyway
sooooo lets start making that sticky guide then lets take it real slow and build it up bit by bit since there is a lot to consider the creation of this guide would be to help address some of the problems people have with this board and bring it a little closer to an ideal state that leads to the questions    how would you like this board to improve what does your ideal /ic/ look like    people here have the desire for an art community where they can get good critique and study tips talk about jobs explore ideas and design do challenges make art friends and connections and just generally make growing as an artist fun all of those things scarcely happen and are often low quality even for the times when people with similar ideas try to band together to make an ideal smaller community things fall apart pretty much all art communities are lacking and the main reason is that everyone has trouble learning effectively and consistently that leaves people scrambling to find their own way to improve unable to properly help others and avoiding doing creative art/discussion due to lack of skill/knowledge/experience    an /ic/ learning guide/regimen/routine would help people stay focused on one thing and give a common practice for everyone to work together on until the average skill of the board raises i have my own specific ideas on what that could look like but what do you guys think
welcome to /ic/  artwork/critique    check the catalog before starting a thread we have various general threads for honing creative skills sharing different types of art asking questions discussing artists mentality and sharing resources otherwise keep any new threads towards the discussion of styles techniques mediums and other aspects of the visual arts   other creative boards exist be sure to use the right one /i/ /3/ /gd/ etc    helpful resources  efficient learning guide goes here  artists improvement obstacles overview an introduction to common issues   how to draw an /ic/ guide a quick beginners guide   big sticky a lengthy artist guide   the w/ic/i a big index of art related sites and resources     please give useful criticism helpful tips and encouragement to your fellow artists remember only constructive criticism is permitted if you cant say something that will help the artist improve dont say anything at all rude or offensive comments will result in a ban and should be reported singling out individual artists for trolling or abuse will not be tolerated no vendettas or community drama 
  ruined your post with your last sentence
why would you follow something from   guy who cant even draw   but i wasnt the only one who written the sticky  whoever else did isnt even good at drawing
  we need ids  4chan    wow the tripfaggot is also a newfaggot who wouldve guessed
  there is nothing bad about this board getting ids people can talk about how good the past of this board without ids was all they want but the fact is there are more people here now and that leads to more shit being tossed around muddying discussion and fewer skilled artist who are willing to put up with that to post here things need to change for /ic/ to get better    in an ideal world a new guide would be enough but things wont change significantly in the beginning especially without effort to build/promote the guide which will obviously be the case since little people care to get involved in meta board improvement as opposed to posting in a feels thread or shitposting and tighter consistent moderation would be the hardest thing for us to get especially with 4channel coming soon but ids would work on their own and have an immediate positive effect of slowing shitposters down and just in case you or others dont know ids work on a perthread basis
  the big sticky is the best resource around    pol has ids its still 4chan ids only prevent samefagging and aggressive shitposting
          wouldnt the id here just end the anonymity tho because people know who you are just by your art so if you post your art once you are not anonymous anymore    if so why not just use any other place on the internet
  thats not how id works please at least read through the posts you are replying to
  i read all comments tho     is it not the case that if you post your art and make a comment in the same thread they will have the same id
  it doesnt matter how big the sticky is because these people are stupid and wont read it no matter what happens there will always be people posting dumb beginner posts    as  points out the mods dont care    threadly ids would solve the whole samefagging shitposting and post your art problem but then again theres nothing stopping people from tripfagging once you post your art once your trip shows who you are    i side with  4chan as a whole is a different place now with all the politics going on this site is overrun with garbage leaking into every board      i think by bigger he means bolder something that will draw your attention      this you cant expect to have success handed to you on a silver platter there are no concrete exercises its about understanding and that takes effort      yeah if the mods are going to do anything they should atleast be more strict on the garbage that gets posted it doesnt have to be rule breaking but anyone whos been here for more than a few months knows what is and what isnt a shit thread and theres no subjectivity to it  the fundamental problem with /ic/ is that the community doesnt care  and ideal /ic/ would go something like   post your art  it gets lots of thoughtful critique  you post improvements  you critique others  no shitposting in sight    you cant create an envrionment like that through moderation alone the users themselves need to be passionate and motivated our sticky is better than what they had in the golden age of art forums but they had better people on their sites and thats precisely what made them so good    i say we go back to the old idea of making our own /ic/ there are plenty of chans out there how hard can it be to make our own then we can have our own mods and our own sticky and ids  
  yeah its perthread so its more like your anonymity is gone only on that one thread you post your art in which i dont think is a big deal
  what about a tripfag general have a googlespreadsheet listing everyones details and trips  and we just post our art and git gud without worrying about shitposting
  i say we go back to the old idea of making our own /ic/ there are plenty of chans out there how hard can it be to make our own then we can have our own mods and our own sticky and ids  someone already tried to make one on 8ch the problem with this is always traffic /ic/ is already slow enough so any splinter from it is guaranteed to be borderline dead  you can always try other communities that offers better critique the conceptart discord is a good example lots of professionals posts there and theres even a channel for asking tips from them
  it is not a problem for single posts i guess but for general threads where you post your art and give critique i think it is because i dont believe that many people are willing to give real critiques if they are not anonymous
  the sticky fucking sucks it should get straight to the point and provide the links i want
  if so why not just use any other place on the internet  ids arent going to make this place suddenly not4chan it will still have most of its freedom and people will still have the means to work around ids if they desperately want to tripcodes are a bad alternative for multiple reasons including being closer to an account system than ids      i dont believe that many people are willing to give real critiques if they are not anonymous  there are plenty who do post their work alongside their critiques yes people are afraid that their critiques will be dismissed if people see their bad art with it but there are constantly others who outright dismiss critique that doesnt have work attached both sides have a point so it leaves us in a place where most are afraid to put their art out there people dont need to be masters to give good advice but they at least should have drawn for a decent amount of time having ids would get everyone closer to accepting that by exposing those who give good critique but arent that good themselves it would also make people put a little more effort into what they say instead of stating wild guesses as facts    sure you could say the really harsh and blunt critiques might be toned down but those often dont amount to much more than study more and are often said hypocritically so it would be better being posted less or reworded at the end of the day people could still be completely anonymous by not eating posting art where they shit critique when they dont want to switch ids and others would be free to choose to listen only ided posts with a long history or everyone without as much post your work and samefag being thrown around
    people will still have the means to work around ids if they desperately want to  i dont think that people will go out of their way just so they can give a honest critique    at the end of the day people could still be completely anonymous by not eating posting art where they shit critique  if people had to choose between give or receive feedback most will choose receive    there are plenty who do post their work alongside their critiques  i dont know about that i would say that very few people do it actually i never counted tho    those often dont amount to much more than study more  i see this type of critique outside here all the time so i dont think that it will change at all with ids       again my big concern is that without anonymity less people will give honest critiques and many will not give any critique at all
  i see this type of critique outside here all the time so i dont think that it will change at all with ids  it would this is still 4chan the blunter tone is already in place and not everyone will have work posted in every thread or care that they do so if the only thing someone with weak art can contribute is study more thats going to come back at them which means theyll be more likely to think a little harder about how useful the critique theyre giving is or not critique at all which wont be a bad loss    again my big concern is that without anonymity less people will give honest critiques and many will not give any critique at all  there is still partial anonymity ids dont equal an account what is honest critique in your eyes what is so lethal about truly good honest critique that someone wouldnt be able to give it with their work attached through ids of course there is no doubt that good people will initially stop critiquing with ids in place but there will also be less study more and yikes tier critiques and less shitposting and samefagging which will make it more worthwhile for others to step in to critique not to mention the people who will still critique before/after posting their work in a given thread some of who really do already exist will be the trendsetters and show that it isnt the end of the world to do so    as it stands people currently complain about not getting good critiques and that this board is shit not having ids lets shitposters and bad critiquers go full force which discourages potential good critiquers because they will get drowned out or forced to stand out alone by posting their work in defense leading to more attacks/samefagging on them a new sticky/guide is part of the solution but assuming a good one is even made and encouraged well ids would do a better job at shifting this environment more to what people want at a minimal loss
there is still partial anonymity ids dont equal an account    if you can tell that was me that said everything i said in every thread isnt it basically the same     every comment links back to my drawings every drawing links back to me true i can just not post my drawings and no one will know who am i but what is the point     what is honest critique     saying the truth being it a positive thing or a negative thing     what is so lethal about truly good honest critique    resentment    some people will feel it and will attack you because of that the way it is now as long you dont give your identity away it die with the thread that person will never be able to have bias against you because they just dont know who you are    with id this type of drama can go to the next thread and keep going from thread to thread until they get bored or leave    maybe it can even go outside of the board    even if it never actually happen here some people will just avoid say anything negative about other people arts just for the fear that it might happen    true some people will not care and just keep going but is there enough people like that to keep this board alive we already have so few people here giving critiques can we afford to lose anyone is it even worth the risk     and if the worse really happen and the drama run loose wouldnt it just drive more people away      as it stands people currently complain about not getting good critiques and that this board is shit  i think that it is more about not receiving any critique at all we need more people with different skills levels       and less shitposting and samefagging   not having ids lets shitposters and bad critiquers go full force   i can see how the ids will stop the samefagging but how can it stop the shitposters and bad critiquers      leading to more attacks/samefagging on them  wouldnt ids lead to more attacks too
  retard thinks ids span multiple threads
  this ids would help clean up threads so much
  no it doesnt you can get a new ip from phone posting by going in and out of airplane mode youre only hurting nonshitters
  how on earth is having a thread specific id hurting nonshitters you sound paranoid as fuck if it cuts down on other shitposting at all it would its beneficial
  go to reddit if you want identification
  youre retarded ids have been implemented on other boards like /pol/ should they go to reddit too faggot
  you act as if im new ive been here since 2010 of course i know pol has ids now scram to reddit or discord and leave my ic alone
  unironically posting your 4chan birthday as if it validates your idiotic reasoning ability   maybe youd feel more at home on a forum with username and registration dates yourself that way a little 2010 would appear next your name and people would utomatically know your status you could even have an oldfag title maybe a site like reddit or ign would suit your needs
            ill never understand why people argue online
  please at least read through the posts you are replying to
ive put a lot of the good stuff id seen mentioned on this board or id stumbled on myself in my boards sticky you could in turn pull some of the stuff from there to help make a new one if anything in there seems interesting       i dont feel that ids are necessary judicious moderation just might be preferable to total twelve year old on call of duty open mic anarchy though     
op here by bigger sticky i meant a substantial one bigger not in quantity but in quality people are often loose as what to do next how to properly use the board simple things such as how to study art or critique it are complex for the new users since you must be 18yo to access the board there should be things that are ought to be clear for a person with a normal functional brain such as how to organize your own schedule how to know your own pace as a student selftaught or not off course we can make threads to discuss with the community but not in a way that the thread becomes my personal life by anonymous    now i dont think this board has to become reddit or any other site to success it just needs a good introduction at what /ic/ really is and how to properly discuss a topic youre troubled with as a beginner or a medium rate artist as far as ids im concerned they dont seem the most approachable solution and i feel they would lead to a worse shitposting and crit
  i think that it is more about not receiving any critique at all we need more people with different skills levels  posters here do complain about both not getting critique and getting bad critique those new people with different skill levels havent come for the past few years if nothing significant changes then we cant expect them to just come out of nowhere    i can see how the ids will stop the samefagging but how can it stop the shitposters and bad critiquers  you said it yourself people will be cautious about posting their art alongside critiquing/shitposting and are more likely to just post art you also understate how much of a big plus less samefagging would be    most of what youre saying just comes down to the idea that everyone will be forever scared to post with ids that a lot of people will constantly be digging through multiple old threads crossreferencing posts/ids to keep drama going and paranoia that there are terribly evil people waiting just for ids before they truly wreck havoc its nonsense and anyone who feels its not should stop posting art/blog links here if those bad people exist then they are already here with free reign to attack anyone they resent who posts their art or blog links   example  anona posts art/blog   jealousanon gives a hatefilled shit critique  anonsx/y/z come in to defend  jealousanon shits up any thread with any art remotely close to anonas as payback for anona not excepting his critique or attacks anonas blog or someone he mistakes as anona who also posts their art/blog here    there are plenty of big targets like firez yev and nonnamefags who are easily recognizable by their art and sometimes post art with critique those people havent been worth a big attack and the drama around them is easily fueled by samefagging ids would take some of the focus off of them and stop a lot of the samefagging that causes threads to derail    lets talk about the sticky for now
  before end it i just want to say that i think you misunderstood my point maybe i did not word it very well    i was talking about someone resenting your critique and start attacking you and how the fear of it happening will make people void give critiques     no digging old threads no terribly evil people    have a nice day
  how to organize your own schedule how to know your own pace as a student  this is baby stuff desu 0 chance we need this or that it gets implemented       the thing is if we reduce blatant shitposting skill will just rise with time as people wont be attempted to be bullied out like firezyevkyle
everyone seems to be complaining about directionality  how bout we make an exercise sticky similar to our current picasso thing which weve got going on but built in a way that we can pinpoint common mistakes ie making people draw a profile view and having feedback or visual checks list postdrawing with the most common mistakes ie look at these plumb lines does your drawing align    what yall be thunk about this suggestion
  mite b cool
  how bout we make an exercise sticky  thats what im currently doing itll take a bit longer but when its done it could be combined with your other ideas      a good introduction at what /ic/ really is and how to properly discuss a topic youre troubled with as a beginner or a medium rate artist  the big sticky has some of this but it should be made more prominent and maybe cleaned up/updated
  i think you should stop trying to start movements and make changes to this board when youre an obnoxious attention starved shitter who cant fucking draw
as a shitter who has asked for advice in /beg/ plenty of times id like to put something out there    when i or any other /beg/ger asked for advice or help often the responses i got were loomis or vilppu or read the sticky just like that quick and dismissive as if those responses are just easy ways to shut down anyone asking for help to so much as question these words of advice is seen as heresy as if the sticky is perfect in all ways and that all of my problems will be solved if only i read the sticky first told to loomis whatever that means when getting interaction from an experienced artist would seem much more helpful than getting advice from a dead one noobs come to this place for interaction references can be found anywhere on the internet for free and yes the sticky does have useful knowledge but learning from someone else will always be better than reading instructions     just know that when a noob comes for help theyre asking you whoever you are to be their teacher at least for a moment and when you tell them to turn around and go back the way they came and to return after they get good its really the least helpful thing you can do for them because you arent helping youre just sending them off to bother someone else or to eventually come back and bother you again     anyway im done
would a warning about the crabs be a good idea because i see people posting here for the first time getting a yikes and never coming back maybe this would help
  almost there
i started making a website with fundamentals of drawing actually still havent shipped it yet probably never will
  but if i get some yous that want to see it done i might
  a website with fundamentals of drawing  what exactly did it have id be interested in seeing it
  just a little more
  what does it matter to you that people dont read the sticky and make shitty threads the generals you might be interested in are still there and you should be glad the content you hate isnt polluting the threads youre in the crappy threads are not only part of board culture theyre a good thing if youre looking to keep your learning environment clean    that is if your goal really is to enjoy yourself get critiques and talk to people who are interested in the same thing you are if youre more interested in being a board mom instead and tell the children what they can and cant do then you shouldve applied to be the next board janitor
  the sticky should be single link leading to this image
  trips for truth
  signed hope it works anon
why wont cgpeers registration work  i finally remembered on the 1st  it keeps giving me an error  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  its the 30th
  it just wasnt accepting my nonstandard email problem solved

why dont you guys all give me your tumblrs
  trips of truth    they already shut down my tumblr but i have a deviantart do you want that
  is that reiq tracing
  mfw mcflintcock bragged about no one on ic calling him out for tracing
  his art isnt even good
  doesnt tracing get old
  construction examples usually after a few rounds drawing poses into newsprint i can work a few decent roughs and build upon them
saltykun mind actually drawing up that old /aco thread with the first responses
ill wait
gimme your thoughts boys
i unironically belive people in these porn threads are among the best on /ic/
            construction examples  obvious tracing in op pic    the porn thread s tracer everybody
  on what theres nothing of value to critique here
    eh its an extremely generic pose thats been used infinity amounts of times how many different ways can you hold titties while fucking missionary doesnt look like tracing just heavy reference      your construction makes absolutely no sense your ellipses used for your head side planes are flat out wrong not sure how you get such a good finished product with such ass levels of construction
  how do i use ellipses for the side of the head correctly
  hands and tits are almost traced line for line  calls it heavy reference  kek
  do a layover then and prove it
  because he traces
  insult followed by compliment of overall work  this is advanced samefagging and i know this because his finished work is much much worse than his construction
  coping this hard  your hatred for this guy is fucking irrational as hell man get help
  aight here ya go lol
  i think that scott robertson book has a very technical approach to elipses
  hows it feel to be so good that you have weeb begs foaming at the mouth with rage and accusations
  mcflintcocks meltdown begins
  so he just heavy refs then whats the need for any construction at all
    absolutely disgusting
  you should really work on that pelvis anatomys off
    i will ask for proof of your piggybacked accusations and a fresh line of bullshit that dribbles down afterwards    sucks to be you op
opinions on asanagis work
  i need to use more blocks or spend more time sculpting out of blocks    i still use the loomis method sometimes as an old habit it is a fantastic learning tool for learning the fundamentals placement of the features basic construction in perspective etc    however i found myself gravitating more towards a bridgman style blocks and the oreily method    i strongly recommend modernjayjamess excellent video on constructing the head in perspective and subscribe to his channel i need to incorporate this more like what i did for the ffxiv piece maybe combine this with the oreily method          hi im right here miss me sunshine      meh its the same shit over and over again from the same merry gang of miscreants and pedophiles
    samefagging this hard  lol
  yep youre still a faggot
  yeah this whiny bitch keeps accusing me too    and people wonder why there are so few good artists left on /ic/
so this is the power of /ic/
  never seen anyone claim vetyr tracing

  here you go happy
  is op autistic does he have mental issues
                        
  jesus christ your art is so cringey not only the disgusting style but the captions holy shit    im not surprised why you keep harassing people on social media and talking about your pedophile adventures
is this totally fucked what do i do to get the lineart finished where should i place the lightsource ive done some lineweighs but im not sure that the lightsource is placed well should i move it around
  see  
by any chance is the anon from the last thread who drew this here asked for blog on the last thread but it 404d before i could get a response
      shit art  shitty pedophile  larping as a goth girl  samefagging    goddamn the butthurt from redmatzoo about this guy lol
    please post blogs these are great
  tfw im the one who made this comparison image and posted it in the /aco/ comm thread    feels good man no regrets
all this whining about shit no one cares about mcflinkcock is shit there is no argument in it and the fact that he traces always seemed kinds obvious from the uncanny look of his stuff    back to porn thread as usual please no more namefags fucking uo entire threads
  great post anon you sure showed everyone what a badass you are well done
  cringe
i asked last thread why theres so few flcl porn and someone said its because most artists arent crazy good enough to do it justice and afraid is that correct
    funny maybe if you didnt put as little effort into drawing as you do into your jokes you wouldnt be here fucking around  fucking zoomers need to grow up and stop acting so stupid youre not funny and no one cares
  the flcl style is too loose very hard to nail down consistently also most people arent into the petit bodytype its either full blown loli or an overdone bimbo no room for anything else it seems
  i think at the moment its just a tad rigid i think as for the light source it makes sense if shes holding the drink in the direction where the light would be coming from when im doing construction lines i find it easier to keep track if you erase low opacity over less important areas otherwise things tend to get a bit muddled hope any of this helps and nice trips
  you fell for the loomis meme
    thanks i like your edit of it more dynamic i think i might wanna start over on it though getting it just right maybe do some gestures first this time    thanks
how do you guys manage drawing two bodies interacting   i find it gets really fuckey really fast and its never touched on in hamptons book
  sounds like a challenge
  its ironic you ask this and posted hamada because he uses design doll
  i didnt say most artists were like that just me personally like its not the reason i started drawing but its the reason im still drawing you feel me and also that the main character you seem to mostly want porn of fucks with my head too much for me to enjoy it i will be drawing kitsurubami after i finish a few other things tho      is difficult never really addressed in any tutorial ive seen mostly just studied other artists i like main thing i took away was having their forms press together not much unlike when thighs or boobs press together gotta think of the shapes of the two bodies as one whole sorta hahasdf thumbnailing really helps have a plan before you come in if you try to just wing it like i often do on single figures youre in for a bad time unless youre lucky or crazy good
  who would you recommend then
new stuff for my pixiv
  kyle is a meme
  what do you mean i dont recommend anyone just go draw
i havent been in /ic/ in a bit but theres usually a questions that dont need their own thread thread is that not a thing anymore   well i have a question how do i get this filter or what do i need to do to get this kind of grainy pencil look would anyone know also if im allowed to qtdntot thread
pencil tool varied line width
  they use paint tool sai just mess with the brush settings
  clip studio
      even the brush for the pants and everything
  just fill a layer with a paper/fabric texture iirc krita comes with a ton and set the layer to overlay or something similar then fuck with your opacity   easy peasy
  yeah they overlayed the whole image with canvas 1 pt 2030 percent the brush they use is likely a mixture of cloudy 1 2030 and blob 1 pt 1525
always wanted to get into art but never did i got some colored pencils and a coloring book as an off gift from a friend and decided to try my hand at it i watched some youtube tutorials but besides burnishing which i know is supposed to be done near the end of a piece i cant get the color to lay flat or even on the page i cant even begin to blend when the paper is riddled with white dots in all my colors    im using prismacolor premiers if that matters
in photoshop you can give any brush some kind of background texture this looks like that alternatively have a paper layer above the drawing and play with the settings

  good mood and strokes but the dock doesnt seem like it should be that twisted the perspective doesnt match the girl since shes mostly in profile but the bridge and water are seen from an upper point of view
  wheres chico anyway did he die
  the bullying got to him
  the guy in the op his work looks like an exact copy of someone els and thats not a compliment considering its a braindead style that anyone can copy with effort
double wip
  dumbass he meant the guy who used to make the threads
  youre one dumbass crab he talking about the guy do always make /alt/ thread  also pyw
    thats why i asked a question you fucking aspies
  someone els  rei17 and its not even a comparison post your work if you can do better than her faggot
  why are newfags always like to crab on everyone
this took way longer than i thought it would
im tired of looking at this now to the next thing
  its beautiful uwu
done
  generic poses do nothing for me
should i star over again or there is hope
  my ref
  what is wrong with it
  i think its enough  the most is up to the way you will paint it because good painting can take all the flaws
  gotta start somewhere    thanks
  very good you actually have a style compared to this copy cat
  i think you should do like 10 more iterations in various poses if you feel like going further with this or cut your losses and abandon it here and now
  neato
  never use black for shadows unless you are trying to be especially graphic you need a few darker values in here dude all the tones are practically the same try adding a few purplesreds and blues on an overlay layer or something on top of her and see if it helps her stand out
  stay mad faggot
  learn from him you noob
    bottom right guy with the guns is so cool
bloodborne fanart i did to sell at the next comic con
    looove those colors good job
  looking very good anon hope youll do well at the comic con
  fix the nose its not following the rest of her faces perspective really throws off her face
help pls
  please gib blog
    mikejordanacom
  good shit this is another good style unlike this 
      the autism and insecurity is strong in this one
  someones jealous awww
ive managed to narrow down my problems to my lack of sense of thinking in 3d and failure to understand how shapes connect to each other to create a better form is there really no way out outside of picking up sculpting
  blog
  push you are self to draw stuff at weird angles also do studiesss
  the ops art is nice why are you trying to put them down
      ive been trying to push myself to do these kinds of studies but i that im falling back into the ditch of doing them blindly or for the sake of doing them im still trying to do them at least twice a week though
  literally coping everything that made rei unique  nice art    if this is nice art to you then you will nmgi might as well draw hyperrealism with your own special touch
  
    stinky you should just make a fuckin twitter or something to dump art  why did you get kicked btw
  blog friendo
last fan art for a bit time to go back to studies anything i should focus on
  hes fucking annoying fat and smelly and never listens to crits
  thats some shit tier bait
  fuck off brian
  twitter  what is this meme going around that twitter is a good website to dump art on also i am still banned from it for being a russian bot  but thanks for the link
  baby all i want for christmas is yous
  not them obvs but twitter is great cause you can just dump the image on there without being forced to title it or write a description i can just post some tiddies an be done with it plus the website goes out of its way to promote you to other users if you fall into the circles it deems them to be interested in which usually involves your mutuals/those who follow you and how they interact with your work getting retweeted is obvious but even just getting liked by somebody or having them respond to your work causes twitter to go hmm this is probably good content that all the other people who tend to like and respond to similar things that this poster does would probably be interested in sure it might not be the best gallery but its one of the best tools for getting your art out there tho there are definitely tools to help you sort things a bit more to make it more convenient for those who would like a more traditional gallery experience but thats extra effort and not really worth it for most users especially cause theyd have to explain the system they personally use but for the main part its probably the best promotional site out there
    good shit i like the linework you do to suggest the shapely legs
  i took up 3d modeling and printing to do shit since it helps to look at actual objects if you cant do that do some drawings of dolls for the anime aesthetic and some structure doll joints are cute and basically the concept of connecting shapes together to make a girl
  
  hes saying it in a stupid way but honestly what he has to say rings true to an extent theres nothing wrong with copying peoples style in order to learn from it but when its patently obvious that youre copying an artist wholesale it really cheapens the work when people try to take all aspects from a particular artists style which are easily recognizable they just end up looking like a bootleg imitation understandably so since rei and yamakawa have really strong fundamentals and small stuff like how the copy renders cloth or how they treat certain edges gives away the gap in knowledge between source and copy    people try to copy krenz all the time but no one tries to copy exactly how he draws and renders they just take ideas like his warm grey color palette or exaggerated saturation at terminators if you tried to copy krenz in all aspects you would fail it would look cheap and everyone will know who youre copying    ive given advice to op before and seen them grow over time they really have become much better at emulating the style hes looking for i just hope he knows what hes getting into by only doing work like this and posting this stuff as his finished artwork of course everyones goals in art are different and im no authority on how he should or should not make art its just my selfishness that wants to see more of his own voice shine through he made it this far already it would be nice to see
  come back to the discord yilx i miss you 
  study animu figurines you dont need to take up sculpting
        really nice          real fuckin nice      kino
  hot
    thanks anons uwu    i made her arms longer but now i fear theyre a bit too long also any feedback regarding the perspective is very welcome
  thanks a lot for your input anon ill try
  i love that 1px usage its my favorite tool
please make the room piled full of clones  
  makes me want to puke frend the forms are well done but it really makes me feel a bit sick
  that crossed my mind i want to try but honestly dont think i can pull it off
  nice im almost convinced you know what youre doing    keep practicing anon kun
  direct copy of someone elses style  yes    anyone can copy it  no at the very least hes been working hard to carbon copy that artist its just a shame he didnt add anything of his own to it to really make it his you know
  thank you that means very much friend
  may i ask why you are drawing these i have seen a couple and again the forms are really well done but the forms themselves and the colors are literally sick it really does a good job of evoking that feeling but what is your motivation
  im not sure i just do cant say theres a particular motivation i really like muted colors i guess thanks again for the kind words though
should be done tomorrow i think what should i do for the background
both from ref
  v cute  post the whole image
  cute
    okay i am tried i think this would be as mane as i can do    should i keep em or scrap the idea
hi /ic
been awhile
  which discord
  copy that
    its you
  thanks for the kino babe
  like the light application of color on the girl nice
  i thought it was inuyasha for a secthere
  i like it imo it adds a lot to the image just make sure the original urotsuki stands out somehow if you do decide to go with this version
  that looks so cool i dont have anything to add about the art but this reminds me of a transformers movie scene 
  you earned it
  big manly hand
i dont really see where else i can take this so let me know what you think
  left side lower the tits they look like pecs there
  well they are supposed to be small so maybe give them more volume or is the shape wrong
  not him but i think hes saying that they look more masculine than feminine
    what im saying is they are too high on her chest but yes volume as well to match the figure on the right
i have a question ive never seen good fanart for flcl what makes that style so hard to emulate  i recently watched flfl alternative and loved it and looked to see if theres any good porn and there is literally none why do artists struggle that much with this particular show
  more like not a lot of people care for the reboot given that it has none of the staff that made it great in any department that isnt audio there was a little hype but once it got out thats how it was going to be it died down fast
  there were actually two reboots progressive the shit one everyone hated and alternative the one that looked amazing as fuck that nobody watched because everyone hated progressive
  i know i grouped them together because both had no imaishi hand on it and imaishis storyboards were essentially what made flcl work in the first place
  imashi wasnt as involved in flcl as you think
  i dont know what youre getting at there i literally specified he did the storyboarding and while its not like hes the only missing piece between then and now storyboards are kind of a big deal when theyre being used 11 with the scenes which they were in this case
ive noticed that only 1 of people who post here draw backgrounds to their images while everyone else leaves it blank or just throws some colour behind whats the reason for this i only ask because im really trying to expand my images by doing detailed backgrounds and its damn near killing me but so many dont even be concerned with it so id really appreciate some opinions on this
  imaishi didnt storyboard all of flcl you brainlett
  yeah only the action scenes and funny moments which comprise pretty much the entire show nice try though
  bg is hard
  thank you anon i redid most of the figures to try and do that exactly i am also trying to not cover too much of the background since i spent a lot of time on it _    thank you and thats fine frend
  keep going i love it i dont know who the character is or if she is from anything but i like it a lot i know what you mean about backgrounds too
  imaishi storyboarded the worst sequences in flcl
  which are
  i know but isnt it worth it if it adds depth to the image i feels some huge disconnect here because im trying so hard to refine it but barely anyone seems to care like i do
  all the crappy sequences with so randumb choppy animation   all the good shit was by yoshinari and ogura you know the stuff people actually remember
  yoshinari did the cool bunny girl scene with al the cool animation on top of the gun correct me if im wrong 
  it depends on the piece anon if its just a figure then its fine if you keep the background a gradient or a plain color if you want to have an actual scene then you draw a background i usually decide if i want a background before i start working on a piece i start with some poses until one clicks and then i set the perspective and start drawing blocks to define the stuff in it then its just adding details desu drawing backgrounds is the same as drawing figures i think a lot of people skip bg because it makes things take a lot longer and things can become cumbersome i stopped drawing for a like a month once when i got bored and overwhelmed by coloring a really complicated background      i see he sucks then lol
  pretty dumb to sully a good character like that like whats the point fans will only get cringed out by it whats even more cringe is that westerner kana in the upper right corner    also check the list on /cos fromsoftware games are well known for not allowing any sales of prints and merch heck even police were called by staff after some people were selling their small fandom comics from popular ips
  so the good scenes
  i always try to add a bg of some sort can give depth enhances the light source and can tell a bit of story
  giantess anonnnn uwu
  if you feel it would be beneficial to your pieces then spend the time to do it drawing backgrounds when you can will make them easier to do over time like training yourself to avoid hiding feet and hands why are you basing whether or not you do something just because a few posters on /ic/ arent doing it
  fair enough thanks for the info      thats how i feel as well      why are you basing whether or not you do something just because a few posters on /ic/ arent doing it  thats not what im doing at all im sorry if i wasnt clear i do backgrounds regardless of what /ic/ is doing i was just curious as i come to these threads often for inspiration and i just wanted to understand peoples reasoning for doing a background or not as im genuinely interested in everyones process
i cant quite nail the location of the back hind leg /
wip kinda feel like im getting the hang of this painting thing    kinda
  im a lazy shit
my 1st attempt at blending i have been struggling to make my butts look less flat dont know if its noticeable      very nice
  let me tell you anon therell always be room for improvement but this butt looks pretty good
my art style is boring and very tumblr/steven universe and i dont know how to develop my art style more
  you dont develop your own artstyle it will come later as more you draw
  thank you anon i tried to fix the hand
  loomis  o  o  m  i  s
eugh my brains too frickin tiny to work in colour  inb4 only draws heads  sshut up
  if you look over my pixiv i have quite a few with backgrounds in them but recently i have really been pushing my rendering and figure drawing so i dont really think its necessary     that being said sometimes the focus is on the character and sometimes its the character in relation to their enviroment
decide to try my hand at a more anime style idk how to feel about it
  is that a bulge between her legs
  you dont know where you are do you
  yes
  its the best part
    
  i dont like the perspective/angle/composition seems flat to me
  all done
  
okay i changed the breasts on the lower left changed the canvas size and pulled some of the red out of the face    serious question i am looking at my phone and 4chan and my picture looks different color wise than it does in clip studio does anyone else have this problem this has happened several times and i am not sharp enough to catch whats happening but the reds are coming through more saturated between when i paint vs post my art the other colors seem to change as well in some of my other pieces is it the resizing
  ok now you see the tits how they are curved you keep making them flat on the left thats why they look like pecs
  aww yeah anon thank you for pointing it out
  i think i pulled it off uwu      it is a recreation of a scene from a video gaem
  kike
  wow frend that is very well done    did you also draw the animals on top
  used a ref but yeah not for the direct pose but just to get a jist of what the animal looks like
  ayy lmao
  you did a great job desu you really know your forms very well frend the head and the tail look very cool and the pattern is also really interesting    only small thing i would point out is that the giraffes neck is very small
  op here im still consider myself a newbie at this stuffs and therere a lot of stuffs i need to learn still    i plan to deviate rei style a bit anway because there are some elements in her styles that i dont like  for now im happy with where i am and want to lvl up all my fundamentals first  i hope you can give me more useful advices in the future if im not wrong youre the one who guide me on how to paint right
im done with this shit
  here you go frend    sick got a blog
    here you go
    i love these faces so much
  the greatest trick the devil ever pulled
  this is gonna be the next godoshit  by which i mean that everyone will praise your flashy planless and with no consideration for values and you will be stuck never improving your anatomy because wooo flashy colors
  then i hope theres more constructive crits for that to not happen
  normies love colours
  holy fucking shit blog
  i wrote you critiques about your anatomy in the past all that happens is that you ignore them and get cheered on by your crabby fans on this site who have forgotten what actual criticism is and im just kind of tired of how /ic/ works you dont come here to learn barely anyone does anymore you just post your finished work that you dont intend to edit anymore anyways this place is basically deviantart now   want a real tip stop with these flashy illustrations and sit down and practice anatomy from photos movies just grind it you will make so much more progress than from just making a couple of drawings over the span of weeks that have poses and colors that lie inside your comfort zone that vp left arm is just broken but its masked by the all around look of the colors which are nice but also have issues with values
  i wrote you critiques about your anatomy in the past all that happens is that you ignore them and get cheered on by your crabby fans on this site who have forgotten what actual criticism is and im just kind of tired of how /ic/ works  i think youre mistaking me with someone else ive barely ever gotten any criticisms if i post here its to get help its not like this board has a huge audience
would have actually drawn something more substantial but ive been sick
  godoshit    i probably sound nickpicky but does anyone else sometimes unfollow artists on twitter if it feels like they post memes/video game/gatcha pics way more compared to their art this is why im still grateful galley art sites like pixiv still exists
  by which i mean that everyone will praise your flashy planless and with no consideration for values and you will be stuck never improving your anatomy because wooo flashy colors  finally someone said the thing ive seen saying about my art all this time      sorry i dont actually draw all that often    but i play mobage everyday
  i could look at their media count and immediately know whether to follow this person or not for example people with more than 1k media count on twitter
  blog
  you just post your finished work  but he did post his wips    problem is no one wants to critique wips  then and ive seen this happen a dozen of times on /ic/ after the piece is done everyone is suddenly eager to point out mistakes
  case in point 
  how do you layer colors on top of each other
  i guess while criticism should be a given people who post wips could try asking if anything needs fixing or point out what parts theyre unsure about while being extra accepting of criticism with wips its sometimes hard to see mistakes or when there are one assumes theyll be fixed after refining
  contd because i had a thought  if youre desperate try samefagging and giving wrong or vague crits sometimes people will notice it and start getting engaged with the piece leading to legitimate crits ive noticed this happens with poor redlines a lot
  how do i make use of line to make the sea on the right look like actual water right now it looks like no mans land
  try looking at real ocean shores and how light reflects off that recognizing the zigzaggy patterns then ink where theres no light right now it looks like a field of grass
  dark and saturated skies make me cum
  i envy your construction and perspective skills uu
can anyone give me a quick redline it doesnt have to be anything fancy but everything feels stiff and i cant draw these arms for the life of me  thank you so so so much in advance and sorry for taking up your time
  i see youre trying to get your entire gesture in an icon size template but i feel like youre shooting yourself in the foot with that the arm is awkwardly close to the body etc try extending them out just a bit
  oh that does look a bit better ill definitely adjust some things looking back at the original image it does feel cramped thank you anon
  this is sans isnt it
  no sorry anon just a faceless person in a hoodie for a friend hoodie has a specific design on it but i promise you its not sans related at all lol
give me your yous plz
  blog
  sauce pls 3
  touch your own cheek and then look at that value transition on that girls cheek a change in value means a change in planes do you feel a change in planes on your cheek there
  maybe you should leave 4chan like for real its not just this board this site is cancer youre crying over spilled milk move on granddad
  drawpile has shit brushes but im also shit at using them  but this came out okish i think
  jealous firez faggot
  not even him but is this suppose to be a red line
some concepting
what are you fags going to do when tumblr shuts your shit down and you have to find real jobs
  did you know that illustration is a trade i get that this is bait but why do you have to be like this
  im moving to pixiv
  the legendary four fingers cause i cant draw hands method
  using tumblr
  firez plz go
  whats godoshit im old      i do too desu sometime often style and colours or composition can easily make up for weak other fundamentals
  using instagram
  ah i wish i were 2d too
    not really a fan of lewd art but apart from the lewd context of the art i really like these a lot nicely drawn and nicely rendered imo really like how you rendered the skin and the jeans in such a soft nice way keep it up
  finally done gotta get to working on the other zine now
  ruuuranran on tumblr    like if i use layers for shading i only use one layer and maybe a light overlay one at the end i dont like how using multiply and heavy overlay effects look
  draw more mikus  3333
  
  seconding this stop drawing shera and draw more miku and asuka please
  but i already have a job drawing is for alcohol and vidya money
im honestly impressed how good everyone here has become  im tempted to start posting drawings too
  do it its an order
  dont do it you will have shitposters on your ass
  do it but just ignore the crabs and only respond to stuff that you feel is real critique dont give crabs the satisfaction of your responses
i wasnt sure what to put in his hand       it did i like it ill forever use ms paint trying new programs irks me       shout out to the pigeons i have 15 at home      dig the screen tones a lot
  make a new one duh 
  like if i use layers for shading i only use one layer and maybe a light overlay one at the end i dont like how using multiply and heavy overlay effects look  i mean how you decide to build up the paint on the hair for example im pretty impressed by how volumetric it looks  or the markerish looking shadows on her shirt under the boobs and directly below the arm pit over the belt
  why does your art get more emotions of disgust out of me than my favourite gore manga artist shintaro kago i dont mean this as an insult or that you should stop drawing just being open and honest with the feelings your work invokes in me
  do you like shintaro kago so much because he is best at evoking disgust within you
  his work makes me feel disgust but its more often than not that i dont feel it maybe because i have gotten used to looking at it    the first time around all his work used to give me feelings of disgust now some of it makes me just laugh some of it i find actually genuinely beautiful and some make me think       i guess i like him because his work invokes a wide range of emotions out of me even sometimes when he is drawing gore i and find humour in it or a message behind it
  maybe because its so crudely done im not sure either but thank you ill keep pumping them out in your honor
  instagram is wowiealli     this is my first time really attempting an asianinfluenced style ive been trying to experiment a lot lately to find a style im proud of im planning on doing a series of this with other pokemon too
  cute
  i love your art and i spoiler already fapped to all your lewds
i wanted to do a john wooesque pose  do the sleeves look right i had a hard time drawing them foreshortened
does this look right
  her head and left arm looks a little too far to the right
  had kinda figured but wanted to make sure does this look better
  yeah it does cute stuff btw
doing things a little different than usual feedback
chicken (((scratch)))
  cool idea but the top half and bottom half seem to be in different places like she must be leaping backwards for that to kinda work or she will be falling down right the torso seems long at a glance as well cool idea cool gun and you fags make me want to play your fucking mobage
  maybe not what youre looking for but thats sais watercolor brush with decreased opacity which give it a markerish effect
pls bully plsnot when its done pls
  cont
  i really want to know how you go from this to finished i wouldnt be able to salvage all that mess
  cuttteeee
  drawing cute beach miku    please marry me please
  cute just try to doublecheck your anatomy in some places especially the feet too lazy to line them
  fuck off
  dude its obviously an early wip back off
  thanks frend i do suck at feet     
  3c
  i feel like the neck is a bit too long and some lines could be made more 3d still very cute
  yikes
  thanks for the input i was actually trying to make her jump backwards should move the background down a bit to exaggerate it
  i love how much your art looks like its modelled in clay like it looks straight up sculpted how do you achieve having it look so well modelled that you feel you could touch it
how the fuck do you dudes do decent stuff digitally do you all have cintiqs i still have the shitty little no display intuos i bought 2 years ago i can barely draw something presentable on paper but its even worse digitally where everything feels slippery and cant track where im drawing by looking at the pad i only use the tablet as a glorified coloring mouse now or to digitally ink my work which i rarely due nowadays i have some microns i bought a month ago but i dont usually ink with those either because i hate doing lineart i started doing pretty much pencil and paper only because someone told me to stop being a digital so i could improve a few months ago drawing digitally feels foreign now
  do you all have cintiqs  yes 13hd is small is shit though saving money for upgrade soon
  im too poor for a cintiq but i got a thinkpad laptop with pen and i use it as a very ghetto cintiq like this 
  the nose knows
  i use intuos medium
  protip drawing lines top to bottom is much easier than any other direction but i draw one from the bottom where i need to connect it
  very nice colors
  same i use the latest intous but small      its never the tools its always the artists their are animators and artist that work for anime that still use basic wacom drawing tablets and not screen based tablets and they produce art that is as good or even better than those that use screen tablets just look at bahi jd he uses an old wacom model that he got years ago as a gift still to this day whenever he draws digitally knowing this i never let myself blame my tools and just keep working with what i got
  thats right bitch
  dont get too full of yourself your skill is still clearly lacking
  ok
  i really like this one but i feel as if the lines are a bit too thin
  silence dog hes better than most of you not better than me of course but still puts /ic/ niggers to shame
  theyre as thin as they can get 1px just a thing i struggle with lineweight it should look better once finished but i am still trying to find a balance
  cringe
  i accept your concession
  i still use my old intuos on my ancient lenovo thinkpad sometimes its not about the tool but how you handle it
  i can barely draw something presentable on paper  found your problem mate  you should work on getting your draftsmanship up to a level where you could literally draw on toilet paper make your weakness your strength and start just doodling on all kinds of paper types and your wacom too
how do i learn how to do pixel art
where are her hands and leg
  idc i didnt make it
  lazy little shit do them or there will be consequences
    zoom into picture and press screen print
  i have acrotomophilia so that even better
  wheres this from
pixel art is just regular art but with a lower resolution and some minor limits if you can draw adequately already switch out your normal brushes for pixel tools have a set palette and get used to zooming in and manually adjusting every last little shit pixel till it looks good    same logic applies to animations
  i cant even draw i suck at everything
nobody has put the rest of the pixellogic chapters on cgpeers/gfxpeers yet  come the fuck on
  milky quest
  god bless you
  hands are hard just hide them and spend more time on tits and vagoo
you need a copy of this to start with
  who the fuck cares about hands they are a waste of time to draw  and her right leg is bent if you couldnt tell
this is all /gd     
  mosaic filter on fucking pixel art
  based
  if there was a porn game i said you should give money to itd be this
  i think he means hes not the creator anon
  then learn to draw homie
  this its the ugliest animated sprite ive ever seen just because of the shitty between frame blur
draw this and stylize it in a way you wouldnt normally    these threads can be fun if its not just nazis every time
  fuck i mean i love doing these but we have so many of these threads already just pick the biggest thread to post in thats not about nazis 
  sucker
  ive grown quite fond of the nazi ones
  that wasnt me like any of you are good enough to want to steal art from anyway
  she literally have no waist
  the shoulder width  the perfectly round breasts  the line conecting her lats to the super thin waist  the wide hips  the well defined crotch with just a hint of butt cheek below it  the perfectly shapped legs    who is the goddess
  edgy
  thats fuggin awesome dude
  you just ruined it for me
  looks like she has a dick i think it was intentional
  where do you think you are anon
  all i could find is that her name is rachel and the picture is by azimuth designs i couldnt find that specific picture on the site but i found her other pictures
    the picture is also heavily photoshoped and she probably looks nothing like that irl
  i loik it a lot
  fucking nice i get the stylization but you might want to make the waist meet where the knuckle of her index finger is they way its currently done just doesnt make much sense anatomically or stylistically
  cute
  i noticed that on her waist its very obviously shopped but those legs are all real
    she literally have no nose and absurdly tine feet its a cartoon get over it stupid realism faggots
  it was a little intentional desu
    i like these yall got blogs
ready to plow
  hella
how did i do
  is this an honest effort
  i hate to do this but blog
  is this what happens if you do your gestures everyday  if so i really should up my game
  bad
  ohheythatfisher on twitter
this is fun
  yeah /beg/ here      thanks
my shitty atempt
    nice job fellers
  thanks anon
i did my best
  really cool art you should get insta too everyone is on it nowadays youd get more views
tried id like to post more attempts tomorrow tho
  on your way to making it
      tfw digital is so much superior  faster to get artworks done
  i promise not drawing digitally isnt whats holding you back
        well coloring alone is 50 much faster than traditional
  im faster traditionally but its true effects like airbrushing are a hell of a lot easier than the real thing
  yusuke murata makes digishitters quake in their boots anything takes long for you because you fucking suck at it get gud
  noice
  not him but i think we can all agree that murata possesses a rare ability as far as artists come the man exhibits something that goes beyond mere talent
first attempt heads too small
  second attempt much more out of my comfort zone im satisfied with this one heads too small x2
  what the fuck dude this is worse than the first one
  if you could learn to put the heads in the right place these would be great
  draw this and stylize it in a way you wouldnt normally      not gonna lie i just didnt really care while making these took like a minute each thanks for the advice though
  faggots like you are the worst no one cares how long you took or whether or not you care about it you thought it was good enough to post for critique dont be a bitch and stammer out excuses when someone actually gives you one
  are you being serious right now whats all of this fuss about its not like didnt accept the critique     just calm yourself down it really isnt that serious share some art or whatever
reminds me of zero suit    basically zero suit    fun pic tho
thoughts
  yeah its ridiculously annoying when people do that  hhaha its just a quick 5second joke sketch   tthanks for the critique bbut its not like i care  jjust so you know im only using 01 of my full potential ok
        welp since this is a huge issue i took it upon myself to try to fix it does the head placement look any better     some of you guys kinda take things way too seriously my goodness
  she looks great love the confidence in your lines
  makes me want to puke      jumbo
  thanks man thats something ive been trying to work on lately
  definitely a lot is off but i like it    prettt good
  everything about this is wrong start with loomis and supplement it with proko
  youll never get fucking good with that attitude never limiting yourself with a fragile believe that can and has been proved wrong countless times will not take you anywhere
  she has bigger trapezius than brock lesnar
  tiny hands
  very cute the simpler styles are so difficult to make interesting but you pulled it off
  is it really everything  i felt like i atleast got torso legs and the gesture right
had lots of fun drawing this and i tried my best hope you anons like it
  hi anon somethings you could work on here is proportions your head and limbs could use some work however i totally loved the concept and the shading looks pretty good keep it up anon and theres no shame in using a reference
  looks great anon i love the line art and anatomy
  im just being honest here you need to actually observe the human body before trying to draw it especially if you dont plan on using reference
  hahahahahahahahah
  you didnt the torso is incredibly long the shoulders are nonexistent the arms are completely misproportioned the breasts are out of position considering they are held in place with latex and she has no hips     you really need to begin constructing with shapes simplified forms will make it easier to construct a complicated pose sycra has pretty good tutorials for that however that is essentially all he has
  quads says we have a weiner
  thanks anon    heres some more stuff overall this was a fun photo to work with
  thanks thats the kind of response i was looking for  ill try redoing it once i get home
  this would remove the negative space surrounding the knuckle though which would make the leg look like its just glued on to the side of the person    also it seems like the majority of the style is intended to avoid lines meeting up
  no boob gap
    honestly yeah near enough everything the immediate problems visible to me are that you seem to have a general idea of basic anatomy but its almost like youre stitching together the torso breasts shoulders limbs etc as individual pieces rather than thinking about the figure as a singular working form    try practicing gesture and get your teeth into some anatomy texts i personally recommend constructive anatomy by bridgman others prefer loomis but i definitely think gesture will improve your overall concept of form and movement    i like that youre thinking about light shadow and fabrics though taking on something this ambitious is never a bad thing though and being bad at something is one in many steps towards becoming good at something good job keep it up proud of ya
  not op but wanted to try what they said
  thanks friend
  decided to tweak the pose a little bit alongside adding some reflections on the suit  i have a feeling like she still looks a bit stiff am i wrong
  how in the blue fuck did you go from the original drawing to that did you just hustle us her left leg is still borked but its all immeasurably better
  did you just hustle us  think i spent like an hour and a half on the thing from yesterday and 3 on this one so i guess yea  i dont really draw womenfor the most is another problem i think i spent like 1/3 of time from yesterday on figuring out how her left thigh would bend and it made me frustrated or whatever
dont really have a style tobh
  thats because you dont know how to draw or paint
  pyw
  you broke her spine you stupid cunt nice face though good job
  shes standing completely straight up how can her spine even be broken
i think these stylization threads are pushing me in a neat direction
  the face is pretty unappealing but your mistakes are minor    if the forearms and abdominal length is suppose to be long then you should stylize it more
  nicely done much better her left leg is very short and the knee on the right is not correct also the gun looks like a ham which is very festive considering its thanksgiving
  aww cutest one yet
  thanks and yea i felt like the right leg was a bit off in terms of size but i learnt from the past that tweaking 1 or 2 lines can sometimes eat an entire hour of my time so i didnt bother    also through this whole shitfest i forgot to follow the actual threads theme and stylize the fuckin thing   very cute 
god im so horny and lonely aaaa
  thats weak put your back into it next time like soaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh im so horny and lonely and just want a gf for companionship to chill and draw with aaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  i like it
the legs are a little off
  the body looks fantastic anon you can still work on expression and hair but the anatomy looks amazing dude
  delte this
  itits beautiful
  perfection
  i try
  oops thumb on wrong side
  stylize  stylize  stylize
  stop discussing my picture reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i bit way more than what i can chew i havent drawn humans in ages
roast me i deserve it
  i havent drawn humans in ages  you still havent
this was fun
  fuck off shlomo
    no post blog you fag
  neat but holy fuck that neck and head isnt close to where its supposed to be
  ywn suckle at a cosmonauts vacuumsealed pussy and asshole and nip at the pockets of pussy juice that build up
  chairmode
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh goddammit i am so lonely and horny aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh fuck fuck fuck
  the breasts and stomach look like a penis
  looks reverse crosseyed
  not bad i take back my comment on the negative space    perhaps adjust the hip so it lines up with the surrounding as well    picture related
_ツ_/
  the one place that hasnt been infected by capitalism  sopacedfs
i cant color for shit so here
want to add some pretty colors but also want to post it before going to sleeps so here is it
  stop editing my picture rrrreeeeeee
  this woman was made for sex
  thats cute blog
          found more
  you didnt really have to fix it but i agree with the other dudes in general people that say things like  just a sketch lmao i didnt even try   to get out of critique are really annoying
      jesus those thirsty boomer comments on each photo
    its still no fap novem goddamnit
  rachael was introduced to us by her long time pal jasi all we can say isthank you jasi rachael is a gorgeously proportioned 5 3 package with a figure to die for theres nothing this girl lacks a pretty face a voluptuous allnatural bosom a tight tummy shapely legs pretty behind and for you foot guys out there perfect little feet add to that that rachael is very sweet and quiet and seems to actually enjoy dressing girlish ie wearing mikes silk bows and you have what every redblooded male and probably not a few females would give their eye teeth for rachaels a freaking knockout
a final version
    he makes some pretty good erotic sculptures though
  
    samefag
  that waist  rory
  youre telling me i waited 3 days to reply to myself
  yea why not the you when replying to yourself goes away by that time if youre phone posting
bump cause i still wanna post mine but im slow
 innominate
  sorry no one asked for your blog anon
i know my anatomy sucks literally just started diving into loomis today      i like this a lot gmi/10      on your way anon keep at it      could work on anatomy but youre def heading in the right direction m8      i like your stylization anon good shit      unironically the best one in the thread      good sense of anatomy getting there brah
i cant stylize this because im still a beg fag but i took this as an exercise
  now this is some good anatomy and style save it for later reference keep it up anon
i was going for something different in the sketch and ended up with a frank cho rip off at least it was some practice    might try coloring it tomorrow
  head too small
  pen settings
i keep interpreting the hips as bony even though shes pretty beefy
    can i see yalls tumblr da pixie or other galleries so i can determine whether i want to commission you
  i dont wanna draw that bimbo tho
  id still fuck her at her age old ladies cant get pregnant old ageno dondomnirvanaexe
  that was fun
  lol you just replaced her with another thot
  better    any tips on getting the head size right i always draw them too small specially when im in a life drawing class    here i cropped the top of the head and the bottom of the crotch into fourths and resized from there but i might still be a little short
  love the colours
  blog
    i goobed on the face art is gay
  thanks
eh
  blacked   come on man
  i know that fucked up anatomy anywhere  youre the guy that deflects all crit right
  please teach me how to be good this reads really well
  i mean its better than thunder thot in the op right      uh i dont think so maybe i think im pretty accepting of crit normallythe op did say to draw it in a style you wouldnt normally do right
  good but you missed the shininess of the suit which was the most interesting/notable thing about the reference image
  posting so i can finish tomorrow
  nigger
  there is nothing lolita about this
it made me laugh
  where did they say it was lolita lel
  but you didnt draw it in a different style at all  she looks exactly like all your other girls ie deformed unattractive
  your filename says lolixxxplorer
  oh thats lol i xxxplorer
  kinda cool but did you give up drawing the heels and left hand
  is this loss
  u wot m8
  sure
  loli isnt the same thing as lolita anon
  loli is literally shorthand for lolita theyre the same thing regardless of what your mongolian fingerpaintings tell you
  someone is mad
  loli as a term is based on the novel lolita yes but it has evolved to mean its own thing focusing on the pedophilia aspect  lolita as a full term tends to refer to either the novel or the fashion the origin of the name for the fashion is unknown but for simplicitys sake its assumed to also be from the novel  they have similar origins but refer to completely different things if you want to use both interchangeably thats on you but that will no doubt only cause confusion
  im just being a nice guy and explaining basic western terminology to a paedo weebs on the internet 
i tried
  nono they arent
      it isnt
how come none of you draw her in way resembling the way she actually looks    i mean shes kinna ugly and that rouge and lipstick aint helping any all i see are people drawing pretty cartoon faces that dont look anything like her
      draw this and stylize it in a way you wouldnt normally
  hey man i would like to commission you
title
  based off the image you shared i would say no
  you can get the old ones on cgpeers the new ones are all the same    the real problem is the insane amount of sakimi clones this is because they start to copy every aspect of sakimi art process instead of use it as a ref for they own style
  this
  based off sakimishit art id say no   seriously though if you want to paint like her try getting it otherwise no
  ill do a trialrun with it if you tell me where i can pirate it
  cgpeers and cgpersia
  her tutorials are basically pic related get loomis or whatever if and start grinding if you want to learn dont think that she will infuse you with years of her own experience just because you bought her sketchbook
  loomis doesnt teach painting ir redding techniques to
  thats something you learn after you can draw an anatomically correct person with a fucking pencil
  how is that anime lmao
  retard if someone wants to learn how to paint its because they already know ho to draw
  i fucking wish you were right most people dont see the fucking difference
  semi realism its just as anime as the first one it just has color on it
  if someone wants to learn how to paint its because they already know ho to draw  anon
  well at least thats how it shoul be
  realism    lmao wtf
  no
  first two look much better than the third
  yes and no a lot of anons will go about how sakimichan cant construct and is not well versed in perspective this is accurate to a degree however sakimichan is good at hiding these shortcomings through rendering specifically through using soft rounds/airbrushes to create very airy and light aesthetics youd expect from feminine subject matter coincidentally sakimachan draws women almost exclusively her lack of usage of hard direct light and therefore hard shadows also prevents her from from having stronger contrast since the only way to make indirect lighting look natural is to keep colors less saturated and more in line with middle grays already present in short she makes women who look like porcelain dolls airbrushed with blush with extremely subtle changes in tone that make it feel like all colors bleed into every other color you can see this by looking at the eyes in the third pic even the lashes and the edges of the eye lids have soft undefined edges leaving the viewer to subconsciously fill in details    however this technique can be extremely effective as i said previously it has a very feminine quality to it and coupling it with pinup can make for some very appealing pieces if the figures pose carries the composition well enough since you can bet your ass there wont be any colors strong enough to lead the eye anywhere outside the face also you can hide a lot of anatomy mistakes behind hair and foreground objects as well think of it like advanced hand hiding    i give sakimichan where credit is due she can render well enough with airbrushes to make appealing pieces to most people of lack untrained eyes and if youre trying to run a business appealing to the least common denominator is not only necessary but encouraged    take what you will op i try to think that everyone has at least one thing to teach and she might have something useful for you
  soul and soulless
  this analysis is way too good for sakimchis garbage anon   please keep posting on /ic/
  tldr knowing how to convincingly portray form along with good aesthetic sensibility on top of decent perspective and anatomy is enough for normal people anyone with half a brain looking at the art market could figure this out
  yes     absolutely     money is being made copying her style
  on top of decent perspective and anatomy  yeah you obviously didnt read what he said lmao
  coincidentally sakimachan draws women almost exclusively  not true almost all of her patreon sets include male characters although they too look like porcelain dolls
  appealing to the least common denominator     this mentality is why so many artists are poor
  if you dont think her perspective and anatomy are at least decent youre a delusional crab and you probably havent been drawing very long/dont draw at all
  in my defense i said almost exclusively but i dont recall ever seeing males drawn by her until seeing this thanks for the correction is it an even spread of men and women ive never paid for her sets and have mostly only seen stuff on her da or stuff thats been posted second hand
  i just torrented her patreon stuff because i enjoy looking at ultra hidef art and she even posts her psds  its practically even every set has a few females and a few males all with clothed and nude variants
  what a surprise another /beg that hates anything poopular she does have decent anatomy she wouldnt be popular if she didnt
  fair enough i will say i feel bad about my comments on lighting while she still abuses color dodge to yank contrast out of thin air she doesnt seem as averse to shadows as she was several years ago although i also dont know how recent this is i feel bad for bring that up ill have to look at her newer work more thanks anon
im sure you can learn more from her than bad habits if youre interested
i hate when people just write current instead of putting a date next to it
    good god ngl after getting home and getting on my computer seeing these in high res makes them look so much more unfinished also sakimichan cant render anything outside of glazed clay
  pseudorealism
  the small eyes feel weird on the wide mango face
  its not anime but western aunimay
do people actually use cgpersia to download stuff its so fucking slow each file is 1gb but they throttle the speed at 50kb/s
  as someone who threw a few bucks her way on patreon for about 3 months i woyld say shes doing 60 females / 40 males not exactly even but men arent rare  that said its true that she also makes nude variants but they are in fact nude edits shell go from the finished clothed version and redraw the skin on top of clothes which triggers me for some reason
  cgpersia  not cgpeers  pleb
  i keep forgetting to sign up
  ive read somewhere that shes not even the one who does the nude versions other people do it for her
  ive seen some of her painting videos and some of the nude edits video and it didnt really feel like different people working  thats not saying that it is proof and maybe some of the nonvideo documented ones arent made by her but i cant tell  what i can tell though is that her dick drawins are pretty terrible its symbol painting of the highest degree
  hey can someone find that one image where someone outlined this  i cant find it anywhere or at least i dont know where to lookgoogle search has failed me and i dont see them in the archives
  based high iq anon
  seeing these in high res makes them look so much more unfinished  in my opinion thats because she has no hard edges at all and relies on the resolution drop to sharpen her edges and smooth the small problems  its a tool and it can work as long as you dont look too closely
  she has six fucking fingers
  fuck cant unsee youve ruined it for me faggot

roast my birdie  what would be the best instrument to use to use shades of black/gey   its not from any refrerence just looked at crow videos and drew it and i think i like the idea of it not the application
  looks like you used a stuffed bird for reference too stiff and awkward looking
  this fucking image    why are you retards still posting this meme image you are not supposed to draw what you see
  you are not meant to copy exactly what you see    is what i meant obviously
  dont learn the same way every influential master in fine art history did  stfu and go attempt to construct some more disfigured anime girls retard
    oh yeah draw something completely without reference idiot    also a list of people that did not drew exactly what they saw rubens michelangelo raphael rodin del sarto should i continue
        calm down draw friends its just a pic with some advice     yes being able to understand 3 dimensional forms and construction is important for illustrating from your imagination and its something everyone trying to draw should learn the reason that image gets posted here and doesnt mention anything about construction and form is because understanding that what you think you see is not what you actually see is one of the first things you should learn about drawing if you want to begin understanding how to fool the eye into thinking a flat image is 3d this is the beginner thread after all so the assumption is a beginner doesnt know how their eye function two things can be right at the same time    ease up draw something post work get better 
  roast my bird too
a sketch i did recently i feel like im improving but not as fast as i want i dont like the brush strokes and the lines but i was more focused on anatomy and proportion
  how does one know when theyre ready to move on from the grind boxes spheres and cylinders stage
  by trying
  when they start to look good and convincing it takes time to be able to use perspective rules intuitively to construct them
  what i mean is that i can draw loomis head quite well after a year of practice but dont know where to go next it isnt that drawing 3d forms is hard but i dont want to become stuck
  you are miles better than most of the quitters on /ic/ will ever hope to be
  how do you know
  start constructing shit you already have the building blocks
  are you doing drawabox my suggestion is just get comfortable at rotating 3d shapes and move on his pattern of autistically grinding the shit out of everything sucks all the fun out drawing imo dont do all the homework he prescribes if you feel comfortable with the concepts hes teaching
i want to study values by doing value spheres i suck shit at imagining lighting and im still having difficulties perceiving tonal differences from more complex forms and from copying from life so i want to copy a drawing of a tonal sphere obviously imitating the tone to the best i can but i was wondering if there was any problem from copying a drawing of a sphere instead of an actual spherical object or a rendered sphere
  thx anon
  when drawing a box spheres and cylinders becomes second nature do it until you cant get wrong
ohhhh ahm a good ole rebel  well thats just what ah am  i will not use construction and ah do not give a dam
  humanists uk
trying to do head practice but all of my heads end up looking like shit also trying to draw paper in different perspectives as well so i can get a feel for face rotation but its just not clicking do i just keep going    shit on me regardless because i need some critique
finished this a few hours ago and something feels off with it but im not sure what any ideas also thoughts on the shading
  forgot to resize the image
  same    
  practice dividing spheres into quarters
complete brainlet here im reading the link in the stick and it says to try to copy a picasso upside down does that i mean i look at the picture in the correct orientation and draw an upside down version of it or do i flip the picture upside down and copy it directly
  flip the picasso and draw it as you see it
  im as beg as you  belive me weeks ago i had same problem and i still have it i started reading michael hampton figure drawing and it helped me i think you should practice a bit the sphere like trying to draw a perfect sphere using one linealso try to understand the perspective and how it works dont give up and keep drawing
  btw reference if anyone is interested
      have you ever read loomis i thought it was a meme but i was so wrong
  will do      thanks ill check it out      i have a bit yeah i was mostly following prokos approach
  proko  might as well give up
  i thought you fags loved proko either way dont worry ill study wrinkly old men heads just for you
  proko is the meme now
  in all seriousness any reason whats different now
  well besides proko being a manlet is that he doesnt tend to a retards needs like me to hold his hands and guide me step by step with a side of critique nothing he does is fun
  dont listen to that anon proko is fine just not the be all end all for learning figure drawing just got to look out for as many methods as possible and see what gels with you
  if you folliw proko then let me see your art i want to see if hes helped you
  nice little sketch but she looks so sad anon are you feeling sad    i know it i a sketch but the poor girls face is quite fallen apart here are some guidelines to get the faces parts you can keep halving distances alf the dead and that gives you the line for the eyes half it under the eyes and that gives you the place of the bottom of the nose half it under the nose ad that gives you the bottom of the lower lip once you have got these measurements down it should be much easier keep in mind that these might change based on different people and with different facial expressions but that is generally a good estimate the eyes need to have a distance from each other that is the size of a 3rd eye the chin line should shrink into a narrower angle roughly at the line of the mouth the mouths edges roughly stretch as wide as the eyeballs are on the face but there can be a lot of leeway there to exaggerate an emotion feel free to make the upper lip darker it generally works    please do not neglect the ears the ears are key landmarks of the head and while we often forget to associate them with the face our brains are wired to instantly tell the heads direction using the ears as a landmark practice and respect the ears they are important
  how did i do i spent 5 hours on this
  ngmi
  lets see 5 hours its a bit too much its something and its original but needs to be improved do you want to draw anime  or it doesnt matter  you should start with exercise for shapesproportion etc read some books and keep drawing
  5 hours
    anyone
  as a complete newbie it looks fine to me the only thing that i can say that stands out is the lack of shading on the legs they look pretty flat
  the last time i drew anything past a scribble was 10 years ago    i would like to i wanna draw my own manga someday    i like it
  i got you when i get off work anon
can someone redline some legs onto this or give me a reference that shows me how it could be done
  did you draw the eyes that way on purpose or are you just bad with open eyes
  im bad with eyes i tried but ended up scrapping them
  i was doing it already geez       anyways i think it i super cute for the cartoonish style i admit i am no good at cell shading at all but i tried to add some things to it to make her more lively
  thanks anon i really like the way youve shaded this i think it just goes to show that i need to work on my cell shading i really like the highlights so ill probably work to incorporate that into the style
  how do you shade better i know its a dumb question but do i just darken the current color
  im a ballerina
  also curious about this all of my shit looks really flat
how would one lay out a loomis simplified skeleton for this character  please draw it in red line
    shading has heavy correlation with the light source and the local colors but the general idea is that you darken the color duh but you also slowly decrease the saturation of it and you can move the color wheel value to darker/colder colors slightly as you decerase the saturation usually this is up to you on which way purple blue and greenish greys can work well but none of these are hard rules colors are a big and complicated subject and it id more important that your colors work well together on teh whole picture    pic i did some earlier thread kind of explains it
  thank you anon this was insightful
  like this armor anon
  a loomis simplified skeleton  what exactly is that explain
  like this  dont know how to apply that simple skeleton to map out her body
  i dunno is this what you meant
  ahh yes  but is it just a matter of knowing the female muscle shapes to then just stick them onto the skeleton
i have a rubiks cube sitting on my desk and its surprisingly hard to just draw the outline of it from observation no rendering it always comes out with some sides tilted or uneven or its just at the wrong angle etc are there any tricks for more carefully reproducing the sizes/angles of objects like this beyond hurr just practice
  learn vilppus gesture drawing method
drew balls any tips on getting the axis in the correct spot especially on the almost side views newer balls are the smaller ones
  to be frank you need to practice getting measurements and your shapes consistent    most of the 1/3 guidelines you drew up are not thirds the circles arent even proper circles or ellipses    there is a reason why the artist holding his pencil in front of him to measure is an iconic meme
  if drawing on actual psychical paper then use a ruler to draw your lines    if you are trying to draw straight lines free hand and trying to have those lines parallel to each other then they are going to drift and not be straight which is going to make drawing a cube really hard    if you do it without a ruler then you are going to have to draw the lines quickly
  what do you mean by thirds i didnt realize i was supposed to be measuring im just going through loomis
  yeah i should just use a ruler for geometric objects like that no rules just tools  i think i can sort of measure angles by closing one eye and tilting a pencil some pencil im not currently drawing with i mean to match the angle of the line i see and then carefully putting that pencil on the paper its easy to tilt the measuring stick slightly while youre transferring it though
  im not that anon but i can draw lines my problem is to put these lines in perspective  im reading all these books but is so damn hard to drawing a cube rotating
  wtf are you drawing qith
  my hand and a tablet
why does my brain try to rationalize not drawing
done did not do a 4b pass mostly because im lazy      the desire to not draw is the desire to submit to entropy    ill never forget when i learned that human beings by virtue of creating break the order of the universe by being the only things to fight entropy so if you want to tell the universe to fuck itself do something to fight entropy draw
will my mild ocd help me or not with learing how to draw i can spot if something is even a few millimeters off
  wont help get over the ocd or you wont ever achieve anything in life  you wont ever do anything perfectly
  its not really harming me in any way its not that bad i was just talking about the ability to spot mistakes
  i think its gonna be harder to draw  the first 2 years of drawing most likely everything is shit anyways
can i really become an artist if  no tablet  use thinkpads laptops mouse basically a red circle  use so little time for drawing  use firealpaca
  no
  fun with a pencil drawing figure for all its worth     he has pages in both books irc called the divided ball and plane method where you divide from the chin to the hair line into thirds and mark the nose and ear and eyebrow line i just assumed you were doing it     regardless always measure how do you know if you arms are the same length how do you know if you drew the forearm shorter than the upper arm i am not talking about anatomy here    when talking about proportions it is not an exact number but is this thing in proportion to another    so when i see you are trying to draw the head and your guidelines are not in proportion to each other i thought you intended to be i said practice measuring    and please actually go through loomis and try to understand it not just look through the examples and try to redraw it
    name of the girl
  what can i do to improve upon this
  what tablet though
  おまえはにほんごですか
  i think you meant 日本人 but no im not
  same thing
i did the upside down picasso unironically the best thing ive ever drawn fucked up the hands majorly and the head is mess too but its a start i guess im actually pretty motivated i think ill pirate one of the exercise books mentioned in the sticky and work through it
i gave up on digital art for awhile and i only recently got back into it i wanna paint and render really good but its complicated to find straightforward loomis style tutorials especially when im using a slightly more lowkey progam like krita rather than photoshop    i put light airbrush on this any general things i should know about painting rendering and color theory
  for some reason i thought you were replying to  which was my second post my bad i didnt use loomis for that image just proko and paper perspective look at my other post for me actually attempting some of loomis    either way i see what you mean though for the most part thanks will keep the measuring tips in mind      xppen deco01 does it suck or something
how to maximize performance in krita fresh install of 415 that i didnt use before
  ive tried drawing since i was 13 until i was 23 and almost everyday i dedicated at least 3 hours to learning and practicing drawing whether through my own effort and using online resources or asking others to help try and grasp the basic concepts of art i slowly realized i sucked at art and would never be able to reach my goal and get a manga serialization in a japanese magazine i dont know if digital art wouldve made a difference but i tried everything for those 10 years by hand since i didnt want to buy a tablet until i was sure i had the basics down and was ready to keep moving forward i am 25 now and last year i dumped all my old art shit away because it is trash and i never was able to make it far or really advance is there any hope i could learn how to draw
  yes go draw
  the reflected light is too light its still supposed to be dark just less so
im afraid of colors
  what if i still dont gain any skill after 10 years
spent a few hours applying the final ink on this obviously super slow my autism forces me to always redo a line at the slightest error so the final tracing part is harder than anything that preceds it how do i solve this
  if  thats your problem go draw already
  okay
  nice
  post your work anon maybe someone her can help
  you want us to judge your possibilities at drawing but you have not posted any
  if its your autism you cant really fix it but just know that people dont often see the same mistakes you do especially normies also your shit looks good
  do you have any wips i really like the way your drawings turn out
  read the manual lol
i just got into digital art 2 days ago please dont bully
  she looks like shes really been rolling in poop my dude i like the eyes though
  i made the cover btw what should i credit you as
  pick better colors not ones direvtly eyedroped from the source especisly for cel shading unless you are doing an exact copy
i have this problem of never being able to push myself to try again i cant ever bring myself to start over  i put so much pressure on myself to get it right the first time that when i make a mistake i just give up    how do i work past this is it even possible or am i just doomed to never drawing enough to actually get good
  are you depresso
  i dont think so how do you know
  lack of motivation is one of the key things with depression does it apply to other stuff or just art for what its worth i think you need to take more time measuring stuff and less time actually draing stop the chicken scratch right now and never do it again even if you make mistakes
  well now that i think about it i do tend to avoid doing most things that i want/need to do because ive already preordained that it isnt going to work  i just dont have any faith that my drawing will improve or that its possible to meet people outside of work im furious that schooling is so expensive that you have to work an entrylevel job full time for several years just to get a chance to become a better human being so i end up feeling like art is my only reasonable option and yet it also stresses me out enough that i never draw which sucks because i do enjoy drawing but im just so focused on what it actually means for me that i just want to crawl into a pit of spiders and cry    also i thought chicken scratch was feathering your lines does it still count if youre redrawing the same line multiple times and just fucking it up
  i sort of get you    school is expensive im doing a 5 year degree that has a 6th year honours and im going to have to do a masters after that if i want to actually get a cool job the work i cant sympathize with because i set myself up financially    the artwork no one has talent you may have an aptitude or2 lear3n faster but everything is skill and practice i just do art as a hobby so i only get in like 30 mins a day but if you dont put in the time youll never see results    whats to the right of the books dog
any tips for drawing accurate dinosaurs should i reference off of fossils first or would using the most current reconstruction be better
should i just kill myself or keep doin loomis like i have been for ages i just got back into drawing
  draw from life or failing that copy reference without tracing youll figure out your own method eventually which will likely diverge from loomis quite a bit those books in particular are only a launching point but dont discredit their value keep drawing experiment more
  thanks man this was actually pretty helpful/comforting
  assuming youre talking about the little box that is a lap desk it looks pretty much like that from the angle i was drawing it from so im not sure how i would make it more clear without rendering  which i dont know how to do in pen
   its good to see niceanons are still kickin around here
  my man drawing an accurate cube freehaned is one of the hardest things to do for newcomers in some art curriculum people spend a whole semester just drawing cubes very large to internalize the structure of the 3d form i only had to do for a few times in class but believe me that shit aint easy they teach you to measure the distances to be able to put it on your paper accurately cube drawing freehanded on your paper is a generic grind you must do in art class from multiple angles because while it is boring and is frustrating it is actually a pretty complex exercise that trains your vision and observation very well    here is the academic instruction on measuring with your pencil it needs a practice      it is a bit of a long read but this is basically the thing they would tell you in art class to do ask if you got questions good luck
  do not get discouraged anon take a break and come back to it and keep doing it art is a grind no way around that so patience is key
  im afraid of colors  why explain further
  so if i just draw that entropy just goes away
  xppen deco01 does it suck or something  yes
  how do i into abstract composition homework for school i have attended the classes but tutor rejected all my comps so far and i need to remake them this week they were rejected because not abstract enough i guess the tutor expects stuff thats more like modern art    its mostly stuff like red monochromatic rhythmic composition or unbalanced and made with colours that remind of fear i guess i lack imagination but i need to complete them till the next thursday or friday
im right handed but i got nerve damage in my right arm would forcing myself to draw left handed be practical or would it just hold me back in the long run
  left handed people used to be forced to write with a right hand often in the past you can try to too also i heard tennis/table tennis players sometimes learn how to play with the opposite hand to confuse their enemies but idk how precise your art can be that way
i tried to dial in on my linework a little bit and tried to measure more but i dont think i did a very good job
  it just takes extra i play left handed guitar even though im right handed but drawing probs is gonna take longer to get used to
  of course it posted sideways despite doing everything to make it not do that
  the proportions are better i dont think a caligraphy pen is your best bet due to the way it flows and curves though get a flowmate or something
  i like the line variations you can get with a fountain pen and it feels very satisfying to use even if im nowhere near skilled enough to make good use of it i dont like the way ballpoints drag on the page and force you to make a groove on the paper just to put ink down it feels sluggish by comparison    not that it matters since my perspective is garbage and im probably ngmi anyway
  sounds like you have yourself convinced that you are not going to make it    i guess theres no point in anyone trying to convince you    ah well
  is the headstock broken off the neck of the guitar you should definitely try out the brush pen listed in the sticky and watch a peter han demo video it might inspire you but i can see you need a primer on perspective based on the game console and bottom of the guitar skim perspective made easy draw some boxes with a ruler and pencil and it should help you see some errors
  wow rly gud bird
  draw animals and their skeletons that resemble dinosaurs better to give yourself a way to cheat so you can experiment and see what works for you
  your accuracy is really bad ditch the colors if you want a decent critique here
  i do not mean to be rude here anon but the lights and shadows seem to be randomly all over the place on those shapes like they do not follow the surface of the shapes at all    the red should have a much larger shadow if you follow the highlight spot and the reflected light seems to be coming from some other random direction possibly a second light source that is not pictured it also doe not take the color of the teal local value that comes form the table i tried to adjust this a but made the light source a bit differently to make it fit the image    the cylinder is lit from the left side pointing behind it because of the perspective the shadow must be mirrored on the table moving upwards yet the shadow seem to take a 90 degrees turn to the right and come towards the right of the shape i tried to adjust this to leave the shadow there and adjust the direction to the light source to match it    the beanbag is the most confusing i cant seem to find the direction it is is it floating or lying on the ground which was does the light come from how reflective is it i t seem quite reflective because of the stripes on its side but those do not add up to its surface i tried to put it on a surface and use the highlight spot to apply some shadow on it
  trace it over on a new sheet of paper  and then trace that over on a new sheet of paper
  copy anime until you can fap to your drawings sticky teaches you how to measure itll be fun and youll improve a lot as long as you have the good sense to stop copying anime once you nut
  not sure what the implication is here
  do value studies which means copying from a picture or i guess actual toy blocks making sure to start out with only one prominent light source
  draw the three lines meeting up into the center corner then draw the rest of the outline make good use of dots as in plot where the endpoints of your lines will be before you draw to avoid erasing everything over and over again straight lines come from some combination of ghosting speed and tracing notebook paper a lot
where is the thread for looking for art books  is it in the /ic/ board orwhat  i am looking for anatomy and perspective
  ever look at the paid drawabox critiques after 250 boxes/cylinders he just fucking passes you even if theyre mediocre as long as you follow his process pick the worst attempt he passed and ask yourself if your forms are of comparable quality they are dont fucking grind 250 boxes then thats a complete waste of time
  its the upside down stravinsky with values thrown in you can only get so inaccurate before you start getting into deviantart nightmare levels of stagnation
  theres a few links in the /beg/ sticky  the artbook thread is here   search thoroughly before asking
any tips on how to move forward with rendering also any tips on how to get the face right under these lighting circumstances of the hair partially covering the face also i dont know how to move forward with the neck for the same reasons of being partially obscured
how good is this for learning anatomy in stylized drawings
  thats why i said use a freeflowing ink pen
  like a 23
  learn how to draw first
  i see people saying this sometimes i dont know what youre getting at specifically because it is a vague statement can you point out some issues that lead you to say this im groping in the dark with specifics
  without specifics i meant to say
  fuck
  eho the frick is sycra ill say it a million times  learn proper anatomy before you learn to stylize
  do you seriously not know who he is
    hes the chris hart of youtube
  he looks like he stylises everything and cant actually draw that well
  that one on the bottom right  if it isnt op in next /beg/ thread im gonna riot
  majin vegeta by yugioh style
  do you mean like the steps i took for that image in particular ill post the progress for the image you replied to    im not working on anything on the moment so no wip in that regard    1/4
    1/4 is the initial sketching where i figure out the proportions the size and the relationship between a lot of the features it still scares me because 1/4 never looks anywhere near the final result took me about 4590 minutes not sure    2/4 i start with 2h to sketch in values this was halfway through
  3/4 i finish laying in 2h values i should mention i check in 1/4 and 3/4 with the original image to look for any errors because once i go further it becomes really difficult to fix things
  4/4 i finished with 2b values i usually get tired towards this stage and i never do a pass with 4b like i intend to    this is all done with graphite so when i scan the images in they appear lighter then they really are unfortunately i was thinking of doing some postprocessing but meh i could work with charcoal but i generally never liked working with it since it is even less forgiving    i make some minor changes between here the the one i posted here  but it is all minor stuff
what are some good youtuber artists that post long tutorials that show and explain the different stages of drawing all that sped up 20x shit looks like black magic to me
  
  crap i forgot to mention i wanted a digital art videos but thanks anyway
  you literally cherrypicked one of his worst works
im a beginner obviously    how do i draw with a pencil objects that arent mostly smooth especially fur of cats or hamsters and other animals also any advice is welcome     the picture was a 5 min sketch
  its a random character design im afraid
how bad is this sketch
  i think painting is very vague and i suck  i suck at drawing too but at least i know whats wrong and what study to get better painting feels to chaotic  gonna post work later
  cmon thats just showing off    how the hell do you get so good that you can just bust that out so quickly im at the end of my tether and it feels like no amount of practice is going to achieve results like that
  so quickly  the post is one day old
man i need to work on my proportions/accuracy for drawing from life
  hatching check out the hatching techniques by utilising different types on different objects you can differentiate them
  not him but i can see trex arms elastic ribcage absolutely ginormous thighs and ass also i think boobs dont follow the gravity properly but i may be mistaken  though again it ties in with the shape of ribcage
  you tried/10
  anon please practice your fundies and do traditional until you can draw a complete figure off your head with ease
     not drawing asuka instead    its pretty rough man but it look looks like one of those meme drawings thats intentionally trying to look bad its got a weird charm in that way
  by doing traditional you mean drawing references
  this lads benis equals his pupil in length hope ill reach this level of backward exaggeration some day
  traditional as in pen and paper
  yeah pencil and paper when i first started taking art seriously i would religiously do traditional figure drawing studies from reference this helped me greatly and i found out years later that doing digital felt way way easier than traditional now i do digital but i think that having that traditional background is really important
any advices or criticism except that my sketch is messy 
  sketch is very messy
  right shoulder should be closer to her neck and left leg should be higher also draw the rest of her arms/legs and hands/feet desu    overall its a hecking sketch please draw more before asking for critiqueu
  look at the timestamps for both posts you chop
how would one go about drawing a better thicc thigh
  actually draw a thigh
  you fool youve just listed everything i like about the picture
  you wont make it with such poor taste
  can you elaborate whats wrong with it
i have been drawing on and off since i was a kid and have never thought of my work as professional in quality this year ive taken up drawing again and have been trying to improve here is my latest work on the left is the actual ink drawing on the right is the drawing after some photoshop work i would appreciate any constructive critique thanks
  when are you gonna get out of your comfort zone
  what do you mean
  draw rest of body with it so it has somewhere to fit in  make fishnets wrap around the contour of the thicc thigh instead of straight xs  you will have to draw a lot of ellipses
      i redone it guys idk if its better but at least its cleaner
  proko head is just loomis head dont bother listen to that guy
  thank you
  its better your pose is slightly less exaggerated than the reference but its still accurate and correct
  xppen deco01  remember to turn it to display ratio mode not max active area or else the circle you draw in tablet will turn into the ellipse
  pleeeeeeeeeeaaaasssseeeee pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeassse help
    what that means anon is that it would benefit you to study the fundamental before going straight into the deep water of rendering something in 3d just drawing with lines is faster for your to learn stuff like anatomy    on your question on rendering rendering should be done in high res with large brushes to put down the basic shapes and then smaller and smaller brushes to render out the details your rendering will be better if you add more midtone values to it and make details better with gradually smaller brushes
  thx yeah i try not to exaggerate
  thats better man
  rendering      ctrpaint rendering video series      color theory    
    no offence but your sketch is not that great why do you want to study color already  practice loomis with pencil and paper if u cant use ps
  thx anon
  this  was meant for you
  try to help others  never be answered myself
  try to hold your pencils tip horizontally to make a larger surface
  to be fair anon your question is really hard to answer
  it also comes down to personal preferences of the teacher and the school curriculum you basically need to guess
just realising how fucking great a resource proko is  dont make my mistake younglings
critiques on my arms anatomy practice
  tell me more pls
  shit forgive me for not resizing
does anyone else come to this threads just to say  im better than this dude this dude this dude shit this beg draws better than me this dude  to feel a little better about themselves please tell me im not the only one
today i learned that colored pencil and graphite dont mix    are there any resources out there that explaingl good ways to use colored pencils correctly
  sometimes it can feel validating to know youre better than your peers but then the realization kicks in that theyre probably trying a lot harder than you are and you feel a little guilty about judging them    i try to help where i can even if i rarely follow my own advice because i know that i would appreciate the same from them if the roles were reversed
  get pencial and paper retard cheaper then the electricity to use the thinkpad
did a value study for the first time
  why arent you using a skeleton you could have done your legs at the beginning with everything else and then do the detail on top i think starting everything simlified and then detailing it is better than detailing the upper body and then having to start new for the lower one
  the squeeze is usually a lot more subtle on the hose also try actually drawing the entire thigh crotch to knee
just having fun and wanted to share    everyone complains about hands but feet are a real puzzle
just got the pentel pocket brush its really fun to draw with but goddamn does it feel hard to control any exercises or anything i can do specifically to control the pentel pocket brush or is it just that i should draw a lot with it and control will come naturally
  throughout my artist career about 2 years now i ignored the importance of building up your subjects with forms starting with a cylinder and then adding to it to form the muscles of the leg for example proko is all about that     i knew it was important and i tried to keep it in mind while drawing but i didnt truly understand
  the trouble for me is trusting that ill be able to skip those steps once i fully understand what im doing and just want to jump to the part where i already get it  so i end up thinking i know what to do trying it fucking it up and then saying to myself i just dont know what went wrong
  in art the only thing you can really be sure of is how little you actually know
any help and advice appreciated
having major problems trying to make the arms look ok in this one i know the proportions are off but the main thing i am trying to wrap my head around is where the arms would both connect and at what point they would dissapear in front of the body imagine hes clutching his groin or something how would the arms look from the back    also some advice for shading would be nice the light source is behind and above to the right of the picture any help is appreciated thanks
  have you even tried to implement fundamentals
anything glaringly wrong with this i thought it was fine though i guess the extended arm might be a bit dislocated
in three years do you think screen drawing tablet prices will go down significantly
  1  anime style i know that is what you are going for but if you are strictly trying to improve then it is not the best way     2  the hands look pretty bad i think that is because the fingers go too far down the hand the fingers are roughly the same size as the palm    3  overall the muscles are ok but the poses are kinda off like the bottom left guys shoulder seems to be too far back and things like that     4  you have a lot of potential i like the expression like not the faces but the motion of the piece good work
where to start with anatomy never drawn anything humanoid before and im an absolute beg
ok so im back again to beg for help can someone red line this and show me how to pose her/draw arms leaning or just show me where i went wrong and what to change
  absolute beg  /beg/ sticky no point trying anatomy if your accuracy sucks
  fair enough ill just work through those then
first time figure drawing how does it look boys
      thanks m8
  the sketch is far too rough to the point where it is hard to distinguish completely what is going on the arms and legs have very poor knowledge of anatomy which is the main flaw here other than the sketchiness the left arm in particular is connected very oddly to the body and the right arm is too short and oriented in a confusing way    overall it is pretty terrible but being your first time that is fair enough to improve work on your lineart even in sketches try to have more confident lines also study anatomy religiously even before you bother with proportion    how long did this take you something like that should take about a minute but that thick linework tells me that this probably took about five to ten minutes
  start with construction simplify the figure to boxes and cylinders then construct the pose meanwhile dont worry about the outline or the detail of anatomy yet that comes after youve learned to properly give structure to your figure by first simplifying it boxes for the ribcage and pelvis connected by the spine boxes or cylinders for the limbs and the head practice that a few times and then start refining the shapes to look more and more realistic and study basic anatomy alongside that
  that looks like a fish with long beaks and feet rather than bird for me
  keep it up work on a more neutral background so you can see the values better dont over blend and practice your edge control its better to emphasize the forms even if it looks blocky as you can always polish them after the form is lost if you start with too much blending keep in mind the structure of the brow and the nose next to the eye and that you are molding these forms with light and shadow remember that the eye is a ball and the corners are fleshy indentations think about the direction of your light source and how it is casting shadows
  when you circle out muscle groups like that they will look disjointed its not a proper representation of how they connect together the muscles have a rhythm and flow to how they weave into each other you lose that when you isolate them like that learn rhythm lines also when drawing lines to show the form do it all the way around not just for the parts that bulge out
can shadows be warm
  i picked it entirely at random none of his other works are particularly good
    thanks for the details in your crits i wasnt the guy who called you a fool i do see what you mean about the elastic rib cage ill work on that the big legs are deliberate though but i will experiment with different proportions
  this was helpful thanks for giving an example of a rework in your pic related ill consider your words and work on improving on those areas
  not significantly but you can get a decent one for about 200 right now the samsung galaxy tab a with spen
never tried coloring before is anything off  and the falling guy is supposed to have a bowlcut
how long do you guys practice every day
  for the past 3 days ive been drawing maybe 5 hours a day on my new tablet much comfier than traditional though ive always been in cycles of drawing a lot then dropping it for a while and coming back i do it cause its fun
  well the thing with legs you still need to keep them within the more or less realistic size if you are going for more or less realistic other body parts or it would just look gross if you want to exaggerate them so much you would be better off with cartoony style which is much better suited to it
  you spelled nigger wrong
  i have just started using pencils too so im seconding the question for pencil advice i got a pack of watercolor pencils also colors are complicated but fun or at least which yt channels show how to use them well and correctly
how is it possible that i can delude myself into thinking some of my worst creations are passable  only after i get back to it months later do i realize what shouldve been obvious right away
  youre only just now learning how to see dont be too hard on your past self
  flip your canvas / paper horizontally to see whats wrong every so often take 5 min breaks from your computer too
just a drawing of a demon oc i had ive been trying to be more complex with my colours especially with skin    what should my tablets screen settings be when painting i know i need to keep in mind that itll look different on different monitors is there a standard  i usually have my tablet on a low saturation setting if thats any help
  ive started to incorporate that and it does help the mind does get used to things      you can try to play with the brightness i think overall its good but maybe a bit too much contract on some of the darker colors
  your oc looks like killer queen    play around with the fire as a light source and the curvature of the hair tentacles
  you should be happy with this    i always see peoples drawings on advertisements or childrens play areas and other places where people have did a drawing and the way they are drawn is always bad     im here to tell you now that your sketch doesnt come close to how bad their final drawing is    and heres the killer about this this you are only a beginner
thread was tldr here is some quick advice    dont put your focus on trying to draw something that looks good as a beginner artist you should be practicing your hand/eye skills by drawing from life your focus should be on capturing life like proportions forms textures and lighting    start with individual objects that have simple shapes and not so complicated textures add single light source that will create light coming from a certain angle this helps you practice understanding how a simple light source works on different forms after you become more comfortable with this practice then start practicing on objects with more complicated forms and textures say something like a sneaker backpack keys a light colored shirt lying slightly crumpled up move from single objects to a still life that is a group of objects you have arranged together in a pleasing design    you should probably spend somewhere between 50 and 150 hours total at this stage before expecting to advance up to a good place on the learning curve and your drawings are truly life like proportions are right on form makes sense to anybody b/c you captured the light correctly and your textures bring each object to life    at some point you should more on to studying the human body and face in a similar fashion working from life is best but if you cant get people to sit for you for an hour or 2 then using photo reference is acceptable dont underestimate the benefit of practicing from life it gives you a better understanding and the hours you put in give more/better experience and you learn more if you cant get people to pose for you go somewhere public where people are likely to be still for period of time and try to sketch them like a mall food court or something when sketching people its good to build up to longer drawings by doing quick 60 second gesture drawings first that look really squiggly and just try to capture the essence of the form
  thanks for the critique anon ill be sure to pay closer attention
  thank you anon kinda hoping for more tldrs like this
  if he is clutching the groin shoulders would go a little forward instead of staying as if he was just standing normally you will see more of the upper arm and less of the forearm currently the arms go nowhere near the groin and just lay on the thighs
  thx anon appreciateim happy with it because i can see i improved a bit a month ago i couldnt draw like this also i can see im improving with poses as well 
  thats great dewd with the way youre going you will get where you want to be  just completely ignore the trolling and only take on board constructive criticism
  here is your redline anon before you start the details just do the basic shapes and check it from far away if it works like the reference do not just copy the reference once you got the construction down try to take the characters individual shape into consideration
even though some people i ask say its fine i still struggle with chins it never feels right and it keeps me from focusing on other parts of my drawing like getting the eyelids right
  fine pencilwork anon you clearly worked a lot at this here are some suggestions   use the eyebrows better the eyebrows are an integral part of conveying facial emotion and so many beginners treat them as just an afterthought the eyebrows pull together when you are tensed both because it is a social que for hostiliy and to focus your sight on your opponentso not have leave a gap between the eye ball the the eyebrows combine the eyebrow with the eye itself to achieve the effect    hands are much lager than you portray them they can cover the face from the chin up to the eyebrows men in general especially have larger jagged and bonier hands the yaoi hands meme was invented for a reason after all    when you grin the sides of your mouth turn dark because the teeth do not cover up to the sides also the skin of the face is pulled apart and pushed upward cause the outer side of your eye to push up as well it is even more apparent if you close the eyes that is where the _ emotion comes from    use these details to your advantage to convey the faces emotions manga artists usually know these that is why they draw like that
  where tf do people get this pop out color picker do i have to take it up the ass and sign up for photoshop cc to get such a basic feature
  anon i dont know much about abstraction but i think it ahs some things to do with what yo uare trying to convey a feeling an emotion an idea what are you trying to convey with your art besides i gotta do this home work cause i am forced to
how long does it usually take to get the confirmation email from cgpeers
  thanks
is there a better exercise book than drawing on the right side of the brain ive flicked through the first two hundred pages and theres only been two exercises the rest is just pseudointellectual exposition from the author
theres so much to learn in art its almost overwhelming    how do you choose just one thing to focus on
  keys to drawing
  yeah the exercises are okay but the book itself is shit check out the sticky in catalog it has most of what you need to start if you are really put off by both right side and keys to drawing just start drawing some 3d shapes cubes cylinders cones and so on and try to draw from life while reading loomis and perspective made easy
  find and artist that you really like and check what he concentrates on then put more emphasis on this
  just draw what you like
  thanks for your critiques anon i made another try and i think it came out much better than the first one
when you draw should you keep your hand lifted a bit over the paper or can you rest it on it and slide your hand
  slide if smudging isnt a problem
hey guys where would you draw the holes like you were attaching them to this rib cage in like a form drawing like way
 i meant to say was  where would you draw the holes for attaching the armsto the rib cage in like a form drawing like way
    arms dont attach to the holes of the ribcage you fucking retard  homerus attaches to the acromion process of scapula  scapula and clavicles move almost indepenedly from the rib cage only connecting to manubrium of sternum on the front and following the form on the back
  now theres an anon who knows his anatomy
  sorry  what were you saying
  the absolute state of /ic/
  are you retarded
ive been drawing daily based on drawabox for around a week should my lines still be this bad
im thinking the pose looks a little stiff but i cant tell specifically whats up any tips
  could you clarify the question anon are you looking for a better pose
  poses look dynamic when they are balanced  your pose on the other hand is stable this is why it looks so stiff and static
  your lines are fine the point is to do get you to stop chickenscratching and start drawing with intention and confidence  if you can draw a series of lines without retracing multiple times and without assembling them piecemeal then youre doing great
  sorry not looking for a better pose specifically but just wondering what was causing my pose to look stiff which i believe i understand now    thanks anon ill try my hand at some dynamic poses next
  sexy work anom would fap
  doing more gesture drawings would help you generate more fluid and natural looking poses
how do you stop getting frustrated at your lack of progress ive only been practicing for a couple of weeks but its pissing me off that i cant wrap my head around most concepts mostly everything i draw ends up looking like shit too even when im just copying someone else     drawing over images to practice construction looks like trash if i leave my lines and remove the reference its pretty discouraging
  think of it like this the only time youre making no progress is when youre not drawing at all     my personal motto is fail upwards it basically means you need to shut that inner voice up that says everything is wrong while youre still working on something and finish it anyway allow yourself to fuck it up because the next one is going to be that much better and then so is the one after that and so on    pictured several botched attempts at drawing cats before coming up with a somewhat successful one
  i always love to see how other people construct their drawings all your cats look good to me because their is a foundation behind what you have attempted to draw instead of not having any foundation    its clear to see in your final drawing of the cat thats what youve done
  yeah good quote to live by its hard to put it into practice but ill try also gotta stop comparing myself to other people
tried a portrait from imagination kek what a mess
  cute lizard
    thanks it was an interesting exercise that shows me i dont know jack shit will have to write notes when i do portraits might try to study the planes of the head or something
anon learns how to draw day 2 feet edition  im doing it lads
  im not sure why everything looks pieced together with a bunch of tiny line segments but i think thats too close to chicken scratching stick to drawing one foot only draw big and take your time because most of the toes have so little detail you dont even have the toenails and veer so far away from the correct contours that id call it symbol drawing
working on a drawing  also eating dinner  pill hot sauce on the drawing  god damnit
    lines dont matter when youre trying to focus on other things like the structure and form of the foot not every piece of art needs to be as good looking as possible
  big stuff needs big lines looking at the legs  also if you should be constructing and drawing through your forms if youre paying attention to structure and form if hes drawing with pen to kill his habit to erase i would hope he follows through with this confidence exercise and practices restating and ghosting
  its not photoshop its krita also its a pic inspired by sonic mania style sonic actually  im almost done with fun with a pencil for your information just did this to draw what i really liked rather than drawing stuff i hate or dont care for    then again why do people expect us /beg/s to be drawing gods already
does anyone have tips for learning values any good exercises    i have a very difficult time telling values apart when its all blended together
  youre putting the nose way too far down there should be a line across from the bottom of the inside circle thats where the nose should be
  hes not wrong its kimda fucked kids characters are made to be easy to draw anyway so focus your studies on other stuff
  looking better indeed
  man i kinda wanna give up none of the shit i draw ever satisfies anyone here whats the fucking point anymore  this was literally the best looking thing ive drawn and even this is shit by /ic/ standards
  cropping out feet  hands behind back  closed eyes  literally definition of someone trying to avoid things theyre bad at so they never improve
  is that from betty edwards did you follow the instructions
  give up then if you want to complain and not improve then giving up is the best option
how do i make art more entertaining than video games or browsing the internet or at least more engaging i believe i can get better but i feel like a spoiled child more concerned with being good rather than getting good
  it was in my drawing 1 course that i took last semester    ive been practicing and reading but ive meet so many people at my school who are waaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy talented than i am or have the luck of having experienced artists in their families train them    a month ago i met that furry artist sunibee and holysh it meeting him made me realize how inferior i am to everyone this dude has beend rawing for 14 years straight and not only does his furry stuff but he draws some crazy looking good pieces for himself    no matter how much an average joe like myself tries ill neveer be like him and hes like a year younger than me and im 21
  im a beginner as well and i read betty edwards book with that same pic she said to use charcoal on the whole page then use an eraser on the lighted areas she said to make sure to do it upside down so that you dont associate any features heres my attempt it may not be the best but im still really proud of it you should try this method and see how it turns out because im sure it will be good since i could do it and im garbage
  yeah i know what youre talking about but my professor just had us do it in class without regards to the book or the exercise plus this was back in january
reminder to draw things youre not comfortable drawing like hands and feet
  holy fucking shit this dude  literally trying to refute with the worst god damn source
  dont give up anon im the guy that said the sketch is bad but not because i want you to fail you are a beg and so am i but try to improve every day what do you want me to say that the sketch is good  because it isnt but hey listen here if u redraw it tomorrow or after some study youll see thatll be better it will still be shit but better also this that you posted now is pretty great
  i appreciate that i just get like that when i feel frustrated with myself i get frustrated with myself because i realize i am not living up to what i wanted to be aand that its on me to fix what i did    it was sonics arms and the lines that made it unnappealing right
  tristan im also the other anon who said your sketch is bad if you give up what was the point of trying you need to stop drawing other peoples art though and focus on fundamentals
  ngtmi
  in the heat of the moment i was worried because i thought about how blessed people like sunibee was with talent and experience i worried in the moment i may be like rock lee in naruto outdone by naturally gifted high tier beasts    but ill keep trying
  sunibee isnt blessed with talent like most popular fetish artists he can render well and has distinct style    a list if you will    sunibee  nezumi  shadman  that other guy on shads site jlullaby  etc    theyre sll terrible artists hidden behind a firm grasp on rendering
  exactly i had problems with lines as well especially in digital see how good the lines are in this one  there is also a problem with anatomy and perspective even if its cartoon style see the difference between this  and yours 
  ahhh i see makes sense thanks for the redline ill do it over    sunibee did show me some landscape pics that he did whiich were bananas
  forogot to mention that i shoudve drawn his legs even me turning sonic around made me fuck up the feet perspective
  show landscapes
  not disputing that rock lee is a badass anon however shounen animes are all major hypocrites in this sense despite that most of them preach that the underdog can overcome the overdog with enough effort but in the end the underdog always turns out to secretly be the overdog in disguise    real life does not work that way in several means yes your birth does have a major factor in how well you get started in life your upbringing has a major contribution to it it may not be your genes or bloodline but more like your familys mindset that mostly constitutes your startup in life but after a certain point it i up to you unless you are broke and/or physically do not have the time and energy for it then there is no stopping you fro pursuing it    hard work for extended periods towards a goal really does have tangible results in real life yes nothing is 100 guaranteed but randomness happens hard work will give you results but you must be realistic you must not look at only the best of your field unless you started really early and had good amount of possibilities to focus on it without distraction you will probably not be among the worlds best but you do not need to be not being the star of the industry does not mean you will not achieve a level you can be comfortable with and make decent money of there are a lot of invisible mediocre ones that are not in the spotlight but have a good life and are having a great time with it so relax anon have faith yourself and keep at it the point is that you keep going at it in an intelligent way no matter what instead of being worried about the distant future results
  yep i thought you turned him around also a tip i can give u that i used a lot recently is to flip the canvas horizontally a lot when drawing it will help you so much
   nadya is my name hmmm   thank you
  a biggeners birdie 3 too stiff indeed i couldnt tell soooo i should work on my lines and try more dynamic drawings
god damn what do i draw
  studies
  draw what you want to draw    once you have drawn something that you are satisfied with it will snowball you forward into wanting to try doing other kinds of drawing    dont sit around thinking oh i better get good at drawing chinese cartoon characters and then post it up on /ic/ for people to give me confirmation that i am good because they said so
  draw dinosaurs from life or even find one real bone anywhere on display thats not a replica just one available to public scrutiny under any amount of security in the whole world once you fail to do that you might look up that dinosaurs were a theroy before any bones were discovered  then you can realise that any dinosaur you deaw is as real as any that ever existed
  thats fhe issue idk what to draw im just drawing action poses right now
decide to try colored pencils  jew myself out of additional colors because i dont need that many right  have to mix two or three pencils at various densities to match pretty much anything i want to color  bluegreen  a bit of brown  a bit of light yellow just to get a certain low saturated green tone  i swear im learning more about color theory right now than i ever did just picking colors digitally
  just draw what you feel like drawing there doesnt need to be a certain thing that you try to convince yourself to draw you will burn yourself out doing that
    what this guys said find something you like and draw it robots spaceships porn whatever
  the funny thing about colored pencils is blending never turns out the way you expect im still new to them myself but it seems like theres a lot more to it than with paints and the like
        
  not that guy but ive always been led to believe just drawing whatever you feel like doesnt teach you anything  you gotta actually study the core art principles if you want to really get good
  its my first work i just started to learning how to draw even if know how much elements in here are done badly i somehow like it maybe cause i feel a little of movement
post tumblr blogs you really likeespecially lewds before theyre gone
  saya  nice

how much time do you spend on your lineart compared to your sketch  i always seem to rush it where i prefer the original sketch cant help it
you can always help it dont you want to improve 
tsundere artists    do you also watch cute nip girls draw
  no im not a dickbrain
how to become a vtuber can westerners even become one
  crop  just link it faggot lmao 
    is that person doing studies from photos
  aaaaaaaaah where do i get a cute nip art gf fuuuuck meee im so horny and loneyyyyyy i just want a gf to cuddle with aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh
no i watch old men draw
  lmao  doesnt consider 4chan thumbnail format    phew way to out yourself new faggot
  based horny poster
  her work is really cool and good im going to try and study and learn from her i dont speak japanese but she comes across as a really cool person even with the language barrier
  yeah imagine how great it would be to be going out with her you guys cuddle together in bed fug wake up and do gesture drawing together 
  how do you even know shes cute theres no pic to base that on except an anime girl wearing a medical mask
    attractive avatar means she is attractive in real life
  i would love to get cuddles from her and draw with her it wouldnt even have to be in a romantic way though romantic would be better i know having someone like her in my life would be cool         by her personality i guess beauty is on the inside it doesnt really matter what she looks like as long as she is kind and draws good is all that matters here to know she is cute
my reason is kinda simple it stimulates my autism its really satisfying drawing and rendering 3d forms especially those of the face and body
originally it was a natural talent proven through both of my parents sharing a drawing skill then in high school was just its my only skill so fuck it now im 21 and i see it as a definition of myself its my craft feels inside an object of god carved into my soul
i wanna draw hot chicks
  my reasons are kind of selfish i like seeing my stories and characters come to life visually just knowing that ill never have to beg/pay others to draw my ocs is pretty satisfying the power of depicting whats in my mind is also cool    and drawing my own niche nsfw stuff can be rewarding too but usually after a while i start noticing the mistakes and cant fap it to anymore
i feel good when i draw something and it looks pretty
i wanna draw hot dudes
  ha gaaaay
cause im bored
  say that to my face motherfucker not online and see what happens
what pic inspired you to start drawing  pic related
    unironically undertale made me doodle the first thing since i was 14 back then i wasnt hating myself and i loved to draw i then moved to more classic art but all started for me because of an indie game
  undertale  14    what the fuck why are you on this board
  post  im curious
  first thing since i was 14  read that again but slowly anon
  i believe you dont understand me    undertale  being 14 when it released    why are you on this board
    nevermind im an idiot
  im not him and also doodle the first thing since i was 14 implies undertale anons doodle that was inspired by the game came at some period of time after he was 14
   its just what i do
  it want a pic but a fan animation of touhou    it made me realize that fans can also create amazing stuff on a professional quality so it really inspired me to start learning how to draw
    because 23 now
theres a couple of people who are artists and did me wrong im going to work hard to become successful and achieve levels within the industry that they could only dream about basically success is the best revenge
i already learned myself programming and got me a job in that field it made me see the possibilities  so in an attempt to widen my horizon break out of social isolation and make some friends i decided i must have more than one skill or thing in my life since i barely did anything besides programming  then i gave a go at drawing i set a target of drawing every single day hoping i would get good enough to justify following courses or going to meetups  i started drawing and drawing eventually i even started to enjoy it  but i still feel like im not good enough i went to some figure drawing sessions which was really great met some people too but i havent going frequently enough to really get something going    but im still having a lot of fun with it it clears the mind after long day at work too
i work hard at other things but i honestly feel that drawing is what i was born to do when i really think about it
  gay
    this was made when i was around that age unironically i was better back than i dont have any other pieces on my phone im at work rn
  there are ideas in my head i want to bring out   its also the only hobby i have that feels productive   i like to play video games also but its not really me creating anything  i get ideas from photos and real life that i want to translate into a still art format  it blurs the line between fiction and reality for me and makes life less shitty  i also just like drawing sexy female bodies because real women dont like me
  getter robo
  i do it because of sunk cost fallacy  i hate every second i try to draw anything and am actively happier when i havent drawn for a long time but the fact that ive spent so long doing it and my retarded fucking need to create despite my lack of creativity force me to sink back into it  its toxic and i hate it and im not even good at it in spite of it
to leave an impact from my life
i never got properly into anything else then came the time to make a career choice and here i am
  based
    are you me
  i started drawing seriously when i was around 10 and i have a bfa now but kanotynes who inspired both undertale and deltarune actually got me to dig out my tablet again  trying my best to be an excellent character designer just for fun now
probably because its the only thing i showed above average skill in aside from video games when i was a kid
my whole life i felt apathetic to everything around me everything feels bland and stagnant except trying to draw life is terrible but when im drawing it feels a little less so i probably wouldve done some very bad things to myself if i hadnt started
    post work anon im curious im same guy btw    i also want to get serious about drawing but have so little time ahead and with a fixed sleeping schedule i cant draw much since im out 14 hours a day
its the only productive thing im able to force myself to do
  is that you craig
i want to make a living out of drawing smut     and i also like drawing smut
  i do art because its satisfying and i love working on things     i post art because i enjoy all the butthurt it causes i like abnormal psychology and interacting with other mentally ill people and my art tends to draw that out of virgins and tweens on this board
  i ask myself that every day and the real answer is out of fucking spite    i suck at it and it drives me mad to do it for so long every day with slow results i might never amount to anything and i stated out near my 30s     im still not quitting fuck your couch nigga
  i do stuff like this in 3d
  and my drawing has been limited to sketching existing characters lately so i did this a couple weeks ago
  im no painter strictly drawing and 3d stuff so i have a long way to go there
  because drawing the shit youll never see in canon is fun for me
  yes i am me
  so that maybe one day baby bird will notice me and she will fly to america and kiss me and love me until i die
  this
i wanna be able to draw cute anime girls with fat asses not inflation tier thats my goal
    pp happy keep going and post blog 
  how about you learn to draw in general you cant even manage that
ive got lots of stories and characters and i wanna draw them
  its really not that bad the perspective and proportions are decent nothing looks outright bad about it the lines are just scribbly
i decided a few years ago that i wanted to be a professional artist yet i went through school and got my bachelors without knowing what i specifically wanted to do now my professional experience is all in graphic design when i really just want to be a concept artist and draw hentai in my free time so theres my aim also these      
  i was sorta listless mid/late high school cause i didnt know what i wanted to do and then i watched flcl and it was my favorite thing ever and still is and i just wanna make cool things that make other people excited and maybe inspires a few of them to also make cool stuff for other people to see so that the cycle continues like honestly all i really want other than to not live in poverty is make cool things that make other people wanna make cool things so then i can look at their cool things and wanna make even more cool things
  (((decent)))
  i want to work as a 1 frame per week graphics card
  you will suck his dick
  whatever anon why dont you post your shit if youre so great
  it makes me feel like im doing something productive i dont have any other skills so if i didnt draw id just be playing video games all day every day  at least by doing this i have a chance of making connections with people and making someone happy
  im horny
i like the challenge of trying to draw either better each time or faster each time its also quite therapeutic i pretty much become an npc when i draw
because of sunken cost fallacy
making stuff that looks cool is fun and i want to hopefully inspire young kids to be creative as well     i think leaving a good impact the best i can is all i can do to not give up entirely i dont want to continue to age only to be bitter and filled with regrets i want to see how far i can go
  this is actually pretty cool
1 psychedlics no     2 heroin yes because you might die for you art   baby version pop ibuprofen hurt stomach probably l8r in the night     3 cough syrup cheap if your broke and uhh helps you not with the actual art but like finding a dope pencil yeah you get into that    5 hentai is morally reprehensible    8 credit cards are for suckers except when you need credit better to buy in debt than to sell your soul in profit namean    2346 luke   thus spake jesus father into thy hands i command my spirit     328 onomatopoeia is required for all paintings with the color yellow
how to how move the color slider when rendering animu    none of that mechanical scott robertson westerboo shit  you do know the secret techniques right the ones that nips simplified while studying old masters of the renaissance
  none of this gay anime shit has a thing to do with the paintings of the renaissance
color pick weeb shit and see for yourself
  color slider  i hope you mean hsv because thats the only one worth using
  the ones that nips simplified while studying old masters of the renaissance    someone somewhere unironically believes this
i believe glorious nip rendering is watercolor or inspired by watercolor painting in the west people tend to gravitate more towards oils or acrylics so maybe thats why we see it less in western art i have yet to try watercolors out either they seem very intimidating
  not using lab   lmao
    rgb is better
  hsv was literally invented because rgb sucks
  have a lot more control ease and clarity with hsv actually
  lab is wonky to work around with since you cant select the colors you want as quickly because saturation is lumped up on both the a and b parametersfurther out is most saturated color and having to adjust two parameters just to get the color you want is really slow with hsbhsv all you have to do is move the hue slider to find that color and then saturate it accordingly   rgb is even worse not only can you not control lightness on there on its separate slider like lab and hsb you have to move 3 sliders to find just one color
  colors look good together with rgb though really easy to get flesh tones
  you have to move 3 sliders just to change the lightness of the color thats just cumbersome m8
whats the fucking problem with these people why do they own galleries in the first fucking place i wish i lived somewhere that didnt say no all the time this is awful i hate these bastard critics and their fucking newspapers and how they lazily make sure its the same old all the fucking time how are you lot in mainland europe any better
galleries that are decent are in it to make money they will carry pieces they think they can sell where their commison will be worth it look at your piece would it look out of place next to their other pieces if yes it is not the gallery for you if its a gallery that doesnt actually try to sell you things you dont want to be there anyway consider secondary venues coffe shops consignment shops perhaps less likely to sell there but the cut should be better and eaiser to get in if your work isnt mainstream housing decoration dont expect it to sell to anyone but a collector
  shintaro kago gets galleries and he draws scat how does that make you feel
how do i learn to draw like artalicemarie on the gram
  ctrlp
  invest in a good inkjet printer and be a beautiful woman i cant believe that was an actual commission i wish i had an art fraud gf who would let me cum in her her secret would be safe with me
  she literally has a video of her drawing  what more do you want youre disgusting and no woman would ever let you near her enjoy being a lonely incel
people pay for glorified b/w photos
stop making these same fucking threads youve made a dozen times and the mac miller drawing threads while youre at it the discussion has been had fake art is fake move the fuck on and make a productive thread you obsessed idiot
  yep its time  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i want an artist gf to cuddle and stop being so lonely aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh i dont even care if she is a literal copy machine i just wanna fuck her in the ass and give her my ink forever so she can get likes on instagram aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh
    i love this guy
  why the fuck would you even want to draw hyperrealistically its been done
  fake news
  drawing extremely poorlys been done too but thats apparently fine
  commission a virtuoso artist from the trendy site instantgram  shes soo good because her art looks just like real life  even mike and angelo couldnt do that  frame the masterpiece and place it conspicuously on the coffee table  what a conversation piece kathy will be so jealous  call the gang over for drinks and glutenfree casserole   no one pays more than a passing glance to the magnum opus  hehe little do they know that its not a black and white photo but a great work of art
  the funniest thing ever posted on /ic/
  id pay her to draw me with some sexy girl kissing
  she needs a photo first try with a fantasy artist
  then whats even the point if she doesnt draw from imagination its like paying a couple hundred dollars to use a printer that prints with graphite ink
  fpbp

  the absolute state of insta artists    its so surreal that not even dumb normies call out these fake artists like how can the person even post something like this without shitting themselves of embarrassment
  tracing my nigger almost all good artists do this shit
  congratulations now you understand the responses in this thread
  lots and lots of patience and brain damage hyper realism really isnt hard but its boring as fuck to draw and to look at also you need some good pencil range i recommend carbon pencils for the blacks rather than charcoal or something else like 8b pencils that are way too light    best poster on this board id love to see his art even if its /beg/
   its not fine you fucking retard
  i like how the pencils look freshly sharpened
  i wonder if she is actually drawing and rendering these like a printer could she also draw anime in this way
  dont ever stop posting this
  tell that to the people putting it up in galleries and teaching it in art schools
  the emperors new clothes its fascinating how people are gobbling that shit up
  he posted his links in the self promo thread and identified himself if you really want a gander
  its popular  that means its good  youre the reason this board is shit
  top kek
    are you fucking serious thats a 10 second video of her drawing a /beg/tier photostudy im not accusing her of faking her painstaking photo reproductions but that video makes her look like shed have to
    actually nailed it
  mike and angelo
  wheezing
  incel  go back to beddit you filthy nigger
  nigger  heh that racial slur will show him  lets play spot the guy with the smallest penis
  muh deeyak
is this good artwork for a child 8 years old
that bitch satan or autism god
  its pretty appealing if you ask me the tree is also pretty decent im not really familiar with traditional paints so i doubt my opinion would be a good insight
  its way better than what i can do in traditional and im 11 years older not too sure what it is though some sort of massive kingfisher
  is this good artwork for a child 8 years old  it isnt
thumbnail is unreadable colors are muddy if its your child dont give them super tonight
  all artwork is good for an 8 year old if theyre having fun
what do you guys think  photoshop with a rl pic as a template will post on 2nd post  almost halfway done not trying to make it look like excactly like the pic just using it as a template
the pic
is this traced
  overlayed on photoshop yeah  didnt try to keep it exact though
bump
since somebody made a shitty thread gonna take over  how do you make your lines clean
  are you asking me the op or are you saying my thread is shitty and asking anons for advice
  this thread is shitty in a way that you should post it in /beg/ same as i should but who cares
  cool thanks
  so let me get this straight you traced then didnt follow your source material    bad trace / 10 if youre gonna practice with tracing then do that dont pat yourself on the back for minor adjustments that arent proportional    tracing can be good for a beg you can work on your lines and see what looks and feels right for your own works try making a skeleton/figure overlaying your reference lining that and seeing how accurate you are to your original
  seeing how accurate you are to your original  im not trying to be accurate to the original though as stated in my op just using it as a loose template
  thats great anon post your next step
  thats great anon post your next step  its shit you fucking idiot  dont encourage him
    anon this looks fucking horrifying    if youre going to stylize you need to learn how to stylize in an aesthetically pleasing way start with the face specifically the nose less is more    also dont ever skip the eyebrows theyre vital to giving a face its expressiveness faces without eyebrows look alien
  what happened on her nose
  thanks m8
  its not done yet
i dont care anymore im going to get good i dont care if i loose sleep anymore im going to get my dream im going to get good im going to be successful im tired of just making mediocre art im tired of looking at the pros and wishing that i could be them im tired of it all aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  godspeed anon
  busy wasting time on /ic/ rather than grinding loomis meme heads    ngmi
  just try to not burnout good luck
  youre the guy on the left
  ngmi
  stop  even in animes only the people with luck/genes succeed
  i feel you anon good luck and study hard  ill put in more effort too
  study and practice is not an anime anon you cant just make a dramatic declaration and expect everything to work out    art like anything else is fairly mundane you spend a few hours each day on your desk silently doing your work then you stop and do other things there is no grand moment of making it you just gradually become used to drawing and designing until you can do it consistently for work once in a while youll make something cool maybe youll take part in an exciting project its still work though the pace remains just as slow if you reach some point of greatness it really would not seem so great as you understand that there is no magic to it there is just practice patience and perseverance the people making it are the ones who appreciate the practical side of it and can just calm down and carry on
  grow a pair of balls pussy
  not in the anime in op
  talentless faggot  gets lucky and has the strongest hero hand him down his power  yep in the op  even pic related tries to push the hard worktalent meme because the author is too retarded to understand that having an ability with a low skill floor and high skill ceiling doesnt make you talentless
post work
  anime all about talents  talentless fag is literally given someone elses talent
  gets lucky  one of the only talentless fags in the city tried to save his talented fag friend thats why he gets given the powers he wasnt lucky the guy was brave  of course all might would end up being there theres a bad guy its what he does pretty well established before this too that midoriya has worked hard to understand and strategise for/against a bunch of quirks and heroes then he works ridiculously hard to try and overcome the fact that his power or talent literally destroys his body
  someone on /ic/ is smart  not possible//
  i can attest to this i recently reached the point of quality i had wanted to since i started seriously studying and now that i am i just see more flaws in my work and the process than i used to im a lot farther into my main project now comic but at the same time im still a bit under halfway through it and my pace is dwindling due to burnout from having gone so hard for so long     focus on quality not quantity op you learn more and faster and have more energy to do shit you want to without risk of burning out
  relax anon stop being a baby art is not about being better than anyone else
why are so many people having breakdowns on this board
op here im not sleeping tonight im going to keep drawing boxes until i sunrise aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  anon im not going to lie to you youre going to burnout with that anime mentality you have a long ways to go
  i know i have a long way to go but how will i ever be as good as the pros if i dont burn myself out im just really tired of looking at other peoples art and then looking at my own with so much self hate and loathing only making me wish i could be them so i could draw as good and have their success burning myself out is the only way i can think of right now in which i can get better
should i catchup on bha only watched season 1
  yes it gets even better
  instead of doing that pointless exercise why dont you try to have fun with the drawing
  idk if its pointless people keep mentioning about grinding boxes so im going to give it a hard try to be honest i dont know how effective grinding boxes is but i feel like i need to give it a try if i want to be as good as the pros you do make a good point so maybe i will fit in 1 fanart fun drawing after every 35 pages of completely drawing boxes
  either youre a committed troll or just stupid  if youre going to draw boxes how about actually trying to drawboxes like yknow with a light source shadows and edges that follow the rules of perspective
  not going to lie im probably the latter now give me resources that i can use to grind drawing boxes with light sourcesshadowsedges and perspective till sunrise
  maybe you should try grinding gestures instead or something since you mentioned you like fanart also do mannequins simplification of the body    if you dont need perspective that much you dont need to grind that many boxes and even if you do want to get better at perspective there are better things to do like actually setting up a few vanishing points and practicing drawing abtract sceneries in one and two point perspective using boxes
  jesus grind many things at once not just box
  yep in the op  even pic related tries to push the hard worktalent meme  every single modern shounen tries to push this shitty meme but each of them end up as hypocrites at the end
  theres also no point in putting yourself that much pressure youre gonna end up burning yourself
  thanks anon ill try grinding my gesture and mannequins instead of fanart thats such a good idea i think i need perspective its something i have always struggled with fully understanding i have tried the stuff with setting up vanishing points but it never really sticks when i try drawing things free hand in perspective is it one of those things that i have to set up a horizon line and vanishing points and keep drawing boxes using the same vanishing point in different angels until it becomes second nature          okay give me some resources that i can use to grind other stuff
  okay give me some resources that i can use to grind other stuff    listen to this 
  if i dont put pressure on myself i feel like i will forever stay a mediocre artist and never reach my dreams in life as an artist it gets frustrating when you feel like you are just a background character watching all these manga artists animators and comic artists all make it big while your art looks not as good as theirs i guess if im being honest im putting myself trhough this much pressure out of 50 frustration and 50 self hatred for not being as good as the pros i hate myself for not being as good as the pros so i guess i feel i deserve burnout for being shitty and worser than them until im on the same level as them
  thanks anon ill give it a watch now
  because learning to draw is hard and often feels futile
  very true i feel you fellow anon welcome to the grind 
  literally this you put in thousands of hours of work with very slow payoff
  you really arent gonna make it most people who are great at art are like that because they spent all their time just drawing the things they liked because they wanted to even if you do 2 hours of hardcore box and line studies every day you most likely will never be as good as someone who just spends all day drawing things that they are interested in
  thats really not correct anon plenty of pro artists put hundreds and thousands of hours into practicing things they felt like was a chore please dont spread misinformation like that
  its not misinformation im sure those plenty of pro artists are decent at what they do im just saying if he wanted to be great hes already missed the bus cause the greats get great by doing what they do all day everyday and they just happen to get good along the way you just cant make that time and practice up by doing 5 pages of boxes everyday
  thats extremely wrong those greats had to master perspective anatomy forms lighting etc they had to look at life in geometric shapes all the times they had to accurately guess colors on a pallet you dont just draw things you like forever and eventually become a master     greats get great by doing something they love and making sure they learn and exercise as much as possible to get better
    nobody listen to this retard  youre like one of the people who worship talent and disregard everything else youre also not taking into account the millions upon millions of shitty deviantart users who spend their day drawing what they want and never improve
   then i will do more than 5 pages of boxes ill do 20 if i need to maybe even more because im tired of being just okay at drawing i want to be as good at drawing as badly as i want to breath ngmi is when you dont want success as much as you want to breath ngmi is when you are not willing to die for your dreams and goals ngmi is the moment you give up ngmi is when you play by the rules of logic and reality instead of the rules of your drive and ambition           i think you two are correct im going to keep work hard and master everything when it comes to drawing and making art
tfw you know you are never going to make it and that you will die without fulfilling your dreams but this is all you have and if you dont embrace anime shonen insanity then you are faced with the bleak fact that one day you will be in your death bed still fantasizing about all those things you wanted to do but never got around to doing    life is hell  i wish i was never born
    yeah no shit you have to put some moderate amount of effort into what you are learning but op isnt doing that he is strictly just grinding stuff in hopes that hell eventually get good and greats do just draw things and eventually become masters they draw and then they ask themselves how they could do it better and then they draw and then improve and then draw and improve and they do this all day everyday till they are so far ahead of other people that they are revered by others and obviously its not mindless drawing they are always teaching themselves something new when their curiosity takes them there while pro artists just go through the chore of practicing to eventually get to an acceptable level that allows them to do whatever it is they set out to do thats the difference between greats and everyone else the greats draw because they can and they never stop trying to do something different to improve while pros do it out of obligation till they are eventually satisfied with their skill
  dude op is literally trying to get better at his weaknesses by drawing boxes hes not going to need to draw them forever just until he gets comfortable with drawing 3d forms in space which is what drawing boxes all day helps dont tell him hes not going to make it when hes literally doing shit greats would love to know about when they started
  its fine to want to improve yourself but it needs to be done in a constructive way you cant just say ima draw a thousand boxes and be good and expect it to work and thats clearly his state of mind because when told that it wont help to do a 1000 boxes his response is to just do more boxes like op honey thats not how this works
  then tell me your method that is not drawing 1000 boxes aaaaaaaaaaahhhh its not like im against trying peoples suggestions like i said im tired of being mediocre ill do anything i need to do to get pro
  then say it needs to be done in a constructive way dont say just draw 4 fun all day otherwise youre ngmi which is what ive been arguing against you for saying
want an art buddy op
  yeah im always open to drawing and grinding with others
  what art program did you use to make the stuff youve shared in the thread so far
  im currently working in clip studio paint using the standard gpen working on drawing this crocodile from reference and being super critical of myself
  but he probably wont only few people have the fortitude to just force themselves to do something till they get the results they want so unfortunately for the rest of us we have to basically compromise with ourselves to trick ourselves into doing stuff if we ever want to see good results so he probably would have better luck making it by just drawing 4 fun the way he is headed now hes most likely going to grind boxes and lines for a week then drop drawing because its boring and provides no stimulus in fact he should just start by drawing what interests him and if he thinks his perspective is wonk he should get a book on perspective and teach himself something new then try to apply it on a new drawing you cant honestly expect results by just grinding something out
  fair enough you willing to take a chance and talk to a stranger on discord only reason why is because you remind me a lot of myself from a few years ago
  you cant honestly expect results by just grinding something out    you should look at the work hes posted in this thread then
  yikes weve already hit bottom of the barrel responses
  sure i can take a chance i actually have an anon discord account i made a while back im flattered that you see something in me
  getting good takes decades of practice     anybody can photobash but not everybody can paint a landscape that will make you wish you were there
  post work anon
  yeah true but i will grind until i can paint a landscape that people will wish they were there i want to be that good as bad as i want to breath i will do anything to get that good
  here is my anon discord account
  cool just join    and upload your current progress on your crocodile or if youre working on something else upload the original file not the exported png of anything youve posted in thread so far just so i know its you
  that works too
  use your fucking brain anon you know one of its many features is critical thinking so how bout you flip that bad boy on and think about what ive said and ask yourself if you agree instead of using my art as a easy way to validate anything
    ok blog i will watch your progress for the rest of my life
  well guess what shonentard in real life eating hair doesnt give you power and you cant magically pass down a talent or skill like that however on the upside you dont need special powers other than having working hands to paint you just need to persevere
  having an ability with a low skill floor and high skill ceiling doesnt make you talentless  yeah but if you are on the floor of the ability most people are not gonna consider that a talent like if you can only play a few chords on the guitar that is not a talent yet being good at shit requires both innate talent and hard work unless you are some kind of super autist that can assimilate talents like a damn anime character
  this isnt anime there are different ways to succeed  try to be kim jung gi if you want but you can also just be smart and find a niche
  yes legit good shonen

  cheer up anon i cant afford them either
  afford what you mean he actually charges for this stuff damn
  who shat on your cornflakes
can anyone help me out since building my own computer ive yet to get a toon boom to work on my tablet so for nearly a whole year ive not been able to use toobboom any toon boom today i found out that toomboom isnt just making this random line i realized that it actually has a cursor far off screen    any advice
  there no no bounce the head remains in the same position in this walking and running has bounce
   toniko did by apparently being capable of decent animation like in the op and then posting slop like this for the rest of us my favorite part is how the head barely moves and instead their face just gets longer      i know thats why im making fun of it this sorry excuse for a tutorial is from professional animator / calarts debtor taco pendejo not me the dude talked shit about bluth so i dont feel bad about giving him a little shit backits nothing super personal but the laziness of this tutorial should be obvious even to layman like us
  the dude talked shit about bluth    he wasnt wrong  that very thread also had proof of how shady don bluth really is from other artists so dont get all butt hurt cause this guy put your hero on blast faggot
  he wasnt wrong   shady stuff     he was talking about bluths animation and being a running joke at the calarts jellybean factory while posting absolute dog shit tutorials himself the shady stuff is completely immaterial to what im talking about but we can talk about that anyway if you want     all i saw was tacos complaining about the price of bluths correspondence class as a calarts grad i found that particularly ironic and humorous as well as some people from the peanut gallery complaining about his teaching methods insofar as how he wasnt able to save every mongoloid that was able to cut him a chequewhich i might add is the same as any art school online or off      anything beyond that i havent seen and hasnt been posted in these threads despite my repeated inquiries to see what the hell they were talking about ie proof so i can only assume the accusers arent super confident in this bullshit either
  do you have a 2nd monitor plugged in try unplugging it and using it on one screen i think theres a problem with some drawing tablets/2screens that make it not work with tb
can you please shorten your shitty copypasta its taking my entire screen for fucks sake
anyone able to recommend free/cheap software to at least put frames together add audio and export videos doesnt need to be fancy tho chroma key/green screen options would be sweet  used to have a pirated version of sony vegas 12 pro to make my animations but the link died years ago new computer doesnt even have movie maker
  layman like us  at least you are honest   he has plenty of other run cycles with head bounce for you people that only want to draw stuff you saw after skimming the animator survival guide
  last thread  
if i am deciding to scan in hand drawn frames traditional style what software would be best for turning that into an animation animate pro after effects
speakig of after effects this still is taken from the making of kill la kill documentary what are they doing
  that effect where light beams spill from the top to the sides/down
  i dont know what youre going on about but its very clear you didnt read the thread dont try talking about things you know nothing about but then again that seems to be an on going theme here on /ic/
   thats not an argument you said the same thing last time i read enough of it to be satisfied if you went deep enough into the thread to uncover the proof of the outrage once before surely youd be willing to do it again instead youre just making ambiguous and as far as the rest of us know baseless statements
  you said the same thing last time    this is my first time saying this  the hell is last time anon are you okay do you need to see a doctor you should see a doctor or step away from your computer for at least a few minutes a day
wait what did don bluth do
  this is my first time saying this    is it        that wasnt the issue idiot you clearly didnt read the thread only one post and moved on    there were several people putting don on blast for some shady stuff hes been doing while providing proof    it seems the only ones ass whos on blast here is yours lmoa
  blender
  davinci resolve is free
trying some stuff at work
  this one is kind of unreadable but its not like i can fix it so ill post it anyway
    this is pretty cool can tell you had fun with it  i got no advice for you though
why is it so putrid         neat stuff
  the way this guy always makes heads do these little loops makes me dizzy
s l a p p
pixelenjoi
anyone here good with steam
  i had a main monitor and my tablet acting as the second monitor my tablet wont really work when its the only thing plugged in and when i duplicate the screens everything gets squashed no circles only ovals
first time trying this i might work on refining it later
what programs do anons here use i used to just stitch stuff together in photoshops timeline feature but i assume theres better ways
  tvpaint is incredible takes no time to get used to and has so many tools and stuff you can go learning along the way it really makes the tedious part of animating exciting
  is that your animation it really speaks to me do you have a blog or something
    i like what you did but please keep the lighting consistent next time you take photos scanning is also an option
  there are a couple that i like to use  all are pretty good    opentoonz  basically a free opensource version of toon boom it has a lot of features making it suitable for large projects but can also be used for small animations as well theres a bit of a learning curve but its really intuitive once you get into it its very powerful and has also been used by ghibli    krita  a lightweight free version of photoshop although its animation capabilities are far superior the latest versions come with an animation template which is really cool its brush system is great as well better than photoshops personally    azdrawing2  a simple line art program with basic animation features but good for simple doodling
so im working on an animation aside from 1 other quick one thats practically a doodle this is my first real animation ive been studying a lot though because animation/filmmaking is my passion and i want to focus my life on that stuff    id appreciate any critique or thoughts on this its based off a comic i did which ill post in the next post so you can see what it should look like
  and heres the snippet from the comic
    version with hat face and poncho that i just added hat was the hardest part and still looks kind of off to me
  he moves too far forwards with the standupstraight part keep his horizontal position stay where he landed
    some of s suggestion but you should change up some of the extremes it kinda looks more like the really delayed recoil and settle after a jump  his actual settle after the jump is a little strange too linear in the way it dips down and comes back up kind of like all the horizontal/diagonal force is suddenly ejected into vertical force somehow whereas in reality the motion vector would follow an arc similar to the dashed line in purple with the character being the blue thing this is where the ball bounce test animation comes into play the characters forward motion carries its mass and will only slow down when an opposite force starts acting against it logistically the character would actually do a faceplant in the context of these drawings  remember that an object in motion will stay in motion objects interactions depend on their mass a character has mass that needs to be accounted for
  really good even if youre a furry
  keep us updated
    thank you so much anons i dont have any form of blog yet and i am a furfag but i try to hide it    these aremy skaterdogs
thoughts
  shockgif  more like ohgif
  shed need to lurch back and have hand motions if you want shock what you got is   
  i really love the characters they remind me of old friends and me i dont care that youre a furry i think the fact that theyre animals makes it charming in some way i would follow the shit out of you if you had your work somewhere
  sorry this is the best i can pull off at work in a factory environment if im at home i just animate digitally or more likely not at all
  aww man this truly made my day and im super glad to hear that the characters come off that way its supposed to be a wacky/bittersweet coming of age type thing so them being nostalgic and charming is fucking perfect thank you
    i think they look like shit for the record
animation is difficult tt
  i would argue that if youre doing an extended sprint you dont need to worry too much about the head bobbing go look at olympic runners their momentum and rate keeps their body pretty level    not saying thats a good gif but it can be applicable
my first animation   it was so much harder than i expected actually took me like 4 hours      i know that feel
is this cool or autistic
  looks cool but whats the point of rotoscoping that
  i think thats awesome
  both at the same time it looks cool but you should have either     1 found an easier way of making it look like that  like dropping a filter on the footage or     2 used just a few lines as markers so you get the movement and the perspective right and made something completely original    heres an idea you could use learn how to make a simple quake or any other game map and use the footage to make a fast paced shootemup animation with basic coloring id watch the shit out of that you could throw in a stupid story too
  this    seems like a waste of time desu
  i mean youre right there could have probably been an easier way to make this and alsoadd some unique touch but doing it like this and having it be like this way was the point to me like if i used a filter or something to just make the footage look like this it wouldnt be the same i even made it using a mouse which is stupid but to me thats just adds to it just the idea of animating gameplay footage frame by frame  your idea sounds pretty cool and ill give it some thought maybe i can come up with something thing is im not a good artist at all and have trouble coming up with what to actually draw what youre describing sounds good and puts an idea in my head but i dont know how do work with it
  its both
  well its all fine if you enjoy doing it but keep in mind that people seeing it wont know anything about it except what they see they wont know how much time you put into it and itll still look like something you just dropped a filter on /     if you really want to do it frame by frame find a reason to justify it
    i literally thought someone just filtered it
how do i get started with animation like from the very very beginning
  draw a thing draw that thing again slightly differently repeat ad infinitum
  what you think
    did you animate this in tvpaint
want to do an homage to the cheap childrens cartoons of the 80s/90s please post any potential reference material for such a project also any insight on learning materials they might have used would be pleasant too
  really love the motion in him throwing the child up
  datazim  i remember seeing your work somewhere else your animation is sorta a goal for me  only thing id recommend is to add a few more inbetweens other then that this is smooth as fuck any tips
  yes this too
  im confused are you looking for 80s cartoon references just look up transformers gi joe heman pretty much every 80s cartoon was cheaply animated
  do your own research      its not hard
  oh no
  im also looking for any insight into how they learned to better grasp the homogeneity of the cheap 80s/90s animation especially the stuff made to sell toys rather than have any quality as a show     ive been trying and have come up with nothing in terms of teachijg materials these animators would have used back in the day
  most of that shit was handed off to the nips toei did gi joe and transformers for instance good luck lad
  hams
  why he shoot himself
      also dic entertainment did most of the hasbro designs so you just gotta worked out who worked for them as character designers work out the year they were born work out the rough age they would have gone to college then from there work out what they would have been taught withseems like a waste of time
  practice the flag wave more to get that s curve and then you can do smoke on top
golly what a mess these production markings are
  it sounds like youre trying to find some magic guide on how to make an 80s cartoon and youre holding yourself back from doing it until you find it back then teaching materials wasnt really a thing they used that cheap quality wasnt an aesthetic they were going for they were sparing costs literally at every corner so in order to copy that style just look at their product and itll come pretty naturally
  i never liked the head bobbing in real life would this be considered over acting probably
  its a good way to emote when you have a close up shot like this tho
  your animations are the only reason i come here its a shame youre a tripfag do you have a blog
  do you have a wacom and multiple monitors there is a shortcut to switch between absolute and relative mouse position basically allows you to either draw on the tablet or click on elements on the other monitors might need to switch that
  blog  i have a twitter mayyde and a youtube my content has no consistency
is it a good idea to start learning animation now even if im still /beg/ tier at drawing
top peg bar  bottom peg bar
  might as well to animate you will be drawing alot sounds like an ideal means to train two skills
  you dont have to be a good artist to be a good animator and vice versa you can apply animation to any style of drawing so learning animation wont hinder learning drawing
    i guess ill start learning the basics then is the animators survival kit a good book to start with
  this i cant understand why anybody would use bottom it just gets in the way and jabs into my wrist
    blame didney they started it warner bros and the japanese studios put it at the top
    the ghostbusters cartoon wasnt cheap it was inconsistent in quality but there are bits that have amazing animation     there are also spots where its abundantly obvious that the good studio took over middle of an episode animation quality jumps 300
  krita free allows you to import image sequences or you can just draw with their timeline   use audacity free to edit audio     like the other anon said davinci is basically a free version of adobe premier and its been used in actual movies i think some tarantino ones idk its good
if i were doing traditional animation with no digital postproduction how would i go about mimicking a camera changing focus my first thought would be to cut a piece of translucent plastic to match the shape of what i want to perceive as out of focus
    this was the first thing i thought of    id get an old cabinet with adjustable shelves and then saw out some rectangular 169 holes for the camera to see through from the top  honestly id go for digital post processing stuff otherwise itd be some crazy shit
any othe programs that hold this functionality for digitally colouring hand drawn frames  
  opentoonz
  youre overthinking it remember one of the oldest filmmaking tricks petroleum jelly
  thats pretty gnarly but now im thinking about how to do it if you scan the image rather than with an animation camera
  open toonz does the linecolour changing upon fill
  youd have to do some simple masking and animate some keyframes for a blur effect later on if youre using a scanner
  first and last animation  8 hours for drawing this stuff on leftover scraps of tracing paper  6 min in microsoft gif animator  god fucking damn it i wish i had time to practice this stuff
  i like this how did you go about animating on paper
ive mostly rotoscoped shit without learning proportions or perspective     heres an attempt at frame by frame without any reference  should i keep trying to animate stuff and learning as i go or focus on learning how to draw first on paper going back to the basics
  i drew the first frame on normal bristol paper and since i had leftover tracing paper from some blueprints the rest of the frames i just drew over one another second frame on tracing paper over first on bristol third over the second and so on 9 frames total those 2 x on the right side were to help with placing the paper since they were just uneven cutouts and i didnt use anything to hold them down thats why it took me 8 hours quite fun but time consuming
  you could have made the shadow bend around her face but its not completely necesary
  how the fuck did this take you 8 hours
  first read my second post and i was doing it after finishing a project it was past midnight and i couldnt sleep so i did it for fun first with pencil and then do it over again with a technical pen i usually draw cubes and variations of it because of modern architecture and lack experience with other stuff
  yep
  interesting how very interesting  so my pipeline could look something like  scan hand drawn frames using gts  colour with open toonz  export the frames back out coloured  put in premiere pro  publish    that seems pretty fair if not a hassle for larger animations
  well first you need to always use reference when animating its not something someone grows out of and all good animators use reference secondly learn the principles of animation before you try animating a body at all do ball exercises and such
  directors orders not my choice
  wait so you animated it really
  god no its from an old demo reel on what various editing marks mean in animation production
  thanks a lot
my friend made this and i wanna see what you guys think 
got bored and made an educational tool to understand the concept of shading markers in animation
  saved thank you
  sometimes those colours change especially with nippon animations but this is fairly standard for fourshade animation
  lmao that aint how physics works
  you do realize there isnt a standard for those right its pointless
    also thats not brown its red
  the post literally says understand the concept  takes it as literal gospel that the colors depicted are part of the education  its clearly just pointing out how it woks as an idea
  i dont think you need to go that far lol especially on genga since markups arnt the same as douga
sorry im taking so long  almost done
i want to study animationwhy do they want me to draw good
  animation design and art are all handinhand its possible to do animation without either but its heavily recommended to understand all of it
  you will need to be able to illustrate
  what kind of illustration is the best if i need to draw something for my portfolio fo the application
  almost done
  i meant in general the ability to illustrate an object in a drawing if you try to draw a car and those looking at it cant tell its a car then you cant illustrate if you try to draw a person and those looking at it cant tell its a person you cant illustrate to draw something and have those looking at it correctly identify it doesnt make you good at drawing it makes you good at illustration
this is my first organic/squishy kind of animation ive done    i think it needs more exaggerated movement but aside from that id like more critique or clear fundamental fuckups identified if possible    thank you
  weird how it only seems to bounce vertically
is it normal that drawing a line in toonboom results in it looking pixelated like in the image how do i stop it from happening
  its normal they dont anti alias the lines to keep it running fast if i remember right you can click the blue gear symbol at the bottom of the view window to make it render smoothly just make sure you have a white colour card underneath of it will just be a black screen
  thanks i just tried that and it worked
  oh thanks
whats the general opinion on csp for animation
steam attempts number 2
  i only come to these animation threads for steam/wind porn nice job
so ive been taking a local digital storyboarding class most of the class had been just how to use storyboard pro    my teacher is a cool guy hes an animator who worked on cramp twins and a few reps of venture bros but ive barely gotten to talk to him the whole session    my family and friends suggest i try asking my teacher if he knows any connections in the industry that he could refer me to to get a job in because im socially retarded i wouldnt know the first thing about how to approach him about that i personally think its awkward an sleazy but if there is a way of asking a teacher with animation connections to refer me to any studios i dont know how i would ask    tonight is the last class so if i dont approach him about it i guess i could always email him but i havent really been given a chance to give him an impression of my work    right now hes mostly a teacher while currently going for an mfa so im not sure how much power he would have in referring me to anyone right now anyway    thoughts ideas
  i loved cramp twins growing up also i guess its okay to do as long as youre polite like just be nice and say your really greatfull for all he has taught you but youre worried about getting into the industry and if its okay if you can chat with him at the end then ask him if he has any advice if you just ask him to refer you to a studio imao it might come across as youre just interested only in using him as a stepping stone to get into the industry instead word it like youre asking him for advice on what is the best way to get in on your own merits instead of just like you want him to tell his friends to let you in good luck
first animation ive made
  the resting position of the cheeks is too high up its like theyre still being held up when she lets go
resources on animating water tears shorelines waterfalls etc
    chluaid has some courses on effects animation on his site i hear theyre pretty cheap
    thank you guys
need a good tool for painting handdrawn frames mostly need to worry about having it not compress my frames to all hell when imported it basically just needs to do the whole line and area fill functions
  you want tvpaint
  this looks really nice the walk cycle for the kid is the most immediate thing i notice tho its like his steps dont match his walking speed id either slow the animation down or speed the boy up
  can the fill tool do raster images cus i was recommended opentoonz by some pleb who didnt tell me that the fill tool doenst work on raster graphics images
  yes it can only work with raster images
  good stuff
  use keys and in betweens and keep the movement speed of your clumps from jumping around too much    looking good fren i remember seeing stuff from this series and not caring much for it at all but this is much better    try to change the overall vertical and horizontal size more when they are released since that mass is being compressed on the z axis when they are being squeezed right now it looks kind of like implants because the overall shape of the mass stays as the same circle type shape you should be going from a vertically compressed oval to a diagonally but mostly vertically stretched one you can mimic this pretty quickly using the transform tool on your current frames    check the catalog this discussion is in every animation thread ad nauseum
  hmmm i see ill have to screw around with it some more i suppose i was trying to do the skip cycle at a slower pace since hes such a tiny little guy but youre right he feels a little too slow
    isnt the company behind tvpaint dying
  check the catalog  all chacking the catalog would do is find me other threads besides the animation thread which wouldnt be useful at all do you mean the archives
  yes permission to gas me granted
  one last part one last bit to animate    yeah im seeing alot of the notsohotness of my animation too nothing i can do about it i just wanna make the last part i have to animate the very best it can be
  nah you were just trying to be helpful desu
  hi everyone i want to make an animation like mike enel because i think it would make me better at drawing and thinking 3d     whats good thing to make animation in that doesnt cost money
  autodesk sketchbook pro is free last i checked and theres a flipbook function limited as fuck but okay for practicing traditional animation you get 2 layers a background layer and a canvas color   if you already have something like clip studio paint you can make better looking but shorter animations better layers and brush tools but only 24frames on base version
  did you draw the image here
  who do you think posted those
  god those tiddies hnnng
  just ask him apologize if makes you feel more comfortable if you dont ask its 100 loss ratio but asking is at least 5050 yes no
any reccomendations for brushes for tvpaint 10 all the ones that ive tried seem pretty bad
i have to ask does anyone here animate on ipad i want that delicious screen but as far as i know there is literally nothing in the way of pro grade animation on that thing
  the fill tool doenst work on raster graphics images  yes it does just only works in normal not rectangular or polyline on raster levels
  they were at ctn so they must be alive in some capacity
    oh my gd csp supports audio files now you have no excuse this is way better than flash
  since its animation thread i should mention opentoonz of studio ghibli fame got opensourced so if you have high tolerance for pain knock yourself out  
   samefag  also mentioned before blender has some cool updates to tool they call grease pencil coming in v 28  heres a short 2d animated film they made using it    honorable mentions synfig havent tried and pencil2d project became active again recently
quick question im used to using flash cs6 but i notice a lot of people use different programs here which one would you recommend as far as good features and easy to use
hi im new to animate what software should i use
  nevermind the audio doesnt play while youre dragging through the timeline it shows the audios waveyzags but it doesnt actually play a snippit of it while youre dragging through the timeline    quickly tested it here     still its a huge step forward for the program i think theyll add the needed feature in a future update
  i have clip studio already though i have no idea how to animate with it and all the animations ive seen from it look like dogshit     is it actually decent for making animations with do you think       what
  has his animation tutorial been uploaded anywhere
  yeah on gumroad
  for free 
    krita has animation capabilities and its totally free
  before animating learn how to fucking draw you underage retard
  dude they are quite clearly starting out the fuck is your problem
  what was the point of them adding audio if it has the timeline scrubbing playback or anything im sure its really not that hard to implement as they pay programmers to work for them just tell them to add audio playback into the animation timeline its not that hard
  i use tvp11 and most of the brushes suck there too ill get one from the defaults that has an element that i like then tweak its settings until its what i need theres a lot of settings to play with at least in 11 shouldnt be too different from 10
  krita has let you listen to audio while scrubbing through the timeline for over a year and its free 
  its perfectly fine to animate with
could someone with a phd explain how the light table in csp works
do i need to look up a guide to use krita for animation i used to use photoshop but obviously this program seems to work differently
  i think you basically just enable the animation related dockers  i found that there werent much of any default keybinds set for animation and that it did not have many features compared to most animation software since its relatively new to the software
  enable the docker and then set keybinds for flipping frames i use uhz and x i think its great make sure to read the documentation its the least complicated and most intuitive animation program ive ever used but that doesnt mean you dont have anything to learn
      fun stuff
  looks a bit odd without his body/head bobbing
  i love this
  chill out on your camera wobble
  hehe i suppose so     honestly once i realized how to do it i used the shit out of it in after effects lol    thanks dude
  both
  looks alright for a doodle if you plan on cleaning it up watch out for deformations since there are some
  its just a doodle  did it this morning in bed as a quick study
just want to know is there anything comprehensive cartoonoriented in video form like the famous artist course or preston blairs stuff because if there isnt theres a definite market in that    in case its not clear what im asking i think video tutorials that are less about drawing specific characters or design and more about form and gesture without being all focused on fine art would be really cool to have if theres anything like that already i want it if there isnt someone should get on that shit and make a patreon/yt channel for it counter out the calarts with some doodly old school cartoon shit
  i like this a lot are you going to work on it more
  jesus thats spoopy
hey animation experts i have a question just watched hotel transylvania 3 and as much as the exageration poses are great i find the animation to be a bit weird like its too fast or something but i cant analyze why exactly anyone got an idea on why it looks like that
  its just a very snappy pose to pose style of animation quite commonly used for comedy animation
  pose to pose    oh ok so basically its nothing more than less keyframes i guess
  i want to but ive been animating it on my phone using the rough animator app the file size has balloons like mad and currently if i try to add anything else to this the app just crashes the file size is also massive for some reason too its simpler to just move on to something else
first time here so sorry if common subject    what do you guys think of u m a m is animations on youtube
  it isnt anything impressive animation wise but the setting/theme/feel is fucking amazing and more than makes up for it
  echoing what the other anon said basically animations nothing special but the overall work is glorious
does anyone have yt animator channel to recommand
  havent seen 3 but a lot of the attempt at the kind of snappy animation tartakovsky was going for in 1 was marred by the use of motion blur
whats like the most basic cheap sketching material i could use for learning animation like the equivalent of printer paper for drawing are there small flipbooks or something i can mass buy
  wouldnt tracing paper be a goto
  digital why the hell would you learn with traditional media especially if youre concerned about money
hows csp ex for animation
  that makes sense thanks although how do you play it back at a constant fps      because i have a lot better motor control traditionally and also at least as far as static drawing goes you can get like 10000 pieces of paper for the same price as a cheap tablet so its a long time before digital pays off
  terrible dont use it use photoshop for animation
some quick piece o shit i might aswell dump
  is there a medical reason you have bad motor control digitally because everyone isnt good at drawing on a tablet at first it just takes practice to get the hang of it paper is good for learning but if you end up wanting to go further going digital will definitely save money in the long run
  no medical reason its just more fun traditionally for me
  using that brokenass timeline
  yeah using csp is pretty fucking shit
  too viscous it looks like the steam is like taffy or something maybe if it was really hot / humid the steam wouldnt have as much energy to rise  in any case it looks really good im jelly
  for some reason this is really relaxing to watch i cant stop looking at it
  works on my machine
  other than onion skin not good to trace your drawings using light box anyway whats so broken about photoshops timeline    if they cared enough wed have tvpaint style animation layers by 2020
  thanks its kinda relaxing/fun to grind animation fundies because im at a stage where i feel the improvement
is there a point trying to animate alone when youre starting at an older age can i accomplish anything alone or should i just stick to drawing
  if you think like this youll never make it
  youll be sorry in ten years if youre still asking the same question just start now
  i dont know i cant really measure how much work it is i just know its a lot and how much fundamentals you need to start animating well i roughly see it i guess so i was telling myself maybe its impossible to animate alone if you dont start early      yeah i should give myself one month of studying animation to get a better feel of it and see by myself i guess
hello i was wondering since i do not really have the money to buy a tablet nor the space is there any real viable way to do traditional animation and how would i get started also is there any reasonable starting point/ any techniques and ideas i need to really have down before i start
  says literally in the tutorial that it is a common run cycle in anime which is by definition limited animation that does not always afford conveyance of weight
crits sorry for the poor framerate of the head didnt really touch it since the beginning also how the fuck do i draw this bloody skirt this is insane
  every new layer is at a set number of frames  if you like using spacebar to pan your image enjoy the occasional triggering of the play function  animdessin2 adds a lot of much needed functionality to photoshops animation features but id still consider it inferior to most other options  firealpaca krita csp are all better options
  is it possible to flatten layers when animating in ps and not just flattening the frames in the timeline

im sorry for making a thread about this book again but can somebody help me out with this how does the concept of big hand look so correct in the top right image by japanese artist but look so wrong in the bottom right image by western artist  what secrets do the runes conceal
  foreshortening
op i will help you figure it out only if you admit your iq is below 60
  i admit my iq is below 60
several reasons a big one is that the moron introduced a perspective discrepancy     the figure in front of her is not respecting the perspective exaggeration making it look like the hand is actually really big    replace the whole figure with lets say just the eye and nose of the observer and it might start to make some sense
  the forearm is not big enough   the figure next to the girl screws up the perspective etc etc
  i dont think im a perfectionist but still how the fuck do you consider something like this finished
  read better books on the subject and you will figure it out maybe books in a language you can understand
i dont know anything about drawing and linear perspective is a concept i have never even heard about  but guys why does this application of linear perspective look better than this other one when i think it has to do with where the image was drawn because im a dumb fucking ignorant little shit
  why is there a single boot  is that guy unzipping his pants  is she threatening to cut off his balls
  he gonna piss into the boot
  sadly thats making perfect sense
  its not a matter of east vs west the western artist just lacks a fundamental understanding of perspective and neglected to place the subject close enough to the view point to create the level of extreme foreshortening they were trying to achieve    like the only way you can view a hand or a fist like that is if youre close enough to smell it    also fyi its very likely the japanese artist drew the hand first then estimated the rest of the body usually easier that way
there are no secrets the western artists are retarded af  just go study anatomy and perspective
      read page number 23 to 28 and youll understand why i doesnt work
  look so correct in the top right image by japanese artist but look so wrong in the bottom right image by western artist  simple the forearm is not done correctly and the silhouette is to cramped also the shading is done badly so it looks flat and the hand seemed to be right infront of her
its called field of view top makes sense bottom doesnt because of where the camera sits in the scene
  let me compare some art salvaged from some /beg/shitter nonames da account with an illustration made by fucking murata  hmm sure anon are ya baiting  thats called foreshortening read more about perspective
  focal length on the figure isnt correct for it to make sense     heres my attempt at fixing it
  im no expert but the girls hand is too low try doing the same sign with yours and see where your hand will naturally end up be you will notice it will be up closer to the face plan then to the hips i would have taken a picture to make mybpint ckearer but im outside just try it and see
  bottom right doesnt make sense perspectivewise we are looking at 2 people the person in the foreground is proportional to the person in the background the large hand should be a distortion or artefact of a very wide field of view a wide lens in film language     in order for this to make sense the person in the foreground should be fucking huge the reason this whole thing doesnt work is because you dont understand the fundamental rules of perspective
  the hand must be right in your face like a few inches from your eyeballs to be so huge    the bottom image looks wrong because theres no way her arm is that long
  top image the distance from the camera to his fist is shorter than the distance from his fist to the rest of him drawing a big fist is in correct perspective  bottom image the distance from the camera to her hand is longer than the distance from her hand to the rest of her drawing a big hand is in incorrect perspective    just hold your hand up in front of your face towards the farthest point in your room the hand is fucking huge in comparison to everything else you are observing and its taking up almost all the space in your field of view  you know for a fact that if you were to move your hand to the end of the room it would appear tiny  well the pokemon girl with her big hand is at the back of the room with her huge fucking hand
  i think this is what unrealistic deadlines cause
  still too big you also changed the perspective shes meant to look at the character in front of her with the viewer ahead of her to the right youve changed it so that shes looking at the viewer who is above her    it isnt often you need to greatly increase the size of the object in question in your case you could reduce it by 20
 this is correct    thats the point its about perspective thats why the top one is correct if shes meant to look at the character in front of her its impossible for the hand to be that big
  are you the 60iq op that anon showed pretty well how the entire view would need to be changed to make the hand appear that large please never post again
does anyone here actually use a screenless tablet still ive moved primarily to trad  ipad but would still like to be able to use pc apps if i have to is wacom the best or do competitors match up pretty well now    pic related the best tablet wacom ever made
i use a large wacom intuos pro i fucking love it
    yes still love it i like to keep my hands off monitor
  are the touch gestures worth it in other words do they work well ive become accustomed to them on ipad and dont know if i could go back
  wacom intuos 4 user here and its enough for me mostly into trad materials only using digital to preview changes try some shit out instead of messing up the original work sketching fooling around in ps and coloring illustrations outlines are scanned
  using intuos art pretty good except i might change to the flex nibs anyone have experience with these
i like using a non screen tablet because i prefer to draw on my 27 monitor i like the bigger screen estate      i never used a graphics tablet with touch gestures yet intuos4 user here too but i would rather keep my nondrawing hand at the function keys/wheel instead of constantly moving them touch gestures seem more useful with drawing apps on tablets/phones to me      kinda ashame wacom never included those little lcd screens next to the buttons on their other intuos tablets
  theyre not nearly as good as an ipad but its usable i use my intuos 5 as a trackpad sometimes and you can also swipe with two fingers to move around the canvas it works better on mac than windows tho and also the accidental touch rejection is bad unless youre using a drawing glove which you should be using
  fuck it ill probably just get a used intuos 3 like the good old days ebay has brand new mediums in box for like 70 dollars
  i would look for one of the newer medium or large ones used on craigslist i got a the large intuos 5 for 200 and the big drawing area is very helpful
  yep   im not trading my 32 4k panel for any of your gay toys
  i do ive been using a tiny ass wacom since before screen tablets became popular and im quite satisfied with it never had a problem with the tablettoscreen coordination  i am considering a bigger size though or a stand or something my current setup puts a lot of strain on my elbow and wrist which makes me more susceptible to pain and stress injury
  does the 5 have touch found some pretty good deals for it and the 4 on ebay as well
  pic related is the tablet i use to be more accurate its actually exactly the same as my entire setup  drawing with that shitty thing on a laptop  i dont exactly have money and the thing costed me 25 so whatever
i draw on wacom one m can anyone explain why would you need more expensive stuff like intuos and etc would like to hear people who actually moved from cheaper tablets onto more expensive like actually explain what about them feels better
  cintiq 22hd here cant imagine going back
does anyone have experience using a bluetooth wacom with the surface pro does it still have the jittery lines if you work that way     i want a mobile setup but drawing directly on the screen is very uncomfortable desu
i got cintiq pro 16     think its honestly just about being comfortable i just see it as an expensive toy for my hobby that makes it slightly better an intuos would do too even tho i would prefer medium size dont get how you guys draw on those small motherfuckers
  i use a wacom intuos medium that has bluetooth and found that the cursor lags when working with big files this in photoshop havent tried in other programs though also it doesnt happen when working on my laptop only on desktop
  i dont like drawing on the glossy screen and once you adapt to not looking at your hand its no big deal
whats your opinion on henry darger
well he doesnt draw very well
  creativity mogs the fuck out of /ic/
  full blown pedophile
first post nails it  i heard a podcast with an interview with an artist the made it in the 50s and 60s and a turning point for him was when one of his peers told him that his the one being critiqued painting exhibited attempts to perform marks of artthey did not contain marks of art the paintings had what the painter thought were marks of art  lines color etc  the critiques went on to say that the painter needed to determine what he wanted to say and that would dictate what marks he would make  post modern art as a whole has become an expression of art about art  it has lost its way  art is expression about experience about life and it can be as personal and subjective to the utmost degree  but when you paint/draw what you think art should be you stop expressing genuine experience you just imitate the last guy
  he doesnt know about the 30000 pages
    explain what is creative about that picture you smug dunningkreugerite
  eh i like his coloring
classic loli art
  while i dont particularly like his drawings i think what he did is still impressive considering the sheer volume of work he put out coloured and all
  he worked on his art every single day after work something to admire to
he was a bit of a lunatic    also legit paedo
down the rabbit hole has done a 21 min minidoc on the guy for anybody thats interested        also recommend this youtubers video on the history of furries it was actually fucking fascinating to see its origin and development out of the japanese art scene
  error no
  its shitty and boring
  genuine art for arts sake not for fame or money
forgot i attached that its not by darger just shows that childrens booklike illustrations are judged differently from rendered out concept art
if he was alive today he would probably post on /ic/    also he traced everything
he was telling a coherent story with his pictures so you have to take that into account
im lilylivered exclusively when it comes to the torture of children so some of those bits of that fantastical are unsettling to me learning about him inspired me to finish as much of what i start as possible even if no one but me sees it

how do i draw from imaginationim able to draw real people stylised but i cant draw a character from my own headis this just a case of grinding stock images more
  is this just a case of grinding stock images more  no its a case of grinding from imagination more
  do you have aphantasia
  do acid
  use stock images to fuel your imagination until you no longer need them
  i do
  /thread
  wrong     drawing from imagination is drawing from memory with the aid of common sense understanding of forms and perspective
  build up your visual library through observational  design studies and at the same time use and reinforce whats already in your visual library by drawing from imagination
  when you go to sleep try to visualize a familiar object think abiut its size wudth depth shape ect its easier to visualize things as you fall asleep and as you awaken it mostly goes away around midday
  whenever you draw from a reference try to do the following    look over the reference for a minute  put it away  try to draw it  bring the reference back up  compare your drawing to the reference and not the mistakes and differences  repeat
i think doing lots and lots of gestures is whatd help you there
  try to remember any event in your life and see if you get a visual in your head
got any ps cc 2018 tips just neat things i can do with it that i may not know about
cs6 master race here i heard using cc means you take it in the ass i dont judge though
  its all i got access to my dude
  there are a lot of professional photoshop tutorials on cgpeers its definitely worth learning photoshop in depth its a great skill to have in any case
what does /ic/ believe are some signs/flags that you or anyone in general are not meant to pursue art as a career     what are some skills that you must have if you are to make a living drawing/illustrating/painting/etc
you must have skills in drawing/illustrating/painting/etc obviously its also great if you dont have skills in literally anything else so it doesnt distract you

  i was stupidly proud of this when i did it at college showing it to everyone claiming i was finally getting good everyone told me that ugly guy had a broken neck but i told them to fuck off once i got home i saw it too i got the perspective severely wrong
  why is it so many people are good at shading and terrible at proportions and perspective    its really not that bad bro
just take a look at the pixel art threads if you want cringeworthy usermade works
  its similar to those render masters at deviantart who draw like crap but in traditional version id say it is because shading is just a very elaborate trick you apply over a base but actually making said base is the hard part proportions and perspective are pretty much learning how to draw    maybe its like how painting a house is nothing compared to actually building it same with any other thing
clown
      its really fucking bad  the real question is though how bad are you to look at that and think its really not that bad bro
i thought it was too phallic to upload somehow
someone elses drawing
  i like this
  im not one to shit on bad art i get that everyone starts somewhere but if you thought this was good good enough to show people you need to take a look at your life this is /beg/ tier and low effort spare yourself embarrassment and please wait a month or two to show off your drawings the beginning grind is rough and done in solitude if you want to keep your dignity intact
  why is this in a cringe thread this is nice
  it felt like i was playing twister with my cultural influences if i had my brush pen back then i would have made it look more like an asian ink painting
i am the sharpest of blades
  in my defense its just that i never looked at the whole picture until i finished i mean if i look at the boots or the sword or the torso i still think   yah this is cool  but once i zoomed out its like a fucking frankenstein and nothing is in the right place and may the lord save me once i try doing portraits ill wait 3 months to show those to people
  i mean if i look at the boots or the sword or the torso i still think  yah this is cool    you need to work on that critical eye of yours right now its pretty blind  read you some loomis
  this isnt cringe
  really  no one wants to comment on these  i guess its no fun to tear into someone unless their fragile huh    kinna hard to bant when your all hiding knives behind your backs
dont forget about six finger sakimi
  looks like something a hobo drew and threw in a dumpster fire
  amateur pro wrestling tier
  people like you suck all the fun out of drawing    i mean yeah its bad compared to michelangelos david but for an fun little cartoon its a step in the right direction
  thats a sculpture m8  he did paint the sistine chapel though
  
                  so do i have brain damage or something why do all my pictures look like i took a hit to the noggin i mean admittedly im much better now than i was back then but i still draw like a special needs child
  i feel like i learn a lot more quickly by fucking up and experimenting than i do through rote practice though the results are obscene
  this is the oldest thing i have
  shes done this several times how the fuck is that possible

the argument about whether or not memes are an art form is somewhat old at this point and has been answered as yes numerous amount of times however much like roy lichtensteins comic book paintings how successful could someone be if they painted memes when i mean painting memes i dont necessarily mean painting a picture of pepe but painting the image its effects and even the words written to accompany the memes image wouldnt this just be a contemporary form of roy lichtensteins paintings or it could even be compared to appropriation found in neoexpressionism or the young british artists
youre gonna have to just do it and find out
  painting the image its effects and even the words written to accompany the memes image wouldnt this just be a contemporary form of roy lichtensteins paintings or it could even be compared to appropriation found in neoexpressionism or the young british artists  jesus christ what a dead end painting memes was a meme itself and its dead literally zero understanding of the meme world
  thats the point shmuck
it neodadaism
  okay then i agree
  wonder why the meme painter doesnt post in this thread lol
memes are not to be appreciated in my opinion there is three kind of memes those that are similar to old comic strips other memes that are just funny images by their own but are given a context for reuse because the image by itself is interesting only the first time you watch it and then the memes used as reaction faces made to go with your text like some kind of ultradeveloped emoticon by painting a meme you are taking away these utilities to the meme ask yourself why would you pain an emoji or a comic strip
  shmuck  hi jimmy
    no it becomes pretentious and unappealing when people try to elevate memes into something they are not only good thing ive seen are these pepe paintings
  comfy
  what about the surrealism in memes take this for instance
  moreover when i speak on painting a meme i dont mean painting pepe or painting shitposts or old ass 2009 shit i mean literally exploiting what you see on todays instagram dank meme pages not daquan what makes that any different from what roy lichtenstein did or rene magritte marcel duchamp andy warhol im just applying that same train of thought to the only thing nearly as popular as porn on the internet memes
  sounds boring
dont expect to be sucessful doing it or think it will even be seen as a form of serious art memes are one of the most contemporary things you could choose as subject only surpassed by flavor of the month anime but unlike anime memes arent an interesting subject for art after a month even you will cringe at your own paintings and after a year you wont even remember what it was supposed to mean or reference
all my art is post internet art because i post all my art on the internet
  audience laugh
  you list several artists but fail to understand the context in which their work stood also you fail to realize that contemporary art has already been plundering from internet subcultures for the past few years now people are already doing what youre talking about and its just as nazel gazing and surface level as what you describe
  pepe is probably one of the best memes i think thats why these paintings work along with the artist being talented
  its because he isnt a meme he is a character he has a personality it is like doing fan art for a video game memes are not like that
is it really necessary for a beginner to draw using a pen  paper rather than a tablet
yea
no
maybe
possibly
how many things are absolutely necessary id rephrase it for the best pencil and paper is more intuitive fewer degrees of separation between you and the drawing theres no pressure curve no opacity setting no size jitter to complicate the already rocky early stages of learning a brand new skill why would you want to stack the odds against yourself at such a vulnerable point pencil and paper is low cost it can be taken anywhere you can easily draw from life with it its beautiful in its simplicity really    i have a fair bit of experience drawing and i still start my drawings traditionally with basic tools then scan and finish them digitally in fact it isnt just that you should start with pencil and paper and eventually move on to digital you should have a pencil and sketchbook on hand to keep your skills sharp if youre serious even digital painters like ruan jia keep sketchbooks for gesture and life drawing    the best part of this is you can start learning digital skills pretty early on just keep drawing traditionally too and as you gain youll know when its time to get more serious with digital there neednt be this hard separation between the two use everything available to you get the job done
ive been considering getting one of these things usually i just draw with a pencil or pen on paper but they look fun is there any particular one people rec that isnt super expensive
  yeah but i hate it when im drawing something and the end result is full of eraser marks
  no rules just tools
  beautiful best post       make more confident marks and get a kneaded eraser
  this might just be my personal style but i feel like getting used to not using eraser at all is a good way to go at least for sketches just let the wrong lines fade in the background and draw darker on top
    pencil and paper makes you feel and hear the grit of your strokes as the graphite erodes that equates to muscle memory you dont get that from a plastic surface plus its cheap
just let the morons who cant even draw with their dominant hand and buy lcd tablets to draw for the first time
  yes for a few reasons  1 its cheaper no point in investing hundreds of dollars in something you give up in 6 months for 20 you can buy 4 200 page sketch books and 5 good pencils  2 its way more comfortable to use also helps build confidence in line strokes the ctrlz fags are wasting more time for inferior line work  3 its easier to move around tablets are nice but for things beginners are doing life drawings and such paper is much easier to move around they can work with tablets but it takes more planning and time/space investment paper you can pick up and take to a park  4 its good to have permanent visual reminders of how far youve come its too easy to forget about digital drawings and let them fall into the abyss of your harddrive paper drawings are always in your sketch book looking at you judgingly
  paper drawings are always in your sketch book looking at you judgingly  its the opposite for me only save my best stuff on my hdd paper sketches lie forgotten in a box probably because i cant skim through multiple pages the same way i can browse through thumbnails
  eh you can get a cheap decent quality tablet for like 50 bucks especially since wacoms battery free stylus patents have expired so now all the knockoffs have them now   plus there is a learning curve with standard tablets regardless of how good you are with pen and paper   really depends on what you want to do and what your goals are
  a shit tablet then you still need to invest in a decent enough computer and monitor and most people will probably at least spend a bit on software     but imo its still the biggest issue is with the portability a tablet is tied to your computer paper isnt computer references are nice but theyre limited
    id generally say its better to learn with pen and paper but if your end goal is to use a tablet theres no reason not to use one from the start the huion h610 pro v2 i got was just 80 and its a fantastic tablet most people have a computer powerful enough to run any drawing program and at least one decent screen in their house they can plug it into a cheap pc and a cheap relatively tablet isnt that much of an investment of money given how much time youll probably invest using them if you dont theyre easy to resell
  yes if youre a complete beginner no need wasting money on a hobby youre not yet sure of for all you know you may give drawing a good go for a few months and then fall out completely which is actually quite common nothing beats the feel of pencil and paper anyway
  i just find problem with the   well im going to be using a tablet anyways  excuse    its not that it hurts you to use a tablet when youre at your desk but youre still going to need to pull out that pencil and paper   its not a 1 or the other but if you have to choose one then go with pencil and paper because it opens up more options than a tablet does
  the whole point of digital drawing is for it to be malleable in its application and because of that its going to make it infinitely harder to learn the fundamentals when you also have to worry about brush size opacity canvas size ect starting with pen and paper means you get down to brass tax and are thrust into focusing solely on learning the basics of drawing so you can later apply that knowledge with the many new tools digital provides otherwise you will be starting with a system that completely molds to the users needs with you not knowing what you need
  tape a piece of paper to your tablet bro
  brass tacks
  or just let the retards like you who cant even write properly use the internet kys
  on the real fuck no start on a tablet nobody gives a shit about pen/pencil and paper  youre not gonna get a following uploading your shitty pencil drawings no matter how good they are  plus you dont have to worry about materials/colors on a tablet it never runs out  anyone that says otherwise is a crab fuck em youll be good enough for commisions within 2 years
  this guy is an idiot youll have a better time learning to draw on pen and paper and if by the time you are actually good its still something you want then you can get a nice expensive tablet and transition over otherwise you are going to spend a bunch of money on a tablet that you might just stop using cause you arent able to get good
  lol its like 70 usd for a shitty tablet and thats all you need getting a more expensive one wont make a difference the only thing that really matters is the size  rich nigga problems i guess
  yes thats what i did just fucking draw     get your fundies down with a supplies that are literally a few bucks then make the splurge once youve developed the skill read the sticky stop wasting your time and other peoples time     is this /ic or r/artfundamentals cause its the same questions over and over
  the whole fucking point is he should wait till he knows for sure that he wants to continue with digital drawing and then get a expensive nice not shit tablet why the fuck would you settle for a 70 dollar shit tablet especially if you dont even know if youll stick with it or not maybe try to use your brain a little
  i think if you for sure want to be a professional commercial artist someday itd be better to start doing digital soon than later because thats likely what youre going to be using for work if you want to be in a studio again might depend what exactly you want to do though     this is coming from someone who started using a nonscreen tablet at 14 and now they feel really intuitive to me whereas people who spend their earlier years with traditional art just cant use those kinds of tablets and they have to fork over more money to buy a cintiq because it feels more intuitive to them but im rambling
  your not gonna get a following  stopped reading opinion discarded  pic related done on a tablet early on before i knew anything about dick
  yeah its absolute trash still doesnt change the fact that if you are going to get a tablet you should go all the way and get an expensive good tablet and you should only do that after youve been drawing for a while and know its what you want for sure pen and paper is just easier to learn on and inexpensive
  r/artfundamentals is the drawabox critique forum even a how do i draw anime op is more interesting than their ocean of lesson 12 exercises
no you either learn to draw or you dont go with the medium you like the most so youll actually practice
  professional commercial artist  what do you mean by this someone who is hired someone who does commissions someone who sells art via galleries
  is it really necessary    no its really not draw however you want the 1 most important thing is mileage
  best to figure out if you are any decent at drawing in the first place before making a large investment
  best surface
most people have pen and paper readily available a tablet is an expense and an investment that might not pay off    the short answer just draw the long answer if youre easily discouraged by not reaching some kim jung gi level by next week dont fucking put down money on a chink tablet    if youre trying to get into animating id advise you to do it digitally paper animation is dead but frame by frame animation is way way way cheaper digitally despite cg saturation of the last 25 years giving normies the impression otherwise
  if you dont consider 50usd expensive id recommend the huion h610 pro     if not theres also a 20 dollar one by them but its really small with less levels of pressure sensitivity
  if you already have an ipad  buy the apple pencil by itself its cheaper than most drawing tablets of the same functionality and it will be more than enough for you companies like samsung have their own offerings but im not familiar enough with them to recommend anything  if you dont  use pen and paper you need to see your lines on the canvas drawn by your own hand and any tablet without a screen doesnt give that feedback itll be very difficult for you to learn like that
tfw your tablet gets dusty  400 intuous large  bought in 2013  sitting there begging to be drawn on  tick tock  sorry im just busy today i cant
yes  more questions
  he doesnt experiment with all possible media trying to find the best way to channel his creativity  how do i know you are a pleb
necessary no    prudent yes
how much space on a desk do i need at minimum to draw
  i have such limited space i cant even stretch my arms completely
when they say rest your elbow on the table but you dont even have elbows
  what the fuck is this retarded thread  enough that you can draw obviously      duhhh pros like to use a 256x452 industry standard at a 38 degree anngle facing west but personally i prefer your classic a15 walnut writing desk at 32x28 feet     like what the actual fuck is it too small get a bigger one how did you get this far in life
the appropriate space enough space so you can draw comfortably what a dumb question
  preach brother
  i just wrote on my whiteboard with permanent market i would be super pissed if it was a large whiteboard like in the op pic
  based
  depends on format and at least have like an a2 paper size of working space themorethebetter
  i agree facing west is just good feng shui really
  idk why but this thread made lol
  2sqm
i always hear about using loomis for learning but what are the thoughs vilppu
  bump
vilppu is the same as loomis same fucking fundamentals  good to go with each other obviously

ive been trying to google the answer to this but i cant figure out what these sort of pants are called  and its not assless chaps its some sort of asian wear or wtf
pants with easy access to get fugged
  you mean theese
  aah not quite   i think theres an asian name to it or something but i just cant remember it    usually these are worn by some kung fu / wushu / whatever girls
  thia maybe
maybe you mixed up the location of the open area because theres hakama pants but theyre open on the ousides of the hips not the inside
  not op but this aint it definitely similar though i dont know if ops pants exist in reality but ive seen them in a lot of fantasy setting anime and such wish i could help these pants drive me wild and id love some way to search them up
  anime slutpants   got any examples of characters wearing these dont have any in mind
  pants like this yeah  is there a name for it or is it just some weeb shit
  i dont think those pants exist are you sure youre not thinking about the pants with holes on the side
  theyre stylized chaps closest thing i can think of
  thats right
might be outta luck op most relevant tag on the boorus are chaps and that gets you all kind of results sad
become a fashion designer and make it yourself
thanks for the help anyways guys   appreciate it
  thanks for that anon ill come back to /ic/ once ive made a few millions
theyre called harem pants but the variant you posted with the inner thighs cut out probably dont exist irl
i plan on getting a drawpad for my sister this christmas whats a good model i should get
can we have a thread about having a second nsfw blog and how to keep your name from it and how would one obtain commissions     i know some people here do have secret nsfw accounts anyone wanna share advice
having to hide your nsfw content on a second account  ngmi  posting all of your shit on one account  gmi
  your clients finding a blog thats all porn and fanart   ngmi
  nobody does that or do you think genuine artists have time to waste leading a 2nd full time social media pseudonym instead of actually drawing and improving    only begs do that those who nobody gives a fk about if they have 5 different names since theyre all probably filled with the same da tier work
  ive seen several people do that anon and get heaps of money on patreon
  doesnt have to be full time and i wouldnt doubt some pros have an accounts for personal use outside of their professional persona
  if you want a secret nsfw account just putit under a url thats completely different from your normal one and dont draw your ocs on it thats it
  yeah but what about money and stuff if you get commissions
      i have three nsfw projects and i have my real official illustration thing going and i also have a fourth project based around art thats more entrepreneurial i want to sell high quality canvas prints its absolutely doable and although my approach is taking it a bit to the extreme i think its absolutely beneficial to have a diverse approach to making a living as an artist of course if youve got a good thing going on with your real name and high quality art theres no point taking time away from that for a sideproject thats unlikely to ever reach your main project    but if you find yourself where i was starting out quite high skill art wise but only getting 12 maybe 3 commissions a month which would pay 400800 each but take 47 days to finish well then my friend i suggets you start a nsfw sideproject because if youve got the skills you can easily get 100200 commissions which take you 24 hours to finish aka you can cruise through 34 per day then you share those online and that gets you new traffic followers watchers and commissioners    i only started feeling like i have floor under my feet when i started doing nsfw stuff on the side and its allowed my main project to grow as well taking pressure out of it and not forcing me to take on every shit job im offered porn got me covered with those lol    and with post scheduling nowadays mantaining three or more patreons is not that hard of course youll lack the engagement of a dedicated onegig artist who can interact with fans instantly but oh well thats life    planning to start another gig and patreon soon because ive heard gay furry art pays extremely well
    you can disguise it a bit on paypals business account invoices but sometimes it will still show up so honestly the only feasible way ive found is to just deal with and not give a fuck if somebody who commissioned me in the past wanted to expose me he very well could but i think if youre a kind and honest person why would anyone ever want to do that they like your art enough to commission you in the first place unless you screw them over by never delivering or treating them badly they will not sperg out on you this is assuming youre at a three digit commission level below that its quite likely that you get petty and autistic kids who resent you for incomprehensible reasons     but at the end of the day if youre ever so famous and popular that being exposed is a legitimate concern well fuck youre super popular already so who gives a fuck    remember when kr0n was busted for being a tracing cheater his patron lost 15 of support for a few months then he was back to normal even though the entire art community online knew and saw the evidence nobody really gives a shit at the end of the day and all publicity is good publicity seeing the kr0n thing first hand also here on /ic/ was also a major incentive for me to stop being so careful with art it made me understand a lot about how the market actually works and how little integrity really matters to financial success
  hey man im the op thanks for the reply    the situation im in right now is that im an animation student in england and my main account is for getting me serious 95 jobs and not for getting commissions whatsoever so im nearly done college and i think i have good enough skills to draw some nsfw fan art and some commissions on the side for when i get a job pic related is my work    i dont expect millions or anything just a small bit of cash on the side of a main job       yeah but im aiming to be a director/film maker one day and i dont want nsfw stuff associated with me i know people pretend like it doesnt matter but it does for someone in the spotlight i probably wont ever get famous but whatever
  nobody does that or do you think genuine artists have time to waste leading a 2nd full time social media pseudonym  many artists do that openly   and they dont waste their posting social shit just picture
      not making paintings of chaste women walking their pet lion instead of producing fast food smut art
  and pet sheep
just make the account
just accept bitcoin be grand
  cryptoshekels  get commissioned in bitcoin or whatever the fad is monero seems pretty anonymous  or just make a fake paypal account and stop being a fag
  his patron lost 15 of support for a few months then he was back to normal
how much does noise really detract from learning experience  im living near a busy street and with thin walls ive gotten so used to drawing while everything is being noisy with cars racing by and honking of impatien fucks that its actually become difficult to get in the mood for it when its actually quiet i prefer to tune in to watts atelier sessions or some white noise stuff to get going at least that seems more conducive to drawing than listening to music  what are your experiences anons
  i grew up in a rural area with near permanent background noise dogs animals people fucking around with saws and hammers machines so i dont notice them at all no matter what   i find the sound tablet pens make on a plastic/glass surface quite distracting so i like listening to music or podcasts to cover it though
i feel like my absolute bests jave been without noise but that if im just practing its not worth doing without music because i enjoy music and drawing is just a hobby
200 fine for honking
if its a type of noise that genuinely distracts/irritates you then it certainly is not doing your art progress any favors
  my gf has caused a few fines because of this
my nibba drake
prove me wrong
  more like  method and result is irrelevantbeing happy and accomplished while drawing is
    the result and method go hand in hand therefore the statement makes no sense
  theres no correlation between method and results
    i think hes more talking about the hate towards things like grids photobashing tracing reference etc
    yes and all of those things affect the end result for better and for worse
  yep but regardless of which methods used if the result is good it doesnt matter whether method affects the result or not
if the goal is to learn or to have fun then yes no rules only tools  if we are talking professionaly then using other artists work as a source for tracing should be a hard no
  doesnt effect the result for the most part yes  but photobashing and tracing is shit like just learn to draw fag    this
  but photobashing and tracing is shit like just learn to draw fag  read the subject of the thread im a /trad/fag and i dont trace or use grids or anything but result is what matters even if i dont subscribe to that myself because it doesnt fit my goals
  if result is what matters well i never saw anything outstanding coming out of photobashing most of it is bad and the best photobashing are painfully average  this is a good method for dishing out a concept fast not for acheving good results
  there are no good results without a good method so not sure what youre even trying to say
  if the result is good when you trace you might as well just use a photoshop filter on the photo and if you trace others art that is pointless reproduction and stealing there is no point in tracing it is the lowest thing an artist can do if the traced image looks nice the original likely looks just the same or better so why would you trace
i would prefer looking at or buying art of poorer quality over something well rendered if i knew the artist put in as little personal talent and craftsmanship in order to make it look better
  but photobashing and tracing is shit like just learn to draw fag  but what if you do know how to draw but just want to save some time what if the only difference is that you saved 30 minutes on something     does it really matter then     no it fucking doesnt even the masters used things like grids and tracing using lenses to project a scene onto canvas or paper to trace over it so they could get the placement proportions perspective and more down at a reasonable pace ive seen them in a few art museums for display and they are pretty clever    you cant do these things properly unless you have already spents tens of thousands of hours doing them the hard way anyways its like earning your right to take shortcuts if you cant do it normally without any kind of aid and you attempt to take these shortcuts its going to be noticeable in the final painting/drawing/whatever    every artist uses referencesall of them
i am relatively new to the whole art thing so i dont know what to look for
here is another portrait
i really like him but what are you concerned about
  he cute
    looks like he liked dix
  my opinion  well hes awful
otto dix is one of the best of the german expressionists his caricatures on german society were excellent as well as his portraits he actually worked in the way of the old masters as well for his portraits and used a tempura base and all that shit very meticulous
  that guy looks like hes sucked alotta dicks
  quite based
this is my first time posting here but just wanted to ask you a question regarding art when paintings like the one in pic related by great artists like vincent van gogh become known as a masterpiece or known as one of the greatest pieces of european art is it because of its artistic complexity and what i mean by that is is it well known because the painting seems to have been made by someone with incredible skill and the level of detail and precision can only be done by someone who has been painting for his entire life and able to portray photorealistic art such as eugène delacroixsuchs liberty leading the people or is it because its able to somehow display some abstract thought but simply like pic related    reason why im asking is because i want to get into painting but have no intention of making artistic masterpieces but rather paint metaphysical concepts and to achieve this i will need to reach some level of competence when it comes to art but i want to know how to go about doing this how do those videos on youtube where people paint or draw photorealistic pictures not be well known all around the world but yet simple paintings like pic related make it into the artistic canon when at least it seems so like to me that the complexity of youtube or instagram freelance artists seem more amazing
  van gogh somewhat as a child but didnt take his art seriously and paint a lot until he was in his late 20s you dont need a lifetime to achieve at least competency in any given field    as for why photorealistic works its mainly because most artist with at least some technical knowledge find photorealism especially those goddamn ballpoint photocopiers to be boring since they are usually just 11 recreations of a reference which is pointless and lacks any statement or intent outside of i want to be a camera but slower
  van gogh drew somewhat as a child
  ok how does the work of picasso become famous it seems like just a bunch of shapes what makes it so famous
  outside the shallow answers of van gogh was an interesting troubled artist and his paintings reflected that your question is so broad in scope that i can guarantee that no one will give you the answer you want come back when you have more narrow goals outside of i wanna be famous
  photorealism is boring in portrait painting i suppose but photorealistic fantasy art or surreal theres no reason not to maintain high standards of art today
  nooooooooo i dont wanna be famous just want to know what makes good art good it doesnt seem to be the complexity but something else its more because i want to study art and create my own art that doesnt come off as cringy but mature dont know the right word but fame isnt my goal im not sure i would even like to be known as a painter there are better things to do with my life i would just like to pursue this as a hobby and become competent at it and put it into my list of unrelated yet cool talents
  i mean i agree but i normally just call that realism a bit presumptuous of you to think i wouldnt agree with that or think having realism in fantasy or representational art isnt something removed from photocopying
  youre right sorry about that
  why are paintings known as a masterpiece ie van gogh eugene delacroix picasso is it simplicity or precision  neither its cultural significance and innovation art is subjective good and bad can have different meanings from one person to the next  but its doubtless that certain pieces have had an impact on society why so many people remember and cherish certain works has less to do with style and more to do with relevance and timing as you mentioned in your opening there are many talented and innovative artists out there today on youtube and instagram many of them if not most are innovative in their own way but not cultrually relevant lets rake a look down those artists    picasso     how does the work of picasso become famous it seems like just a bunch of shapes  yeah picasso drew shapes wanna know what else he drew pic related   wanna know when he made that when he was 14   picasso came from a family of artists he was bred for art and learned the basics young this meant that he had a grip on the fundamentals and the art world was already paying attention to him because of his connections that aside anyone would have been shocked and curious to see a 14 year old draw like that even in these days we would picasso was so good at drawing portraits and scenes that he actually got bored of it the reason picasso drew cubes was because he was so good at everything else that he decided to do something new people were absolutely shocked that someone so talented could just get so wild in art and everyone was paying attention to this guy who broke all the rules when someone says girl with mandolin is so well done they are saying so because picassos fame and aptitude helped create an entirely new branch of history this is why art history is so important at art schools its context
  van gogh  more art history  the op picture is seen as a masterpiece now but while van gogh was alive it was worthless he only sold one painting in his entire life despite having an obsessive passion for his art he was poor and sad and angry and his family felt like he was a failure he comitted suicide before 40 the reason his paintings like starry night became popular is actually in part because he died after van gogh died his widowed wife decided that she wanted to prove the world wrong about her husband so she lent his art away and asked to put it in museums for free getting it into circulation at the same time she published van goghs personal letters to his family  the letters were what made the world pay attention to the art in them he talked about how he wanted to be an artist no matter what the cost and how much he loved and cherished his craft he very poetically talked about his passion all while being borderline homeless hungry and depressed these emotional letters when paired with the art van gogh did showed a biography of a tragic and beautiful figure who was ruined starry night is detailed and simplified but above all its emotive people look at starry night and they can understand that a sad man is trying to be hopeful and thats what makes it a masterpiece people have since taken his style his vivid colors his ingenuity and been using inspired techniques in the west ever since
eugène delacroixsuchs liberty leading the people  again cultural significance and innovation this painting was actually completed as a commemoration to the july revolution in france it was an uprising that actually booted the king from his throne charles x it was a huge deal because it pretty much completely reformed the french government their flag literally changed the painting was finished about 6 months after the event and it showcased the feeling of victory that the french people felt at the time as for innovation eugene actually was born during the rennasance and went to one of the best art schools at the time he was growing a reputation for his talent and this sent him over the edge of fame he was one of the first to break away from stuffy portraits and to draw romanticized forms and colors in other words he was a pioneer of romanticism     every single time you see the same pattern people get popular for whtever reason and then whatever they were working on gets ingrained into society we look back on that and call those works masterpieces    tldr  artists are memes use that youtube video its whatever
boils down to cultural significance and what the populace considers as revolutionary or tasteful extensions of current art practices    you shouldnt assume that complexity means better    all forms of art is based on cultural significance  painting music writing poetry etc why because culture is defined by art    the populace or those in power curates which instances of art becomes popular which in turn dictates the culture    this process also imparts significance back onto the art because it describes to a future audience a portion of the culture and/or how it was formed
        thanks for your insightful answers this now leads me to ask if there is ever going to be another piece of art that will capture the current political climate with all the things that are going on in society today would all it take to create the next great piece of art is to somehow capture the madness that is going on today perhaps a painting of liberty leading the people but its a pepe with a kekistani flag overtaking america with the title meme magic speculation sure    also about art being subjective what is your opinion on modern art i know a lot of people like to shit on it but could it also have clutural and once day become know as a great piece of art
music analogy  when pink floyds dark side of the moon was released it was revolutionary it popularized heavy sampling used eight track mixing and in general was just really cool and new if you listen to it now it doesnt sound that experimental this is because everything after this album was influenced by or learned from it you might see some art and wonder why its famous when another painting just like it isnt well known at all its because the first painting innovated and has cultural importance the second painting is good as well it just isnt as important
  i forgot to add that many paintings can become iconic for reasons totally unrelated to their quality a good example is mona lisa or the last supper by leonardo davinci fun fact the reason the last supper is in such bad shape is that leonardo experimented and used shitty paints while making it because he didnt care about it he just needed to pay some bills
  this now leads me to ask if there is ever going to be another piece of art that will capture the current political climate  look around there is depending on the country or the subject youre looking for  perhaps a painting of liberty leading the people but its a pepe with a kekistani flag overtaking america with the title meme magic speculation sure  do you really think todays america political climate can be narrowed down to an internet meme parody of an iconic piece reflecting an entirely different era from an entirely different country i mean i dont really see anything of the sort happening    also about art being subjective what is your opinion on modern art i know a lot of people like to shit on it but could it also have clutural and once day become know as a great piece of art  while i think most of modern art is trash theres a few gems hidden here and there  i think some pieces are on their way to become historical icons if chinas political regime changes for example purely speculating you can probably expect ai weiweis stuff to come back to the surface to reflect the issues he pointed out old china had
  do you really think todays america political climate can be narrowed down to an internet meme parody of an iconic piece reflecting an entirely different era from an entirely different country i mean i dont really see anything of the sort happening  pepe and the entire meme culture is a something that best represents our current climate when i look at the whole hwndu phenomena words like redpilled being more commonly used 4chan being a hub for political discussion i dont think its too wild to think that it can represent the current culture
  meme art as political value  funny you should bring this up because i was just thinking of this myself the popularity flexibility and poinency of memes really mirror the social paradigms seen with classic art i dont think it would be a stretch to say that memes in general are the masterpieces of our era unfortunately i think it might be more complex to pinpoint the next singular artistic masterpiece even though political pepe parade sounds both hilareous and poignant our society is actually very interconmected these days and i think any critique on our society to be taken seriously would have to reflect that we cant forget that it would also have to introduce something stylistically new useful and float off intense popularity maybe hack a bunch of artists to tweet the art at the same time while also including a new way to render and that could do the trick lol    modern art  personally i think that when historians look back on the art of today the most noticable thing will be the interconnectivity the internet has only really been popular for just around 25 years and the fact that anyone can share anything with anyone immediately and build off each other is something that has absolutely never been available in all of human history before i think the cultural significance of that alone will actually completely change the very idea of what it means to make artistic masterpieces rather then a singular art being a masterpiece it will change to groups like you said op theres quantity and quality available everywhere online and i really think the future will be about disecting and combining ideas and art in my personal opinion i think that every uploaded art is part of the masterpiece known as the internet
  is ever going to be another piece of art that will capture the current political climate  if youre talking about visual art painting drawing etc its becoming less and less popular among the general population but im sure there are some examples i guess you cant really tell currently though in hindsight it will be obvious    however i firmly believe other multimedia art vidyas film vr will have both a greater and deeper impact within this current climate
hey /ic/ what does it take to reach to the level of picasso both in terms of fame and skill
  skill time luck and gimmick
  in terms of fame  simply put never
things outside your control you need to have had an art tradition in your family to meet the best artists of your generation to live in a country and city that is culturally important at just the right time live into your 90s    its pretty random
jew connections thats it thats all it takes
  whats wrong with his fingers
    picasso is known to have had a very rare medical condition that slowly turned his fingers into french pastrie throughout his lifetime something with the synthesis of limbic proteins im not a doctor
  to me it looks like sausage finger
    picasso had a very low skill level you can reach that easily you have zero hope of ever reaching his fame level
  pleb
  picasso had a very low skill level  im not a fan of his but thats not true
  lmao dont expect shitters like this to answer    i saw some dude saying hitler shouldve killed modern artists like picasso a week ago    remember kids
  you are the piece of shit this hitlers was a sketch two can play this game but in place of place an informal work ill put picassos latest selfportrait
  skill  a year  fame  eh hes famous because he drew really really terrible so hes synonymous with shit works cant top that
  dude cant even keep his perspective in check and he wanted to be an architect lmao    stay mad because your pencil moustached idol was shit
  aint idol dear piece of shit even you been right you cant ignore the fact that your absolutely no joke xx century artist was actualy shit becouse of hiding hisself under shitty shapeless ilustrations by couldnt upgrade his capacity and style
  this is dementia
  from father please fix my painting to i cant draw on my own
  you cant judge hitler because he was a beginner at that time and then he stopped painting picasso instead was an artist all his life and he never surpassed himself the only reason why he is famous its because we live in a era where frankfurt school teachings are in the mainstream also because he is jewish
        just like that
  those failed quints prove a lot of things
  you need to move to the city that will define art this century then make some early works dancing around the modern style as soon as something looks like its going to break through as a mode then pounce on it and totally dominate it with as many quick knock offs as possible
  i dont know what it is that caused him to be such a big deal
i use fire alpaca and need some custom brushes help  also inklings
a thread died for this
  and you just bumped the thread
  im currently using fire alpaca with default brushes i think im doing ok but keeping an eye on this thread if it comes to good use
  just switch to medibang its basically an alpaca with cloud storage
found a new job in the it  talked with the coworker and mentioned that i drew as a hobby  teamleader endorsed me to design new commercial flyers for the company  struggle to be creative in a cloud of people who observe constantly my process in drawing and digital editing  noticed that being creative at home alone is much easier than doing it will interactive in a company  literally fucked my chance to get paid for drawing and being creative
  doing it interactive in a company
  thats pretty normal anon to help with that mental struggle thats why mileage is so important because youll some information that was hardwired into your brain that most people dont
  want to represent a group of people with art  that group of people wants some input into your work    what exactly did you expect you need thicker skin anon
  this is exactly why i did absolutely nothing with my bfa you should make art for yourself nobody else there are less stressful jobs that pay far better
  anon you have to get over that feeling of insecurity if youve been drawing and designing for a while and youve actually built a bit of skill at it then chances are youre better at doing creative work than any random it person anyway maybe you dont want a job in a creative field but if you do youre going to have get used to people who want to see your work and want to see periodic progress as you work through an assignment    people who have no idea what theyre talking about dont understand how much effort certain things take and dont know that polish takes time are going to look at comment on and criticize your work when you are being paid to do creative work its not just about the final product especially for people who arent creative themselves for those type of people your work is less like a product and more like a performance they dont know enough about the work to get that creative work is not like seeing magic done its like watching a sausage get made    finally keep in mind that when youre doing something for someone else it is not about you its about them they want to be heard and appeased they want to see themselves represented in your work they want their vision not yours and they want to get their 2 cents taken into account before youre done    good luck anon keep at it if you do good work youll get another shot
  youre looking at art the wrong way there are a lot of very systematic things about it the creativity part is very small and you cant force it if its just a hobby and youre not an expert you cant expect yourself to do it professionally at all so either get serious and actually learn or dot put yourself in situations like that
thats mephistopheles
  mentioned that i drew as a hobby  digging your own grave buddy
  drawing shit at my factory job lead to my boss pestering me about making a new company logo for his business cards i dont plan on bringing up payment but i wish hed stop bringing it up are you at least being offered something
  congratulations artfag
why does the 4channel boards hate /ic/
they hate that they cant view /ic/ at work because /ic/ is nsfw
everyone hates /ic/ even /ic/ hates /ic/
  everyone make fun of the other board by spamming meme mate that how it works around here  fit/pol/tv/r9k are the bottom of this barrel though
  but spouting loomis without context or specificity is shitposting even here
  parroting loomis is not inherently wrong nor is it shitposting it basically means go back and study more
  /v/ draw thread    probably the worst fucking draw thread across all boards who cares dumb thread
lets see how many of us are truly here    there are now more peeps around right  
shit poll but ok
  i was the 3rd vote said i was a boy lol
  i selected the male lurker option though i think it has more to do with either captcha annoyance or not wanting to shit up the board any worse with uneducated or poor quality posts rather than introversion     i enjoy the shitposting and flaming here but i usually think better of contributing to it
at 50 and only one gurl actually posts are we the least diverse board that is surprising
  diversity is neither good or bad
  9 shy girls are posting on /ic/  aaaaaaah please post and go out with meeeeeee im so horny and lonely all the god damn time aaaaaaaaah
      we all no boys today are girls
  no
  not you again
  come at me i have nothing to lose and ive already establish the back up from a nation far superior to your own and this includes nato
there is nothing more useless than an insecure shy boi uwu neck yourselves
  never put meme options in polls you stupid fucker
hey sexy ladies
  teehee
  im surprised girls are even in here the way this board is littered with crabs  girls are already born with low selfesteem do they really need /ic/ too lol
tee hee i voted as a girl but im not
  really crabby board has tons of girls  hmm
  tilted furry fag    lmao anon
  do you mind if i save this pepe  got over a tb of pepes already
so many shy people on /ic wtf imagine how productive this board would be if they all started talkin
cringe language put me off  sorry honey
why yall shy who cares if you get shat on by anonymous people on the interwebs
  some people have very fragile confidence when it comes to drawing
its ok  dumb people should stay silent
  im lazy and also this 
    so thats 1 vote in the im a pink haired lgbt trans fem furry category
  op didnt give an options for lurkers in my case at least most threads arent worth replying to
tfw over half of /ic/s userbase are lurkers    just wanted to say youre all ngmi
the only board where the guys dont ask for tits or gtfo and the lowest female population what are women
  this is because the board is majority female who pretend to men
this poll is so thirsty that none of the girls answered it lol the drawing community has a female majority
so theres the polish girl and the vulgar girl with the handsome cat who are the other two
  cringe language  sorry honey  pfft
there was no option for brian so i picked boy
  based honeyposter
how do i get a cute art gf to discuss art while we embrace beneath a blanket in a very cold night
  im sure there are waifu pillows on sale for christmas
  well since you asked so nicely 
  get a well paid job    be confident    exercise    dont be an asshole    pay attention to what she puts effort in and complement her on it    easy  also it is enough to sleep with most girls    also avoid raging sjw types  but i guess it goes without saying
  sweetie he said cute
  i have a thing for hanging around neckbeard faggots
  at least you are being realistic about your relationship prospects honey
  i lurk because i feel like theres no point in posting on 4chan for serious discussion and /ic/ board humor isnt really funny when youre hanging out with art students all the time and the punchline is always loomis or something it gets pretty tiring the artbook thread is just about the only one i check now     i also feel that most of the 4chan userbase or at least the most vocal part of it are younger guys in their early 20s who are just getting into college i dont want to spend my free time arguing about useless things so i cant get along with them
  i wont date you until you make it
  meep
  lel
  savage
look at all these qt boys o////o  im gonna need a jpg of all your phone numbers 
  o////o  fuck off boomer hag
  sweetie even ic doesnt want to date a single mom thats gonna be 40 in 5 years
  did you do your nails anon
  do you actively draw/ have a decent following
    thats not a woman anon
    damn woman cannot make a single funny joke after all
100 people on /ic/  wtf
  personally id be more interested to see what time zones people are from this board is really active at odd hours for me
  based horny poster i love this shit man
  200   20 girls
  girls male
shitty poll
  there are more artsy girls than males tho so at least half of it should be actual females or trannies
the only thing you can go by is that there are actually 200 people but even then that could be a lie
  tfw chatting with the same /ic females in dms    votes are pretty accurate   sorry you dont qualify as a girl tranboy 
  maybe if you are talking about the entirety of the internet on /ic/ i would expect 80 guys or more
more boys that dont even draw than girls who actively engage and draw  im ashamed of you all
  the girlsboy are the real crabs here we all know there are no girls in 4chan
  i just dont feel like posting
  pretty much this lol  its not rocket science
  pretty much this      asianfag here
/ic has only 10 peop  250 peeps and growing     wtf i know popular artists are fucking lurking here speak up you shy bastards
  no
  no fuck off the last thing we need is for an influx of normies finding out their favorite naruto artist goes here and then well keep seeing their shitty animay doodles on the front page only to get butthurt when someone tells them to fuck off
  100  implying these are unique ips per person and not one from their mobile and another from their desktop
  thinking people are gonna take the time to inflate the ratio of wannabe porn artists on one of the slowest boards on a eastern culture/nazi idealogy forum   people wouldnt actually do that  wwould they
  eastern culture/nazi idealogy forum    o_0     made me look like dumb silly feminist   must be they are eastern nazis
  pic  good god
  half the population of /ic/ is lurkers  come out of your fucking shells you losers
you should have made the poll less tindry     be much more interesting to know specifics about the kind of art you do and/or medium you use and other stuff that actually matters fuck all these teeheehee im shy memes  digital  traditional  anime focus  experience by years  desired industry   desired audience  location by naeuocas etc    some shit like that there being a ton of lurkers isnt really news
  not the same poster but  its likely that there actually might be trans artists on this board at well
  spooky
  
this place would be a lot less dead if more of these lurkers participated
  kek maybe women really do like it when men shit on them i have no idea how they think
  women arent interested in art men are more interested in objects
  draw the absolute best thing im capable of drawing  lmao it sucks stop drawing kys
  be confident  e a s y
    never stop posting this is funniest shit when im around /ic/
  64 shy girls  ahhhh
    no
  how about heck no
for gods sake there are less people on here than on reddit and that makes me want to kill myself
  20 girls
  productive    talking
  not any of the previous posters in this thread and i dont dye my hair cause its already a standout color on its own but i am unironically a trans fem furry      the best running gag since and then she farts      water is wet  for real tho anyone worth their salt can identify most artists they know of pretty easily so unless youre posting something so far outside your comfort zone it renders your inherent style unrecognizable posting anonymously isnt really possible here if you want to actually get and/or give proper feedback and im sure you can piece together the rest of the reasons why most established artists probably dont wanna be associated with this place
has any of you in /ic/ have entered this strange state called flow or zone whilst working on a painting or a drawing   if so share your experiences
  yep when im oil painting outside i get this kind of mood goin its a great feeling    however i think skill is not the x axis here i got into that flow state years ago too when i was a much less skillful artist and i still feel apathetic every once in a while now     i think that bottom axis has to be something like mindset or mood of all things
im in anxiety mode all the time even when im not drawing
  i literally have to i constantly deal with large amounts of work with very little breaks its the only way to get everything done without buckling
  i think theres some interplay between mindset and skill its more like i feel capable of doing what i want to do
  yes  start working on painting at 8  its really fun  when did it become midnight  why do i have to sleep i want to keep working
  yeah mostly during past midnight where my critical thinking is nonexistant theres no annoying voice that insist i shoudnt be drawing right now  the downside is im always sleepdeprived and wake up late
anyone whilst listening to music or something you get really excited and feel like you able to do anything you want with the paint
  i think youre damn right man thats definitely an aspect   maybe all you need is some positive feedback from your drawing itself just knowing youre getting something good done
  where is i feel capable but am always anxious
  somewhere between arousal and anxiety
all the time but really only when programming never when drawing or painting its a shame
  shame those clouds werent finished though
  dont be a cunt mate
  i only get into flow state less than 5 times a year its always a magical experience but you can get into something similar but not nearly as amazing far more often if you simply work on something you like for a prolonged period of time without distraction
  i dont think so ive had flow with something that was definitely over my skill level but i simply didnt care at the time while i am usually super anxious
redesign tim and moby or draw them in your style
  oh my head god blast from the past where is this from again my head is spinning my childhood ahhhhhh
  its timmoby from brainpop  they did little science videos and such
  yeah i remember now they would play it in science class as a double explanation what the teacher said and the jokes were kinda funny i wonder how come this was scrubbed from my memories
  this is begging for porn
  gotchu senpai  found his online
  thats pretty nice man
  hhot
  i want to die   why fucking  fuck
    who wanna play tho  come on in and lets test our skills
nah thats gay
roast me bitches 
    very nice work

  no  fapping to kids drawings is wrong anyway
  use common sense are people so delusional that they genuinely think this is good enough its okay to be bad everyone is bad at some point but dont go into it assuming you arent bad otherwise you dont improve    op lets play a game can you name 5 things wrong with your own picture
  nothing being wrong with it could be something wrong to some people  cant figure out the other 4
  reported thread for trolling
fappable but id get harder to a blank sheet of paper
  is there a trademark on this persons dogs likeness
  anyone halfway decent is going to get some hate no matter what
  this is his cp art  this single picture
  nah as someone who knows knew tacklebox and is friends with a lotta the people who now hate him they hate him because he retweeted a drawing on main from someone who d his alt account where he drew a toddler aged furry with a dick bulge and had been retweeting similar art onto said alt account the thing where he referenced a character design from an actual dog is just those people not wanting to be associated with him now that hes known for drawing toddler furries in a sexual way
  honestly looks more like a midget/chibi/shortstack than a child
    man i bet its hard to run simultaneous accounts and keep them separate at some point youre going to slip if youre not extremely careful
yiff in hell
  and i care because
actually become a decent drawfag for the sole purpose of making my own doujins someday  a good doujin idea or scene pops up  draw out 5 pages realize how shit and cringy the writing is  become demotivated trash it all away  rinse and repeat  mfw
just like how you need to get deeper into artists and techniques to make it as an artist you need to read good books and learn writing techniques to git gud at writing just learning from say vidya and light novels would never cut it its not rocket science
  ive done the same but you get better keep at it anon and read the classics dont copy shitty manga
so im doing my fundies and i just noticed that loomis ribcage simplificaton seems to be wrong    it actually gets wider at the top yet a real ribcage should get thiner i know this is a manquin   butthis is supposed to be a simplified skeleton right so whats going
  loomiss simplified ribcage also has additional forms ontop of it specifically the pectoral muscles and the deltoid which serves as shoulderpads in his illustration to better help give you an idea of how to convey simplified forms
  thanks anon oh boy
  that is manikin form not a skeleton
  check mate loomis    back to anime studies now
beginners say the darndest things
  its not an actual rib cage as well as everything else its just the representations that suppose to help a beginner transcend from a stick figure to something more advanced     the idea is laudable but imo the realization is not really good i switched to hamptons book instead of loomis imo the former is a really strong educator
  fuck no i need my fundies to draw anime girls      but isnt the manequin a simplified skeleton
  you are overthinking it if you look closely at loomiss skeleton you clearly see the ribcage beng overlapped by the pecs
  but isnt the manequin a simplified skeleton  no
  because unless you are a drawing a skeleton you probly wont ever have a slim top theres so much going on in the top shoulder muscles the wings and so on
  no google a manequin and find out  no skeleton have a pectoralis and shit  anyway its just used to draw human you autist just draw it his way or pick another less dated book
  read the whole fucking book    holy shit people are this retarded huh
        thank you guys      except you you are fucking retarded
  r e t a r d     you will never make it if you post on i/c for help retard go back and draw
  youre welcome  thanks for killing a thread with your inane post where you jump to the conclusion that youve discovered something that a fucking master of drawing didnt because youre a special fucking snowflake next time post in the /beg/ thread and maybe do 
  loom        youre welcome and fuck off jackass im not going to post where you want asshol     it was a question i didnt say loomis was wrong you fucking retard
  how about you go and draw a middle finger instead of shitposting here instead    go back to drawing retard
  just remember that youre shit now and will likely always be shit thanks to your shit attitude and the way you jump to idiotic beginner conclusions thinking that youre special and different and not like all the other artists no youre gonna be the special one youll show everyone just gotta give it time dont worry we know it good luck   pic related you
    lol nice delusion jackass
  just remember that youre shit now and will likely always be shit thanks to your shit attitude and the way you jump to idiotic beginner conclusions thinking that youre special and different and not like all the other artists no youre gonna be the special one youll show everyone just gotta give it time dont worry we know it good luck   pic related you      nice delusion jackass i just asked a question  but your armchair pshychonanalisis made me laugh
  how many times are you gonna keep making these is loomis wrong bros threads
  its an idealized and heroic type figure which is why his shoulders are so broad and his waist so small
  shes cute thanks for the pic anon youre a good person
  it also probably takes into account the thick lats an ideal human figure would have
  read the whole fucking book  people are this retarded
  heroes are deformed  ngmi
do you need a powerful rig for digital painting i wouldnt have thought its as intensive as gaming
  ram    if youre doing 3d modeling it helps for sure      gaming comps/laptops are ideal for digital media
  mostly you just need ram
  some digital program use gpu but dont really need a powerful one  just buy some decent pc/lap with good ram and you are good to go
  as much ram as you can afford at least 16gb a nice ssd and a solid cpu is most preferable a gpu is rarely used for any 2d art
  how do i discern a nice ssd from a not nice one
  try mischief free trial version because its vector based i think it works fast even on a crappy computer you lose some functionality compared to other programs but overall you could use it and be fine digitally
you do when working with big resolutions for print have fun painting on a 15k px wide canvas on a potato
  pcie nvme ssdsnot sata would be the best if your motherboard supports itmost do nowadays but if youre cash strapped then a mlc ssdsata would do
   a gpu is rarely used for any 2d art  many of photoshop effects and tools use gpu acceleration
  at least 16gb  fucking seriously
  is that large a canvas really necessary for convention type prints i thought that type of canvas size was only necessary for billboards
  you can never have enough ram
  depends on the resolution and the number of layers what operation youre performing photoshit takes memory way too fast as well youll mostly want a mid end to a high end cpu and 8 gigs of memory at least
  treat yourself with a gtx 1080 ti trust me better yet get rtx 2080 ti you wont regret it mate
  rtx 2080 ti    a 1200 card to run photoshop
  he use a graphic card that is less than 1000 to painting
  thats way too much for art lmao    it will do just fine    that card is 5 years ahead of its time
  not at all you can draw even in something shitty as an amd apu prioritize ram if you want to work with high rez images
  nah photoshop runs fine on my 4gb gts 450 shitbox theres features that use graphics card but you can turn them off in your photoshop preferences also gives a boost to startup and usage if you turn it off
    you need a powerful processor for big brushes though especially complex ones like the mixer brush in ps or blending brushes of csp sure there are workarounds but it will give you less workflow options i agree though for strictly learning purposes you can get away with a low end pc
  that card is 5 years ahead of its time  more like five years late  and with a price thats five times its value
  dude 1080 ti is well ahead of the trend     fuck a gtx 1050 ti runs modern day games on high not to mention the gtx 1060 is exceptional
not really
  not at all i was working perfectly fine with and old amd phenom from 2010 with 8gb of ram i just upgrade cuz gaming and all that crap
  games dont grow in demand until the hardware to run them is available  the newest hardware is barely an upgrade from the previous generations now  the 400 and 500 lines of gtx cards were both released in 2010  the 600 line was released in 2012 the 700 line in 2013 and the 900 line in 2014  the 10 and 20 lines were released in 2016 and 2018 the last four years have seen two new lineups while the four before had five  and while the performance improvements have been roughly the same over time the prices and power usage of the new cards have skyrocketed  in fact pretty much the entire pc parts market is fucked right now i built a pc in 2014 and a couple months back i couldve sold my ram and gpu for double of what i paid for and the case i couldve sold at a 20x markup the only worthwhile advancements made in those four years are ryzen simply because of how intels performance keeps suffering when patching hardware vulnerabilities and usbc which i only list as asus wasnt allowed to sell the extension for my motherboard because of some legal bullshit  if youre smart youre not upgrading your pc now
  your shitpost radar is down fren
anyone with a high end processor use clip studio i am curious how much/little brush lag you experience with for instance a brush set to running color mode with high color stretch value at large brush sizes
    and lowest gap setting
  1050 or maybe 1050ti    6 or 8 gigs of system ram tho
need to make a college art portfolio  please give advice on how many pieces etc  feel free to suggest specific things you think i should draw too  pic is an old sketch i did
die
    finish some good drawings showing off a range of scenarios / interesting shapes some perspective stuff to show youre not disabled with a number of portraits and a couple full bodies and keep your fucking signature off of the piece you clud
you did archy dirty
  why not post some newer work so we can actually give you some advice old sketch doesnt really help
dong
  looks just like you
  thanks thats sweet of you 3
does anyone have a good collection of any kind of sfw reference pictures ive been drawing in coffee shops a lot recently and i dont really want to load up a bunch of pictures of dongs or honkers
believe it or not deviantart has a fantastic selection of sfw stocks
  ive been drawing in coffee shops a lot recently    why do people do this is it some kind of social signaling
  not op but i like the smell of coffee and cant drink it _ツ_/
  most things people do is signalling even secret stuff even anonymous stuff  its okay as long as long as they keep the pretentiousness levels low
    there could be signaling involved but sometimes its good to have a change of environment or some different stimulus sometimes ones environment at ones house/apartment/dorm is also not great for one reason or another
anime  manga art tutorial by a western artist who has never worked on an anime or a manga  why do these exists
money
why does how to draw manga or anime book have art that looks like shit compared to a majority of the anons here where can i learn it
i would put out a shit book if it made me money no shame as would anybody here
    he has sold millions of copies guy must be filthy rich and one of the most promiment producers of how to art books i think when he released his first how to draw manga book in the 90s or early 2000s it was a different time the process of creating manga/anime was still a bit mysterious to the general public and people saw him as the gook whisperer or something
    would be funny if /ic/ collectively released such a thing
    hart hires people to do the art for them the people he hires to draw are 90 better than this board
  jesus fuck christopher hart is still at this  my sister had some of his books years and years ago curious i scrolled through them found the artist credits and realized that christophers art was the worst in the book
  its cheaper and easier for publishing companies to exploit teens to make these then get the licence and translation done from an actual professional honestly do kids even read these though even growing up it came off as one of those things just made to trick your well meaning but not fully understanding older relatives
  i wouldnt be able to live with myself if my book was really shit that said chris harts stuff doesnt seem that bad just mediocre
  this    my mom was still buying me how to art books from thrift stores while i was in art school
chris drew his waifu recently    
  because average nip artist suck at english   and in general nip also pretty bad at english
  fat coach who has never been world champion before dares to train an olympian
  what is the false analogy fallacy
  what is fallacy fallacy
back before anime hit mainstream they collected money from weebs with garbage low quality art tutorial books
im gonna go find some at libgen im feeling nostalgic
  guy aint even that bad like some anon already said its just really average but the books heart is in the right place in that it doesnt promise to turn you into the bestest animu girl artist overnight it merely gives you the tools to get started and a bit of a confidence boost so you can output work you enjoy drawing in a consistentish manner    the art could be a fair bit worse and the book would still be good in that sense
  good gracious youd think after 2030 years of this there would be some improvement but he draws like every 10 year old weeb
  what is the fallacy fallacy fallacy
  it always acts as a confidenceboost to me seeing this guy
  right away  well this dude kind of made it life sucks
    post your work
  his work is unironically more mangalike than half the peoples work on /ic/  including me
  i dont think its much of a stretch to say he only draws something whenever he needs to release another shitty book      not those anons but i agree with them
  fucking weebs characters lookin like voldemort with their missing noses     did you just forget to draw it or are you just too lazy what the fuck is up with weebs not drawing noses
  did you mean to reply to this 
  yeah got the feel of oldschool manga which is different from mainstream animu style these day
  imagine being a hack fraud who deceived millions
anyone paint with oils i just watched a video on how to achieve almost any color by mixing white brown blue red and yellow im wondering if the mixing process is precise enough that it could be automated for example an app where you input how much surface area you want to cover and what color could enter the hex value and the app returns to you the weights of the colors to mix i guess the boiled down question is  if i mix the same precise weight of some colors multiple times will they always produce the exact same color/value
  there are apps i think for this purpose the problem is that every paint manufacturer uses different fillers thinners extenders mediums pigment amounts and more no two paint brands will mix the same and even then two tubes of the same paint might have slightly different characteristics due to the manufacturing process paint mixing really is just about practice until it becomes intuitive muscle memory you feel what needs to be mixed if you really want a more scientific method to painting check out the munsell system    t also learned mixing from carder
david briggs probably got a heart attack if he ever saw that video mark carder approach isnt bad but it nowhere gives you almost any color specially if you are as autistic as briggs when it comes to color mixing    spoiler alert the gamma of colors reproducible with pigments is somewhat restricted and there is a lot of variation    check the program color2drop its the preferred program by briggs it does exactly what you want except the volume but i remember the other autist bruce macevoy had a program to calculate that    if you ask me ill stick to carder approach if you really want to get autistic about color mixing read david briggs site a few times until you either turn autistic with color or accept that you need to keep science a little far from you artistic practices if you plan making art be somewhat fun
  got into the carder approach last year    took a painting classe in college that basically amounted to mushing around paint on a board and treating color and paint as if it was secret voodoo magic    what exactly are you trying to do estimate materials for covering a big canvas    if your objective is to have precise color in your own paintings then train your eye weighing tiny gram weights of paint on an ultra precise scale is just sheer autism paint will vary like this anon says       and you also wont account for how lighting conditions alter the color of objects
im really interested in knowing how the art of u guys compares to ur age     ill start  18
19

why are teens so age obsessed either youre good or youre not
  its to see how you hold up to against people from different ages
  thats pretty immature anon people start at all different times in their life and its not like age really plays that much of a factor in how good you are
  thats good stuff anon
23    great job with the expression
18
  stop stealing work you fag
    thanks its a wip
  look at the first post on her tumblr you absolute mong
22

23
  have you ever finished a drawing
  no 2018  ive literally seen this picture a year ago  that file name    are you browsing the archives and just stealing peoples work
  its rare but it happens i lose steam after the idea i had in my head gets conveyed and rendering only feels worth it on the focal points
i am in my early forties
inb4 underage
  lol same file name from the nazi retard
  this is all i have saved on my phone    i posted one of the drawings but im not the guy whos been spamming threads
  bro you havent made any new art in 18 months what are you doing
  who is she
  ive drawn a lot of stuff i just havent added it
  comfy stuff fellow boomer
  aside from joel jurion do you have any other artistic inspiration ive always been a fan good stuff anon
  fellow boomer  thats an incorrect classification mme
26  i never draw
    looks great anon    you probably used to draw a lot i assume
  thank you anon  only traditional media i was too poor for a pc growing up and tablets werent a thing trying to learn that now is making me consider taking a dull bullet instead 
  25
  thanks i love anything mike mignola touched sean gordon murphy kim jung gi james harron winsor mccay sergio toppi koki jeffr poju theres a ton more i cant remember off the top of my head
27    i think age factors in very little with abilities    everybody learns at a different inevitable pace ive seen people with talent at a young age and people with no talent catch up and exceed beyond    cool threadi like this idea
   21
   here
everyone so young and so great already  fuck you fuck you all
   but ive been drawing forever anon if im not at least decent by my 20s somethings up
  you got a custom brush set anon or you using default chalk
  you still have objectively far more time ahead of you than me fuck i think i should stop coming to this site i feel like a friggin mummy at this point
  tracer boi you came back  no dignity
  prove he traces stop making baseless claims
    watch what happens when youre in your 30s    im 36 and i know for a fact i should kill myself this thread proves it    which is fine no one comes to 4chan without looking for someone somehow telling them to kill themselves
  what happens in your 30s
  you lose your ligameme and brain plasticity
  you suddenly realize the best part of your life is long gone and everything will only go to shit from there your health will go worse your general appreciation for new things will wane you will get more and more detached from the world around you the world expectations for you star to mount to levels you never experienced before you start to feel bad for not doing the things you should have done were you the wiser 10 years earlier the days seem to pass by faster and faster people you know also grow older and uglier some even die your start loose your parents and relatives due to death and generally you just come to realize you have no future the next generation will outcompete you for both consumer tastes and ability you have nothing to look forward to and you are helpless to do anything about it    believe me anon age is a cruel cruel reality
  just use reference assuming youve built up enough memory in your fingers to draw or paint
  assuming youve built up enough memory in your figures to draw or paint   i just told you i lost my ligameme
  you sound depressed anon    life isnt that bad just excersise and eat healthy it helps curb mental stigma 30s is nothing    unless you got early diagnosis of dimentia you can still get good just use reference and do it everyday    look at james gurney that dude is old and is incredible he is very healthy and lives a balanced life style
  stop bullying me
i think i was 33 or 34 when i painted it
  you used the warp tool your tracing skills are advancing congrats
      used a filter
  i use the shale brush setting in procreate
  what a great comeback stop being an insecure crab i wish you all the best on your own art journey      this doesnt really make sense but i did colour pick a lot of it its a weakness that im trying to work on and have cut down by quite a bit
    doesnt make sense    anon do u not know how to use filters in photoshop    assuming u used ps
  i said it doesnt make sense to think that because thats not typically how filters work/look after applying one nor would it change the placement of the features/shapes/etc i thought they assumed i used a filter because of the general colour accuracy
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh goddammit im so lonely and horny be my gf be my gf be my gf
  based
    this is a filter i used palette brush its not exactly the same but its fairly close
i turn 30 next month is it too late to start on art
  did you paint when you were a child
  nope    start sketching still life just doodle house hold objects
  take people calling you a tracer as a compliment you obviously arent one
  but im already tracer
  yeah but i was never any especially good at it   i suppose some of my clay and paper sculptures were pretty good for a little kid  when i look back at the drawn art its all autismal spaghetti because i wanted to express continuing action with no sense of frames/panels at that time each image was one actor so id just keep erasing and drawing on them   other than a little bit of room painting and dying to make my house more interesting i havent done any art since
18
25
  ill go out with anyone who can draw well
  yeah but are you a female or a male pretending to be female
26

26
                                          to make things more interesting how long have you been drawing
  im the first one down from the op  about 4 years now
22  i should be better for my age
    ive been drawing for 4 years but ive only seriously grinded like 3 hours a day for the past year or so
24
  16  see you later bucko  spoilernice art/spoiler
  16
  it is the nazi spamposter just ignore him everyone he is here to bait you        this means you too
20
   here  tbh i cant recall a time when i didnt like to draw i got a bit more serious before i applied to art college but at the time i already had some sort of skill used to draw from photos a lot when i was 1416 results were cringe material but still  pic related something i drew at 17 yrs old when preparing for college entry exams
  hey i remember the frogy from /alt/ you added more animals cuteeeeee
  have you posted before your stuff looks familiar also blog
  i used to post kinda frequently no blog tho soz
    huh i assumed you were vetyr
18 been at it for 2 years  has anyone here gone through a rigorous nonart related degree such as medicine starting to care more about art and i am worried if i can still achieve my goal skill level given limited time per day      i really hope this is true
24 started when i was 22 struggling with perspective currently as you can see
  forgot about mandatory school art classes so 4 years
  many artists dont get artrelated degrees im studying cs atm its not as rigorous as a doc school but you have to give up some drawing time thats for sure
  in surprised no ones talked about this piece yet its pretty cool you got a blog
  21 im tumblr style shite cant draw realism for the life of me    but im not too butthurt since in my case its only a hobby used to relieve stress
   dont be sad old man if you do things right youll be good within the year
  i drew the fish since i was three but i started more seriously around nine i wanted to be an animator or at least an artist for disney but that all changed
  thats a relief i do want to keep my art as something i can do out of enjoyment alone  maybe it can work out since ive been drawing for 12 hours a day now and am still seeing progress  thank you for reminding me about cs as an option despite my absence of programming background
  what  said thats depression i feel like that at age 24 everything about being alive including drawing just feels like work this better not get any worse in my 30s
  do some life drawing i find that pretty relaxing as long as i dont get too frustrated your tumbler shite will improve amazingly fast
20
22 dont draw often or as much as i should also internet addiction/depression fucking sucks
    26 4 years
  i did a bs and am working on a phd in molecular biology i gave up drawing for the duration of undergrad picked it up again later in grad school i think my skill goals have definitely been delayed as a result
19
      sorry folks but   hits home hard  30s reporting in
  oops thats not the finished version
  im in my late 20s and still learning getting better    how much drinking do you do also smoking weed and drugs fucks up your brain    i dont believe that you lose ability to learn as you age you might have to work harder but you dont just turn into a retarded veggie that stops learning
  i do not smoke or drink booze fuck that shit you think i am a hippie or something
21
16
  how bad is it bro im guessing its pretty shite lul
  enjoy your ban
    2 years
  i was more referring to your age but you should work on trying not to symbol draw and make cleaner lines see you in 2 years
  its bad but youre only 16 if you practice enough youll be good in a couple of years read some books    also 
16
  
  there is hardly a difference between 16 and 18 through
17
hello boys im 20 how yall doing i just got into digital art 2 days ago whats poppin
      reported have fun explaining this to your parents
    nice love the minimalistic look blog
    yeah its really good
18 board  its a trap
  18 site actually
  could u elaborate
21 time spent on drawing really depends typically i sit 47 hours a day on one drawing for 14 days if it is smth fully rendered though if i spend more time week or more on only one piece i burn out and just abandon it another thing is if i draw without goal in mind then it can be from 30 minutes to whole day
  since i was born my father is an outstanding artist so i grew up with it 2bqh
    ha im 26 and ive been drawing since i was about 11 drew obsessively through middle school got more passionate about it during high school guess i was around 16 ive just always been drawing so 1017 years i guess
  op here since i was 4 i think had a break from 14 till 16 which made me feel behind on my peers but now adays i draw everyday
  this year sucked    drew like crazy but aimlessly in middle school because there was a legit prodigy there went easy in highschool and then got serious in college after i found this place
i got serious around 16 im 19     i hung around the art kids so i always felt developmentally stunted lol this is just a drawing i had up im only gradually working my way into digital and i dont have a lot of my artwork on my computer i can show my traditional work if anyone is interested
  im surprised that you picked up art again during the most extreme part of your education does that mean your phd has also significantly delayed your progression not just your break
    only 7 years to reach goodhood    how can i slow down this
  faster  faster
  only one person is good in here
  like who
tweenie
    
did this like a week ago just to fuck around lol  the first time ive done a background  18  been drawing since i was a kid but took it more seriously at my 14 years
    im worse than everyone in the thread
  thanks here it is 
  fuck nile youre 20 already
16 here
  whats your social media
27 ive got a terrible relationship with art
  whats your social media
  ye dude were getting up there
  19
  why are you drawing kendra lust for practice
  you havent improved the past two years
21
  ye tru oughta try harder
7yo im 18 currently no ban  sry i know this thread is supposed to be about arts made currently but due to an extreme lack of time i didnt do anything but sketches in the last few years  i did it in about 30/40 mins in an art class this isnt supposed to be pretty it was a portrait of a classmate and she was kinda ulgy so the drawing being that ugly is not an error
  its a selfportrait
23
  this isnt supposed to be pretty it was a portrait of a classmate and she was kinda ulgy so the drawing being that ugly is not an error    anon stop crabbing yourself
  this isnt supposed to be pretty it was a portrait of a classmate and she was kinda ulgy so the drawing being that ugly is not an error    when youre so bad at something and still find ways to blame others yikes
  so the drawing being that ugly is not an error  im pretty sure thats an error6 also  namefag  out of all the names to chose why that one
  nude selfportrait or gtfo
22
  i love you so much  you drew these other yume nikki drawings too right tfw same age
  yep thank you anon i love u more 2b honest  i just find that stuff really interesting to draw
  your art is actually the first ive saved directly to a /art/series name folder in all the years ive browsed and posted here thats how much i like it i love your choice of colors and the simplicity of it you really capture the atmosphere of the game   what program do you use do you have a pixiv account so i can follow you
20
  wow anon that is very very flattering makes me really happy that you like it that much seriously    i use photoshop because i like the interface to give you some extra insight i use pencil brush shading is usually done in a color burn layer and when i do highlights or lighting i use overlay    my username on pixiv is pantsu_ripper i update it periodically if you want to see more frequent uploads you can find me here too  
          gaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyy
19
18    ive overworked myself very early on to the point shit has taken a toll on me i dont mind slow improvement now
  i think your style is very interesting but you should try and focus things more unless this is a wip in which case its really good so far like the cats face looks really nice but everything else is too undefined
        ah young love such a magnificent sight to behold truly i wish you lads the best
  this is a very promising image anon have you ever tried working w/o opacity your understanding of light  form are already pretty decent but its very hard to maintain nice edges when the brush is ghosting everywhere try making shapes and then painting into them    overworked myself very early on to the point shit has taken a toll on me   i did that too and suffered because of it for a long time gitting gud doesnt mean as much if you kill yourself in the process
  thats nice man your colors are too monochrome though makes it look cartoony try expanding your range of color leaves are not just green the sky is not just one hue of blue etc
  i messaged him/her on pixiv but he didnt respond only followed me back feels bad man
  i dont know how to read messages i just messaged you back but i dont see yours uwu
  i dont see a message from you either usually itll notify you at the bell and message icons if you get a message thats so weird  tfw you get frenblocked by pixiv
  this is only person in the entire thread with skills on par with mine  tfw 23
  aw _
21    been drawing seriously for 3 years and casually for who knows how long
        tfw you will never have a genuine human connection like these 2 anons
31   heres something from figure drawing a few hours ago
18     been drawing for 6ish years but i wasted a lot of time animu as a kid long hiatuses using tumblr art memes etc and have only taken it seriously for the past 2 years
                          finish your work and post again i cant tell shit about your skills from those scraps alone
  elaborate how its this brush
  hey i really like this anon
  do you have a link to that akko pic
  hahahahahahah enjoy your ban    using soft brush  shitty eye   wtf is that background  no facial structure     yep i know my shit ive been trying to practice more and more mixing programming and drawing is a very bad idea took me an hour to draw that  i used paint tool sai for that but now im gonna stick to photoshop  what are the things that i should learn to become a good artist what should i learn aside from loomis
27
    thanks lads i am not sure if i would consider that finished though i somewhat fucked off and refrained from continuing working on it    who knows i am currently trying to find a technique and workflow that suits me the best havent tried the brush without opacity thing yet
  tnx
  for some reason i thought your post had this image attached to it   seemed more fitting to me
  well post something finished then i would love to see
  youre also shit buddy youre ngmi   shitty coloring skills  crappy rendering  can barely draw the upper half of the body  good luck posting in /beg for the rest of your life
  thanks man im trying to finish it but its going so fuckin slowly    this is the update of the work since then about 24 hours ago slooooow
  some things are ok just as sketches stop being a little bitch post your work
  you start to feel bad for not doing the things you should have done were you the wiser 10 years earlier  like what
  probably not what you were hoping for
  fapping to overwatch porn
  a pleasant surprise
  27    lol ur old
  based off this particular picture i think you should consider using more values everything is mostly the same saturation and id like to see more variance there also please note that the arms are too thin otherwise i like the vibe and the color choices that you were goimg for here
  begone zygotes
  not what i was hoping for but its a surprise
  this is fine
  shit excuse  if it was a brief exercise you wouldnt spend that much time on detailing the bows and shirt straps instead youd be laying down the proportions and work on making the facial features look like they belong there   youre just shit whether your ref is ugly or not     i swear im being baited
21
old as hell 29 doodling casually since i was maybe 11 but quit around 16yrs old recently picked it up some months ago and am trying to improve recently discovered this board lotta great art you guys got goin on its insane

  cool i like this style do you have more anon
  nice
  for a school project
1624 year olds mostly lack selfcontrol and discipline they have little to no experience in learning and the exceptions to this are the ones who were going to be a competing factor anyways    want to be happy and feel a purpose in your life get a job challenges you but doesnt leave you exhausted find a partner and immediately attend couples therapy and learn communication raise children find 23 hobbies one of these can be art now you have a lot of legs for your life to stand on    working as a freelance artist / with art teaching 28 it sure is great but i lost 7 years of my life broke off a 6 year relationship with a girlfriend and earned very little money indeed while doing it grabbed a ba degree in 3d  id post art but as im interviewing for studios and sending out portfolios i need to stay under the /ic/ radar love you d/ic/ks
  can you post some stuff that isnt gonna be in your professional career
  0nryotumblrcom  thank you for asking anon

kek
  its a portrait of my mom 
  hello harry
  im 31 and i dont believe for a second youre 36
  no mang its fine im just busting your chops your moms pretty she just looks like rule 63 of harry potter is all
  tnx anon 
can we talk about the multitude of subdisciplines within the main discipline of art i see so many beginners here who just want to get good but seemingly have no idea what that entails not only is there technical and mechanical skill involved various tools their mediums and techniques but mental skill as well theory design     drawing  value placement  line weight  color mixing  rendering    perspective  color  construction  anatomy  value  edge control  composition  exaggeration  am i missing anything
fuck no that would require far too much nuance that this place just does not allow for
  am i missing anything  loomis
  shape design theory
  that falls under construction and composition
  shape design is more fundamental than composition composition is just shape design within a frame
  define construction and composition shape design doesnt fall into those categories for the definition i know  heres a better explanation of what im talking about    
why cant artists move to actual art websites instead of posting their art on social medias that arent built to work as galleries knowing that it makes harder to organize everything and that it might even shit in the quality of the image and auto preview like twitter does hell even instagram is shit for art
  path of least resistance  herd mentality whats better having your portfolio nice and neat on a literally who website or just throwing shit up on twitter with the potential of reaching millions of people and just reuploading old work every now and again to remind people it exists
because it gets them the most followers
viewership
  first of all they do da hentai foundry newgrounds etc    second off social media is primarily a suppliment for exposure and communication with your audience we know these sites arent designed to be galleries well tumblr used to be a good gallery but social media is viral and huge and most art websites are not
  you need normies to throw shekels at you so twitter is it
  no one cares about img quality unless they pay for it fact     art websites  for what purpose sucking each others dicks off  are you a teenager or a professional online artists are door to door salesmen salesmen dont try to sell to other salesmen cause they also have something to sell    instead you want a place where you are surrounded by dumb non artists who require your skills this is how a market works    twitter is the biggest active platform right now regarding content its the onlu viable choice
  art sites only have other artists on them all sorts of people use social media  if you want to build up an audience you post on social media
  because they want people to actually see the art
so i had an epitome moment just recently     be me   black   go onto beginner thread   takes time to read the how to draw with your fucking eyes and not with your brainjpg   realizes you know most of my references pictures and study material is on the internet  does it  everything start to make more sense    what ive realized is when you think about it being upside down is the right side of the world no analytical words and expressions can be viewed in this and make clear sense of it without have to slow your brain down and focus what i mean is comprehensive speed we attained through our daily lives    think about it this way youre reading this right now you can clearly understand it meaning your screen is right side up    but once you flip it and its upside down you would actually have to focus a lot harder inorder to comprehend the thing you see same concept applies to pictures/ images being upside down    its like when you look at an image right side up you are trying to read it and not view it for what it is    but when the picture is upside down you are actually looking at it on a more visual scale not just shapes structure and form becomes more clear alightment with pesky edges / relationships becomes more clear also viewing the image for what it really is becomes more clear    tldr basically if you want faster art gains flip your view on your pc to landscape flipped and jump into a new world    ive had the hardest time wanting to actually post thing on shit when viewing stuff upside down psychologically its like my mind was telling no this world doesnt need that it can only seen things in images alone no words  no logical thinking
  good job anon  im happy for you
reading it  i feel like im the only one who bothered to try the damn exercise wasted on me since unifag tho but when i fail out and have all the time in the world to draw just you wait
  how to draw with your fucking eyes and not with your brain  you know thats a meme right the one who wrote that draws like a /beg/
    sometimes people cant separate what they see from what they think they see this exercise gets rid of all attempts at symbol drawing
  yeah but i have no doubt you suck at drawing too yet here you are giving advice if you cant draw whats in front of you tell me how are you going to draw it from imagination
   its just meme    its actually true based on the book drawing on the right side of the brain by  betty edwards a book that i read and own btw
  our eyes see the world upside down to allow for depth perception and our brain flips the image get fucked nignog
  how do we know the worldis truely upside down or right side up right now i dont want to even reply to this cause all these words upside down are so ugly all i want to do is look at image eveything is jibberish i bet if you had your monitor flipped you wouldnt even take the time to comment  go fuck your sister filth
  well she is right but the book is shit its like she took good thinks and buried them in shit so that you need to wade through it to get to them if you leave only really relevant parts you could probably cut book like 57 times in page number
  true but i ike the fact she broke drawing down toa pyschological did i spell that right level  boy i think if i keep my shit flipped id be good at recognizing images but terrible at words and knowing left from right lol
  so i had an epitome moment just recently  you mean an epiphany
    i dont get it why was this a detail worthy of sharing
  i think op was being self deprecating and implying that it took him so long to figure out that he could practice in this way because black people arent very bright ops opinion not my own  cant imagine what else he might have meant by it    snibbity snab
   be me   black  hey me too
  i meant to say me too now leave my board but i accidentally pressed enter kys
  basically op is an uncle tom or not actually black
can we get a reference thread going
  reference thread  ops picture    gee thanks
everyone here deliberately sabotages themselves and everyone around them you all act like raging inflamed cunts who are on the rag 24/7    every other board has bantz people have a back and forth and try to troll one another and have fun ic is fucking humorless i honestly think you all come here just to play rushambu
  insecurity about skill  frustration because growth is slow
  read the majority of the threads especially the ones were people ask same stupid shit over and over and youll understand why
rushambu
  this happens on literally every internet forum ever  is right learning a craft is hell and this is a good place to sling shit to other faceless anons without anyones feelings getting hurt we all know what we signed up for
  you can have a learning environment without slinging shit at each other for the sake of slinging shit
the vast majority of other boards arent almost entirely about honing a personal skill
  but its fun to sling shit at each others throat
  not anonymously you cant
  just ignore them op  thats what i do  i did a thread about 2 months ago and i had a guy stalking me in that thread that would just try his best to discourage me  i mean he tried every angle to mind fuck me into quitting   he spoke with authority and pronounced one judgement on every image of my work i posted  the judgementdoom    turns out hes a first year art studentlol  even if he was a fucking professional in his 70s with shit in museums i would have had the same attitude  he could and still go fuck himself    you can buy tutorials college classes tools whatever but you cant buy drawing skill  you can only gain it from doing it in an intelligent manner  no one can prevent anyone from that  that fuck will graduate with tens of thousands of dollars  if not 10000000 in debt  how you gonna be able to have time make art with that kinda debt to service hanging over your head  paying your bills become top priority at that point art takes a backseat  dude was just pissed because he saw people on here doing stuff and learning for the cost of the materials whereas he was paying out the ass and trading his future to learn the same thing    so forget what people say on this board unless its constructive critiques    they dont matter
everyone here deliberately sabotages themselves and everyone around them  ignoring the dumbass op and his retarded post he actually touches an interesting subject   i agree that crab meme is indeed real but the cause for it is not angst or jealousy like he thinks but nativity and incompetence   most people are just simply too dumb to give proper advice or criticism they just dont know any better
what is rushambu
  niggers
  so  i honestly think you all come here just to play niggers  
  niggers
  its a game where you kick each other in the balls until one of you falls over or quits
  oh okay
my rendering looks a loy like the left of the pic   how do i get that soft airbrush look on that right
  reference
  use an actual airbrush and soften the forms the one on the left has no airbrush at all and is muddy as hell
  ctrlpaint will show you     hes not using an airbrush its a hard brush and blending
  hes not using an airbrush its a hard brush and blending    how would you know do you have a vid
  how would you know  anyone who actually knows what they are talking about knows that the image on the right was made using a hard round brush    airbrush would only give you shitty rendering like the one on the left
work more cleanly and methodically control your brush opacity better
  wtf does blending mean anon
  is not much about airbrushing but the fact that your values are all over the place vs the well organized chad on the right
  how do i get that soft airbrush look on that right  airbrush with lasso
    as for why the right reads and the left does not its not fundamentally a question about rendering as much as having a solid value structure with a clear separation of light and shadow vs no structure and no understanding you cant render your way out of missing fundamentals making this about rendering is putting the cart before the horse     as for purely the rendering aspect the brainlets cult like fixation with the hard round is retarded it clearly uses some form of textured bristle like brush with strokes along the form look at the cape closely but yes you can convey a sense of light with anything that leaves a mark hard round is a good go to brush  btw it doesnt matter if you start with hard edges or soft ghosted airbrush marks or something in between i have seen great digital painters do both anything can work as long as you have a value structure in mind and dont randomly scribble stuff to render
  you never used a aibrush properly anon dont assume things please
  first of all you can do this with a hard round brush in photoshop    i know who you are make sure you control the range of your values and have accurate lighting across your whole composition tackle that problem first with hard edges and then when you have grasped that go to manipulating edge transitions from hard to softer ones            these two anons are right listen to them
  imo you should first fix your anatomy and proportion your pose look kinda stiff and awkward
  i like the one on the left there is better value range and more detail you can also see some ideas of how you can take the drawing further with photos the one on the right looks like a quick paintover on 3d model kind of boring
  kek
  you can see the strokes just set pressure to opacity and color pick between values several times as you progress across the form to get smooth gradients like that with a hard brush
  how would you know  you just know  epic advice
  you have objectively shit taste
  only hard round to render like the right  only hard round  clearly has texture in it  come on dude you can at least mention the brush specifics if op is looking to recreate it      anon  i mean the left pushes values into a darker range if thats what you think but almost all the rendering is muddy and unrealized
  hey anon you literally know shit and are probably not an artist if you unironically believe that the one one the left was made using a softbrush it has very opaque strokes and features almost no blending whatsoever the point of that drawing is a showcase of bad values and bad brush technique the fix from the teacher is one the right and ofc uses a hard brush for shapes and rendering and a softbrush for blending and soft edges a third brush with subtle texture for the cape and broom to imply material    these two anons are right listen to them  fuck no also never trust some guy who tells you to listen to some other anons vague inexperienced answers
  the left was made using a airbru  blam  pow  fucking retard
  stop intentionally giving people wrong advice you troll beginners might listen and actually think youre supposed to use hard round for everything like a retard    this post actually upset me desu
  there is a tendency to underestimate what can be achieved with a hard round brush in conjunction with erasing opacity control hatching stippling limited values and a general good drawing base anything you learn with a hard round brush can be applied to special brushes textures and effects    i see a lot of paintover corrections here that do nothing more than make the original blurry it may look good at first glance but its not better its effectively making the image smaller and not different from taking an inked drawing back to a sketching phase again not trying to talk you out of using every tool at your disposal but its something to be mindful of when assessing your own progress
itt brainlets think they know anything about rendering and lighting     if you havent even render a single thing with decent quality then dont spout ur shitty opinions
  this rendering is pretty amazing except the 5th picture is a bit too deformed to look good
  anime  amazing  choose one
  huuur anime bad   post your work faggot i bet you cant even draw it without making it look da tier its just realism but stylized at some points
  absolutely this of course
  yikes
ic my friends  is my art realy sucks or it just me  its been 2 years of painting almost every dayno lifelike i had one when i started doing it but now i have a good exiuse to dont have one  i dont posti my images im holding them in my ass facebook album  even if i post anything it just goes in to the deeps with no reaction    so i know only one opinion of my art my opinion and i know that its biased af  when ask my friends and family they always saying thsts is goodamazing etcthey never said whats wrong with iti could belive them but they been saying that 2 yeras ago when i know i beed sucking in it    so im confiused ic  any advice   image related i took one that i think is good
thats one of my artworks that i did on the begining
recent one
  you have good colours decent composition but you seem to be scared of defined lines your owl looks great in a thumbnail but after enlargement it kind of falls into parts due to very rough brush work
  your colors are great what this anon  said  if you want to draw humans you may want to look more into anatomy also
  the first one is really charming something that would get 5k likes on insta you probably hate hearing that but its a style that normies would really adore and follow you for    the recent one looks decent as a thumbnail but falls apart when zoomed in even halfway there is nothing interesting going on its all blurred and soft it has no form or substance no edgework no fancy brushwork that would intrigue the viewer
your sense of colours is good
i like em a little bit of overpaint may help keep it up
draw entire image in greyscale  draw entire image again in full colour over top of greyscale  wips of random blotches of color to prove ur not a hack    yfw been doing art wrong this entire time
grids  holy mother of cringe
  google photo  magic select the dead guys silhouette  add filter  make greyscale layer  put on top of color layer  erase random patches of greyscale for wip  erase everything for finished piece  kill yourself afterwards because youre not gonna make it    what did they mean by this
  instagram likes dont get you a job
  oh i forgot  sign it  be a woman
  all the old masters n the renaissance did this too nothing new
  why doesnt the terribly done traditional drawing match up with the digital drawing and why is this supposed to be impressive reminds me of the photorealism speedpaint craze of youtube
i forgot to mention that shes selling prints too why is this so funny to me
  its filters and shes a hack    she must be desperate for quick money and attention gotta convert all your orbiter twitter followers into revenue somehow why not be an artist ah the life of the modern woman
looking through here art it just seems like she traces digitally and color picks
  its filters on lassoed photos you dumbass
  why do they type like a child
  this was her art a year ago it just seems like she got better at tracing and color picking anon i could pretty much see brushstrokes in ops picture too
  its the fucking painting filter you fucking moron
  this reminds of my favorite fraudster artalicemarie i cant believe shes still getting commissions for selling print outs and passing them off as drawings 
who gives a shit
  god damn im getting the double digits so much today god is on my side
  why did i have to be born a man
  actually when you look at it you can see she left behind parts of the original photo its very apparent in the sweater she didnt paint over it completely she is likely putting a very opaque filter over the photo then just painting over it kinda like that araki guy just ask her to make a stream with an empty canvas real time and have her do a complete painting shes allowed to reference but she must show her whole screen try making the rules even more fullproof so she doesnt try doing anything sketchy like hiding her sketch in the stream by blocking out a certain colour
she forgot an ear
  no one would care
  she must be one charming individual if shes able to pull this off i kinda feel bad for her because you know this this is going to backfire hard on her at some point
  she got 100k likes on one of her drawings im sure you can stir up some controversy/make money from it just look at the holly brown situation they got like 200k views from calling her out on tracing when her channel was basically dead also i would like to correct myself and just say his name was not araki but irakli nadar
  people do this a lot though especially with the hair adding some random strands or details and stuff but the face is obviously a direct overpaint or a filter adding genuine brushstrokes to make a more convincing image and shit like that
  i dont ever get shit like this if its so close to the real picture that you have to prove its not then whats the point even wheres the artistic choices
  who the fuck just noodles on random patches of color as their rendering process thats what gives this away as a fake
  you deserve to be scammed if you think that this is a real drawing
  i dont get it  are they photoshoping or
  op is an obvious fake but im pretty sure  is real you can see the shine from the graphite and that sketch isnt unachievable for a professional artist
  shine where there are other people that print out photos and draw and shade directly on top to give the feeling of realness this technique runs rampant on instagram when it comes to photorealistic art
  this
        theres a video on her instagram where she sketches a big cats eye on paper either she drew it or its a vignetted photo printed on the drawing paper you can see some shine from the graphite around certain parts could be drawn on top
whats the point of painting and drawing if color photography exists    really makes you think
  old masters had colored photos and photoshop and internet
  its hard to type on a phone so it makes sense to abbreviate words
            99 sure her shit is real she has legit exhibitions and you cant fake that    what kind of an autist you have to be to spend so much time churning out this uninspired crap i will never understand
  it is literally a rent a space not a proper established bm gallery ffs  
  true artists work this way  spend hours on a greyscale all wips are only coloring over already finished greyscale
  17m followers  5001k likes per photo  what a fucking joke
  yes
  yah
  you mean 17k lmao
women should be sent to death camps desu its the real final solution
  all social media work like that dumb shit
  the giveaway here is the grill examine the colour channels individually in photoshop and compare that to the rest of the image also only part of the picture with jpg artefacts
  id like to beileve this to be true
  someone compare it to the original i would do it but i have no computer atm
  dat wip  couldnt make it more obvious that this is fake fucking kek
  but this is what normies want to believe the art process looks like and its less that the artist is trying to trick normies as much as she is a normie herself and this was her best attempt at showing what the artistic process looks like    normies tricking normies
  what is prediction/auto correct
  based
  ok so what if they line up i could get that kind of accuracy if i used a grid same thing with  and  you guys are so jealous that your messing with real artists and slandering their names does /ic stand for incel or something
does anyone else believe that its basically both real and fake   as in i think that she just went in and traced a photo in photoshop like really painstakingly and copied the colours 1/1 etectera   lts not imo a filter but theres no real craftsmanship in there i also hate all these faggot musicians she does art of
  no i doubt that very much especially the second one theres not a grid being employed here i think its more like  samefagging so i dont have to write twice  if theres no proper wip i smell bullship
  it really isnt even a trace its two filters pasted on top of one another look at the big fuckoff brush she used in her proof
  this she literally has patches of color in the wip that are the same stroke and different colors like her scribbles are magically color matching the finished piece she isnt doing it in layers just raw dog faking it
    so youre saying its just filters i suppose now that i think about it the black and white drawing looks like graphite but it wasnt supposedly done in graphite so it doesnt really make sense that it looks like graphite does if you get my meaning but still can you prove it to be undoubtedly true cause if so lets expose it to twitter or whatever
go on her instagram looks like she heavily grids and colour picks/paints each individual square
  i legit said her arts not fake what the fuck are you talking about  im criticizing photorealist copymachine artists in general anyone that actually admires what they do is unenlightened change my mind
  essentially correct    she has a twitch with older videos with like no views i figure that if theres any fuckery to be found itll be found here shes not very good at drawing but uses tiny ass grids and as you can see on the left has the photo of the same size right next to the drawing on the same grid as she copies each square i think it could also be that she merges the photo and lowers the opacity of the drawing and stuff like that but if you ask me this shows laziness and requires almost no skill thats just me tho
  too much effort this person is so convinced that what shes doing is somehow art regardless of whether or not it took her two seconds that any effort to expose her for what she is will be met by a rousing who cares incel by her normie followers if anything itll just make them like her more and the person is making money from it so its in her best interest to publicly call out anyone who tells her shes a fake and get them to pitchfork mob that person on social media    shes a liberal womyn donald trumping her way to success the same way all liberals have been doing forever but im sure shed tell you we should imbeach drumpf meanwhile she filters photos and raging feminists across her social media until other normies start calling her an artist the same thing that happens with every white girl on social media amass your white knights then go on your crusade
  that sounds so tedious if anything thats her skill
  in addition if you look at the way its drawn stuff like the detail of the sleeve is just popping out of nowhere with no point of reference other than the grid that makes it pretty obviously just rote copying each single square which i think is pretty laughable because you arent actually using even your ability to reproduce a photograph youre not using your creative mind to produce anything that way
  okay anon i want you to look at that /beg/ tier symbol drawing then look at the op picture then look at that /beg/ tier symbol drawing and then i want you to tell me with a straight face that she isnt applying filters to photographs because shes given up on learning how to draw    there is no way that /beg/ tier symbol drawing becomes ops picture especially given her supposed workflow in the wip she is a fraud and nobody who follows her cares because people want to believe the next great artist is anything other than another white man and theyll accept every woman at face value until it happens regardless of whether or not they are actually drawing it
  im not defending her lmao and who said anything about trump shes a fucking gross english person bro anyway im pretty positive that its not just a filter but it is a terrible method of drawing with little skill involved however most people probably will ignore the subtlety of it the fact is that she cant deviate from a photo and make good art so its pretty cheap shes also hugely defensive on social media about this stuff which makes me suss
  okay im gonna do some comparisons god this is kinda tedious but i want the truth of the matter
  shes an npc dont try asking her on twitter shes not a real person just a manufactured dime a dozen sjw screeching retard who decided she deserved free money for no work
  christ all those grids
    i looked at the drawing and photo side by side its not a filter just lots of grids
  she cant fucking draw omfg the dumbest thing you guys seem to think in this thread is that if you had a grid or even stupider if this person had a grid theyd be able to do a perfect 11 copy of a drawing even if you fucking traced something it would still look shaky from the fact that it was hand drawn ops picture is godlike steadiness godlike lighting godlike colors because its a fucking photograph this screenshot of her twitch screen is all the proof you need that shes a beginner tier symbol drawer when it comes to drawing if you gave her a giant grid and 1000 hours she wouldnt be able to do the op picture even if i tried to do that and im a pretty advanced artist i dont think i could get the drawing so absolutely perfectly mac millers likeness completely removed from any style whatsoever to the point that it looks like a photo theres not even a style to it for gods sake its literally just the exact photo    its a fucking photograph with a filter
  change my mind  hello nazi trumptard 
shes the real deal i compared the pictures and even though theyre very close theyre different
  right i know you say its a filter but im not certain it is thats the entire point of this conversation here is a filter next to the drawing they look really similar but is that enough evidence that its not at all done by hand i dont know
are you all retards or something        she doesnt trace she just uses grids there are multiple clips of her process
  this is tracing bro the image is in the photoshop file lmao
  go to her channel and watch it shes literally drawing theres no tracing going on you fucking moron
  you need to learn what tracing means dumbass
  im actually embarrassed to share a board full of /beg/s like the people in this thread this is going into the /ic/ cringe folder
    ive seen it there is tracing going on she brings the photo to the drawing grid and copies it thats essentially tracing there certainly isnt any drawing going on you silly dudes she posted an actual freehand drawing she did and it fucking sucks why is this one so terrible if shes actually good at drawing
  this is just ridiculous show me a video then where she goes through her full process from sketch to rendering looking through her videos you see none of this she never shows her actual process through just little snippets which by the way each video doesnt show any progress from what she started with
  you cant honestly expect results by just grinding something out    post the clip of it    there certainly isnt any drawing going on you silly dudes she posted an actual freehand drawing she did and it fucking sucks why is this one so terrible if shes actually good at drawing    thats because it wasnt referenced but because a copy cat doesnt make you a tracer
   cant honestly expect results by just grinding something out  sorry i meant to greentext this     ive seen it there is tracing going on she brings the photo to the drawing grid and copies it
  did a layover for you guys make of that what you will
  thats a weird effect looks like hes breathing    while growing his ear back constantly
  if art leaves the viewer with more questions than answers the artist was unsuccessful  literally the first rule of art  that goes for all art  if an artists intentions or honesty or purpose ever come into question the piece has failed  artist immediately defending herself from critics  not the artists place never has been thats for the viewer to decide
  see   its still not passing the smell test for me  i think this might be the worst piece of art drawn copied traced or otherwise that i have ever seen absolutely confusing to behold and all of my opinions about it are outside of the content of the actual piece    there is no merit in its style execution or content and the artist needs to reevaluate everything their art consists of because it is possibly the most vapid thing ive ever seen entirely unremarkable in every way and utterly painfully baffling in its awful technique
    her commission from will smiths child is far worse
imagine being so jealous of someones fame that you have to try to ruin it but telling bullshit stay jealous assholes
  thanks for moving the goalposts you fucking autist
  stay oppressed npc femanon why dont you call us incels while youre at it
  thats some real heavy truth here anon too sad it still wont get your dick wet to whine at potential femanons on a chinese crocheting website
  omfg why are women so obsessed with sex you guys need to channel your self worth into something other than your saggy aging bodies because yikes uwu
  ahahaha cry more baby  why are women so obsessed with sex  you are the actual only human on this planet who thinks this is actually true lmaoooo   there is an entire subculture of sexually frustrated dicklets like you and trust me its not made up of women
  anytime someone challenges me on my bullshit it must be because theyre a woman    are you really that much above them jesus you really are an incel
  owo im not gonna fuck you femanon stop harassing me uwu
  it was referenced it just wasnt copied verbatim or say traced
theres still anons who unironically believe this isnt traced  you people saw her process right you saw her shitty lines and random half assed chicken scratches that couldnt prove anything are you sure you anons have ever drawn
  some artists work this way ftfy
  how the hell do you color a greyscale image traditionally are these some magic pencils i never heard of before
  i would say this isnt traced but just some filters on top judging from that ridiculous wip as you pointed out
  i cant tell if this is ironic or not
    you can tell she just painted over it and used the warp tool dont understand the filter theory when the paint effect filter doesnt look like that
  this is so clearly a photoshop filter    and theres no fucking way he couldve done that without a least a rough sketch in the process
who cares if its real its just a fucking photocopy of some white nigger it looks like shit
god this is seriously annoying me so much so much promo over this fake shit has my gears grinding she blocked me on twitter finally after calling her shit out why are normies so god damn stupid
  thats how painting is done you draw with pencil and then paint on top
stop doing whatever youre doing and draw whatevers around you in first person
  nice try fbi
  implying the fbi could tell your location from one of your shit tier scribbles prove me wrong
  abcs literally use peoples phones to map rooms  implying you arent one of the abcs trying to cross reference that map with some memesters shit tier scribbles    what this guy says 
    /begs/ will do anything to rationalize why they shouldnt be drawing huh
  its called a joke
  my lifes a video game  rise up  nice try the joker
  this has nothing to do with vidya are you by chance autistic or did you just really want to use that reddit meme and couldnt think of where to post it
  you need something to offer for a thread to go anywhere if you posted your own drawing from your own pov then people probably would have joined in but when you make a thread just /r/ing without giving anything back its like saying    alright well all sleep with each others gfs but ill go first and then i might let you fuck my gf later on might    might meaning wont   you wont get anywhere senpai you come here pockets turned out cap in hand and youre demanding aint gonna fly bruv aint gonna fly
  im not requesting anything it was just a fun topic thread theres plenty of them theres like 5 draw this picture threads on the catalog and theyre asking for something specific what would i get out of some random anon drawing his room youre analogy and reasoning is completely retarded but it doesnt matter cause the threads gone to shit gg
  its not like hes telling you to draw his oc you argumentative faggot
  those threads take off because its easy to draw a shitty head in 3/4s from ref no one here has the perspective knowledge to draw the op thing and no one here draws from life thats why you have shitposting
  heres a quickie i did in the car super bumpy and hard to draw but it was fun
bump
  i dont have my notebook with me right now but i do it everyday on the bus ive got a pocket notebook and i also always carry a pen and pencil on me so i can whip it out and draw whenever theres a chance i think im improving thanks to being forced to do perspective instad of front view drawings    so yes i approve of this thread my sketches are shit though but trying makes me improve and so will do for you
  late night doodling
  is that a huge bottle of wine on the table
  looks cool asf 
  i like it
wip  imma get it right
  holy shit shut up
    thanks
  is that a thinkpad
  nah its a surface book 2
got pretty lazy and rushed most of it
  nice work also that is a barren desk do you not have anything laying around on there crazy clean
  thanks for the save anon  that was a close one
    these are comfy anons
  i have a mouse and keyboard but i didnt wanna spend a lot of time on this and was already nearing like 3 hours lol but yeah i like to keep it clean cause i cant focus well in a messy environment
  ppls im innocent dont track me fbisama
  this is so creepy alexa play feel it coming in the air tonight
  still going  see the perspective
  not bad at all
thoughts
  barnesnoble is comfy but if someone is sitting on a chair across from me makes me too nervous
i did this the other day
  do you live in a cardboard box
did this challenge  perspective is fucked   grinded how to draw by scott robertson  the fuck is wrong with me
  nice
hm
  thanks  im reworking parts  we will see how it goes
anyone ever included their nose periphery and eyebrows and hair in any pov art     im finna do a thing that includes all muh lumpy face parts wonder how that can get did probably be easier if its like a self portrait with an eyepatch so then i only need to have the nose on one side instead of how you see it where its kind of just floating in the middle of your 2 eye vision
  this post is deep
  gj whats that thing to the left of your computer looks like some scifi shit     did you just invent the perspective yourself or draw this standing up odd angle to be drawing from looks noice tho
  nah perspective is just messed up and everything looks so far away i was sitting down so my view would actually be similar to what  did i feel like trying again
  drawing in a car  at night is the worst what the hell  we arrived before i got to finish it
  yeah its hard to draw even a simple line when youre in a car let alone some perspective stuff you did alright though i can tell whats going on
what a slob
fucked up a lot going to try again in a few minutes
  1 did you died  2 i liked it so there
  neat monitor bro
  do you hold your tablet in your hand when you draw absolutely insane
  im pretty sure that thats a clipboard brah
  i dig the looseness of the background
  well where is this demonic concoction
      first attempt at an eyeball pov duct taped my right eye shut and did a the rock thing with my caveman eyebrow so it was easy to see     next time i think i wont push my hair forward to close out the frame and try and draw what you see in your periphery more
  interesting i wish the face bits read better though hard to make out what they are
  yeah the hatching on the nose and brow kind of goofs it up particularly with the shitty scratchy hair doing it with like colored pencils or paint would probably be more effective
  meow
bump
  absolutely fucking awful jimmy
  why do a lot of first person art use fish eye for some reason  is it because its stylish er sumting
dis is ribrary
  absolutely fucking awful  absolutely  with no qualification restriction or limitation totally  seems dramatic
  yeah it looks cool and also it allows you to show more of your environment youre view would be somewhat limited if you just drew what was in front of you
  probably because the eye actually sees in curvilinear perspective such as fisheye although i think ops example is really inconsistent in that regard
  because humans have a fish eye view shits spherical you have peripheral vision that picks up like 150 degrees or whtever if you want to draw your literal point of view accurately you kind of have to do fish eye
big ol fan of this
  is this a picture for ants noice dual monitor set up tho lad
  because kim jong gi uses it
  bigger size and lil bit extended
  comfy
  because human vision is in 5 point perspective aka fisheye  think about how you see the world and youll understand
bump
  
  looking good m80 definite improvement on the perspective
  i did that with the brim of my hat once
bump
  oooo i really like this one
  cheers
    how do you even draw in pov do you only move your eyes the second i move my head i completely loose my picture i dont understand how to draw a room with object that are 90 degree cubes while moving my head i have no problems drawing thing directly in front of me though pleees halp
  reflected light isnt light its just less dark  otherwise pretty good
  wow that fits really well actually
how do you do thumbnails    i suck doing them so bad i feel completely lost at sea while starting them i can do a value thumbnail of lake with distant mountains and clear horizon because its so simple and generic but if id have to conjure up something different like valleys and waterfalls and caves etc its just horrible even when i use hard brush at 80 opacity and try to lasso tool shit up i am so lost on everything and end up with muddy values or almost black and white cut out which looks as bad    the feeling of having no initial idea and just find interesting shapes is so overwhelming that im completely clueless of course this carries out to making any landscape compositions out of imagination and its just awful
  the feeling of having no initial idea and just find interesting shapes is so overwhelming that im completely clueless  then have an initial idea castle hill knight on horseback square castle rounded shape hill triangle knight on horseback change position size and value of shapes to arrive at a composition/story one value for each object
this is where some basic graphic design can come in handy youre basically saying you have trouble with composition
  i was watching a lesson on nma by bill perkins where he takes a composition and breaks it up into value ranges on his scale based on local value and elminiates the values in between ranges as to make them distinct then assigns the contrast accordingly based on his light sources for each range within a given range not sure if that makes sense since im still pretty /beg/ but kind of makes sense in the lesson
  ever consider you just might be a brainlet
draw more from life and build up your visual library
  study shape design  study values  think about the story you are trying to tell  look for great compositions you like and break them down in thumbnail and see what is working what kind of shapes they are using the value structure etc
    google notan landscape painting thank me later
        
  what is a good resource for learning basic graphic design
    graphic design has nothing to do with art     he probably meant to think graphically and use flat shapes to build a composition pretty much what this anon said 
  yeah but most of the time thumbnail studies are meant to be very creative warm ups and to find interesting shapes etc they are meant to do from imagination not from reference
  thumbnails training dont forget stay near your computer

  bill alexander
a dev i met at a game con a year ago is now developing some kind of app  messages me if i want to do freelance work and if so i should email him  i email him on tuesday he says he wants face stickers done for an app like the fact filters you would see on snapchat like cat ears would show on your head in camera  asks if i can do it this weekend i say ok  says hell send me a test later that day  few days pass hear nothing  friday he emails me again and asks if i can do the work this weekend and hell send me a contract   i say ok still dont hear anything all day  dont want to discuss price yet cuz i wanna see whats in the contract  he messages back friday night that theyre waiting on his ceo and that hell send me a contract saturday morning the latest  its already past 2pm saturday no contract  message him to send me contract at his convenience  finally at almost 5pm at night he emails me no contract just an email of 12 photos of a girls face with app face filter stickers and says theyll pay 100 for the set  i was out to dinner at this point so i didnt email back until 7 asking if what he basically wants me to do is redraw the graphics from the filters  he then responds at fucking 1130 pm with just yes at 1000 x 1000 pixels    should i take on this project should i counter offer his price i feel 100 is way too low for this project but i dont know how much to charge for a bunch of 1000 x 1000 pixelsized drawings i also dont feel comfortable taking on freelance work with no contract i also usually work with a down payment first    my worry is just the timing in all of this he wanted it done this weekend and now its sunday morning    how would you go about this
  100 is low and fifteen hours isnt much time with that in mind wtf are you doing on here message your contact
so how does this sound as a response    i can get the entire set done by the end of today but for the amount of work you would like to be done im afraid 100 is just too low     i can do the entire set for 300 i also ask for 50 up front before any work is done    how i work with my clients is after a down payment is made i immediately start on the work i send sketches and wip to the client during the process in case there needs to be any revisions once the work is finished i will send lores watermarked versions of the work for final approval and payment of the 2nd half after the second half is paid i send the final hires    please let me know if you agree with these terms    i dont want to sound threatening but at this point i feel like saying if he wants it done as soon as possible he should agree to my terms
  seems fishy as fuck either ask for payment upfront or do them and send them at like 300x300 pixels negotiate a price that is like 15/hr too at the very least if you dont need the money just tell them to go fuck themselves for being so unprofessional
  not threatening in the slightest id count this gig as a nogo they sound really unprofessional so far and clients like that can be a hassle even when wellintentioned
  so what exactly should i say i dont want to burn bridges in case this guy has any connections but i also dont want to work for very little pay and thats hoping i even get paid based on his response time
  whoops i fucked up my greentext i was going to email the client back with this response anything i should phrase differently or add    i can get the entire set done by the end of today but for the amount of work you would like to be done im afraid 100 is just too low i can do the entire set for 300 i also ask for 50 up front before any work is done  how i work with my clients is after a down payment is made i immediately start on the work i send sketches and wip to the client during the process in case there needs to be any revisions once the work is finished i will send lores watermarked versions of the work for final approval and payment of the 2nd half after the second half is paid i send the final hires please let me know if you agree with these terms
    nope its fine im just saying that itd be wise to keep your expectations low more often than not the first impression a client gives you when offering a job is the right one and this guy comes across as a pile of red flags
  this is absolutely /gd it isnt art or critique its commercial graphic design youve got a whole board its the /gd board
op again    so looking back at the examples i saw i realized they would be really simple drawings that wouldnt take too much time to do so i lowered my price to 160 i sent the message i wrote with my price and this is what he wrote back      i felt like telling him for a quick little project you sure took your time to get back to me but i bit my tongue i just said i understand good luck with the project and keep me in mind for any future opportunities    case closed i guess
  how is it graphic design
  its definitely a scam op never undervalue yourself and dont do anything for free im serious dont do anything for free doesnt matter what kind of promises of future payment youve been told
  yo as a fellow freelancer id say drop this guy without regrets ive had funny people like this message me for comissions before the time frame to do this thing is ridiculous so is the price and communication you definitely deserve better clients
how does the light haired male character so effectively evokes contempt and lack of empathy based on design alone i look at the dude and i dont like him what tricks are at play here
  my guess it has to do a lot with the girl being cute and the whole scene
  his eyes and face and the mcs eyes and face
  the girl looks generic the boy looks like a the author trying to be original and the douche looks like an urasawas background character
  eyebrow expression    looks like a smarmy snarky motherhubbard
  i can divorce myself from all of that and the guy still looks unlikable in a vacuum
  its the arrogant eyebrows the tiny squinty eyes and the smug smile
he has a very impassive expression and small incomplete eyes  check through the /co/ archives for its walky i didnt see it at the time but someone was kvetching about how the cartoon eyed characters looked creepy
dot eyes  smug expression
its the nose
  was about to say this he looks basically like a jew
halfclosed dot eyes with no highlights  basicaly no facial expression except a very faint smile  almost no body language    those elements say that he isnt interested in whats in front of him hence the smug atmosphere    contrasted with the girl which is more expressive it works  also the left panel is the only one were the male moves putting a hand on the girls shoulder meaning that when he does something its only to assert his position and the girl face tells without a doubt that yeah im his bitch and i cant help it    wouldnt be as effective in a vaccum i think    also sauce
eyes and eyebrows  the author gave him squinty eyes covering the iris both up and down the upper eyelid touches the pupil this subtly gives him this kinda sleepy look    pic related just to show how covering the pupil changes a lot the expression
  its definitely because of the whole context and not just because of his hair but lighthairedness can be used as a way to make a character look more alienated to japanese people since theyre mostly darkhaired but it can be used both positively or negatively
  the smug lowered eyelids and the eyebrows are probably the biggest part here
new masters academy is having a cyber monday sale 11/month first three months for both standard and premium theres also a 35 off sale on annual subscriptions if there were any videos that you really want to watch and its not on cgpeers now is a good time 3 months for 33 total is less than their monthly price 35 in their annual subscription just unsubscribe when youre done    this started three days ago but i live under a rock so im posting here in case any other anons didnt know
the sad truth is /ic/ anons cant afford or dont even want to pay 11 dollars a month for something like nma
wish i had 11 dollars ive had nma in the past and i can say it was definitely worth the 35 pricetag
just buy gumroads from artists you find appealing
    what if /ic/ did a group buy and made the account available for everyone here its not a lot money i think there are probably 35 people on this board who are willing to pay 1 a month
i hopped on this deal steve huston here i come
  there already some post here    also while you cant download the vid on pc you can download the vids through phone browser just found out about that yesterday  just regis 1 month and rip everything that not on the mega  also the 1 account multiple people wont work
i have a lifetime subscription ive been thinking of starting up a stream where i show the videos and try and follow along with them while playing them
  i have a lifetime subscription ive been thinking of starting up a stream where i show the videos and try and follow along with them while playing them  that would be so great id follow along
  i feel like this would be easily detected and could possibly get you banned am i just being a paranoid idiot
  then they dont want to make it fuck them then
  i mean it doesnt apply to everyone there are people legit living in 3rd world countries who literally cant afford it there was a guy on here a while ago that lived in venezuela and did digital paintings with a mouse
  thanks anon
  last call guys it supposedly ended 30 minutes ago but i was able to still able to buy it for some reason maybe a glitch or something to do with timezones      youre welcome
  i have been downloading for 2 days now and its still ok  i doubt there is a way to find the different between browsers load video and download video through browser
i dont believe for half a second that this shit is worth that much spending that much on fucking video tutorials is plain retarded
  hehehe
  not an nma shill but youre retarded if you cant see the value in this
  an actual art tutor would cost 60 dollars an hour are you retarded
    it was only 11 if you have bid you can rip the entire photo library with a push of a button and get thousands of refs that alone is worth the 11 the beginner material is okay but the rest of the stuff on there is redundant they have like dozens of videos on how to draw a head and neither one of their methods clicked with me though i havent reviewed the rilley method     youre not entirely wrong though they need actual content on how to draw fucking cartoons you have teachers on their who claimed theyve work in animation and not one fucking series is on cartooning baffling i believe these old fucks intend to die without sharing what they know in the animation department
  why in the blue fuck would anyone work to create and release animation instruction when you can get the definitive animators survival kit for less than 15 dollars
  that didnt stop aaron shilling my holiday coupon on /ic/ blaise now did it
  whats bid my account expires in december and i want to download the references
  bulk image downloader according to bing
  thousands of refs  i didnt believe you but holy shit
    divide that by half because its picking up the low res and high res files possibly but yeah its still a lot of images
  i think there is a way to tell because some sites you cant dl the streaming videos as it just cuts the connection  i dont know what information they are left with behind the scenes but those sites can definitely tell the difference between streaming and download attempts through 3rd party extensions in chrome or whatever you are using
    jw player has the ability to watermark your information at random for nma to do this would be a waste of time to employ but that is an option they can do for sites like cgma they do this which is why youll never see another cgma upload ever again
  not so much watermarks that is the problem if you download for your own use but permanent ban from their site and maybe even legal action taken against you
  people can still stream the download though
  i think there is a way to tell because some sites you cant dl the streaming videos as it just cuts the connection  those site use special player to cut the video into pieces to stop the download not because they can detect it or not
anyone have the sheldon borenstein videos they took them down
  sheldon was an inferior vlippu anyways  he padded his lectures with his weird humor and 1/5th of the viddo is him axtually drawing  vlippus only flaw is that it is hard to understand him but they put subtitles
    if anyone does rip them can you post it on here my dumb ass chose standard plan because i thought there was the chance i would want to keep the subscription
more like ngmi academy amiright
    holy fuck thank you for informing me its december 4 and thank god i subscribed to thier newsletter which made me eligible for their discount    oh god i can finally have access to their premium thanks again anon
i need some advice on drawing roses like pic related    its turning out to be one of the hardest things ive ever tried to draw but i cant find any decent tutorials or books on the matter
most flowers are just a collection of simple forms learn how to manipulate forms in three dimensions and youll be able to easily draw pretty roses from imagination or just trace a few roses to get an understanding of them and draw one from ref
    is this peak anatomy
  is this peak anatomy    not really but understanding anatomy to the point where you can stylize it convincingly is fine i dont see a problem with this at all
  arts purpose is to draw your eye to it if you dont like stylization may i suggest pictures
give me free art i mean show me your style critique welcome
  my critique is that your art sucks
  critique welcome  its shit
  thats offensively bad why would you do that
      thanks for the critique guys
  i was being 100 serious never come here again stick to /co/
why are these people always practicing cleanliness and nothing else most of /beg/ can draw better but almost nobody there can be as clean
  bluepilled artists never practice fundies think just sketching is fine and believe that details rendering and cleaner linework will carry their shit scribbles into success this is bolstered by the sheer amount of shit tutorials online on how to render different materials how to do cleaner lines etc which only serve as short cuts to prettying up fundamentally poor drawings
  honest critique here pros first its very clean the colors themselves are for the most part well selected the way the hair is done is interesting and the highlight of this piece now for the negatives there are so many absurd elements to this at once that just dont belong together theres so much questionable content that it seems kind of like a joke or an insult as the anons here have shown firstly what the heck is that on her face i think perhaps its blushing but its so blobby and spotted that it honestly looks like she has a bad rash the neck lines that are popping out are messed up the neck itself is much too wide the mouth on the face is too low the bags under her eyes and the odd lip lines make her face look too detailed and unappealingthe hands have no wrists and you know probably all of that would have maybe been passable is it werent for the thighs the weird white goop there is just so badly done the texture is inconsistent and what is it supposed to be anyway semen female lubrication a birthmark alien goo it looks like her flesh is melting via acid or something the color white doesnt match anything else in the picture a skirt or pants would have been better then those bare legs with those panties  literally anything else would have been more arousing also theres this strange lump on her legs where it meets the thighs her left leg that doesnt really make sense it definitely looks like some niche fetish material and im not following it   im not trying to be cruel im just being real people cant take this drawing seriously because of all those strange factors
  holy kek
    the hell      thank you for the detailed honest critique i appreciate it
  youre welcome man hope you make it
  went from bad tumblr to sexy with a bit of tumblr nose great improvement
  this makes me want to vomit
  you made her hot but shes still a literal shit monster
  that is utter garbage i am appalled
  is this the power of tumblr

  nnnnngh
  you did good
  bloggu
  dont worry anon you dont have to be god tier or even good at the start practice makes perfect seriously read some books on anatomy study some of your favorite artists until you make a mishmash of all the techniques and shortcuts that you gather from them cultivating in your own style stay determined d
  if this is a wip tilt the syringe a little bit so we can see what it is very nice tho
  thanks for the encouragement solid style you got there love the eyebrows
  im sorry but that picture is gross everything about it is disgusting
draw thread    post your current drawing here and give constructive critique to others dont take anything personal    please make sure your posted image is clear downsized to around 1000 pixels wide rotated to the correct orientation and that any unused space is cropped  if you want critique on a drawing from the previous thread you can delete it there and repost in this one    da /ic/ group       /ic/ resources/reference/downloads/links    general resources           last thread  3682889
last thread 
  that op pic  based
  ipad pro  yeah ipad  pro  look what it can do  you can probably tell i have 16 anatomy apps  also got perspective zoom on so all my drawing show perspective  also into trad hence the toga
  looks good there are a few subtleties but all in all id say it looks ok
  thanks man  rendering wasnt too bad but the attempt to alla prima trompelœil using crossfade was a little glitchy
lineart for character design challenge prompt
beginning of a cast drawing from life  already scared  already lost  hoping this is where i learn
drew a turtle
  just go pro at this point man      id work on your lower back/hips they seem to be missing his legs just connect to his stomach      you need to put in a lot more work before youre ready to critique this looks like the first 30 seconds of construction and i cant help you   just dont be afraid to make mistakes      this is a nice turtle id work on finer detail and backgrounds this turtle pleases me    i could really use help with perspective and making sure my anatomy is up to snuff hoping the neck seems right but ive rescribbled it a few times now
progress so far    i feel like i need help with values and shading     but how do you think im doing     do i need to spend more time blending things i think i do     i would appreciate if anyone has a good tutorial or video on doing studies like this anything that could help me really
did a quick request for /tg/ i dont like to spend more than an hour on these so not gonna work on it anymore but i think this took around 2 hours
  do i need to blend  you dont have all of the values down yet theres nothing to blend
  damn it i knew i had to spend alot more time with it before posting sry
    get rid of the white background and put a midtone there get your drawing right your relationships alignments and shapes are completely off and id use /beg/ at your level
trying to learn how to draw digital and its tough currently learning how to draw from colors instead of lineart then filling it in with colors i think this is how the pros do it but im not sure
  i think as long as you get good results your method doesnt matter looks like youre on the right track keep improving and work on shading
  thank you i think my problem is that ive been recreationally doodling on paper for years and transitioning to pixels is frustrating something about tablets take away my mojo and i suspect its because the work doesnt come out as nice as my paperdrawn images they come off as i think rubbery is the best way to put it less lifelike than if i did it on paper    that and ive been traditionally black and white colors are really spooky
bumpin this above the /pol/ spam drawthread
  good    fuck nazis
  30 seconds lol   a couple of hours   if i were afraid of making mistakes i would only draw from photos
  baziiiinnnnngaaaaaaa
  just to emphasize the last part of what the other guy said the bigger problem is not your values rendering very rarely saves a poor drawing
  i know that drawing undertale is the equivalent to breaking a deadly sin/anything that isnt anime but how does this look is it obvious theres perspective or does it look flat should i add anything
  you should stop rendering this piece of shit    start over    focus on what you need to strengthen first its lacking structure you need to define the shapes better before you go in and start blotching in lines of color    make sure your line art is strong and youre are absolutely 100 confident about it before you render
  i will red line it for you
  ok what do you think looks the worst about it the thing i can distinctly point a problem out with is the skeletons hand    by defining shapes im wondering if you mean make limbs more noticeable      thanks    also this is just a general question i never do digital art or projects of any sort but how long would you say is the proper time to spend on a sketch i spent 1520 minutes sketching this out and it felt like there was a clock counting me down because i was worried it was taking so long
  what kind of prefessionals are you talking about comics and cartoons are almost always draw first and color later
    probably means tho concept art render farms my advice to that poster is color is secondary get gud at shapes and values
does this look like an improvement    do you guys think im a bad artist lol
  i think you should fix the kids face rebecca sugars art isnt very appealing look to other inspirations
something from my sketchbook i also do digital art
  i hate steven universe
is it sad that i consider /ic/ the only social media i want to be popular on    i repainted that still life onto a smaller canvas with thicker paint and a bigger palette
  why did u red line a cock lol
this is the last time im posting this sorry guys does it look like he just has a giant hand or does it look like its perspective
  start applying for shit right now i want to see your work everywhere
  i was working out the leg that wouldnt be visible in the final piece so that my proportions would be correct
  this isnt the porn thread
the first self portrait i do that i actually like and its a gender bend 
  not sure which one youre asking about but guy on the left looks in perspective guy on the right looks giant hand/arm
  nother /tg/ quickie managed to keep it under an hour but shouldve flipped image at least once
i think its done its easy to get carried away and fuck shit up
    you look pretty pretty ugly
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh goddammit im so lonely and horny be my gf be my gf be my gf
i mostly just draw traditionally so i suck at digital painting could i get some crits lads    nice gesture reminds me of something out of the force dynamic anatomy books    i like it the texture on the coat is especially cool
  check your values everything looks the same and there are no good shadows/lights your linework is also really bad because everything is same thickness your colours need work also because everything is brown and anatomy is fucked up
  its bad mouth is all wonky and too low on the face colours are too muddy on face and all the brush strokes are showing
finally done with this shit  i put some effort for the composition but im not sure its working any critique is welcomed
  looks dope
  good stuff mate am impress    i think the eyebrow facing us is a bit off other than that i like it try to look into hair a bit i have the same problems
learning how to digitally paint without outlines not sure if im on the right path or not my artist friend said the clouds arent very realistic i guess im going for realistic/semirealistic how and what do i do from here keep refining critique welcome
  fuck off back to /beg/
  looks cool as fuck but the composition is kinda bad there is no clear focal point if you used the red less it could have made a good focal point there is same amount of detail in the foreground as there is in the background so the characters in the foreground lose interest there are a lot of elements that point away from the page skeletons arm dudes gun and i cant tell whats going on from the thumbnail    again cool as fuck and normies would eat this shit up but read a book/watch a lecture on composition if good composition was your goal here better than 999 of /ic/
  its a wip youre a crab
    holy fuck i never thought about /tg/ for requests i thought draw threads were doomed to anime/cute garbage on /a/ and /v/ going there right now
why was the last thread deleted
pew
  i like the right more
critique please
  cant help you if you arent gonna help yourself draw more lines
  is it bad    i can agree with the brush strokes ill need to smooth it thanks anon
  her pussy smells like frog i bet
    cropped the bottom it was pointless space
  shoulder line doesnt make sense for that camera angle
  its kind of fun but there are a small few that like to cause drama and bait requesters and artists also /ic/ kind of frowns upon providing free art which is why i try not to spend too much time on any request theres an info chart for contacts and some of the other artists do get commissions from /tg/
  2spooky4me
  sometimes i try to make a manga mix with a bit of realism
  good work    but dont confuse realism with tedious rendering there is nothing realistic or convincing about this image
  you really need to work on your fundamentals i suggest you start with proportions and gesture also try doing photo studies of models under dramatic lighting conditions to get a better sense for light and shadow where you are now the rendering is completely flat and your figure has no form
  most likely why ive disliked all of my previous selfportraits stereotypical looking nerd while this only gets a pass because its a chick one thing i feel i have going for me is my hair though which can translat even better onto a girl
  no you actually look pretty
  you have a pretty well shaped body in my opinion i would have no problem drawing you as a nude model
  jesus christ brian you are so fucking thirsty its more embarrassing than the lonely and horny poster
  brain doing a prison sentence they let you have internet
      not brian its me anon
  what do i have to do with this
  would you be interested    assuming youre over 18
  you are loosing the structure of the face and the sense of light direction because your values are all over the place with no clearly defined statements think about what planes are catching the most light and which are facing away generally its a good idea to map out your shadow shapes first to get a clearer idea of whats in dark and what is in light
  nerdy is okay for a girl as long as you know how to keep your hygiene good     yuh your hair is like a lioness its going for you i agree
  kek you dun fuckd it up
everyone just noticed his head is a dick i was proud of my archer as for the thin arm it wasnt supposed to look human but seems like a giga nigga
  man ulduar brings me back
  what exactly are you trying to go for in terms of style if its semi realism you should push the values more and make the planes of the face clearer not crazily dramatic since its a women and usually value shifts are more subtle with women also look at painters like sargent zorn etc work look at how they do portraiture to learn color and zone of the face youve made everything a bit too saturated pink which could be cool but you need to add variations of color and it doesnt really give that much room to invite more color into it neutrals allow a lot more color harmony and variation very rarely are things all one solid color usually there are color shiftsagain if you are aiming for realism like around the ears cheeks and sometimes nose the skin gets reddish for white people and for men around the neck chin and basically facial hair areas its usually a cooled down desaturated color also i think you mightve taken the whole warm light cool shadow thing a bit too literally and made the shadow areas this purplish blue cool shadow means cool relative to the light side not always a cold color like purple and blue i do like the drawing of the face though as a base
  this is sweet
    id ask u out for coffee and see where it go
  nicely done but why
  man hands man arms    i should have known
  feason is that you
  yeah i need to work on my hair and i see what you mean about the eyebrow ill be sure to work on that thanks for the input anon    you pretty much nailed everything i was attempting to do and where i went wrong super helpful crit thank you for taking the time to help me out based anon
    brain works at gamestop
  that a tall doggo
roast me
i was taking a dump while doodling the swole dude and suddenly the intense pain made me evolve as an artist and i sketched the above guy in 5 minutes i will surpass murata with my shitty zenkai boosts
  tried addressing some of the problems you pointed out such as the palette and lineweight variation the anatomy i tweaked but hes supposed to be a dwarf so its not gonna be anatomically proportional any feedback
  what am i suppose to look at its too much shit going on looks cool but my eyes are all over the place
  why what
  i like it her body is very nice    ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh soooooooooo horny ahhhhhhhhhhh i need a gf im so lonely ahhhhhhhhhhhh
  sternocleidomastoid connected to middle of god knows where  deldoid of the right arm doesnt exist at all
  sternocleidomastoid  theres that word again
  its actually one of the easiest to remember if you just consider the connections  sterno   for sternum  cleido   for clavicle  mastoid  for mastoid process of temporal bone
im gonna hopefully use these designs in a comic something with a simple plot
  i see a whole lot of plot in that image anon
  those designs are fun as fuck
watercolor based on one of noah bradleys scotland photos
  part of a daily sketchbook drawing exercise that im doing everyday kind of fucked up the hair
what should i do for the background
  what r u talking bout
value exercise might add more design elements to it to make it a little less generic was going for very soft lighting
  oh look same face same lighting same rendering how do you live with yourself
  can you explain exactly why any of thats a bad thing though
  yeah itll have some adult content
  you have no goals
  my goals are traditional im trying to learn light and form this is a practice piece not a portfolio piece
hollo i come from the ass of /b/ drawthreads i need your assistance in shading composition line cleanliness and over all everything else     i got lazy from during the coloring stage because i lost hope on these drawings dont bother with telling me what i did right but i need to know everything im doing wrong outside of using paintoolsai and a shitty screenless tablet from almost 13 years ago    it also would be nice if you guys could help direct me to good resources that help fix some of the problems thank you
another example
    its not the problem of drawing the ideas its more of finishing the drawings at a respectable quality id really appreciate it if someone would help until them im going to go fap my sadness away
  maybe find a way to contrast the map with the central figure its giving me a headache    other than that its fuckin rad m8
  blog
  i really like your approach but i think you could benefit from some good references
  just did a quick paint over im no bob ross though get rid of the white around him it throws everything off a bit the drawing seems pretty fine apart from the feet
  the big girlss head is too small
  he wants to smell that froggy gash
painted john wayne
    very good    i love it
do you guys like feet
  thanks mate i am pleased with how it turned out as well
  snip snip someone is buttfrustrated today
  i like those feet very nice
                    i feel like i accidentally jebaited a bunch of people with a rule 63 selfportrait    the manhands/arms looks kind of accurate always want to practice that anatomy even if it doesnt fit that being said feel like i put a lot of thought into it face is very similar to mine body type was meant to be similar to my sister the hair is pushing it but i genuinely like my hair kind of pull off the wake up in morning and hair falls into place in a cute/attractive manner and believe id take a lot of care with it as a girl    though does anyone else feel they might think too much about a drawing as it you stagnate and stiffen it because youre too focused on reasonings instead of appealing design fucking hate that shit and it happens all the time
  study
  getting a compliment on ic is kinda rare these days thank you      yeah im getting used to the ipad still
study
is the perspective on this okay
  how about this
am i better than you would i at least be a decent art sparring partner i once again got heavy art gains and i am erect
  i iike this one too
        
some of them are a bit wonky
  thanks for the crit did some fiddling with it i think i got the perspective right now heres me annoyed blocking traffic
need some help with this one struggling a lot with the environment is the closest mountain working should i just keep refining it also how should i approach adding more movement in color and value in the snow on the light side and still keep it looking like snow and in the light
    really nice work anon i love your style i think the shading on the closest mountain is a little bit inconsistent get some reference maybe those rocks dont really seem to be far away at all so maybe try pushing them more into the distance by putting in some atmospheric depth the biggest reason why they seem to be close is because those two dudes in the bg dont really seem to get forshortened at all theyre not really all that far away from the rocks if you imagine a perspective grid on the image maybe you should try using a perspective grid    it also kind of bothers me how her hair bun is in that tangent with those two mountains either have it break the shape or make the mountains lower or higher     i dont think you need to refine the snow focus on the characters and the storytelling im not completely sure whats supposed to be going on in this image is the guy in the foreground her friend or foe
    sorry i misspoke its not that the dudes dont seem to get foreshortened at all its just that the foreshortening is inconsistent if those are supposed to be big mountains
    work in progress
  needs people feels empty without them
  maybe the closest mountain is too detailed it looks close and small instead of far and big idk which one of those its supposed to be
i tried
  needa finish the car interior but im doing it all on one layer and im kind of dreading it
  the streetlight sharing tangent with building corner
  its on the island with the foliage that devides the road is it that hard to tell
  shared tangents are bad design in general
  thanks for the crit dude yea youre right the dudes in the back would be a lot smaller if we are to follow the scale of the mountain which is probably why the mountain looks close and small as this  anon said and yea ill probably add a filter layer to desaturate it and push it back good catch with the tangent i was a bit to focused i having the mountain tops as leading lines the guy in the foreground is a foe he is her bounty the dudes in the back are his henchmen as for reference i do have reference its supposed to be like zion canyon except i thought itd be cool to top it with snow ill play around with it more thanks again guys
    fair enough tbf i was copying a photo
  besides liking this image and its pretty cool    id say the background is flat especially the second one you could match it with the figures its might add some depth and help the atmosphere
  a lot of times artists will alter life to avoid things like this
  this nigga eatin beans
would it be a bad idea to cover this drawing in calligraphy or some small ink embellishments
second final version of it
  yea just leave it whats wrong with what u have now looks good
  ok no ink i did try to fix a couple small values though
  looks fuckin rad anon put some more light on that head so its easier to see tho
  looks very nice anon good work
  gonna make it blog
  blog
  twittercom/munsplit
  go away furry faggot
  looks interesting so far you have some problems with the perspective where the buildings go into the distance also those plants are too green considering your environment as well as the sky bleeding too much blue into the image you should also clean up some edges on the main building other than that youre on the right track
           are you guys fans
  can i get 1 one redline on her figure
  let me guess you also did fionas painting  i love u granny fag
  thanks anon    for some reason and im trying to fix it stuff looks over saturated on phones the green and red espectially maybe my monitor is fudggy
  yeah its not the phone those greens are oversaturated i think you could keep the saturation similar but make the greens whiter because of da sunlight
  it seems you have made it anon and about the composition i would have to agree its all over the place that said it is still amazing work
my current one what do you think
  i think you have a pretty solid foundation there
im just trying to get this over with because i hit the top of the page and will be mspainting the spear together    girls are hard
  i am the cosmic queen
i drew a jazz club
  i like it but i think the surplus of detail on her torso makes the face come off kinda weird its as if shes getting fullfrontaled by light but her torso is getting its shadow from somewhere else otherwise its excellent    i like it feels jazzy in general though im kinda miffed at how the rightmost window has that thick line off on the right side maybe if it wasnt so prominent itll be less offending
  i fucked up the bar too the windows would have to be huge for the bar to be that tiny    heres a drawing of me getting broken up with
  
did another painting today for my friend  kept this one really really loose
  i think the windows are perfectly fine giant windows are okay but perhaps a functional bar would be bigger  anyway i like the bandshirt guys expression it is minimalistic but its excellent i will say that the shirt wrinkles are making the arm look kinda fucky though the womans jawline is also a little small for a mouth that wide open but it matches your design    nice centaur    hory frick that is super
  thanks i like how it came out as well
  im still quite bad on a tablet let alone colors im sure your friend really likes this
  nice but i really wanna punch your friend in the face
  youre not bad at all theres definite problems with it especially the face but theres good stuff too the colors are nice and the painting style is cool as well
i know its side ways but this art was a joke please share your opioion about it
  its a joke
far from finished just want an honest critique
  lol but seriously
  i like the comic style i just think it needs more definition
  ha i knew someone will point it out sooner or later i cant argue with that      if you used the red less it could have made a good focal point  totally agree as my first intention was to draw blood on center only and not else but i derailed hard    same amount of detail in the foreground as there is in the background  in my defense i used finer lines on the background to compensate that issue but i didnt differentiated enough as they all look the same    a lot of elements that point away from the page  funny thing is that i did it intentionally thinking that may attract focal point to the center considering those lines converge at the center but i think it may produced exact opposite outcome never thought about that    good point anon      yeah i seldom draw large piece and i had overwhelmed by so much empty spaces on a2 paper now i look back and think i should have drawn things bigger thus fewer      thats great idea further contrasting every other elements with gas mask dude might be even better i think    and thank you other anons for appreciating my works
bill evans photo study
  i miss you i need to find your tumblr again
how can i make this shading better
  thanks man can do
  foreground doesnt match the background perspective
  give me your worst i want to improve
  really like how you approached the beard and jacket
  thank you
hey guys what do you think of my latest creation    someone has to take the place of ruan jia eventually
  1/10    i would give 10/10 but the perspective on the mail goats mailbag is off
  this is really charming blog
i fuckec up the nose but i think the rest of this came out okay
    is it that noticable for animation
  oy vey
  right eh whatever
  made this for a school project
  this is the idea behind it
  shes missing a large chunk of her skull
  jesus christ study some hands
  probably its very noticable now just adjust/redraw it
  is this what life drawing in a synagogue looks like
  i like it a lot but the tangent between the dudes upper arm and the assassinpersons calf is bothering me and based on where i can see the knee poking out the leg doesnt seem to be attached to her hips
  her legs are open like her right one is the highest one and the left is behind the dude thts y i assume u think it looks detatched
i cant figure out what is or isnt working in the original composition so all these repaints feel useless to me i didnt see the errors others did on my thumbnails so im just floundering around lost and frustrated    what do you guys think id love any help at this point i just feel like im spinning my wheels because i cant figure out how to fix it without knowing what it was people didnt like in the first version
this started as a doodle but i just went with it dont know if the pose makes sense but wip i guess
update to my drawing earlier
tonights project      eerie i like it      saw this on insta earlier nice values thumbnail reads very nicely      really nice rendering of the metal      those value relationships and transitions are real dope my man      really cool i like it initially thought the loose rendering was tattoos from the thumbnail though
  bottom right is in the right direction but you need to make the figure like 3 times larger and filling up a much larger space in the foreground dude looks 2 feet tall assuming the characters are similar sizes based on the other 2 comps
in process
idk where i was going with this
  im concerned of how large her hands are wow
im working on this project right now
  reddit wont crit me am i just to highlevelstyle
  i like this but the top part ruins the composition would look cooler imo if the horn things were going up forming sort of a halo around his head
  its dope
  what is reddit is it like 4chan
photo study got lazy with the details but i find a certain charm when i just leave it loose
  i like it but the climbers expression is really hard to tell what hes feeling since its so small i dont know what you can do about it im just giving my thought
horse rolling in the sand  except im not sure how to draw sand/mud
its rare they i ever have the ambition to render something out this much    be gentile but true with me /ic/ loveya
from that loomis book
  i actually like it a lot     i would recommend giving his lower right arm a more limp wrist hes flexing for no reason     limp would be creepier
  this is indeed how the pros draw  shhhhh stop giving up the secrets
any advice on how to render whiteish hair better
  not like that
  dont be an asshole anon      currently your values are very close together if youre trying to make the hair glow i would keep the values close in the hair and vary the lighting  increase contrast on the planes of the face otherwise just increase contrast overall right now it seems you have the right idea on how to show form but it feels like youre too scared of going too dark with the shadows in the hair
  some texture would help the dirt you can flick a brush to get some specks randomly
  you could tone down the value of the hair to make it similar to the skin other than that just treat it like you would render blonde hair
  i had a quick go hope it helps
  go back
  worlds longest sword
  thats very fucking cool and you have max talent   but  like others have said its a bit schizophrenic due to a lack of clear focal point and easy readability if that was the goal then well done however its not pleasant to look at and almost feels feverish
    just figured out a way to kinda fix it   perhaps by giving the diamond in the centre a white border it may create a sort of isolated focal area from which your eyes can explore by following one of the many connecting cues     again i wanna stress this     that is really really really fucking cool though   like really cool  i hope you are very proud of both your work and yourself     also where can i find more of your stuff
  please help me improve my shabby cyberslav elf thing  please bear in mind though im not trying to be the very best and i only really draw as an outlet   just want some general tips and advice on how to make her more interesting and appealing whilst still being one of the most generic fantasy creatures out
  what media is that straight digital  if so the flowers look almost inked might be my shitty phone though   i cant really give any critique it seems to achieve what it sets out to do   i like it
  nah needs to be pulling a circle
i cant paint so i stuck with ink giving my drawings some photoshop work wondering what you think of my latest piece
  whats the name of the original youre drawing loved it so so much
painted scrooge
oh nice stuff                  oh anon u su guud
  oh that is cool i will help you tomorrow
  mad cool    thug magic    harry potter nigger
  this is cool reminds me of pic related
  
painted this
how can i refine this  i always get to this stage with my paintings unsure of how to refine and add details  any tips on how to add details
  rid of those outlines and focus on the details and shadows after in its place
been only drawing with ink and graphite and i am slowly trying to get used to colours i am going to work on my shitty habit of line dependence next so tips in that direction are very appreciated does the colour scheme work overall what would you guys improve
  thats amazing dude
  thanks a lot man
  is this a step in the right direction  i am new to digital painting so any tips on features and brushes would be nice  i also fixed the wonky eye
  i love this the colors work in that it gives a surreal feeling as if this is not our planet i love how you left the pencil marks all around to give that raw feeling but that just a personal opinion i also love how much detail you gave to the flowers do you have a blog or something also are you aware of artist arx lee  the surreal setting and chunky forms in detailed colorful landscape reminds me of him
    i really like your style bro must have been a painstaking amount of work how big are you working     i think your perspective could use some work but maybe thats just your stylistic choice normally id think this was a really weird color scheme but since ive seen the movie it makes a whole lot of sense    would love to see more of your work        never heard of this artist before thanks for the recommendation
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh goddammit i am so lonely and horny
  thank you a lot no i was not aware of arx lee but from what i see he is really up my alley in terms of aesthetic i like kind of similar to simon stalenhag wich is one of my biggest imspiration and motivation in terms of where i want to be skillwise  i have an artstation but i have not uploaded since forever 
any advice on how to improve the anatomy of the legs  they look weird  or advices in general i need tons
  you are completely right about the perspectivebeing kinda fucked i realized too late how the backpack is positioned wrong i sometimes stick too closely to the reference and forget to keep the bigger picture in mind but i am working on improvising more     i usually work on a3 for complete characters like that
i simplified the backgrounds on these two
i havent drawn anything for about a year felt motivated the other day so this is my first painting ive done in quite a while havent regressed too much i suppose
  do you have an insta
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh goddammit anna why didnt i get your number we held hands and everything aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh i am so lonely and horny
      dude sup
  not that guy but i could tell he was a dwarf this looks cool and that guy sounded like a /beg/ who didnt know what he was talking about nice modern take on a fantasy classic
  we wuz bad art and shiet
  insta buddykaroon  just made the blog minutes ago since i dont wanna reply to these msgs with no blog soz its a bit barren now but more to come promise
want to make an underground fist fighting comic r8 my anatomy plz
  like a weak 3/8 at the moment id say
  did a really quick op to to go along with the notes some of it comes down to taste but things like inventing muscles that dont exist or giving the guy what i presume to be 4 rib cages doesnt fly in my book  one major flaw in most of your work is that it all looks very flat and not in terms of painting or rendering but how you draw things study some perspective break down your uggos into basic shapes and make sure they enforce a sense of volume in everything you draw or paint most of your things feel really flat and 2d  and greatest advice if you want to draw weird lookin creatures and stuff study anatomy im quite bad at it myself but it helps a ton to know some ive noticed  gl boy
hit me
  overall the colors look rather muddy and it could use some better atmospheric perspective also the sky looks a bit too dark and the shadow the tank is casting is too dark for how soft the edges of the shadow are the rendering of and the effects around the tank look decent though
  yyou too thanks senpai
3 hour sketch embarrassingly long    is it bad
tonights project      i really like how soft this is reminds me a little of gta style art      sick
  not to be a douche but you need more loomis look at the facial features section of drawing the head and hands to learn how to simplify the eyes arent bad but could be better the nostrils need work and she should either be showing some details in the teeth with the size of her smile or you made the smile too big it also looks like you spent too much time noodling with the hair the proportions generally look good though so nice job there    im sure you also spend a lot of time cleaning up your lines since they look hairy try to make an effort to make more confident larger lines i know that takes time but you should definitely make it one of your goals
  not to be a douche    not at all in fact i didnt expect a critique this constructive god knows i would probably have started rendering that shit but oh well back to loomis    thank you for the crit anon
  bru wuts ur insta    i like this
  fantastic
hello brothers    for a small project i need your help    i need a picture of a nice coffe table with 2 used cups on it like a coffe cup and a tea cup mugs as if 2 individuals had coffee together    focused on the table and cups    just need to be simple and feel real    thank you very much
what are you paying
  everything i earned answering questions and helping others on 4chan

im making it rn op  however im holding the image hostage till you post a pic of a sharpie in your ass with a timestamp
  there you go op enjoy your a  that will be 50 bucks and a dick slap
  more wise cups please
  answers questions and helps others on 4chan  cant draw a basic fucking image using basic linear perspective    this is how strong your most active users on /ic/ are
  this sounds like the easiest project ever just watch a 10 minute youtube video on perspective and you are golden
  needs more loomis    i hope he made it
  i hope nobody actually believes this shit
  he needs to go back to /beg/
mid 3rd c
  came here to say this artist was ngmi  pretty piss poor pictures and proof desu
and then they decided jesus grew a beard
the great debate  jesus was actually a twink to start with
is there a better portable tablet for drawing than the ipad pro it looks so comfy and portable but it costs so much and i dont want to use it for anything besides drawing
  dont forget planned obsolescence
  look at those fat hands eugh
  try getting a refurb of the first gen or the 2018 normal ipad it can still use the pencil i wouldnt worry about any planned obsolescence nonsense because several people here seem to be using the first model just fine
i had a good time with this samsung tablet that had a stylus galaxy note 8 i think but i keep getting results for the phone pretty affordable and the pen worked well
a galaxy tablet with the stadetler s pen is awesome    the problem is that all the software sucks nothing beats procreate and csp
  its an old lady hand dont be mean
which are the phones you can draw on a link to a list maybe i got a kamvas 13 pro at home but i would like something i can take out of my pocket and sketch out for those often times i am in transit
  ipad is good but its second best art app procreate has a lot of stuff it still needs to catch up to csp they just added clipping masks in the latest update  and the first best app csp mobile is subscription based so you will be paying for it forever
  cant you pirate it where theres a will theres usually a way
samsung galaxy tab s4 is good
been thinking about getting a 64 gb 105 is that enough memory to run stuff like procreate should i get one with more memory or go cheaper and get a 32 gb 97
does this work with any kind of touch phones  
  the samsung chromebook pro has the same tech and its a damned sexy machine      the 2018 ipad is comfy as fuck and mine plus an apple pencil was just 350 i dont know of anything else in that price range thats nearly as good for drawing and general computing stuff
  not so easy on apple devices you gotta know exactly what youre doing since jailbreaking removes all security protocols i wouldnt risk it
  note 8 and note 9    just buy the 2018 ipad its almost the same as the pro only with a few limitations when you want to create very large files i just bought mine the last black friday and its pretty comfy desu
    i agree with this anon on the 2018 ipad even though i just bought the 2017 ipad pro a few days ago very little difference between the two however i went with the pro because of the display the slight difference in drawing with the pencil was a nice perk too    here are two great comparison videos between the ipad pro and the 2018 ipad            you can run procreate fine on both here is a good video about that    
  note 8 and note 9  thats all and nothing cheaper
      buy a fucking lenovo yoga 530 or hp envy x360    costs less and have more power
  ehhh id say thats preference i dont use clipping masks or other digital stuff like multiply layers which it has for someone that paints/draws in a very no nonsense manner its very nice and the one time 10 price is very cheap better gui for mobile device and overall more pleasant to use the only thing ill agree on is that in the same update it just got the option to resize the canvas
  well if you get that wacom pen for android devices you could use any phone or tablet as far as i know i just dont know how well they work
  i dont find the appeal in ipad/tablet sketching just get at cintiq or draw in a sketchbook
  i appreciate the help but i already have a tablet for drawing at home i was looking for a phone to have on the go not op      its because i was not sure how compatible is it and i wanted to know what options i have before i make the jump but since theres not i will buy the bamboo sketch thx
  no  just get an ipad 6th generation  theyre just as good as a pro for half the price the screen sucks meme is just retard propaganda    the pencil works great and the screen looks great    if you have 300 buy it
i bought an ipad 6th gen to supplement my 10 year old cintiq    the apple pencil is pretty fucking amazing i can actually use it on its side like a regular pencil unlike wacom only thing i dont like is the glass surface but apparently theres some screen protector that add more texture    if astropad was on windows id probably never look at another cintiq especially since the ipad is like less than half the price even with the pencil
can somebody draw a football helmet on this stick figure i cannot for the life of me get one that looks halfdecent thank you
bpd comics
i want to punch that motherfucking bunny in its bunny face fuck that bunny and whoever made those    also dumb thread post this shit on  or something
i enjoy reading these but depending on how many levels of irony there are the artist may either have a really good sense of humor or be a total asshole
  this isnt bpd this is just how every female thinks and operates
the comic art is cute but i feel i cant appreciate it fully because i lost 4 years of my life with a bpd partner and some effects physical and emotional are still present    keep it up op show the world how disgusting bpd is and how its fucking stupid is to try and appease them maybe less people will be put in the same position i was
is there more i tried googling and getting nothing
my favourite retarded bunny on the internet  please make more comics about fat childhood
  some landwhale from reddit that keeps trying to become internet famous by copying nekojiru and spamming it on /fit/
  i really enjoy this art and wish it was all hosted in one place so i didnt have to scavenge for it
  they have a deviantart apparently  
  this is art and critique can you stop posting this same thread on every board you think it will gain traction on also quit samefagging
  
  10/10
  bpd hrt scz
  made me look up what bpd actually is sounds very familiar to the behavior of some people i know
  kek
i always wonder if bpd shouldnt just be classified as assholes
i dropped out of a psych degree because current academia dogpiles anyone who tries to further research on bpd and manic depression because apparently they affect 80 more women than men or something and thats sexist    so yeah its better off to let the people most likely to commit sustained domestic violence and the people most likely to commit suicide go unmedicated and unthreated because theyre women
  that doesnt make any sense  the sexist part i mean wouldnt that be even more of a reason for researching and look into it just because it affects women more and shit
  whoa how bad was it ive heard some stories of people with similar issues being unfit partners
  youre not very aware of the history of mental health
  im honestly not surprised i recently just learned that why women have abnormal symptoms to things like heart attacks is because the norm was to only study men then apply that info to everyone so even with women having normal symptoms for women theyre left unstudied and considered atypical
  do you have a blog or anything you gyopo subhuman
  to put it lightly to this day i got panic attacks/nervous breakdowns major trust issues and gastritis due to what i was put through    it might sound harsh but i think bpd people not getting treatment for it shouldnt be alive imo and the ones that are still should avoid being in relationships as much as possible    going from loveydovey to manipulative and overwhelmingly abusive is something that can happen at any time and due to people with bpd being mostly women partners often dont seek help whether they are male or female unless something big happens early on in a relationship its easy to write female bad behavior off as shes having one of those days until all the shit youre put through is the norm and youre stockholmed beyond seeing that no relationship should be like that
  women are way less likely to commit suicide or abuse anybody than men are tho not sure what you mean by dogpiling but it sounds like what you really want to be researching is schizophrenia if you feel like youre being persecuted every time someone says something disagreeable to you
  women are way less likely to abuse anybody  statistically false  also nice resentful adhom at the end though
  bpd anon here male    you need to be the right person who handle someone with bpd i am very conscious of how i act however i cannot actually stop myself from doing it its a pure gut reaction motivated by a lot of underlying insecurity anxiety and terror my exgirlfriend was terrible at properly handling me and would do shit that she knew would deliberately set me off and then go wah wah why are you the way that you are current gf is the perfect tard wrangler for me she is extremely emotionally perceptive can almost predict my thoughts and feelings exactly and knows how to soothe me perfectly    when im with her i dont get the feeling that i need to do something to warrant her attention like putting on fake crying act or just start a fight because i want her attention to be on me even if its negative i feel like she feels the same way about me that i feel about her and that is the absolute most important thing because i would never leave her and if i know she will never leave me i have nothing to worry about
  i agree with the last 2 boxes
  ah thanks asking because im with someone whos clearly some form of messed up in the head spectrum either bpd or bipolar or something and as the other anon said i basically have to be a full time tard wrangler because they cant afford meds right now it can be pretty exhausting at times  i see a lot of the switching between sweet and callous moods along with clear insecurity driven mood swings/behavior even saying/doing shit they know will provoke me  my current method is to just kind of ignore how dumb theyre being until they realize its not getting them attention and they stop sperging out  when they were on anxiety meds during a brief period of medical coverage they were a lot easier to deal with but i still wonder if they need mood stabilizers on top of that though im worried that theyll be too drugged up and just be in a fog if they have to take multiple things
  please go read a fucking book friend women abusers being taken less seriously is not the same as them abusing less
  less likely to actually successfully commit suicide you mean they are way way more likely to attempt it they just suck and pretend to actually kill themselves because they want attention
i found their yt i think they might be a girl  
  i bet it also has to do with the definition of bpd being deemed sexist in the first place because that way you deem more women than men mentally ill so unless you change the definition enough so that its 5050 its illegitemate or some ideological bullshit like that
  6 views  wait are you the one who made these
  women in general are more prone to enjoy feeling miserable and want to be nursed and arouse pity when they feel down hence the term the weaker sex men are expected to swallow it down / walk it off / get over it
  seriously this women constantly bitch about how men dont open up yet they refuse to understand how vulnerable that makes us look i get this is off topic but this thread has basically done this
  the thing is after all this fighting to change the way we view genders introduce a true balance in the work space elevate the respect for women while bashing men with terms like rape culture toxic masculinity and mansplaning the present day feminism really only means to confirm gender stereotypes in all the right places   eg men should pay for dinner and be courteous be financially altruistic at all times in a relationship from the first date to marriage to giving exceedingly more than 50 in case of a divorce men are supposed to be the strong part the safe haven in a relationship while women have every right to give up chores that were previously deemed a female stereotype like cooking cleaning and laundry     again this comes back full circle on the victim culture that feminism has furthered in the past years if you are an unstable reckless manic type of woman you can brush it off saying you have bpd and people need to be more tolerant and forgiving   people proudly announce selfdiagnosed mental illnesses the same way as kids used to collect badges on their backpacks in the 90s  its completely acceptable and fashionable these days to say you are deeply troubled and unable to change
i always thought that the male equivalent for a borderline diagnosis was sociopathy  which is funny because people like to believe aspd is way worse than bpd but in the long run both have a lot of comorbid symptoms and personality quirks if you bother to read about it
bpd artist here ask me anything
  what do you think about these posts        
  what does it feels to be emotionally broken and for your psyche to ruin all the possible relationships you may have in the future
  bpd is disgusting and im happy enough that i have the self awareness to attempt to control my emotional outbursts rather than most other borderline women that demand humanity accept them for who they are and continue their toxic behaviors without guilt or intention to stop      feels bad man i emotionally blunt myself with prescriptions and refuse to enter romantic relationships despite how hard i idealize someone because i know i will fuck it up
  looks like your typical runofthemillnihilisticpostironicintentionallypoorlydrawnhipsterwebcomic    spusk
off topic to some extent but i personally feel that bpd is just a made up disorder that sells pills to people who are anxious towards failure rejection and general feelings of discomfort because they never had opportunities to fuck up so royally so they now have to go through life feeling like theyre perfectionists when in reality they are egotists that are products of their coddled environment    t 28yo clinically diagnosed with bpd at 22 went off meds after going through a divorce and have never been happier    seriously i dont care if im sad every once in a while im just happy i can be happy again
  heads up anon depending on where you are and what doctors you are asigned to its really a crapshoot these days so many false diagnoses and partly even influenced by the biased scientific environment at the moment that suggests that we all have at least one but mostly several mental illnesses i recently learned that apparently i have misophonia there is an icd10 definition for literally every little thing you can get upset about     way too many meds fed to unknowing people when in reality the only pressing problem is that so many people have no good friends to talk to
  when in reality they are egotists that are products of their coddled environment    nah i grew up in a home where my mother was never there because of shift work and my father was always there because he worked from home father was a massive cunt to me and only me not my two siblings just me but he wouldnt do it when my mother was around    the product of that environment is having someone who desperately feared his mother leaving him and his siblings neglecting him so they wouldnt get caught up in the trouble too    you couldnt get a more perfect environment to produce bpd
  anon bpd is real even if you were falsely diagnosed with it   i wont go near people with it any more there was a guy in my highschool with it and another in my work place several years later but both it took me a long time until i was told why they were so fucking difficult to deal with they both followed the pattern of one day being your best friend the next just not showing up or even hitting you when you try to talk to them and both at some point disappeared for a length of time before showing up with shaved heads the one from my high school dated a girl i knew and it later came out that he would literally threaten to kill himself when she didnt feel like sex because it made him feel rejected and so he was pretty much raping her all the time because she was so scared by his outbursts that she would just let him do whatever after she got the courage to break up with him he would randomly try and hit us up for information about her even a year after   bpd is real and those people are broken
      you were misdiagnosed  ianad btw
  threaten to kill himself when she didnt feel like sex because it made him feel rejected    wew scarily like me then im     i fucking love sex not just for the physical pleasure or the mental dominance/submission but just being so physically close to the person and having their attention solely being on you and what youre doing better than crack    i would get very pouty and feel very rejected like the other person hated me if they said no to sex its a difficult thing because i experience these emotions during sex which make me want sex more and more because it makes me feel very loved but other people dont experience these emotions or just not as strongly and it distresses me because it makes me think why dont you want to be close to me do you not want to love me have i done something wrong are you trying to hurt me    its a wild ride havent had sex in over a year though so
  not them but source i looked it up and from what ive seen studies do prove that
  thank you for not burdening other people
  thank you for recognizing my efforts i feel as though thats really what i long for the most in relationships and im never fulfilled so i disassociate completely    i dont like the other art i made for bpd but i have art of my and friends ocs that i idealized in the past some i dont talk to anymore
  x is just a made up disorder that sells pills to people who are y  anon you might just have cracked the code
porn for a friend because i was practicing i wanted to turn him on and give me attention
favorite person and is ocs i dont really have romantic feelings for him anymore but i think he thinks we are still dating hes the man i want to marry and have a family with but i know for sure ill fuck him up so bad and i dont know if i can handle that
okay you can stop attention whoring your art now no more yous for you
  oksorry
good girl
                are you fflirting anon
what in the flying fuck is this thread besides a bunch of first world adult children talking about how they cant stop projecting their selfcentered insecurities on people while somehow coming out morally righteous because hurr im on meds and trying my best
finally get my shit together and start drawing pencil and paper  really like portraits so focus on that  naturally taking time to even come close to achieving likeness  actually start to get decent likeness  woohooo wheres le artistic vision ur just copying thats not good art    why does this sentiment exist is it nothing more than cope for not being able to achieve likeness not even talking about hyperrealism here just actually resembling the person youre drawing
trying to teach you to be an artist when you need to be taught how to draw
  different skill levels warrant different critiques a beginner will get critiqued on fundies but a master is more likely to be critiqued on abstract or preferential terms dont worry about these things right now most amateur artists just draw whatever they think is neat looking anyways
  keep on drawing anon
  its most likely because youre literally just copying the lines instead of thinking of the forms underlying them  no matter how pixelperfect you are itll always look flat when you do that  keep at it for now but at some point youll want to learn how to do it properly  drawabox is good for the basics of construction
  if you are being critiqued on that its a good thing it means its time to think about a style choose what lines to keep and which to drop or start working with color
can i be a mangaka
  if that anatomical abomination is good enough then sure why not
  most mangaka are /beg/ shounen are barely above the test but only because they have to know something about human anatomy for drawing action scenes as well as cars and shit you can be a mangaka as long as youre japanese
  everything is fine except for the pens beng too high and everything above the collar bone
  its stylised
why do you have to ask you can be whatever you want just put in the effort
  i think as long as your story is good the level of art skill is not important like the guy that made the original one punch man
i had the oportunity to see little childrens artwork and i think the drawings are cute so what do you think all drawings was made around a story made by the teacher
so much innocence and purity its like im looking at /i/ _
its over
you lighted my heart up theyre all soo cute
hes playing rushambu instead of drawing
wat
what the fuck is rushambu
  aqua im going to fuck you so hard you little slut spread those cheeks
  why is aqua one of the most sexiest if not the sexiest anime girl to ever have graced the anime world in almost a decade
  great post op you sure showed everyone what a badass you are well done
  its that stanky fat ass
  she has autism and you relate to her indefinitely
  its another i wanted to draw all day but ended up doing jackshit because the internet exists episode
playing wow instead of practicing   got finals  life is pain
why arent you guys tracing
  i meant this pic
  im already tracer 3c
because i dont care if it takes me longer but i want to do everything by myself and not just use crutches
  what about widowmaker
  nuuuueeerffff bastion
  because tracing is obvious by any trained eye and shows a distinct lack of form or gesture
  yeah but  is successful and traces
  shes a real artist youre just jealous not every good artist traces go back to drawing anime
  this
  is successful    i wouldnt call her a success all she can do is copy from photographs thats very fucking limited anon and if anyone challenges her shell crumble unless you think having a roof over your head is success i dont know how you call her successful
  i dont believe in grids or tracing i work free hand all the time i dont even sketch out and fill in the colours like a lot of oil painters jack vettriano for example i battle out the whole thing art needs freedom for things outside of the artist to be allowed to happen the more an artist rules out chance the less likely acts of inspiration are in the process
  i think having 16k followers and an army of normies to defend her from any criticism
  cuz is a waste of time
ok serious question bc im relatively new here    do you guys define tracing as literal tracing ie using tracing paper or an opaque layer on ps or just copying solely from a pic genuinely curious
  this is great  you put all the renaissance masters to shame with their petty sketching and working out problems and composition before their paintings and sculptures
  copying from a pic using your eyeballs is referencing
  you trace parts or whole  tracing  you use measurements and make a 1 to 1 copy of photo  copying or studying  you use a photo or multiple photos so you know what the subject looks like but paint them in a original pose  reference
  roof over your head  tons of followers who will white knight for you  likely bills are covered and have disposable income to fuck around with    not to argue but what is your measure of success even i dont know how much more successful you can be if youre an artist and you can sustain yourself solely through your craft
      normie infestation
cause i want to have fun also if i want realism ill just start photography
  of course
  wojak
    thanks anons just making sure im not slowing my progress 
  go home wannabe zoomer
  tracing is not drawing    an unexperienced artist tracing will make a bad looking picture    a well trained artist will use tracing to make a good picture    turns out the skill of drawing isnt in tracing at all

questions that dont deserve their own thread thread    ill start where can i find a copy of design doll
i mean a crack for it
  how the fuck do you draw dynamic lineart in sai i tried different brushes with different settings and they all look appealing when tested but when i actually start on my piece they look dull and lifeless is there some trick to it to make my lines seem more natural
  post some examples anon we cant solve your problems in a vacuum
  how do i stop two colors bleeding into each other despite the fact that im using the lasso tool
    see 
    oops i thought i attached it
  did you invert selection is it on a different layer did you lock opacity
  invert  theyre two layers lineart and color  i dont think so
what does it mean when you guys say grind your fundies     read the books over and over again
  do the exercises
  does that really help right now i just draw from photos
  i cant figure out what youre doing from a cropped still image but i bet you can solve your problem by adding flatting to your workflow and making selections that way    try this     or this 
  i lassoed the skin area so that i can start shaing the skin but it acts like im blending with the hair i never has this problem in ps does that make more sense
    this guy is having the same issue
i recently lost all of my reference photos and im looking for a particular set of paintings of car crashes that i saved from /ic/ years ago    they were all done by the same artist one was a white car wrapped around a a light pole it was a painting set at night another had a blurry form of a bloody person falling out of the door of a open car door after the crash    i believe there was another with a car that had hit a guard rail    all were set at night and had an atmosphere similar to the painting ive posted here
      then i think you should lock transparent pixel or create a clipping layer on top of the base colors
  reading the books/watching videos will do virtually nothing for you whats important is that you draw so when someone says grind loomis what i would do is open a loomis bookor pdf because /ic/ is generous of with free books and skim over the text to understand it but more importantly copy every drawing in the book and try to absorb the information it is trying to convey the reason you have to grind fundies instead of just learning it once like a rendering trick is that fundamentals need to be subconscious so that they can make all your work high quality accurate etc because most artists dont draw a bunch of loomis heads bone structures and perspective lines on all their drawings its internalized
this is a wip am i still beg tier
  grids  below /beg/ actually
  please dont listen to     as a exercise its fine theres nothing glaringly wrong with the portrait without looking at your ref post your ref grids train you to evaluate angles and spacial relationships within a subject eventually you want to be able to do without the scaffolding and be able to see/correct relationships within you drawing from life but theres nothing wrong with using them unlike what some puritanical anons will tell you
    i meant 
  phil hale
how do i get good at drawing torsos angled away from the viewer    its so fucking hard to draw i cannot for the life of me understand how shoulders upper arms backs and torsos above the bellybutton change shape as a shirtless person is rotated and angled away from the viewer    i draw it all wrong at something like a 45 deg angle away from viwer my brain keeps fucking up i draw the far away shoulder way more visible that it should be and then as a result i draw the rest of the upper body as if it was facing almost right at the viewer
  youre fairly off likeness wise so far really watch those proportions especially in the jaw and nose which youve shrunk it also feels like youre filling in some details with what you think is there instead of observing especially the eyes which has that almond symbol look rather than her eye    you can do a trace to get a feel for how to draw the portrait then return to the grid with the tracing as reference if that helps you can also either    flip the image upside down draw from that   find animal shapes recognizable shapes that you can use to abstract what you see and focus on proportion and angle ie the bridge of her nose  forehead and temples form a bird or whatever you can come up with
  also forget about value for a bit focus solely on capturing her likeness in line only
whats his endgame
how do i politely tell people to fuck off with a specific request when im at gigs    have gig today  selling polished turd animu prints and onsite sketches  normies buying them because theyre normies and cant tell the difference  one guy comes along and asks for 2 sketches  black guy with broken english so i already have a bad feeling  wants his fucking kids  always that one fucker at every gig  but wants them as superheroes as if that makes it easier  of course theyre fucking black too i suck at drawing black people  power level for drawing whites is okay but its hard for me to capture elements that make black people look like black people without making it look like a glorified racist cartoon  agree to do it because its been kinda slow up to that point  lose out on money because it takes me 45 minutes each for his dumb ass kids when a regular deadpool or poison ivy would have taken maybe 15 minutes each for the same price  ended up staying an hour longer than expected because i didnt put my foot down    how do i tell them no to things like this everything i have hanging up is weeb shit or video game shit so i feel like that should be enough to ward these jackasses away but it never is but i cant be a dick because the tables are so close together and i dont want it to affect anybodys opinion of me what would you say in this situation
  literally just say im sorry but thats a little outside the scope of what im offering i can do thing instead though its not that hard anon
  also if you dont want to disappoint someone theres no harm at all in telling that person that their request would cost more money on account of time spent and opportunity cost sell yourself as a professional anon
  im glad i went to college and got an engineering degree
    i did make an attempt to defend myself by saying something similar to that but he was only halfway paying attention to me and talking to somebody else but im still to blame for not being assertive enough to say no i guess in hindsight it really is as easy as you say looks like im just a spineless bitch      i have an actual job i just do this as a hobby for local gigs i just hate when people ask for realism and shit good job though engineering is hard according to my friends who dropped out not sarcasm
  is this something that can be done with anatomy books as well
any ipad owners that could tell me how much storage is good enough if i wanna get one for drawing
  ic  depends if you want to record yourself with procrate get a big one otherwise an average one is fine
  i have but it does not to prevent colors outside of the selection to blend through im wondering what is the point of the tool if i cant lock into that area
im doing figure studies and the features of the face always come out utter shit im working on standard printer paper so i dont have much real estate to draw on the face and i think this is my biggest issue any tips on how to draw the face in a satisfactory way in small scale or should i just use larger canvases
  depends on what you mean as satisfactory if you want 100 likeness and all the shadows and shit than larger canvas is the only way if you just want the face not look like complete shit than look to cartoons and comics to see how you can simplify some parts of the face when the size of the drawing gets smaller
probably been asked a lot before but whats the best software for drawing is there a list somewhere with all the differences
are there any types of materials or books i should look into if i want to learn how to draw in a retro illustrative style i really like this type of art and would like to replicate it digitally

does anyone know whats wrong with my csp  i keep getting lag when i put down and move my pen resulting in shit like this ps and sai works fine
is there a good nude anatomically correct poseable 3d model out there to use as a reference if not maybe downloading a 3d program and use an anatomically correct model in it just want to get familiar with real proportions instead of drawing from imagination with the wrong anatomy
is there any good nonwacom nonsurface standalone tablet  huion doesnt seem to have any
  this   i think you should work on making your lines more fluid and your shading more even/confident focus on blocking in solid greys instead of blending for now those are the biggest things making you look beg right now  but your proportions are good and youre on the right track
how the hell do you plan drawings like this
just got gifted a 2in1 laptop with win10 whats a good stylus with pressure/rotation sensitivity would a wacom art pen work with a nonwacom tablet

any decent drawing app for android with low latency
  yeah but a lot will depend on what tablet/phone youre using sketchbook pro ibis paint x infinite painter all work for me
  trying infinite painter thanks its really fun and the latency feels manageable are there any smoothing options though whenever i draw lines slowly they become very wavy
study and drawing from imagination  vs  drawing from reference model sheet    anyone with experience in this area can share words on the subject    if i study a character for example i can draw it from any angle/ perspective as i know all that is there    if not i can only draw from reference the face especially having to check against an official source to match the detail    what is the pros and cons of each route  if i wanted to not only draw my own comics but do allot of r34 content of various characters on model for the most part what do    ty anons in advance
    nevermind found it
  draw from reference to learn your subject/anatomy then draw your subject from imagination to reinforce what youve learned and figure out what you dont know both drawing from reference and imagination go hand in hand
  peter draws
  every time i draw from reference i end up doing a carbon copy of it i only draw from reference because thats what im supposed to i guess but i find that i spend too much time assessing small details and it doesnt really help me draw anything new whats the point of drawing carbon copies how does this help me improve
  it wont help you if youre a brainlet with no critical thinking or analyzation skills the purpose of a finished copy in my eyes is to learn about proportions value relationships and edges if you arent internalizing how form works while youre drawing youve wasted your time
  i do at first but then before i know it i get too caught up copying the values without thinking about why theyre there and obviously lots of times the lighting in the reference is poor so i cant make out why certain areas are in shadow
what is photobashing
  photobashing is a technique where artists merge  blend photographs or 3d assets together while painting and compositing them into one finished piece this is used by concept artists to speed up their workflow and achieve a realistic style    google is your friendo
  
  choosing a reference with good lighting is critical for study hate to shill but either get nma and download the thousands of reference images they offer or try to a find an upload of it somewhere those references should last you a lifetime

how do i convince my parents to help me with art school i actually had to pay my way through a semester in italy and my parents helped with rent and food which they held against me for over a year i went to community college after i got back for 2 semesters classes were okay compared to italy but by 2nd semester i was absolutely over it and theres just not a good selection of art classes at a community college    art schools in america are too expensive but my parents just dont see art as a real career even though ive made 80 oil paintings this year and paint almost every other day now were moving to a place where theres literally no colleges that teach art except a community college that has an acrylics class and my dad is telling me to keep my chin up and make the best of things

whats a good easy to set up webcomic theme for tumblr im currently stressing the fuck out trying to set up simple webcomic theme v4 which supposedly allows you to load button images for previous next first and last tumblr being fucking tumblr nothing works its totally fucked    anyone got a better one the simpler the better
  in my experience webcomic threads on /ic/ dont seem to get a lot of attention    have you considered asking a tumblr artist with a webcomic its not like they can smell the 4chan on you
  have fun getting all of your shit flagged
whats your attitude towards drawing  i see a lot of talk about art as an ultimate passion but pretty much all the people i know who draw on a regular basis myself included treat it more as a hobby or a fun distraction than some kind of calling  is being so lukewarm a general attitude or is something fucked up there
art is the kind of thing that you either do as a hobby or have something you wish to make and love the grind
  i treat it as something i want to get good at    its work that i like
its a creative outlet theres many to choose from its a good one because everyone understands the concept of art and can relate to the process because practically every kid doodled once before
i treat it about the same way as video games its something i enjoy but i dont want to do it professionally and i dont really gain anything from it
its the only thing im somewhat good at so ive had to make a living out of it somehow these days its getting harder theres more competition more social media related anxiety i do illustration fulltime so every day i try to draw for a couple of hours at least but the results are measly and im not getting as many replies to emails as i used to i like to draw in general but its not something i genuinely enjoy anymore its just a job
going into art as a job is for chumps so im gonna siphon patreonbux making art for a game thatll never come out while i do my real job
  instead of getting paid for art i get paid for art on top of my job  a gentleman and a scholar
i got an idea its been years that i draw but never seriously and i have taken to many bad habits now that i want to draw seriously  should i restart to zero with my shitty left hand draw with right hand actualy maybe it will train my brain to take good habits this time
who here has learned to draw with the weak hand 
thats not how habits work lmao please dont draw with your left hand youve probably lost most of your drawing skill along with bad habits if its been over two or three years just start slow and be careful to form good habits this time
what does /ic/ think about glitch art like this its ben shapiro if hes too distorted to be able to tell

how is this art exactly you took a pic and added a bunch of filters to it
now that is epic
  im logged into the mainframe
how did peter mohrbacher reach this level of success sure hes technically good but there are others that cant paint like him that dont have near the same success on patreon or otherwise
  im sure most of his patrons are table top and magic card gamers
    i see that makes sense so basically he hasnt built his brand from the ground up as a indepedent artist but as someone people associate with the magic brand
only 8k for someone that well known meanwhile sakimichan rakes in about 40k per month
    8k isnt exactly being on the verge of poverty either
ive been watching one fantastic week for quite a few years now and most of peters success comes from going to conventions and selling at artist alleys if you listen to the show him and sam do youd hear about him slowly increasing sales throughout the years and using things like mailing lists to build and retain a customer base spending lots of money to buy larger and larger booth spaces with an ever improving quality setup to attract new customers as to why angelarium as a product is so successful who knows fantasy products are fairly popular and have been for a while again its the common theme ic misses technical ability alone isnt the beallendall of selling your art    mohrbacher actively talks about how much he hated working for magic and i dont even think hes gone to gps or done magic cards for 4 for 5 years im sure some people who know him from magic followed him to this new work but the guy has obviously worked to build a new customer base through selling at 10 to 20 conventions a year for 10plus years it would be very difficult to reproduce his level of success simply by sitting at your computer chair at home unless something about your artwork was highly compelling or desirable or you did a lot of freelance work for highpaying clients in movie advertising or television hes obviously worked to build the business not just sat in a room and studied how to paint hands better for 5 years    i think its pretty safe to assume he has built 90 of his business from the ground up he may have had a small boost in the beginning from his magic work but theres no way enough people would recognize him solely from that to account for all of the money he makes he also doesnt do porn so its understandable that he wouldnt be making more than saikimichan the patreon revenue is only one source of income he still has the kickstarter  prints and other products sales along with conventions
  thats just his patreon dont forget in the recent years if you listen to one fantastic week pete will talk about making 10 k from selling at a conventions consistently     if he does 5 to 10 of those a year that could be as much as a 100k in profit just from that one aspect of his business in recent episodes id say the past year hes now set his business up so he doesnt even go to the conventions to sell anymore he has assistance that do that for him so hes making enough to pay an individual a high enough salary that they will work for him so you can be rest assured hes not just making 8k on patreon a month    part of the problem with people on here is they think you can just sit behind your computer practicing how to paint feet for a couple of years and somehow build a business for yourself theres a lot of other aspects that go into making a decent living off your art other than just learning how to make art especially if you want to be an independent creator making your own products and selling them like this guy does i should all go search one fantastic week and listen to the stuff they talk about youll get far more information about the business of selling art than you ever will listening to people on this board
    like most business his success wasnt over night    hes been dedicated to his art and business for probably over a decade now     i remeber he had a tutorial video o n photoshop that was back around 2006 and the content was better than most standards today    also hes a cool guy and super nerdy did work for mtg which helped a lot undoubtedly
haters are going to die of cancer edition    itt ill be posting things im working on and soliciting anons to tell me what theyd do to improve the paintings im not necessarily asking for anons to tell me whats wrong with them if they dont have any solutions or ideas on what to do next on them     future focused thread bing bang bong
  whats wrong  it looks like shit you use to much blue and have zero understanding of values it looks flatter than a pancake  solution  stop using so much blue and learn your fundies
need to do more midtones and highlights next probably gonna keep stacking strokes until its all blended to get her
  it looks like shit  this means nothing   you use too much blue   this is accurate particularly for this year  and have zero understanding of values  this means nothing  it looks flatter than a pancake  what does the op     also not that i dont disagree that it largely is pretty flat but when it comes to the stacatto strokes memes theyre all connected to what i imagine images that imprint into your brain when youre dying may look like like your mind is eroding as your brain rots and this image is the last thing you see them coming off as kind of 2d images burned onto the canvas is something im consciously aware of but even then id say theres some definition in the gal gadot meme that i was happy with wear it was going   stop using so much blue   this is the year where i abuse whites and for a lot of reasons this has turned into the year where everything is super blued plus the whole process is starting with blues and stacking purps then reds then yellows then highlights  and learn your fundies  explain what youre referring to
are her eyes meant to be closed or opened    the style of the teeth and gums looks out of place
3699508  the retard hasnt responded in hrs    i think that means they have finally been banned  thank fuck hahahaha hallelujah
  wow you are getting worse
  good luck to you mang  let the haters keep on hating
  using so much blue on an otherwise green yellow orange and pink palette make the characters look theres no colors that balence the picture perhaps using even more nuetral colors could help but in this picture the art gives off a muddy vibe and the blues on the face unfortunately look like veins and such making the characters look sick i think you would benefit from less odd color choices at least for a while  that is to try to get colors as close to the otigibal as possible as for other critique i think you need to practice lighting perhaos its because of the bizzare color schemes but the lack of lighting is almost disorenting you could add so much to your art if you had clear and dynamic light sources
  oh damn nigga that is fuckin hip and radical  you know i know slayin bitches left and right with yo funny ass memes my dude
  oh please god i was going to avoid posting at all but if he doesnt respond at all i want to laugh at him while he cant respond to me
i never reply to your stuff but this is seriously triggering    okay why make a thread if you wont even listen to the critique you literally ask for and instead attack it and defend yourself saying it means nothing hes telling you exactly how to improve your paintings stop abusing blues look at the thumbnails of all your damn paintings theyre unreadable garbage and then when you expand them it doesnt help at all because as anon mentioned you have no understanding of values aka formsyou are not thinking in terms of 3d shapes at all you can use all the grids you want and build all your stupid ass clay models but if you dont understand forms and you dont practice your fucking fundies your stuff will always end up looking flat and unappealing    so the solution fucking start doing figure drawing studies fucknig actually try to get good or stop posting asking for critique you wont listen to
  muh fundies  do you realize how many excellent painters have no real understanding of form you should learn about how art is made outside of the concept design world
  how do you fix this guys garbage then
    havent been banned just been doing rdr2 online obsessively and not doing anything productive forgot i started this thread tbphwyf  i was going to avoid posting at all but if he doesnt respond at all i want to laugh at him while he cant respond to me  lol wimp
  okay why make a thread if you wont even listen to the critique you literally ask for and instead attack it and defend yourself saying it means nothing  depends on what were talking about idk like everyone loves to cirlejerk about reeeing about what is wrong when im kind of always much more interested in just saying what i should do on them next time to make them better or whatever hearing the same generic muh fundies memes is just boring and generally not super applicable     like i appreciate things like  because theyre getting into more than just saying that muh fundamentals are dumb   you are not thinking in terms of 3d shapes at all  like when you say this its annoying of course i am hyperbolic absolutes are meaningless
  define areas of the painting with distinct value ranges and make sure the only paint that goes in that area falls within that value range allow some interplay between values at the edges of the areas but keep it pretty limited you can still have an interesting mix of different tone/value within a single area but it should be within a well defined range    try to maintain consistency between the relative value of different parts of the face unexpected contrast makes faces in particular look unnatural so its pretty important that if one area is darker than another in the reference that that relationship be maintained    actually forget all that hes a faggot and should go spend countless hours freehand sketching ellipses if he wants to be good at painting
  i like this one looks like you put more creativeness into it
pls go to tumblr and do not come back
  spoilerslol/spoilers
desu i feel your technique would be far more interesting if these werent just repainted reaction images you patterned brushwork in isolation is really interesting to look at some of the best work ive seen from you has been of subjects i dont recognize all subjective of course i feel like your potential is limited based on the reproducibility of the reference you are using which is a shame i know you use grids which is cool but do you have any work where you havent used grids and painted from life or even if you used a grid was it at least a life painting
   some of the best work ive seen from you has been of subjects i dont recognize  i agree probably like when im working on something im care about i often either try and play it safe and fuck it up or get anxious after doing any effort and stall with working on it anymore but when its just some random reaction of someone i dont really even care about i tend to try more weird shit and a lot of the hangups go away   i feel like your potential is limited based on the reproducibility of the reference you are using which is a shame  yeah as im shifting out of the peasant painting period where ive been primarily focused on memes and reaction images solicited on 4chan i have started to focus on ideas that dont involve proportional copies of images i dont own   i know you use grids which is cool but do you have any work where you havent used grids  well i mean 90 of year one was fucking graphite transfers but 3040 of them were hand drawn without gridding
   and painted from life  not really   or even if you used a grid was it at least a life painting  done life drawings in 2018 but no paintings my first attempt at a selfie meme was done by taking 2 pictures and photoshopping them together and doing the normal grid technique     got 35 more sefportraits to go for muh van gogh race though and most of them will be either handdrawn to canvas from life and then handpainted to canvas with no underdrawing
  this is how it goes he has no skills so he paints memes but painting memes is a little boring in itself so he builds up this whole schtick around painting memes juxtaposing it with van gogh and whatever he can grab to make this thing that looks like an art project now he has this giant house of cards artproject more or less constructed around the fact that he has no actual skills the story takes an interesting twist when the protagonist discovers he actually has the skill to make regular paintings what will he choose the house of meme cards propped up by drugs and a web of of literally nothings or will he leave the fantasy to pursue the fragment of actual skill that has appeared
  pretty good memes for the first 2 paragraphs
  fair enough btw this is coming from a guy who has criticized you in the past for what its worth ive come around to see value in your work i just hope you dont stagnate because i feel youve got potential
  this is how it goes he has no skills so he paints memes  heck yeah its popular and relevent subject matter that you can experiment and learn with cant develop skillz by doing nothing and by painting memes even if you fuck up theres still audience interest in the subject and the shittiness may even add an irony factor   but painting memes is a little boring in itself  i mean its less boring 2 me than like still lives or scapes   so he builds up this whole schtick around painting memes juxtaposing it with van gogh and whatever he can grab to make this thing that looks like an art project   i mean the van gogh thing is and has been pretty connected to the whole endeavor since the get go whole decision to make it a fulltime effort happened in the van gogh museum   now he has this giant house of cards artproject more or less constructed around the fact that he has no actual skills  eh more than you tho amirite  the story takes an interesting twist when the protagonist discovers he actually has the skill to make regular paintings what will he choose  i dont care about regular paintings its always been about the quest for a novel aesthetic   the house of meme cards propped up by drugs and a web of of literally nothings or will he leave the fantasy to pursue the fragment of actual skill that has appeared  both probably
  i have also critized you a lot but ive seen this one several times now and i actually like it
  not op but hes learning through experimentation also hes stated on multiple occasions that hes going for quantity to reach the body of work similar to van gogh by the end of the year
  are you his secretary or what lol
  no in fact if you werent a drooling retard you could figure out his intent by looking at his stroke technique and comparing that to latelife van gogh
  appreciate it sorry if i was a bozo before and part of the whole idea of scheduling for shifting focus to doing new things wrong every year within an overarching 3act structure where focus shifts to new subjects and mediums and stuff hopefully prevents too much stagnation      ive also spent most of this year looking at doing monthly themes to keep things spficy like there was unfuck august where i started no new canvasses and only worked on paintings i started that look like shit there was selftember where i was focused more on selfportraits and all sobriety and everything oktoberfest october im thinking next year ill do no paint november where i only work on drawings i halfcommitted this year i guess december is mostly focused on wrapping up the year and finding a satisfying conclusion to the timelapse journey     like ive got 6 years and 600 paintings to gogh hopefully it doesnt get too boring
  best of luck i honestly see the heavy van gogh influence and i absolutely love  and  since they both showcase that patterned brushwork only thing i could possibly recommend is having stronger positive space contrast since it might show off your strengths better also if you do more of these could you also include dates in the file name so its easier to differentiate between new work and older works
  more specifically this one  is where i see the positive space contrast helping since it doesnt have the patterned colors to break the piece up although i will say going back on my dates request i cant tell if this is older work or not so i dont even know if my rather small critique is even valid either way ive got my eye on you
  this samefagging is just pathetic
  did you know that the only person who truly knows that this isnt samefag is op did you also know that youre the only one who cares
  year one was graphite transfers  it sounds like youre autistically limiting yourself to methods of painting with the hope that they will inherently make you better what has using grids for the last year taught you what is the point of doing this you do realise painting is outcome based and your learning process doesnt matter as long as you learn everything properly and can consistently reproduce good work in a timely matter i want you to get better but it seems like youre at a war with yourself and this forum for no reason
  lol god luck you fucking faggot stay bad
  draw something from your imagination for once you dull onetrick pony
  bloody christ  ive seen this images popping from time to time in the threads but i thought it was a /ic/ meme not a deffensive autist thinking they are good    ill screencap this thread and save it for the days when i feel my art is bad
  kill yourself     kill yourself     kill yourself     kill yourself     kill yourself     kill yourself     kill yourself    kill yourself     kill yourself     kill yourself
  something good has to come from this madness
  not the guy but wouldnt there be two people in this thread who knows its not samefag however if it was samefagging only op would know aha    but seriously this may or may not be samefagging but im pretty sure you started samefagging liberally a few months back op
  do you just have a stack of these at your place seems sad
  it sounds like youre autistically limiting yourself to methods of painting with the hope that they will inherently make you better   idk about better just different its part of the idea of the quest for the novel aesthetic like you prop up all these rules and then develop ideas around them and start subverting them and spin out into the unknown   what has using grids for the last year taught you   i mean theyre great for getting a better understanding of space and framing and perspective and all that stuff plus theyre pretty standard practice for transferring an image to canvas its part of being a painter   you do realise painting is outcome based  eh i mean mostly  and your learning process doesnt matter as long as you learn everything properly   im learning improper things properly  and can consistently reproduce good work in a timely matter  not my bag   i want you to get better but it seems like youre at a war with yourself  there is only one enemy and it will be subverted and destroyed
  u wish u had a meme stacc boah
  u seem upset    wiiilll do    tldr    sorry ur upset my guy    ive samefagged essays about why im a piece of shit and stuff
  lmao he has been doing this for years which is sad he already stagnated a lot for whatever artistic endeavor he was probably trying to pursue
   have zero understanding of values  this means nothing  its funny that you think that but not unexpected with how all over the place your values are
ok here is my critique i painted over your drawing i didnt bother to finish it but you can see what i mean    1your proprotions are way off your ear is too small and your top of the head is too small  2avoid drawing all teeth and all skin folds looks ugly less is more  3be more careful about color theory skin looks dead and background isnt in harmony with skin      learn to draw before painting if your drawing is bad no amount of rendering will save case in point my overpaint didnt save it
  wat
  you pretty dense huh your paintings look like crap they make me ill to look at them for your own good do something else and stop being so stuck up
  seems like youre not going to make it and youre upset    i dont really get the meme rendering is an extension of drawing    this meme is informative and fun    you pretty dense huh   idk youre pretty upset huh   your paintings look like crap  really activates your almonds huh   they make me ill to look at them  thats pretty powerful just think that youll never make anything that physiologically affects anyone   for your own good do something else and stop being so stuck up  for your own good shoot yourself in the brain and then stop being a cancerous donothing naysayer do anything at all ya doingus
  i dont really get the meme rendering is an extension of drawing  look at your paintings and then look at your sketches
  look at your paintings and then look at your sketches  ok now what
  i think you should try putting less emphasis on skin folds and every little detail there is using black or near black tones to define them doesnt look good on your paintings in my opinon and its the main gripe i have with the stuff you post also a tad too much blue clashing with other colors as other anons have pointed out  keep painting anon
  delusional
  nvm  both bad you should take off both masks
  i dont really get the meme rendering is an extension of drawing  dont worry youll paint it and do a terrible job at it
      rude
    i think you should try putting less emphasis on skin folds and every little detail there is  yeah i should do a simple guy to break things up probably   using black or near black tones to define them doesnt look good on your paintings in my opinon and its the main gripe i have with the stuff you post  i feel you the black thing has been a recurring theme since the beginning  also a tad too much blue clashing with other colors as other anons have pointed out  yeah the idea behind it is that i eventually stack colors on top and it eventually blends to look more like skin but then i use weird blues and get lazy and theyre left incomplete when i get to the reds and yellows phase  keep painting anon  wiiiill do
  like most of the things i draw from imagination are connected to movie/story ideas ive had brewing in muh head for the last decade i dont spend a lot of time on them and theyre normally just like quick concept sketches and junk
  idk i kind of want to draw something from muh brain grapes today but nothing is jumping out at me
  why is it so hard for you consider your art is bad its not even original youre just painting memes badly
  why is it so hard for you consider your art is bad  i dont really care if it is i value production itself wrote a haiku about it  nothing is perfect  and anything is better  time is entropy      its not even original  id venture to argue that very few people would be able to replicate my aesthetic   youre just painting memes  yeah there are very few meme painters there were even less 2 years ago and there will be hundreds more in the coming years its funny to me to see you jump from its not even original to youre just doing something that nobody else thought to do   badly  does it upset you that the standards that you use to justify why you do nothing dont effect me like these threads are ideally about you helping a belligerent dipshit make art better this idea that you need to obsess about how bad i am and basically just refuse to do anything itt other than whine about it is kind of weird to me it always just screams that youre super insecure about your own shit and youre kind of blatantly projecting the cognitive dissonance you feel about yourself at me     like how often do you choose not to do something for fear of it ending up being bad
thinking about this contraption again     think itll be too much of a hassle to try and build it around being able to use any of my 11x14 canvasses maybe i should build one first thats designed to work with 8x10s     and then for memes that it could work for i was just thinking about fight club and how much of a edgy faggot i was about that movie and book when i was a tween and i should make something about it and that led back to the joi box     so like i could do a bunch of different cartridges kind of like a floppy disk or n64 kind of aesthetic where you load in the images into the slots ideas are   bladerunner fuckbot v hologram waifu  fight club jack v tyler durden  they live news anchor on/off  prequel meme darth vader v doofy anakin  yes/no meme drake or rooney or someone  sadfleck bvs meme idk   the possibilities are endless
   the most ironic post ive seen in a long time    bbut muh style  iim not projecting youre projecting    look at this dunning kruger
  i like this meme btw ill be thinking about it next time i work on it in july
  the most ironic post ive seen in a long time  idk about that plus appeals to hypocrisy or whatever isnt really irony its just that you dont have an argument   bbut muh style  yeah im not selling any originals until the race is over the entire thing is fundamentally about subverting norms in a quest for a novel aesthetic like i spent my childhood and teens learning how to into art in a traditional academic setting stopped focusing on art and drawing at 18 and then got back into it at 27 specifically focused on building a style around the concepts of innovation from ignorance and novelty through subversion and stuff     like im not trying to get a job with this shit i dont care about potential industrial applications of mlabor this is the job for me and when the race is over ill be done     iim not projecting youre projecting  i never say im not projecting when you interact with anonymous people you typically have to project a lot about yourself since you only know who youre talking to from a few lines of text ive talked some about how the autoresponse you bot meme is all about using empathetic projection and responding to everything as a means to write about muh ideas and stuff     and yeah of course youre projecting you probably wouldnt be upset right now if you actually did work   look at this dunning kruger  its funny because you probably have zero experience painting faces with acrylic paint which would mean youre projecting right now
  wht colors should i doo next on this
    the issue here is that style is intentional your work on the other hand looks sloppy unpracticed and just plain ugly     look if youre doing this for yourself thats totally fine you do you boo    but then i have to ask why are you posting here its obviously not for mass appeal and youre not getting much by posting here     people have literally been trying to help you make your paintings better and youve just been shitposting ignoring good advice people on here have given you    why even subject yourself to it if you dont intend to get any better    also    its funny because you probably have zero experience painting faces with acrylic paint which would mean youre projecting right now    thats twisted logic if ive ever seen it what does anybody elses painting skills have to do with your badly painted shitposting
  the issue here is that style is intentional your work on the other hand looks sloppy unpracticed and just plain ugly   i mean the sloppiness is something that i justify as being an aspect of the process like im starting with the original image and then spiraling out into disorder     and yeah theres no practice other than whats on the paintings like pic related was the first attempt at doing a gogh strokes meme and then  and  were me trying new things and practicing on them and applying those thoughts on 131 they what now    and just plain ugly   like a snail slithering along the razors edge    but then i have to ask why are you posting here  i mean the whole series is inspired by and kind of reflective of yous from 4chan the whole thing is kind of about the dang place   its obviously not for mass appeal and youre not getting much by posting here   ability to publicly archive my thougths and ideas and arguments related to the production of this shit for me to be able to refer back to later plus i dont really like positive reinforcement being antagonized is kind of fuel for me   people have literally been trying to help you make your paintings better and youve just been shitposting ignoring good advice people on here have given you  i mean i reflect on and try to apply everything people say even if i do respond with bait or whatever
  why even subject yourself to it if you dont intend to get any better  a i absolutely intend on getting better and i already have significantly  b fuck safespacing i like using argumentation and conflict and having an underlying debate behind the things that i do spite and angst and tribalism are powerful motivators     thats twisted logic if ive ever seen it what does anybody elses painting skills have to do with your badly painted shitposting  its making a claim from ignorance mostly my point was that its essentially the definition of the dunningkruger concept that people with no frame of reference and low ability are the most confident and likely to overestimate their own abilities and not appreciate the intricacies and complexities of the skill     people with zero experience painting on canvas are generally the most critical and their criticisms are almost always the least meaningful
    people with zero experience painting on canvas are generally the most critical and their criticisms are almost always the least meaningful    patently untrue drawing sculpting and painting mayhave their intricacies as mediums but there are concepts that can be applied to all three    a person who primarily sculpts may not be able to give pertinent criticism on say a painters use of color but they can immediately identify mistakes in form and perspective     youre better off listening to those folks than not
     people with zero experience painting on canvas are generally the most critical and their criticisms are almost always the least meaningful    forgot to greentext
  patently untrue drawing sculpting and painting mayhave their intricacies as mediums but there are concepts that can be applied to all three  duh thats what were talking about when we say low ability you understand enough about things related to the skill with no practical frame of reference like you cant relate with the struggles and weaknesses of acrylic paint or additives or layering or any of the minutiae of the medium you dont even relate to using grids its like youve been snowboarding a few times and then have a real strong opinion about my skiing technique   a person who primarily sculpts may not be able to give pertinent criticism on say a painters use of color but they can immediately identify mistakes in form and perspective   sure but thats generally not the nature of the shitposting and even when it comes to goofs in form and perspective like im pretty much always aware of it and i typically know where i goofed up my focus then becomes what would need to be done to either recover on that meme or prevent it from happening again i often like leaving the frustrating problems as a reminder for future me like sticking a head on a spike   youre better off listening to those folks than not  sure and i listen to everyone doesnt really change the reality that most the anons on this board are mostly just have experience drawing waifus on tablets and shit the loudest most disingenuous poindexters that argue at me generally arent producing shit
   i dont really care if it is    okay fair enough you dont care about quality got it     youre just doing something that nobody thought to do    no youre doing something not many people are doing big difference the reason not many people are doing this is because it is stupid      blah blah blah    wow thats a lot to unpack youre the only one projecting here pal and yes it is bad and here is why your stuff is boring the end
    yipes    okay fair enough you dont care about quality got it  i mean the concept of quality is a pretty ambiguous and subject meme plus i was saying i dont really care if its ugly according to some random anon and even if we want to qualify what quality or ugly is im making experimental memeschlock and again this is a series about 4chan a place that is famously perceived as being an ugly and lowquality place its grungy  no youre doing something not many people are doing  got in on the ground floor   big difference the reason not many people are doing this is because it is stupid   everything is stupid all art is trash time is entropy also define stupid there is a lot of demand for meme paintings and still very little supply theres an ocean of oil underneath our feet   wow thats a lot to unpack youre the only one projecting here pal   again everyone is projecting pretty much constantly    and yes it is bad and here is why  shoulda used a colon  your stuff is boring the end  i enjoy it glad youre done though youre just too stimulating for this thread too much excitement for this simple memesman
quality is ambiguous  wrong your paintings would be of much higher quality if you knew how to draw a face or depict form  lot of demand for meme paintings  lol
  this is absolutely horrifying sickens me deeply
  wrong  like this is the kind of shit im talking about youve got an intro understanding of art and media history and psychology and sociology and stuff like of course quality is ambiguous its an entirely fabricated construct that were applying to fancy trash we hang on the walls like we can discuss the standards by which quality is often determined and the nature of subjective versus objective and all those memes but the fact that you just negate from the gut demonstrates that youre kind of useless   your paintings would be of much higher quality if you knew how to draw a face or depict form  i know how to draw a face and i depict form constantly youre such a basic memer   lol  there unambiguously is try harder lame brain     take it all girl  
  that painting looks ugly i am a total art newb cant draw very well but this painting is unpleasant to look at
  i agree looks like shes got a pox
if you booze you looze
  but muh withdrawals
your painting look really unappealing
  my bums been withdrawaling rum mud all dang morning tbphwyf    yeah but it sounds great

  and ironically all of the bans for silly shit got a 3day for starting a draw this thread about pic related because it was soliciting free work or some shit got a one day for getting too political in an incel thread and a 3day in like august
  you cant even draw a face with a grid though i mean imagine how bad you have to be at drawing to fuck up a face with a grid
  you cant even draw a face with a grid though          pict related   these were all drawn without grids tho like you can see on pic related how her right eye is off a little but its still unambiguously a face   i mean imagine how bad you have to be at drawing to fuck up a face with a grid  the face gets fucked up by the painting the underdrawings are generally accurate thats kind of the point of gridding btw like hand drawing on canvas takes more time and theres a much greater chance for human error which you cant erase and ultimately its going to be covered in paint its a lot more of a risk when you use hand drawing to set the foundation that you build on with paint and theres very little reward because ultimately you make a painting with the paint
  these were all drawn without grids tho  wow and it sure does show jimmy more fundamentals for you please
  you have no concept of form whatsoever this is flat now and gonna be flat later
  wow and it sure does show jimmy  explain  more fundamentals for you please  elaborate    you have no concept of form whatsoever  hyperbolic absolutes mean nothing this shit screams that you dont really know a whole lot but you know that form is something to meme about   this is flat now and gonna be flat later  nothing is perfect  and anything is better  time is entropy
  explain  have you ever seen a good drawing before like ever what youre posting looks like some middle school bullshit i think your lack of exposure to actually good art is a big reason you have no idea how to produce it like a musician attempting to play jazz without ever having listened to jazz its noticeable   elaborate  get good
  have you ever seen a good drawing before  yeah  like ever   yeah  what youre posting looks like some middle school bullshit  ok this isnt explaining how it shows that the pictures were hand drawn or what that really means seems like youre just moving the goalposts from the first claim that i cant draw a face without a grid to a bunch of vague autism memes   i think your lack of exposure to actually good art is a big reason you have no idea how to produce it  well i mean im currently leaning into scratching and hatching when i draw been looking at crumb stuff recently not to mention that my whole drive isnt really about being able to replicate other peoples styles i did do a goya meme last week though    and who are some good artists that i should be looking at     like a musician attempting to play jazz without ever having listened to jazz its noticeable   none of this has to do with explaining what it shows means   get good  are you good howd you get good
  hyperbolic absolutes mean nothing this shit screams that you dont really know a whole lot but you know that form is something to meme about  yeah keep calling criticism hyperbolic and hide being the wording youve been told a hundred times by now that you fundamental skills are undeveloped and you rely way too much on crooks like grid transfer and tracing you are in denial       you pretty much proved that you are t dunning kruger with this post
      stacatto strokez 4 dayz boye    yeah keep calling criticism hyperbolic and hide being the wording  saying you have no concept of form whatsoever is a meaningless shitpost theres no argument or concept that can be applied going forward hyperbolic absolutes are literally always cancer   youve been told a hundred times by now that you fundamental skills are undeveloped  and then ive asked a hundred time if yous can elaborate and it always just devolves into ad hominem memes like what specific aspect of le fundamentals do you think are undeveloped     and even then so what the entire thing is about seeking a novel aesthetic through a sense of innovation from ignorance and subversion by leaning into doing things wrong and spiraling out my goal hasnt been to adhere to fundamental standards since i stopped academically studying art when i was 18    and you rely way too much on crooks like grid transfer and tracing you are in denial   every notable painter used grids and canvas transfer is a standard practice and not being familiar with either of them means that youre actively refusing to further your education   you pretty much proved that you are t dunning kruger with this post  except im not overly confident in my own abilities and ive been painting for years now and youre still not making an argument projecting meme labels is what you do when youre not capable of anything else
    forgot to give you your you
  he keeps posting this as if its actually good  lmfao quit living in the past
  i dont really think any of it is good shadows are fucked for one thing its an example though of my abilities back when i gave a shit about hand drawing and muh fundamentals     like if you want to just say everything just isnt good and just be a pointless contrarian theres nothing to talk about its always this meme where you try to seek out some talking point like you use grids and youre not capable of drawing without them and them im like here look at all this stuff that wasnt done with a grid look at these sketches look at these paintings that didnt use a grid look at this pastel from 2006 im not incapable of hand drawing to canvas and every painter uses grids and then it just pivots to well it just looks bad   lmfao quit living in the past  im pretty overwhelmingly future focused my guy what have you produced today
part of me assumed when he was sober and not cramming a billion memepics and/or greentext shitposting replies hed be less of an asshole maybe even able willing or understanding of receiving criticism    its embarrassing to say that out loud but part of me really was and is that foolish oh welp
  part of me assumed when he was sober and not cramming a billion memepics and/or greentext shitposting replies hed be less of an asshole   i was still doing that sober tho   maybe even able willing or understanding of receiving criticism  memeing about fundamentals and endlessly bitching about standard painting techniques isnt really valid criticism     not to mention that i constantly try and do and apply things that people suggest i get shit for not hand drawing enough i start hand drawing more i get shit for not doing it well enough     like when an anon says a generic meme like i have no understanding of form without being able to or just actively refusing to elaborate on what specifically theyre talking about or how it could be done differently like what do you want exactly that meets the standard of willing or understanding of receiving criticism     like if you just want to make vague blanket absolutes that serve no purpose why shouldnt i be an asshole and seek to better understand what theyre saying   its embarrassing to say that out loud  youre typing  but part of me really was and is that foolish  explain what you think i should do differently
your images are a lot like how i would start a portrait if these are all on canvas then id urge you to go back to them and build up on the original paint as possibly they can be worked up into serious complete works youve got the underpainting now finish the rest youll be worth a fortune
op take all your portraits load them in photoshop and open the curves editor look what that tells you i just did your op and almost every value is midrange you need to expand your value range broseph get darker darks and lighter lights when people say your drawings lack form i believe this is what they mean the illusion of form is hardly created with just midtones
  this is one of your best paintings
  the best turd in a letrine is still a turd
  i like the veins but the teeth are shit and the eyes and mouth are too small or something
  your images are a lot like how i would start a portrait  ooh yeah most of the things posted are generally like 1/3rds2/3rds finished the original idea was that i would do the last part on camera for a weirdo video series  if these are all on canvas then id urge you to go back to them and build up on the original paint as possibly they can be worked up into serious complete works  idk if ill ever make it to serious works but yeah a big part of the no selling originals until the race is over thing is that i have like 6 more years to keep working on them and apply things and techniques that ive learned since that i didnt know about or think of then   youll be worth a fortune  literally tens of dollars    op take all your portraits load them in photoshop and open the curves editor look what that tells you i just did your op and almost every value is midrange you need to expand your value range broseph  you right been obsessed with mixing everything with white this year so thats probably a major part of it all the dark tones are getting tinted then ive tended to phone in mid tones and then just quickly add highlights   when people say your drawings lack form i believe this is what they mean the illusion of form is hardly created with just midtones  i can see that i think what i was working on yesterday with  was a better attempt than most
gonst fuck this up
  blamo didnt mix any white into the base layer
    sequel to pic related
  is this the absolute zero of artistic taste
    blue layer    what did she meme by this
  and pic related which was ruined by matte gel and gesso and a bunch of other stuff
      what bugs me the most about your little school project is that its gotten boring right from the start  you know its easy to see what kind of taste and preferences you have when you choose something to copy you are going for obscene extreme facial expressions theres an area where this is most welcome advertisements they love that shock factor and edge because it annoys people you cant look away because you are naturally driven to find out why a person is making such an extreme face expression and when you learn that there is nothing more to get other than the frozen expression you are left annoyed and want to look away    your paintings arent just badly executed they are also inherently making everyone want to look away for numerous reasons i give the benefit of doubt that there actually are a few able talented people on this board as you seem to get all the right criticism from time to time which you consequently deflect from or chose to ignore altogether  tldr etc    so here you have your amateurish approach that you try to justify as deliberately bad time and again then you have the shock effect of the awful facial expressions and to top it all off your edgy rotten persona all in all everything about your field day project screams look away im an abomination    surely you will answer with another black/green rag rug wording between haphazard justifications and complete denial   there is no progress in what you do only repetition and that repetition is full of mistakes knowledge gaps and obstinacy in fact the only consistency in your work is stagnation    sorry not sorry  leave /ic/
      boy do i dislike this one      what bugs me the most about your little school project is that its gotten boring right from the start  k  you know its easy to see what kind of taste and preferences you have when you choose something to copy   yeah   you are going for obscene extreme facial expressions  generally yeah  theres an area where this is most welcome advertisements they love that shock factor and edge because it annoys people  are you autistic seeing people emote excites empathetic people to relate to the feels connected to those reactions makes them feel more  and when you learn that there is nothing more to get  theres plenty more to get though   your paintings arent just badly executed they are also inherently making everyone want to look away   making you write essays eben   give the benefit of doubt that there actually are a few able talented people on this board as you seem to get all the right criticism from time to time  not from you though huh  so here you have your amateurish approach that you try to justify as deliberately bad time and again   no i just do things wrong and embrace mistakes wabi sabi brah   then you have the shock effect of the awful facial expressions and to top it all off your edgy rotten persona  im your huckleberry   all in all everything about your field day project screams look away im an abomination  personally i prefer the term berserksklovn demon   surely you will answer with another black/green rag rug wording between haphazard justifications and complete denial   youre not making an argument to need to deny were talking about your feelings   there is no progress in what you do  there is   only repetition  i do different shit constantly tried a different approach on pic related not digging it   sorry not sorry  
  boy do i dislike this one  because it proves that you can only bash extreme facial expressions when it comes to more subtle shit like that photo of dakota fanning whateverhernameis you fail whats sad about it is its not even that much more sublte than any of the obscene shit you select just that tard bit more difficult to trace it right then again there are more examples of faces that you completely turned into zika virus versions of the original photo
  because it proves that you can only bash extreme facial expressions  why would you think doing nonstressed facial expressions would be more difficult     also its pretty much because i started bad started to get something interesting going with the blues on top then when i was doing pinks and yellows just kept piling on things that would need to be addressed with more layers and stuff lot of redundancies  when it comes to more subtle shit like that photo of dakota fanning whateverhernameis you fail   never done a dakota fanning idk which one youre talking about and normally the ones that fail are caused by goofing around and trying out stupid shit and getting stuck having to do stupid shit to the whole piece for continuity and stuff painting yourself into a corner type of jams   whats sad about it is its not even that much more sublte than any of the obscene shit you select  youve got a weird understanding of sadness    just that tard bit more difficult to trace it right   most of them are grids meow pict related was hand drawn and its not an obscene expression bit subtle   then again there are more examples of faces that you completely turned into zika virus versions of the original photo  sure particularly in the earlier stages normally you generally want to paint over the lines at first and then when youre stacking another round of background and/or shadows you shave it back down and stuff thing i run into particularly on the op is that get blow the guidelines and then dont think about it until way later     but why you so upset have you produced anything today
  because i started bad started to get something interesting going with the blues on top  you know why you suck at it because you use grids and then you color it in like a toddler
  you know why you suck at it  at what that painting i have a few ideas about why that one is a goof for one thing it was kind of always doomed to be a goof off painting like i was pretty enthused and almost even satisfied with the efforts i made yesterday on  and   and instead of taking the selfdestructive impulse that follows any sense of contentment and applying it to them or one of the other paintings that still have potential i set out to work on one wrong on a fresh canvas to minimize the damage a bunch of them are or started as blowoff goofs after i did something i was excited about theyre the afterbirth of better efforts   because you use grids and then you color it in like a toddler  yeah and of course youre only capable of falling back onto the same meaningless autism like do you disqualify painters like van gogh and rembrandt for using grids     like its so clear that you have zero experience painting and no meaningful depth of knowledge when it comes to art history or theory or anything other than the most basic introtodrawing memes and then at the same time youve got all these strong opinions that you choose to express through hostility why do you think you do this
  and reminder that itt haters are going to die of cancer youre fucked kiddo i bet its brain cancer
  like do you disqualify painters like van gogh and rembrandt for using grids  seriously if i read you excusing your autistic use of copying photos with grids and comparing it to the use of van gogh one more time i will shit down the internets     yes van gogh used grids but you know how he used them he made a frame with strings to look through into the landscape he was drawing outside right in front of what he had chosen to draw he stylized and abstracted elements in the landscape in a way that he saw fit to make a point or find the essence of a given motif  you sit at home and you print stupid celebrity photos completely stagnating and redundant that you try hard and fail to copy and color in like a toddler can you see the difference  you are not racing van gogh you are ridiculing him with every time you mention his name
  copypaste mindset  has absolutely no fucking clue how to mix colors or layer them  it shows  oh how it shows  must somehow try to delegitimize other anons critique  like its so clear that you have zero experience painting and no meaningful depth of knowledge when it comes to art history or theory or anything other than the most basic introtodrawing memes and then at the same time youve got all these strong opinions that you choose to express through hostility why do you think you do this  mfw
  like its so clear that you have zero experience painting and no meaningful depth of knowledge when it comes to art history or theory or anything other than the most basic introtodrawing memes  this is extra funny coming from a guy who shits out introtophilosophy syllogisms to explain why his art is so bad
  seriously if i read you excusing your autistic use of copying photos with grids and comparing it to the use of van gogh one more time i will shit down the internets   do it nerd   yes van gogh used grids  not just used grids he carried a giant gridded window frame around with him like a lunatic autist   but you know how he used them he made a frame with strings to look through into the landscape  yeah thats crazy   he was drawing outside right in front of what he had chosen to draw  and he was only comfortable when he was using a literal framing device   he stylized and abstracted elements in the landscape in a way that he saw fit to make a point or find the essence of a given motif  yeah and like i use stacatto strokes when its a meme about mania or death or anxiety i use schmeary strokes and dont focus on details if im doing a depression meme i like leaving parts of the canvas exposed i like leaving things frustratingly undone i use experimental and psychadelic layering on memes related to heavy concepts and conspiracies and drugs and stuff there is a pretty thorough emphasis on motifs and abstracted elements that recur in different paintings intentionally to build a narrative and a sense of language that ties the whole gestalt together like these are things that i very actively circlejerk about whats your argument   you sit at home and you print stupid celebrity photos  peasant paintings my guy  completely stagnating and redundant  they arent almost every one is an attempt at a different expression as well as an attempt at different color theory and brush style and stuff are you projecting would you say youre not stagnating   hat you try hard and fail to copy and color in like a toddler  eh i pretty actively use weird colors constantly and i like how you essentially just hate the fundamental concept of painting and youre taking that out on me for some reason its all just uppity kids shit
  not just used grids he carried a giant gridded window frame around with him like a lunatic autist  oh thanks for reiterating that its almost like i didnt mention it in this post here   he made a frame with strings to look through into the landscape he was drawing outside right in front of what he had chosen to draw
how can a single person be in so much denial
   can you see the difference  sure that hipster fuck didnt even have a computer just lived in the country making ugly paintings of poor people for like 5 years   you are not racing van gogh  yes i am idk if youre confused you generally seem pretty confused   you are ridiculing him with every time you mention his name  sure im ridiculing you too its all a joke existence is a goof youre just too sensitive and stupid to be able to appreciate it youre the reason youre not going to make it     that one was hand drawn though and its 3 colors on exposed canvas weird choice of painting itt to meme on as a paint by numbers     copypaste mindset  you copypaste the shit you bitch at me about every time we interact you have the mindset of a kid that doesnt know anything and refuses to act in good faith because you have underlying personal issues
  oh thanks for reiterating that its almost like i didnt mention it in this post here  i responded to it in that post i respond to everything you say you choose one thing from what i say and ignore everything else because you dont act in good faith you choose to be a bad person and youre going to die of cancer    denial of what exactly are you maybe projecting
  you are the epitome of the postmodern selftherapypainting maggot   breaking the rules before you even understood them hiding behind a thin wall of theory wabi sabi shit unable to cope with any given criticism treasuring your product like a toddler saying goodbye to his own turds       as well as an attempt at different color theory and brush style and stuff  how we laughed
  you are the epitome of the postmodern selftherapypainting maggot   you have a diangosable mental illness and you believe stupid selfdestructive shit that is making your life worse and for some reason your cognitive dissonance about yourself gets focused at me because i dont believe the stupid selfdestructive shit you do and im not bothered by the meaningless handicaps you give yourself to justify why youre a shiftless knownothing  breaking the rules before you even understood them  which rules dont i understand why are you so incapable of actually maintaining a consistent or meaningful argument for more than one post you have nothing to say but you feel like yelling like talking to jello made out of piss with you   hiding behind a thin wall of theory wabi sabi shit   im not the anonymous shit talker with a bone to pick im not hiding anything the reason i appreciate the concept of wabi sabi and encourage you /beg/ kids to attempt to appreciate it is that it does absolutely alleviate a lot of the anxiety that people may have about getting into painting its meditative and reflective and puts you more in touch with the nature of existence its a top tier meme   unable to cope with any given criticism  what actual criticism have you given youve called me a bunch of meanie words and made it clear that youre only interested in attacking me personally you repeated grids memes a bunch failed to explain how that has any bearing though refused to acknowledge that ive done like 40 paintings that werent grids which is almost certainly 40 paintings more than youve done   treasuring your product like a toddler saying goodbye to his own turds   i dont think you understand my work flow   how we laughed  so which one are you i feel like its ratface that always does the how we laughed meme because you dont really understand english and you have a limited vocabulary
  its meditative and reflective and puts you more in touch with the nature of existence  selftherapeutic painting with low to no chance of appeal to an outside person    what actual criticism have you given  you are in denial of any given criticism you say it over and over again do you really need to be reminded how you turn every mistake every wrong mix of colors the black outlines into a deliberate phase in your school project    you repeated grids memes a bunch failed to explain how that has any bearing though   how about you are the best example to show people that relying too much on visual aids and cheating is going to make you stagnate and never improve with your grid method you could be braindead and still get this shit done all the same your griding of meme faces is a visual enema that miniscule amount of variation you introduce by applying dots of color while maintaining your flawed color mixing cant distract from that stagnation   you have a poor sense for contrast and people told you a million times weight distribution of light and shadow in literally all faces is like a gorbachov style pigment failure times 100     what really grinds my gears is how stubborn and proud you are about your kindergarten paintings you bend over backwards to fend off every kind of reasoning and look at the first post in this thread you get shit for it so consistently that you feel you need to take it away that haters people bringing up legit criticism are going to be in this thread and you wish that wouldnt be so all you want is compliments asskissing from /beg/ teenagers that dont know how to hold a brush which is why you have the audacity to go into /beg/ threads giving out advice on how to start painting  a copypaste loser like you giving other people advice oh man
  this post alone has told jimmy chickenscratch memeshit all he needs to know on how to improve his godawful griddependent skills but nooh not with jimmy he dont roll that way better stay in denial start a thread with ten consecutive posts of shilling his meme copies proving once again that stagnation and repetition are his best assets
  selftherapeutic painting  yeah you should very unironically give it a gogh you have all this pent up frustration that you need to project why not do it at a canvas instead of an imageboard  with low to no chance of appeal to an outside person  a you lack basic empathy  b there are billions of people anything has a potential demographic you shouldnt let this kind a selfdefeating anxiety control you     do you really need to be reminded how you turn every mistake every wrong mix of colors the black outlines into a deliberate phase in your school project  why would i need to be reminded its constantly reflected in all the shit i do and im not getting an academic receipt for this shit   how about you are the best example to show people that relying too much on visual aids and cheating is going to make you stagnate and never improve  and then when i dont rely on them what exactly is the argument     and like lets say i wanted to do a mural or something thats like 8x10 or bigger would you hand draw that     with your grid method you could be braindead and still get this shit done all the same  yeah i started a left handed meme about that youre doing the whole introtoart conversation btw when you say anyone could do that the response is well they should have      your griding of meme faces is a visual enema  and youre upset because thats still more than you can do your impotent ranting about my memes is the only art youre probably capable of producing at all     that miniscule amount of variation you introduce by applying dots of color while maintaining your flawed color mixing cant distract from that stagnation   could do a bingo card for your endless stagnation projection talking point like how frustrated are you about your own progress that stagnation is your goto meme   you have a poor sense for contrast and people told you a million times  yeah and ive generally agreed
     weight distribution of light and shadow in literally all faces is like a gorbachov style pigment failure times 100   gorbachev seems like more of a chunbun relevant thing     what really grinds my gears is how stubborn and proud you are about your kindergarten paintings  yeah because youre malleable and weak and you dont do anything and it bothers you that other people arent crippled by your autism kill your self you uppity retard    you bend over backwards to fend off every kind of reasoning and look at the first post in this thread  nigger youre not using reasoning youre seeking out any means to nitpick and talk shit because you have a clear personal or emotional agenda that is motivating everything you do or dont do     you get shit for it so consistently that you feel you need to take it away that haters  youre a hater you dont have any intention to act or engage in an intellectually honest or empathetic way youre a bad faith cunt and an unambiguous scumbag and youre going to die of cancer     people bringing up legit criticism  you hysterically reeeing about grid transferring is not legit criticism you can barely even read if you wanted to and you choose not to regardless     are going to be in this thread and you wish that wouldnt be so  im here for you bb i know you cant read so youll never understand this but your virginal buttblasted angst is my muse   all you want is compliments  nope dont even know what to do with compliments    which is why you have the audacity to go into /beg/ threads  yep and youre a gatekeeping coward that has the audacity to do nothing and act like a faggot at people that do cry more m80   a copypaste loser like you giving other people advice oh man  making a whole instructional video series and if you dont care about me you can just ignore it this idea that everything i do gets you so upset just means that youre pathetic and you dont have control of your life
  this post alone has told jimmy chickenscratch memeshit all he needs to know on how to improve his godawful griddependent skills but nooh not with jimmy he dont roll that way  youre so upset and why really     like seeing you flipping out like this is all the positive reinforcement i need to continue doing my thing youre annoying and hysterical and emotional and you have all these belligerent dogmatic views against basic elements of artistic production the idea that what im doing pisses you off this much is fantastic to me way more satisfying than any fucking compliment i could ever get youre giving me so much power  better stay in denial   what am i in denial about again seems like youre just offended that i value work itself more than outcome while you obsess about outcome and never work   proving once again that stagnation and repetition are his best assets  i mean its good to have assets at all even if we really want to bother qualifying stagnation and repetition and then even if we wanted to talk about why you think these things are inherently bad i still have plenty of evidence of attempts to do new things i try new things constantly     youre only really stagnating when youre not producing anything by my standards     work on something of your own today or youre going to develop earlyonset dementia within 5 years
  like seeing you flipping out like this is all the positive reinforcement i need to continue doing my thing youre annoying and hysterical and emotional and you have all these belligerent dogmatic views against basic elements of artistic production the idea that what im doing pisses you off this much is fantastic to me way more satisfying than any fucking compliment i could ever get youre giving me so much power  eat shitn die besh
stop bothering the good people of this board jim we have it bad enough
  theres plenty more to get though  audience getting out of their seats  did you hear about my connection to van gogh the famous painter  audience is leaving  im racing the guy lol  pplease wait just drop some acid and let me play this tool song it explains everything  last audience member closes the door behind him  youre missing out on some seriously meta ironic crazyness  takes drugs to escape reality
  gets super upset about how bad at art and lazy you are  act like a sniveling faggot anonymously at strangers  get cancer  die  you_irl
  this is most accurate
  please seek help or die already
      samefag     leave this thread and never talk to me or my memes ever again be less of a cancerous buttblasted loser and quit making it my fault that youre not going to make it     you are going to die of cancer now your fate is sealed you did it to yourself you wont be missed
theres nothing more creatively bankrupt than realism
  creativity might not be the goal of realism
  technical perfection can only boredom because it only reproduces nature  i agree that technical perfection is boring but  getting bored with nature  yikes ngmi
  great post op you sure showed everyone what a badass you are well done
  anything too technical with a lack of soul will ultimately be bad no matter with how much skill it was done but there is good realism like the hyperrealism of chuck close ron mueck and gottfried helnwein    the shit you refer to is probably the kind of digitalfag autofellatio art with knights in armor fighting dragons or chicks with impractically big tits and tight thongs or better yet people copying their own selfies for 50 hours and uploading it to insta     different levels of art that dont touch borders i say
yeah because i can go out and see demons angels and all sort of mythical creatures and heroes from ancient times this looks like ((())) tricks to me
  the ultimate goal of realism is understanding how things work so you can aply that knowledge to yoir pieces and enjoy your work progress and final result
 checked  my reading comprehension might not be so good are you implying demon/angel/mythical creature art is classified as realism
  literally retarded  if people didnt like looking at realistic imagesno movies no porn no photos  nature is beautiful  if someone can use rudimentary techniques of crushed rocks and crushed seeds mixed together and produce image like pic related by imitating certain aspects of nature and pick and choose those elements and bring out what they think is beautiful about nature then modernists btfo  modernist gospel btfo  modernist thought btfo
  that has to be my boy odd
  no theres nothing more creatively bankrupt than modernism     there is more creativity in the way titian paints a hand than there is in a thousand surrealist monstrosities
    strange dialogue makes no sense to pair technical perfection with decadence as the former is about discipline and the latter is the opposite of that
    are you a woman
  in all gods honesty i read the thread being theres nothing more creatively bankrupt than capitalism and were wondering what the picture has to do with the thread    thought this was about bashing some concept art culture where stuff needs to be created super fast and have quantity over quality    its easy to misunderstand those words or take them out of context
  technical perfection can only create boredom because it only reproduces nature  superimposed over stills taken from blackandwhite photographic film  why are you posting a conversation from the past facial expressions of the participants reproduced with photographic perfection when you could be expressing the same sentiment more creatively
  this is about hyperrealism and you should feel ashamed of yourself for not understanding that pic related is not 1 to 1 real life
  there is good realism  hyper realism is good realism  holy shit you sound even more retarded than op hyper realism is just as bad as post modern garbage
  this
  nature is boring as fuck
is it possible to learn to enjoy art more  does forcing yourself to draw even when you dont want to eventually make you like it more
lol youre pathetic and an embarrassment
you need to start being honest with yourself about why you are drawing at the moment we all start out drawing for the fun of it but this is then heavily influenced by outside factors as we age are you using it cope or to seek approval from others to feel important to send a message this is the first step and the easiest but solving it is only something you can do on your own no one can teach you how to enjoy the process again itll take time honesty with yourself and lots of trial and error
  it did for me but i am that kinda person and knew that from the start for others it wont
  its like your tumblr blog sometimes youll have great moments sometimes youll be alone crying in the rain with a notebook desu that you drew something retrospectively will be the reward get to art shows too
  the embodiment of /ic/
  hmm those are 2 things altogether if you are forcing yourself to do something it usually means you dont enjoy it not sure why that might change but depends on the root of why you dont enjoy drawing  maybe you should ask yourself how you want to approach art you dont have to draw if you dont like it you can try sculpting or painting or some other branch that you connect better with
    i know i enjoy doing art or i wouldnt have started doing it in the first place  for the record before i took art more seriously ive never drawn for more than say one hour and a half or something i was very casual about it  however now that i take art more seriously and desire to improve i am going through a period where its not fun to draw but more like a job you have to do every day i dont feel motivated at all the most i can push is three hours of drawing but only occasionally and it still doesnt feel enough  my goal would be to become motivated enough that i can put like four to five hours of drawing a day so i can make good progress right now it feels like im wasting time bouncing between one and three hours a day    sorry for the late reply thanks for the advice though
  drawing five hours a day wont magically make you good adopting a growthoriented mindset is what will make the most difference i would take one hour of focused study over 8 hours of mindless practice any day its not about how long you practice but how you practice
  maybe take care of other aspects of your personal life to make you enjoy your hobbies a bit more it should never feel like a dreary chore happiness and excitement will take you further than whatever sense of grim duty youre considering
  well i know i am already in that mindset i should say because everything i draw is aimed to improve  that isnt to say i only study all day because then i wouldnt be surprised i dont have fun but i am mindful of how to gain something from every drawing and think when i put the pen down for every line    but a good four hours of mindful practice is what i aim for which in my mind if what good artists do because they are dedicated enough that they dont have to force it  one hour a day can be good for slow progress but its too little for me to be satisfied  at the very least id like to put in two to three hours regularly not based off how i feel that day      thank you i find this to be true also im trying to do that  im just exploring possibilities and gathering opinions is all
  i have been through this for years because i started drawing with /ic/ and academic shit from the getgonot even doodling    does forcing yourself to draw even when you dont want to eventually make you like it more  no absolutely fucking not forcing yourself to draw can get you some results but once you get a short streak of shitty drawings you will despise it even more and drop it all together for a short or sometimes longer time   first and foremost drawing must be to your enjoyment to create something you want to see rather than about skill you and i probably went the exact opposite about this and i still struggle to not put skill above all else but its retarded i doubt you will find a great artist that only got good to get gud instead of passioni guess there are probably some asian robot people like that but they are the exception    this does not mean not setting out time to draw and getting yourself to draw every day but dont view it as forcing yourself to do so if its not the day then just doodle a little bit instead of forcing yourself to do a piece     draw what you like and the motivation to learn certain aspects of art will come this might be suboptimal in terms of skill increase but unless you are already highly motivated and love drawing you will simply not grind fundies all day every day for months you are a human and not a robot or asian
  hello fellow academic anon i went to an atelier for a year and quit art immediately after because it made me want to kill myself now im getting back into it the right way and having so much more fun however i have to give credit to my academic training for instilling in me the virtues of discipline and patience also my technical ability is tenfold greater than it would have been without i have an very very good foundation because of it i hated every minute of training but i said dont quit suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion
  i suppose the best way would be to have your fun drawings at home and work academicly somewhere else like the people who learn fundies for their animay drawings there certainly are a lot of benefits to the academic way as well you are right
  first and foremost drawing must be to your enjoyment to create something you want to see rather than about skill you and i probably went the exact opposite about this and i still struggle to not put skill above all else but its retarded i doubt you will find a great artist that only got good to get gud instead of passioni guess there are probably some asian robot people like that but they are the exception  op here you are absolutely right and i also put skill above all else i made progress even in mindset but i am still envious of more skilled artists  a lot less now than a few months ago  and very frustrated with my current level i think fundamentally thats one of the big reasons that make me enjoy art less im too focused on results when i should enjoy the act itself instead  that said i think i will definitely dedicate some time to fun drawing trying to free myself of worries then studies alongside that
being good at drawing will make you like drawing striving to be good at drawing will make you want to draw  whats the difference    too many fart sniffing retards heredont realize that it sucks to suck no one wants to draw badly so that results in not wanting to draw  the fact that you entertain the idea of even forcing yourself to draw is a big step doesnt matter if you dont like it currently you eventually will once you canput your thoughts on paper which is all that matters    exactly what happened to me
anyone struggle to erase pencil lines after inking too its a pain in the ass to erase pencil lines on the whole page and probably would damage the paper already tried red pencils for sketching firstand then remove in photoshop but colored pencils are too soft for the sketching task are there any red or orange pencilseverything above h3 best would h5exactly for sketching out there
draw in nonphoto blue forget about eracing pencil lines
  nonphoto blue    are the lines still visible while scanning tried light blue pencils but they are also not easily erasable on photoshop
  they shouldnt dont forget to scan in grayscale and bump up the contrast/brightness if needed
    nonphoto blue only works perfectly in the older days of using analog film to photograph your drawings if youre going to use digital editing to remove it anyways you can just use any light color
  yes actually orange and red pencils work perfectly question is where to find colored pencils with harder mines for sketching
  by harder do you mean a lighter color i remember using derwent color pencils and they have some super light blues in there
  pencils with harder mines for sketching  why would you want that just dont press as hard and you wont notice the softness of the pencils you shouldnt be pressing hard when sketching anyway
    the things tradfags have to worry about
  yeah traditional drawing is pretty dated but its still alot of fun im ok with draw trad first and edit it digitally
  he doesnt do traditional alongside digital  ngmi
  ballpoint pens are actually great for this most red ones in particular are a fairly light shade of red that looks a little better than most blue shades and its really easy to see it apart from black ink    another option is to just print your sketch in cyan then ink that and remove the color when you scan it    pilot color eno 07mm leads are pretty good too the soft blue and red ones are pretty durable and erase well one 07mm mechanical pencil with blue lead and one 05mm one with 2b lead is a nice combo to keep along with some pens in a pencil box
  not easily erasable  lemme hook you up with some sycra my dude     skip to the end where he goes through it very quickly again works for me at least
    i wouldnt say its dated per se as it still does many things digital cannot do yet digital has yet to come close to the dynamic and organic feel that traditional media has although i predict that it will be mastered eventually inking digitally can definitely be made to look traditional but certain kinds of marks like those in pic related are very hard to achieve
  use nonphoto blue light blue for penciling then ink in black then finally scan using grayscale settings with high contrast so it wont pick up nonphotoblue
use a lightbox and dont ink on the same paper that you sketched on
  too much extra work
when you erase the ink could fade and become gray you can avoid this using dip pens and good ink but then youre forced to use these specific toolsbrushes and dip pens and maybe you fell more comfortable with some markers or brushpens    for example nowadays comic artists rarely ink on traditional pencils they  1use a blue pencil like the pilot eno 07 or the prismacolor colerase and remove the pencils in photoshop james harren is an example    2scan the normal pencils/do the pencils digitally and print them in light cyan on the bristol board then remove the pencils in ps chris samnee do this    3do normal pencils but use a lightbox to ink them on another sheet of paper this is the hardest but the cleanest option i think dan panosian to this even for full pages        to remove digitally blue lines scan in gray and use levels or curves to push the blacks and the whites    then if you need solid black use threshold to convert the inks to monochrome but its not necessary      for comics traditional isnt dated at all
  you have been cursed
  prismacolor carandache and staedtler have dedicated sketching pencils in red and blue prisma has them also in many other colours you can try to check them out
op maybe you erase like an autist  you need white and soft just like your penis eraser gentry stroke it on paper in one direction make sure the ink is completely dried first
  use a lightbox
took me 15 minutes and is one of my first ever paintings
thoughts
  i mean its just a silhouette you can hardly call this a painting
harsh but thanks yeah
decent also noone cares how long something took you to make by saying this took 15 minutes youre trying to give yourself an excuse for the quality of the work from now on never ever mention how long something took you noone cares and it doesnt matter
  if youre new here please lurk and learn how things work instead of just jumping in and looking like an absolute fucking idiot     also the painting is a simple silhouette that is a fact and not good of a silhouette either its boring and begginer
if you had the name of a famous painter you could sellthis exact same painting for several dozens of thousands  but since its just you people wouldnt even take it for free
  nice basic composition try turning black shadows to blue shadows cool as fuck
  no
  yes
its a nice painting just dont post it with first painting btw most posts like that are seen as fishing for compliments
  try and add more color composition this is actually really good on its own but youre lacking a bit of character in it yellows and blues would do you some good for sure keep practicing 
are drawing with jazza tutorials any good
  look at his drawings do you feel thats a level you want to move towards if yes do follow him
  this i personally like the guy but find his skills are subpar nothing personal against him but id never learn from his work
  he is a jack of all trades but master of none
  his channel seems like more kids oriented if thats your case go for it
  so were really making a thread about this again    you know what fine good for jazza good for him
  i think they are solid he tells a good way to build basics his style isnt really the way i wanna draw but i like him and his channel
  this jazza is fucking garbage ngmi fag who thinks he can teach something he cant do
  clickbait youtuber faggot  no these guys are youtubers and social media shills first artists second or third theyre shit is always some rushed clickbait shit that they crap out day after day for ad revenue
  shitonadick69 is a great animator
  yeah he kinda like cartoonist or something   not something i want to be  i can learn the really basic from other source
  checked id also like to note that theres a difference between an artist with a youtube channel and a youtuber artist guys like alphonso dunn and aaron blaise do amazing vids in my opinion they really break stuff down and have a clear knowledge of what they do and their work proves it their channels tend to grow organically as well because theyre not doing shit like  1000 degree knife to paint  draw with your feet challenge  drawing with 500 year old microns  ___ challenge
  araon blaises paid courses are shit specially the anatomy one
  jazza is mostly aimed at kids he seems like a cool person but he is mostly a youtuber
  the course is not out yet but the 1 hour horse introduction was fantastic tho
  he is good with animals but his anatomy course is really bad deviantart bad
  why is his face such a nasty color
  because he used a yellow background
  this is why i cant stand to see his videos in my recs the color of his face and hair looks nauseating next to each other it literally makes me angry
  seriously  ive been considerign buying it because so far out of all teachers his method of teachign worked the best for me
  post screenshots
  yes he just sits in a chair draws some body parts and halfassedly mentions the names of very few muscles and bones       its really bad
  cant i already deleted that crap from my pc the preview on youtube shows the single drawing for each lesson he does though     buy it you want but dont say you werent warned
  no the man cant draw well    why learn from someone who cant even apply what he teaches there are fundamentals being taught by actual professionals in their fields often for free or made free with torrents    if you need a hip cool haha youtuber guy to excite you with flashy shit for children like jazza or rossdraws so you can just fucking study and draw then go have fun with that but you will never be decent thanks to them because they make gimmick videos for profit not cause its revolutionary or helpful
hes like the special olympics gold in the jack of all trades event  barely competent in all absolutely master of none
  dude had a weird life used to be hardcore mormon or some shit and then made friends with all the newgrounds guys
i learned a good way to hold my breath thanks to him
that stupid fucking cartoon thumbnail is pissing me off its so ugly looking
  what are some good professional tutorials then
  maxed out business man   literally no artistic skill
  this
  free links please
    his pfp pisses me off so no
    pretty much this
  /thread  watching jazza is more like watching pewdiepie or something not for learning
  someone said it at least  it fucking pisses me off
  at least pdp had those book club and philosophy videos
  his background makes me go into an infuriated rage similar to this
  why arent you drawing with jazza right now
  no hes more of a youtuber than he is an artist
  yeah man hes pretty good  i learned from him and i think megamikey or something like that his name is  my drawings have surpassed theirs now though but they were definitely helpful at first
  it pisses me off too im at the point where the cartoony avatars these faggots use all annoy the shit out of me
  amazing how people manage to bitch about stuff nobody really gives two shits
hes mostly an entertainer his drawing is mostly mediocre but sometimes pretty good i think some of his video ideas are actually good but the fact that he has a 2 minute sponsor ad on every video and that he acts like an autist most of the time make me not wanna watch him
  i think hes a nice guy or whatever but i fucking hate his shitty art everything feels like a blend of boring canadian cartoons and shitty newgrounds art he needs to realize hes not that great     pic unrelated
  ya i agree his creature creation stuff is really fucking school but anything outside of cartoon stuff is shit
  you should have seen his collab with proko the dffernce in skills was super obvious    though dont fault the guy he is an animator not a gallery guy
  hey proko can finally feel good about drawing better than at least one youtuber
  fuck off proko draws better than 90 of art youtubers
  dream fucking on kangaroo fucker
  on the surface yes
  12 year old detected you know thats a meme right guy was trained by jeff watts
  post your work
  he might not have good visual library for animal but his humans and landscapes are pretty damn good   probably one of the few technical artists that fit the youtube audience with his shitty humor
  please do not taint watts legacy by bringing up his worse student
  worse student lol proko is/was a teacher at watts        its so obvious you are jelly
  jelly is definitely not how id put it  i admit i dont like the fella but his skills are nothing to be jealous of
  thats a caricature its obvious he deformed it on purpose    post your work i dare you
  shows mastery of form and its manipulation on paper  nothing to be jealous of  youre such a faggot
  steve huston proko his anatomy vids are good even if his imagination work is garbage fire moderndayjames aaron blaise vilppu scott robertson feng zhu peter han marshal vandruff to name a few    as well as the plethora of material available in the fucking sticky you fucking waste of air i already know youre gonna drop trying withon a dew months couldnt even bother using a shred of critival thinking
cant think of an appropriate thread but im looking for a tutorial guy i find a year ago he always drew in blue pencil he has a video where he draws a minotaur or something with forms that was really good he had a whole website for his art tutorials    ill pray for you if you help
  it was ctrl paint
  you mean the worgenwerewolf  
  dubs of truth
  hes a jack of shit thats what he is
every time i come to 4chan art threads i only see people shitting on other peoples art this thread is no different from any other artists that get shat on here imo jazza is fine for supply reviews and basic stuff also he knows how to do youtube videos so is nice for me to watch
black n white  drawwws
   love it nice throwie as well looks like its inspired by the artstyle of tony hawks american wasteland got any more like this
  only this
is a aussie wojak
is it possible to make it without going lewd
  in general yes  for you no
  yes      i mean its /beg/ tier but its not the worst has a lot of potential honestly
  for you no  what about for me
  you can do it just not op
  yes      i also see potential with your style
  should i go lewd then      thanks 3
  dont go lewd    its immoral
  ok sorry geez
  no with that skill level
  yes  draw fun concepts  most sfw artists adopt either really good rendering or commercially viable illustrative style
  whats a fun concept how do you even make yourself known if not by drawing porn of mainstream characters
  be an interesting person
  look for novelty look for ways to utilize the visual medium in fun and clever ways  this is by avogado6 on twitter his work is really popular its cute and clever its anime but not even porn you can do nonporn things in a simple and impactful way
  well i think i understand now i really liked this one
  i like that one too his style of illustration is really nice but im personally bad at generating visual metaphors with visual clarity like that wish i were better at it my natural calling is to indulgent and meaningless porn i think
  plz lewd
  whatever everyone else is doing do the opposite
yes but why would you want to lewd is free money basically you should atleast have a half assed lewd sideproject be warned though if you have the spark you will not be capable of not caring about your lewd art its just not in the nature of a sparkhaver to do anything halfassedly i told myself id have shitty loweffort porn sideprojects and they have by now grown into massive brands with large followings and regular triple digit commissioners and gumroad shops and patreons and yada yada it consumes you but it pays
  drawing lewds is a good exercise
for many many people its always about sex so they dont gravitate to lewd for making it it just happen that they would do something of a kind anyway so why not get paid    rant    moral signalling fags like these one make it hard to be lewd and taken seriously everyone will think you think of erect penises and wet pussies so much that you couldnt possibly draw or even think of anything in good taste or with any meaning they make you think that there is only choice between lewd and nonlewd art where one is high and pure vs the other being low and exploitative its bullshit and red herring  you can go low and exploitative without even touching the subject of sex  most of asian comics exploit our inbuilt affinity to wide eyed cuddly youthful creatures with underdeveloped features another exploitative plane is social recognition a porn in which reader can vicariously experience main hero climbing social ladder same goes for falling in love exploring new lands fighting and winning surviving helping your family thrive i bet you could find may more all of them simulate something to exploit a drive in you for a positive response  how does sexual gratification not fit in here  whats the difference    when i was a kid i had a privilege of being tutored in drawing and sculpture by married couple of veteran artists he was a painter she a sculptor both very accomplished in their fields  the practice sessions took place every other weekend in the basement/ground floor studio of their home once visiting them i got to glimpse into their apartment upstairs there was a sculpture near the door of stylized sex act  man penetrating woman from behind in standing pose blatant and unapologetic but beautiful in execution art  its not the subject its the execution what experience does it leave the consumer of art    everything even the subject of sex and sexual organs can be extrapolated to serious art  look h r giger  /rant
  there was a sculpture near the door of stylized sex act  man penetrating woman from behind in standing pose blatant and unapologetic but beautiful in execution art  its not the subject its the execution what experience does it leave the consumer of art  everything even the subject of sex and sexual organs can be extrapolated to serious art  look h r giger  are we really going to pretend that furry or fetish porn is on the same level as this painting you described theres no artistic intent behind every drawing anon
  noy him  its not art if you make it for money or without artistic intent  going out of your way to be artsy never made anyones work better unless youre a normie that eats that shit up  the only reason that furry porn isnt on the same level is because the artist who made it was worse at his job
  another exploitative plane is social recognition a porn in which reader can vicariously experience main hero climbing social ladder same goes for falling in love exploring new lands fighting and winning surviving helping your family thrive i bet you could find may more all of them simulate something to exploit a drive in you for a positive response    very good point anon saved
  yes please gib blog i love that drawing and would like to stalk your social media and like every single thing you post ever
i think if you draw anime and game stuff you pretty much have to i mean theres a market for nonlewd weeb shit but its fucking tiny   expand your field of study to incorporate more contemporary illustration styles or grind dem tiddies chose your destiny my dude
  leave no stone unturned when doing things but yes it is possible
mods where are you  stop finger popping your arseholes and do something about illatrat and jimmy please  delete their spam threads  range ban them  for the love of loomis do something    their attention whoring and weaponized autistic shitposting can not continue
  you realize the problem is /ic/ not them right if nobody replied to them they wouldnt make threads anymore but when you have 50 unique posters replying to you every time why would you stop maybe instead of asking why the mods dont do anything you should ask /ic/ why they need to share their unoriginal insults with illastrat over and over and over and over
ok man
  yes please
  anyone who replies/argues with them needs to be banned as well  or atleast muted for a few hours so their dumbasses wont keep feeding them attention
  implying attention whores dont just change their ip and reply to their own thread to bait more responses  how new
  well thats not gonna happen so i suggest you get used to it or find something else to replace your 4chan time which honestly there are about a million better things to do than coming to this shithole let alone trying to clean it up
theres a button that hides threads    if you autists stopped replying and hid their threads theyd fuck off but you never do you get triggered and feed them     in a perfect world theyd waste their time on their shitty posts and people would hide the damn thread completely ignore them and itd just be pathetic instead of lol i trolled them again most attentionwhores would rather be hated than ignored theyre banking on it literally the best way you can ruin their day isnt to insult them its to ignore them
  theres a button that hides threads  just ignore the problem and it will go away lol    idk about illastrat but jimmy makes ignoring him quite difficult since he barges into unrelated threads and derails them with spam and autistic rambling after mass replying to several people which then gets even worse because retards dont stop responding
you forgot to include two of the autistic 4 but i agree
have you ever considered turning off transparency anon
i do not know how to and its probably a bit late for it
  you cant render without it in photoshop
      you dont need it on it sets a better foundation for colors gives the image a more solidified look
  yup everything looked like torn aluminium foil with me using opacity everywhere
totally opaque with the pencil tool though i make more flat / graphic drawings    the pencil tool is highly underrated try using your favorite brushes with the pencil tool instead of the brush tool even if you do more painterly work it can make for some really satisfying results
  no
i genuinely believe that one of the main issues that plagues the concept of creepypastas is a fact that there are children early age teenagers drawing and creating such stories i also believe that i can make something like jeff the killer look like a genuine creep
  sauce on that gif
  stephen king has a whole literary universe thats a creepypasta but we dont really call it that now  what is it that you have in mind anon
  more mature/grimdark creepypasta is a start but walking the line between campy and effective horror is still tough i think even without some of the more juvenile trappings
  creepypasta    is for children
  its from the music video of empty spaces by pink floyd
  a good creepypasta is just a horror novel thats like saying high effort memes could be good    thats not really the point anon
anon i have aphantasia   i never heard about it befor i saw this video     i always thought this you have to see it with your inner eye was a metapher but nop im just retardet  should i quit art forever
  the very artist you linked has it yet makes art    obviously you dont need to be able to visualize in your head to make it
  the very artist you linked has it yet makes art  i dont want to be an one armed boxer she is just a youtube not a real artist
  no you dont have aphantasia stop this retarded meme this mental gymnastics is on the level of tumblrinas making up 50 genders   stop making excuses and learn how to draw
just use ref lmao
i often see steve huston talking about his inspiration from comics does anyone know which specific comics he are talking about would love to see the comics that inspired his style
  steve is a closet weeb but is too chad to admit it
sergio toppi is to comics what jesus christ is theology sorry i couldnt come up with a better analogy hes super awesome is what im trying to say
marvel
i didnt know that     probably kirby because anyone who gives a damn about gesture construction and likes comics seems obsessed with kirby    also i like to call his approach gesture of the mannequin because unlike many gesture gurus he relies a lot with structure which to me is the only way to make sense of gesture    its a very similar approach to kirby that was his secret to be able to shit 34 issues and a few covers each month
    thanks ill check em out      any specific ones i really know nothing about comics
i love this picture because i like to imagine huston choking a gook to death in the vietname war with those swole fuckin arms
//wwwthedrawingwebsitecom    its a drawing guide made by a simpsons animator and a great alternative for loomis fun wth pencil loomis he teaches from zero     dont expect advanced topics and intermediate level lessons are silll months away    but if you want a place to get into the basics of drawing this is your site
  formerly used loomis but this looks interesting so ill subscribe to his feed
  enjoy
isnt this teaching people to symbol draw
  t brainlet doesnt know what symbol drawing is
  i want this meme to die so bad
  a lot of it is literally symbol drawing but he has solid drawing advice in there too its a weird fucking mix like the sorta halfassed implementation of advice you get from people like jazza where they clearly have no clue how to do anything regarding drawing but theyve read other peoples books and are just repeating the shit
  did you really expect much from the simpsons as of late anon
  not really if you see his level 1 stuff he taches construction there
  his dvd is sold out i wanted to buy it any other links
  that normie panderer is making bank gotta respect the hustle
    were you born yesterday youtube is filled with them this guy gives free /beg lessons on his site though so no need to buy the extras imo
does anybody know how can i suggest this get added to the sticky
his da  
  i dont like his style that much but he can draw no doubt
is it possible to learn this power
ya
  why does it look so good despite it being utterly technically uninformed where is the light even supposed to be coming from here
  anon i am sorry to say that some of the most advanced ninja techniques are in the bloodline of the greatest clans that trace their bloodline back to the demons spirit and gods the only way to obtain them is to have sexy with as many ninja girls as possible and and hope that you children ill inherit the ability to perform the forbidden secret techniques
  why does it look so good  look so good   good   implying anon
  post work
  i dont know if its any solace but going from a blank canvas to the image on the left is immensely harder than going from the left to the right
  because after a point appeal has little to do with technical skill to most normie eyes
    holding the sword with a faggy bent wrist
  it lacks light direction but still sort of has shadows where shadows make sense  so it gives off the impression of a lot of light bouncing around from different directions but primarily from the front here with some blue rim lighting
  bent wrist  cant unsee  also cant figure if the bent wrist hand has the palm upward or downward
  shit i didnt even notice that now i cant unsee it
not without t a l e n t
  holy fuck bbbut muh epix shading hahaha

  le chef meme
    teleports behind you nothing personell kid
retards like  is exactly what is wrong with /ic/ some insecure faggot needs his self esteem boost by pointing out some minor mistake thinking that by doing so it somehow invalidates all the skill in the rest of the drawing this is all so that he can feel superior when he probably draws like a drooling mouthbreather fuck you for shitting up this board
  instantly turns around  post your work
  cuts your fucking head off
  head on ground post your work
  kys
  minor mistake    you see i would normally let such ignorant comments slide if it werent for the fact that i take great pride in my swords skills and my love for anime oh whats that are you a woman yes ofcourse you are sweetie my sincerest apoligies for not taking your sensitive roastbeef curtains into consideration while your in all likehood mediocre apperance grants you many benefits in life a fundamental instinctual understanding of combat that the male is gifted with is not one of them so maybe step aside while the big boys talk art and swordsmanship here but to make yourself useful why dont you go into the kitchen and make us some cookies

  is this pasta
      samefagging this hard hurt your feelings
  the left image can be done in an afternoon or two with practice fewer if you have ref youre aping or this is similar work to that which youve done in the past if you wanna do work similar to the left side    blob in your shapes dont stress details blobbing  blob in your values   new layer wireframe out your forms like a 3d model     this is where a lot of figure drawing practice anatomy and a strong knowledge of the anime style youre going for will show    im willfully skipping the spend six months figure drawing people every single day for at least half an hour and for at least 3 hours a week step    new layer on top of your wireframed forms create smooth thin black line art which includes surface details and wrap lines like the sleeves  use a new multiply layer to drop in each of your your midtone colors and be super fucking careful about them  drop in cast and occlusion shadows drop in directional lighter areas and specular highlights based on your values from earlier    and thats it for the left one believe it or not    right side is    lock layer transparency on each of your midtone color layers switch to a soft brush and grind out those transitional colors you dumb motherfucker    the power is actually fucking doing all of the above and being confident enough in your figure drawing to produce a figure that doesnt look like shit you could get there in less than a year from no practice if you were sufficiently dedicated
  no u cant
  you know what im willing to try your stepbystep explanation  ill post the result in a couple days if the thread is still around
  yeah you could    loomis for 2 months for basic construction one hour a day every day  master study painters for 2 months to learn rendering hour a day 35 on weekends  spend the remaining 8 months figure drawing at live modeled events every single weekend get a job to pay for this and during the workweek whenever youre off work and theres a local session  use nonlive days to practice anatomy and proportion from reference and texts like hampton    its not that hard anon you just need to work like you want it
  accusing of samefagging  guess whos feelings are hurt sweetie
  3 posts all exactly 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds apart  not samefag    lmao its alright sweetie you cant draw and you cant hide your shitposting either  kill yourself or get back to /r9k/ where youll end up killing yourself anyway
  the lighting in cg drawings are often made to accentuate brushstrokes and forms you see that it often has light tracing highlights that make zero sense whatsoever    its supposed to look cool not physically correct
how do i transition back to regular life and job
  have you tried applying to jobs
  like any other thing is not like youve killed someone
go back to mommy and daddy
  the wagie cage meme is real   hahahahahahaha
whats wrong with it  every time i look at it i dont feel proud even for a sketch   the concept is of a strong being whom is defeated by time hence the clock tower piercing the subjects hand
to me its the messy brush work that spoils it looks pretty neat in thumbnail but once you enlarge you can see all the faults and the more you look the more you spot  spend some time cleaning it up and itd be neato
  also might add the perspective is a tad whack but i reckon you could make it work any ways so im not too fussed about that
  his stomach should be bulging/bent back under the strain  look at a power lifter to get a reference and an idea at the different positions as he pushes the weight to the top  that is  if u r looking to emphasize the strain
  should have made it clear that his back would be bending under the strain  also there will be some reflected light on the stomach from the ground
  it doesnt really makes sense that the idea of the sketch him being defeated by time is relegated to the background imo
  how about you fucking finish it
  the abdominal muscles and that it isnt a feminine pictorial representation
  reminds me of andrew hussies musclebeasts
  one of the biggest things you need to do is to define your light sources to help make sense of the forms simplify your value groups into whats lit and whats in shadows in a way that will create large simple shapes that helps articulate your forms
  oh well i thought it was piercing his hand just because it is pointy
  pretty much this   id also make the red dot a few  bigger and sink it a bit more to the bottom of the pic if i were in your shoes
  why is there a perfect red circle in the back
  its the sun symbolizing the coming of a day when the giant is finally crushed by his failing strength and the passage of time
  are you also compositionally implying that the sun is consuming or being filled by the blood they are the same color
is it legal to sell film posters with original art
  idk just use an alias if you are selling them
  if youre using someones art without permission then its illegal

any books talking art theory but only in text format    sometimes i get off time at work or in the public transport so recently ive been spending that time reading fantasy books thing is after i find a story i like i dont drop it until i finish which means even when i get home and could start drawing    i want something to read in those off times but not be so interesting i cant drop it when i want reading some art theories would be relevant give me something to do and when i finish reading it could give me something new to try if not atleast as a warm up    ive got folders with refs and artbooks but staring at pictures for a few mins gives me strange looks from the others
  a few people have recommended the art spirit by robert henri to me but i havent read it yet im not sure where i got the file but theres an epub of it somewhere out there
  seconded
  thx will check it out
  the act of creation if youre looking for a book that will change your life and how you think about approaching creative tasks its truly mind blowing it art theory specifically but theories about learning and creativity and approach that applies to all disciplines
  its not art theory specifically
  this thread is where you get most pirated art manuals jesus christ
havent been here for a while have anyone scanned leyendecker yet
  heres my artbook bookmarks check them out if you like

does anyone have omphalos by kjg
is there a online/pdf version of michelangelo the drawings of a genius i want to get the book for christmas but decided to check if theres a digital version first before spending any money
  michelangelo the drawings of a genius    i would like to know as well    btw are you a classical artist its so rare to see a man with such refined taste
  i dont have that but i got this
  no and thank you im hoping to reach that level someday though i found the book at a library and trying to study from it ended up being surprisingly enjoyable    a physical book or a digital copy
  quadrouple this  and the previous years book also please
  i have a lame pdf scan just had a flick through it its not that great a book actually i should probably be ignored
  gamefreak is really secretive about that stuff you wont find it there i would start with just reading bulbapedias article on unused pokemon and helix chambers website if you really want books though ken sugimori released an art book a while back that has some stuff and recently in jp if you preorder both games you get a small book featuring concept and promotional art only full scan i know of is at  but i can scan the first sumo one if youre really interested
would appreciate lessons from michelangelo figure drawing based on techniques of the master it goes for 50 on amazon and its not available in new yorks library system
shinkawa bro do you plan to scan the gallery works book from the art of mgs iiv as well
it might just be on my end but it seems like mega is now bugging me to sign in when i browse the folders on and off
  kyousogiga visual book pdf      please back it up to your account i cant guarantee that it will be there forever
since the /ic/ catalog is flooded with axis powers nazi/nip pictures which wolfenstein artbook is your favorite
  oh ok thank you i already went through bulbapedia but not helix chamber    also thanks for the link
  thank you
any word on amano sky book 3 and 4
  4
  yes 4
  thats not an artbook there is no such thing as the sky book 4
  literally says sketches of logos packages characters and monsters for final fantast    sounds like an artbook to me
  then do your research properly its entirely about the person amano and not about his art
  not that anon but it is an artbook a pretty hefty one actually featuring a lot of his ideas thought and paint process also with a dvd that shows his actual live painting process    all in all this is probably far more valuable than the sky books and probably more expensive
did tatsuyuki anon ever recieve their scanner
  beyond the fantasy is not the fourth book that is included with the original sky collection you guys sure are huge brainlets    also in the slipcase edition there are only the 3 sky artbooks you guys sure are beyond greedy even asking for a scan of a supposedly fourth sky book i guess this is the nature of leechers always asking for more and more without any remorse like the little sociopaths you are
  beyond the fantasy is not the fourth book that is included with the original sky collection    nobody implied it was you absolute retard also wtf is wrong with you the anons literally only corrected you and said that it actually is an art book after you were continuously implying it wasnt while acting like some tilted faggot kike    also they do have the right to ask i try to find rare books online when somebody is kindly asking for it but lemme guess you never shared a thing yourself    especially okay to ask for amano since the good anon said hell share the 3rd sky book half a year ago which at this point is rather doubtful
  the sky slipcase has only 3 books i think the wiki may be wrong since the content of book 4 there can applied to all three book though the logo design only one page on each ff7 8 10      the beyond the fantasy is not belong to the sky pack its the new one like a graphic biography of amano    theres this guy scanned the sky book long ago but he organized the image by the game not the book you can check it out if you like       theres a file theskyrar    hope we could hear from amano anon soon
  nobody implied it was you absolute retard  except he directly referenced the dvd that comes with beyond the fantasy you humongous faggot the fourth book in the original the sky collection is not an artbook for the fourth time retard  you never shared a thing yourself  you are wrong i scanned multiple books for this shit board and all i always get is faggots asking for more and more leecher scum is never satisfied
  well people always want more that the purpose of this thread no one force you to scan your book if you dont feel like it and what do you expect in return we appriciate your effort but all we can do here is say thank you    lets not waste time arguing please accept the fact and move on people
  from the wiki    a fourth softcover book 128 pages long entitled all about yoshitaka amano serves as the index book for the three hardcover volumes with titles and dates for all artwork as well as several pages of bonus sketches it also contains several interviews with yoshitaka amano a biography of his life and a full bibliography of his works both final fantasy and nonfinal fantasy up to 2001     so i think its not an artbook
  yep thats it
  he was pretty reluctant to scan the latter because most of the art there could be found on artbooks scattered across the web      guess well have to wait for the yoshikawa tatsuya guy for a while to update lol
  you are wrong i scanned multiple books for this shit board and all i always get is faggots asking for more and more leecher scum is never satisfied    you do realize more than 5 people visit this thread  are asking for stuff it is different people ive seen tons of books been shared that ive had no interest in     why are you here the only reason you come to the artbook thread is to get art books the minority are sharing the majority are downloading
any good books on drawing dinosaurs  ive been looking to get ahold of draw 50 dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals book but im curious if theres something better/more geared towards the young
  i dont think theres specific book about dinosaur but dinosaur is just another kind of animal so i think to get good at that first you need to learn to understand dinosaur features anatomy then gather reference and draw a lot when you already understand what make a dinosaur you can draw in any style realistic cartoon stylize even design new species and you know itll work
any guns fantasy or not books you guys can point out to
looking for this one can anyone point me in the right direction
still searching for these    
  any guns fantasy or not books you guys can point out to    ive been digging through vkcom see op for link for the past three days there is a forum thread over there with more than 260 pages of books and magazines a lot of them are in russian many in english and some in chinese and japanese    i scrolled past most of the weapons books but they have several from dorling kindersley
  thanks anon ill get a cup of coffee and browse the vk link
this came out a week ago    does anyone have it
  seconding
  i have 線と陰  will trade it for penguin highways settei book or in this corner of the world keyframes collection    
the framed perspective vol 2 link shows that the files been deleted can someone share another link to it
  some guys on kbgcubacom shared it and this too  
  thanks anon
  great book good quality everything mine came with the dust jacket which seems to be fairly rare in and of itself    the other one you may want to take a look at is michelangelo divine draftsman and designer still affordable great images    either one will do for xmas both are great but drawings of a genius is way more expensive i think
  
  thank you
  does anyone have op book with art from toshihiro kawamoto
  the beyond the fantasy is not belong to the sky pack its the new one like a graphic biography of amano    read it again bud  nobody implied it belonged to the sky trilogy people are just misunderstanding and thinking that this biography and the small index sky biography are the same        a dvd somehow implies that beyond the fantasy is the fourth sky book  nevermind youre actually a retarded like seriously
  i dont think hes written specific books about dinosaurs but james gurney made a huge fantasy series about them so im sure theres stuff about it on his blog or something we have two of his books scanned at least color and light and imaginative realism     ive also heard good things about the new paleoartists handbook and im going to get it later this month but i suspect its like a textbook and would take a lifetime for someone to scan
you are wrong i scanned multiple books for this shit board and all i always get is faggots asking for more and more leecher scum is never satisfied    so what youre saying is mommy mommy ii scanned something and i expected eternal praise and attention for my selfsacrificing deeds     youre either full of shit or are genuinely depressed that your name wasnt engraved on this oh so mighty /ic wall either way youre a faggot who should get down from his high horse there are people here who spent 1000 bucks and hundreds of hours scanning and compiling rare/requested artbooks while knowing that their efforts might very well go unanswered and underappreciated and when you ask them why they do it they answer with a simple its no problem i like the art and wanted to share with those who are into it as well but cant afford it or im just glad if it makes others happy   im the first to admit that im not that goodhearted and no matter what of a shithole this place is those are the true heroes of this board who make it a better place thats worth coming back to    you speak of leeches demanding more and more shit but arent you the same demanding more and bigger forms of attention and thankfulness since obviously you are not satisfied with the way you were treated my guess is that youre the anon who scanned the mgs books or even amano bro himself i for one shut down the thanks do you also have____ comments whenever i see them since yes its ungrateful af imo but you cant treat everyone the same anon
  thanks anon
    this is just an 130 page index pretty much we were talking about the illustrated biography which obv is an artbook limited edition has over 400 pages and a bluray
  well yeah that i was talking about that guy request the 4th book of the sky pack    and now were talking about this illustrated biography book i couldnt find any video review or review that show more pictures so i dont know what to expect and i watched a live painting video of amano on youtube too in which he paint the black guy on a horse i dont find anything special about his technique and i dont quite like his quick drawing too kind of loose but when you see some of his painting the detail color flow are just awesome
  ive been looking to get ahold of draw 50 dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals book but im curious if theres something better/more geared towards the young    wait  the ancient lee j ames book ive had that book since i was a child im sure you could get it for a song at a used book store even an online one    how young do you need to go
  ive had that book since i was a child  photograph it anon lack of dinosaurs is holding me back
  the kids only 11 but he likes dinosaurs and likes that i draw and doodles alongside me thought i might try to get him more into it

  youre a peach anon
  reading the reviews and seeing that page it just seems to be those types of examples might as just read loomis
  i think i got that from here its not great search ryo hirata in the archive
    no problem ive played and criticized the game while selfstudying game design so i guess some of the art was ingrained in my brain topic aside though hopefully we get another wars game soon lol
  thank you so much

    any download that doesnt seem shady please
  tried bokorg
  i didnt but i just tried and its not there either thanks for the link though i ended up just buying the book
  whats wrong bro the zelda link i gave you is the english digital version by dark horse the best you can get if you want japanese version one on that site is very bad you can search on ehentaiorg  the marcos mateu mestre books are the one and only version out there and theyre very readable
  sorry my bad i thought youre talking about the book quality  the mateus books are all in op thread   the zelda link is pretty safe too click on the image beside the download instruction after the countdown you get the link
does anyone know where to find this book ive tried looking for ages but i cant find it    the modern art of figure drawing  and pinups by derek k matters
    torrents by their nature are shady but    magnetxturnbtihbbb2bf9d1a12617480b7f630de4b4963179a60addn28e794bbe99b86e383bbe8a8ade5ae9ae8b387e69699e99b862920e382bce383abe38380e381aee4bc9de8aaac20e38396e383ace382b920e382aae3839620e382b620e383afe382a4e383abe3838920e3839ee382b9e382bfe383bce383afe383bce382afe382b9ziptr

  i own a physical copy of this book and it isnt that great i bought it on impulse and kinda regret it the hgirl book is better
  imo all these japanese how to draw manga are kind of the same
  its almost like fundamentals are universal wow what a thought

requesting     kirchners painting no one else has these colors     by christoph krekel and karin schick        i would be eternally grateful
tfw none of your favourite artists artbooks are scanned  i love yoshihiko umakoshis art but despite searching high and low i was unable to find any scans of his artbooks the best i found were some shitty photos from a fucking review website  probably because most of his work is focused on mahou shoujo and thats not popular with western weebs so no one bothered scanning them  still its a shitty feel
  import them retard
  importing them to the slav hellhole i live in would be far too troublesome not to say expensive shits tough
any tartakovsky artbook i dont think theres one for samurai jack but maybe the hotel transylvania movies    also taking recs for similar 2d styles
  blessed anon

what is the secret to drawing sexy feet
  trace daz3d figures and use airbrush tool
when in doubt go to loomis
the closest thing /ic/ has to a secret for feet
feet  sexy    not at all i dont understand how weirdos find feet sexy
  softsensitive think about foot massages
  a nice shape the contour must look nice and smooth take a pic of any well drawn foot and color it in black it will still look good  line economy its particularly important here the less lines used to define the feet the better  colors/values must be adequate   provided very nice refs
  i am not even a footfag but these do look sexy some anon on /ic/ said everyone here becomes a footfag sooner or later when they really study feet
  whats it like to have shit taste
  me neither anon
  their parents never picked them up and seldom made eye contact with them as a child leaving them to dawdle aimlessly on the floor hence the parents as feet become the provider and object of worship rather than the parents as human beings mentally stunting the footfag child for the rest of its life and causing it to identify as a foot morseso than a man
  my sister used to step on me when we were kids i think thats where it all started
  do you consider flat feet sexy
  please tell us more
  soft  squishy distinct smell  feet are based
  footfags are the worst
  you had me agreeing with everything until you said smell you make us footfags look like losers
  when my big sister wanted me to fuck off while she was sitting on the sofa she used her legs and feet to push me away or throw me off balance and pin me on the ground /blog    smell  sorry anon not all of us are filthfags
  second
  was she cute
   be me 18 in 2012   first time browsing /a/ see nothing but fetish porn   bruh2mp5   fuck that shit   go to /b/ nothing but fags and blacked threads   leave 4chan for 3 years   meanwhile girl im trying to get laid but nothing   fucking bitches are either lesbians or gold diggers   another year later and say fuck it ill hire a prostitute    prostitute come and im ready to fuck   first time fucking so i cant find hole    im in pain because not circumcised so first time fucking hurts   she leaves after wards and i couldnt cum   fast forward two years    get on 4chan    get /b/ and start watching gore threads    see japanese milf in stockings wearing a maid outfit stepping on puppy   bonerexe   go to town with my dick and cum buckets  hire same prostitutes from years ago and pour honey on her feet only to give me a foot job   nirvanamp3   came buckets on her other foot   see fuckable foot on 4chan   insta buy   mfw i have a pocket pussy that looks like a foot    what have you done to me /a/

  oh god that thigh is fucked up
  interesting why do you think it fucked up
  there are some good videos you can use for reference or reference here and in the related videos
  im in pain because not circumcised so first time fucking hurts  yikes someone has phimosis thats not healthy dude
  nice
   im in pain because not circumcised so first time fucking hurts  wait wait wait  it can hurt for men their first time how
  not him but for some men the foreskin is tight and the head of penis can get out   my first masturbate at age 19 and it takes several weeks for the foreskin to loose enough and slide down properly   and yet it will hurt alot for those ram it directly to vaggie without loosen the foreskin enough
  not liking smell    what cold sterilized times
  is long as fuck
  what have you done to me /a/  nothing you just have grown older and still had no partner so you became much much more desperate for sexual gratification to the point of doing disgusting things there is no help anon
look at this
  i am look
  killing animals is sexual  going from vanilla to zyklon b worthy degeneracy within one day  somehow i dont believe your story and it definitely wasnt /a/ that did it to you lots of us saw shit like that for years on /b/ without the thought of fapping ever crossing our minds
  why bandaid
  because bandaids are moe desu
  diy pasties
  do footfags like food on peoples feet
  food or dirt id not mind clearing such feet with my tongue anon
  as long as it feels nice on the tongue i wouldnt mind desu people that have a fetishism over girls feet smell are a bunch of losers and cucks though
   nice toenail aesthetics    blood circulation under the soles    curves on the silhouette on the foot   good composition and foreshortening skills    lastly being able to draw everything else good dont end up like those artist that can draw feet well but is scrubby at everything else
  if by people you mean cute/sexy girls with cute/sexy feet then yes
  not me but it seems to be a decently active niche foot fetish
  if its easily dissolved stuff like ice cream then yes
these are my waifus feet /ic/

reposting and requesting    does anyone know what does it says in here    its chinnese but still
  just draw you stupid fucking nigger actually pick up a pencil and draw something    my chinese is a bit rusty but i think i got the gist of it
  very epic post anon
  it says a picture says a thousand words or something like that
  made me chuckle
posting some video girl ai illustrations because the style/manga is majorly underrated its like neoart deco

  this discord sucks i joined for a few and got bots sending me private messages
  damn that sucks dude are you okay my thoughts are with you
  look at those proportions why do you even use this book
  you are not studying anime you study manga dipshit nobody here will ever work on an animation movie
  got em xd
  i am dead serious dipshit i am tired of these retards calling everything anime
  uhm its ka ra tay not kar ra tee  thanks nerd
  nerd  you people here make a thread about studying manga and call people dumb nerds xd when they actually have a clue about it    thats your problem whenever i see a thread like this i know its done by a clueless faggot anyway   anyone who takes this topic here seriously wont study anime they will study manga
  /r/iamverysmart
  actually its not manga its 漫画    thread title should be 漫画勉強組 dipshits
  no you are just very stupid i immediately notice you have no clue by calling everything simply anime the western definition of anime is japanese animation movie
  hurr lets make a thread for comic fans but instead call it animation movie thread  thats how stupid you are
  what the fuck kind of response is that
  stop being so fucking autistic god dammit your posts on the other thread were rife with bullshit and name calling over shit no one fucking cares about   post your work or die
  post your work or die    careful with that edge you might hurt others
  having actual knowledge about the topic means you are autistic
all this shittalk and no posting of work    wow its really like im in an anime study thread full of weeb neets huh
  any selfrespecting manga artist wont even post here they will just post in the stylization thread    thats why i am telling people here that the thread reeks of stupidity
  both threads are shit and nobody here can draw manga besides those 2 people who entered the manga contest last year
  or was that this year time does fly by
  nobody here can draw manga besides those 2 people who entered the manga contest last year  thats still 2 more people than the amount of people who made an anime here
    its common practice to say draw anime because its an umbrella term for english speaking people everyone knows what you mean by drawing anime in reference to the style
  its an umbrella term for english speaking people  no the english definition of anime is japanese animation movie   its only an umbrella term for people who have no clue about the subject only people who have absolutely no clue say oh he draws anime nobody in the west draws fucking anime
  can you please stop sperging out thanks
  only people who have absolutely no clue say oh he draws anime  do you want to post your mal
  i am merely trying to help you here if you pander to clueless retards with your thread titles you also wont get good artists to post here    enjoy your dead threads i guess
  post your mal or gtfo
  post the anime you worked on or gtfo    where is your japanese animation movie
eeveryone lets jjust all be nice to each other youre all good hardworking people who just want to get better at drawing anime manga whatever you want to call it no need to fight right right
  1 im not japanese im black   2 im not in japan therefore my animation wouldnt be japanese animation   3 japanese animation movie isnt a 1 man project no matter how much your autism wants to believe if we want to play with semantics     therefore when we refer to anime as english speakers were referring to the style
  fucking kill yourself jesus christ
  i make my own definitions  typical blacky ignorance is bliss    japanese animation movie isnt a 1 man project   there is an anime which has been produced by a single person again you dont know shit    plus you also dont realize that you dont have to be japanese to make an anime a lot of people who work on anime are actually korean too    if you dont want people to believe you try to make anime then simply stop acting as if you do
  
  1 yeah those are called reels animation students need those to you know get jobs in those korean sweatshops   2 1 answers 2  3 post your mal
  not anime thats manga get out
  manga master race
he actually deleted it  lmao
  there are about 67 basic ass kanji that you should know if you even bothered to start learning them get some shit on anki basic kanji book core 2k/6k read nhkeasynews and get going its fine to learn things out of order some of these youll see again and again learn to use handwriting recognition to figure out kanji you dont know yet either with google translate or     目色無描少小好
  ti means stop being a retarded nigger and look at the image its pretty obvious what the text is saying if you have a functioning brain
  he isnt fluent in japanese   ngmi
mods please fucking nuke this thread its beyond saving at this point lets just make a new one but without the sperg and all the faggots who feed the bait thank
    you can also benefit from studying anime keyframes even if you arent really planning on animating and besides what would you call the typical illustrators on pixiv that never published a manga a blanket name is more convenient this way
  ou can also benefit from studying anime keyframes  only retards do this     what would you call the typical illustrators on pixiv  i would call them manga artists of course or manga style illustrators  if someone draws illustrations of spiderman you also dont call him animation artist you either call him comic artist or comic style illustrator
  only retards do this   how so animators have a unique knack in depicting motion and flow that illustrators dont have so why not study them    i would call them manga artists of course or manga style illustrators  both of them is just as inaccurate if youre trying to view it from a prescriptivist mindset both manga and anime technically have no predetermined stylistic boundaries so if youre going for strict definitions neither of them makes any sense
  how so  manga has much better quality art generally of course you can also study anime sometimes but it makes much more sense to study manga only reason to study anime is if you want to become an animator    prescriptivist  oh look who is acting smart by using fancy words without saying shit    both manga and anime technically have no predetermined stylistic boundaries  an anime is an animation movie something nobody here will ever work on a manga is a comic something which already got posted here     many of these pixiv illustrators actually already made short manga pretty much every good artist who draws in a manga style already made at least a very short manga its just common sense to call it manga artist not anime artist    just fuck off only retards would say hihi i draw anime those retards who actually dont even draw but just watch their shitty moe shows all day i already draw this shit since decades and i never said hihi i draw anime
  manga has much better quality art generally  i really have to disagree on you about that theres no reason or evidence manga would have better art quality in general if anything anime tend to have better quality control if youre looking at the better studios at least due to them having highly experienced directors that basically directly redlines the key animators work mangaka have editors too but they are rarely as scrutinizing in regards to the technical side of the drawing quality    oh look who is acting smart by using fancy words without saying shit  dont know what else to call your particular point of view    an anime is an animation movie something nobody here will ever work on a manga is a comic something which already got posted here  again if you want correct definitions anime just means animation it could mean a 3second selfpublished animated clip on youtube it could mean an hour long movie by a highlyregarded studio in a theater anybody here could just as likely to work on anime as they are on manga    many of these pixiv illustrators actually already made short manga  and theres a lot of pixiv illustrators that made short animation clips too and a lot other that made both animation clips and short manga neither of them makes more sense than the other    just fuck off only retards would say hihi i draw anime those retards who actually dont even draw but just watch their shitty moe shows all day i already draw this shit since decades and i never said hihi i draw anime  definitions shouldnt be affected by your very personal feelings
  i already draw this shit since decades  not that anon but youve been gloating so hard on all of your replies lets see that work of yours big boy
  i really have to disagree on you about that  of course you because you are fucking stupid manga is personal anime is just mainstream shit created by a huge team on an assembly line any artist with common sense searches mainly in manga for inspiration not fucking anime    theres no reason or evidence manga would have better art quality in general  then go and show me a single picture in an anime which looks as good as pic related anime obviously has better animations sure but manga has better single pictures    anybody here could just as likely to work on anime as they are on manga  you are clearly just stupid it makes no sense talking to you nobody wastes time with creating 5 second animations except for some rare autists anyone who wants to create stories with this draws manga    neither of them makes more sense than the other  then call them simply illustrators i really dont care to me they are just doujin artists     definitions shouldnt be affected by your very personal feelings  has nothing to do with feelings its simply a fact that nobody here will ever do an anime i did a flipbook once but that doesnt mean i made anime fucktard the defintition of this word means japanese animation movie in the west    any talented artist doesnt watch anime anymore anyway its clear that only retards dwell here manga is the only thing still respected by good artists  
  its clear that only retards dwell here  lol i hate to break it to you anon but youre here too
  give source
  of course you because you are fucking stupid manga is personal anime is just mainstream shit created by a huge team on an assembly line any artist with common sense searches mainly in manga for inspiration not fucking anime  manga is just as much as a rushed assembly line of drones as anime can be if youre only willing to look at the lowest common denominator  just because a work is created by a single person does not make the work any better this only makes sense if the artist have a consistent high level of artistic vision and integrity which is definitely not a common thing in manga or anime  generalizing an entire medium like that simply doesnt make any sense especially seeing you are willing to single out a top 01 artist like inoue to generalize the entire manga medium but refuses to do the same for anime  and of course when youre correctly studying anime you arent studying a random batch of keyframes by a random nobody from a random anime youre studying specific keyframes by a specific artist they deem to be highly competent    then go and show me a single picture in an anime which looks as good as pic related  ok    anime obviously has better animations sure but manga has better single pictures  nobody is saying that you should never study manga or that you should only study anime by the literal sense theres value in studying both if you want to study a specific aspect like painterly rendering or hatching then go ahead and study manga whatever is needed to improve a skillset you desire you should do  trying to dogmatically confine yourself to something as arbitrary as a single medium just doesnt make any sense its much more productive to judge at the level of individual artists
  you are clearly just stupid it makes no sense talking to you nobody wastes time with creating 5 second animations except for some rare autists  youre moving goalposts  but a lot of artists do in fact make very short animation clips for practice even professional animators im not sure why this is news to you    anyone who wants to create stories with this draws manga  i dont know what this has to do with anything youre trying to define stylistic categories not what you think people should want to make and this thread is almost entirely filled with illustrators making your point even more irrelevant    has nothing to do with feelings its simply a fact that nobody here will ever do an anime i did a flipbook once but that doesnt mean i made anime fucktard  youre contradicting yourself yet again anime just means animation right    then call them simply illustrators i really dont care to me they are just doujin artists   so youre going to abolish something as useful as the whole idea of stylistic categories just because of your personal feelings    the defintition of this word means japanese animation movie in the west  neither the dictionary nor the popular usage defines the word that way im not sure what world you are living in    any talented artist doesnt watch anime anymore anyway its clear that only retards dwell here manga is the only thing still respected by good artists  this just makes it obvious how little you understand of this medium and industry as a whole
are we done here  can we post some work now
the best way to combat this autistic sperging is to ignore it and just draw unironocally post your work guys get this thread back on rails
  any talented artist doesnt watch anime anymore anyway its clear that only retards dwell here    you seem to read a lot of manga care you post your mal account hm how are you keeping track of all those chapters youre keeping up with hm oh thats right you dont read manga or watch anime     now kys
how do i paint like this
  more
  practice painting like that look at the pictures and copy them
  ill just come back here in a few days or a week when this thread is fucking dead and a new one is already made
trying to study tobe sunaho  a is mine b is the original mistakes i noticed are proportional things some color/value stuff is a little off gesture is inferior lost some of the subtly  c is a quick tachiesortofthing i whipped up after trying to apply aspects of the sunaho approach im not sure why i drew the face like that usually i do it a little differently but im more concerned with the body it looks like fucking shit my end goal with bodies is to be able draw bodies in that real conventional galge kind of look pan is a good example    i havent been doing many studies of this kind of thing because i see how much subtlety they pack into the drawing and get discouraged as fuck give it a year or two until youre more comfortable with anatomy has been kind of my mentality this is obviously wrong as op points out the artist itiyann いちやん pointed out how he just did studies to get so good and hes only 1 year older than me but hes been so good so long fuck everything and if you look at the progression of his art he made a complete style out of his anatomy even tho it was very lightweight in the beginning and with time he packed on more subtly  so my question is even when the amount of anatomical/stylistic subtly is blowing my mind should i just stop being a puss and just dive in or is there something that can help road map my way thru these amazing artists paintings  academicoriented anatomy resources such as proko and hampton and bridgman i find to be only minimally helpful since they dont help with the most important part actually getting the style to not be puke plz help before i start breaking shit
  i want to understand it first though
  just copy it dude its a somewhat common approach among animestyle painters in japan but actually more common among chinese weebs fundamentally its just about blocking in planes and then smoothing out their transitions where need be
hey lookit muh first animu drawing can i be japanese meow
  i award this the seal of western dog shit
if i want to learn how to draw anime do i start with the board sticky and then come here
  no need just read the thing op posted  general art overview      just keep copying good animestyle drawings and trying to come up with shit fully or partially out of your head or edit existing paintings constantly thinking about gesture anatomy style lighting etc referencing 3d models or figures can be good too  the final form of most /ic/ advice is basically stan prokopenko and thats not something you want to be
  could u translate the 2 pages fren
  its literally ocr you retard
  what ocr are you using  im using capture2text and its pretty buggy sometimes
  a chinese friend
  such a nice friend
i have always drawn on paper using traditional techniques can someone guide me a bit on how to learn to color digitally or recommend a good tutorial
is it possible to convert this expression into anime may i see
  smug_anime_girljpg
  if you think thats smug you should really quit being an artist because youre so out of touch with human expressions of emotions that youll never be any good
  here is a you      literally just search holding laughter anime expression
  thats not it either are all anime people this autistic
  why are you trying to communicate with autistic people d
  ok genius you describe it
  i cant thats why i was asking retard at least im smart enough to know when i dont know something which is more than the people in this thread apparently
  wow talk about arrogant youll never find good friends like that maybe someday your high horse will kick you in the arse dont bother replying youre getting ignored either way
no dont start this again you spergs
how can draw cute skiny girl
i once saw a thread discussing the way the japanese draw and how they think a little differently and that it makes their characters less stiff it said something along the lines of them seeing like animators or something anyone have any references or information on this
  going on 4chan to make friends  just how pathetic are you
  youre not likely to find that facial expression selfdeprecating sarcastic sulk in animestyle due to that facial expression being a product of cultural marxism which anime mostly filters out
    calling people trying to help you autistic and retarded
  god bless you anon
its supposed to be asuka but the hair shape isnt helping so ill fix it later   theres a few things that still bother me so yeah not even close to call it finished  i just need more time man college is beating up my ass critiques are much appreciated
  her left arm looks like a cheap and badlyjointed prosthetic the meeting point of her torso and shoulder with the upper arm is too distanced add more of that armpit muscle there im not sure if youre trying to push it as a style or not but the left arm is also too straight it looks like a log the fact that half of it is covered in jacket doesnt help the silhouette either id also try to fix the breasts the right and left dont seem to be the same size she doesnt look like asuka mainly because of her face and headshape id say its too softlooking but i like its softness looks gentle and kind it complements the fluffy hair very well
how do you draw anime hair /ic/ any tips books
  just watch youtube videos of speedpaints of anime drawings done in photoshop/sai/csp and youll just learn to imitate gradually japanese videos tend to be good also
  keep your strokes fast while taking in account the existence and not existence of the wind that causes movements as well as how it sits on the head learn to draw an accurate bald head by looking at anatomy of the skulll and then do the hair on top of it so that it can take shape accurately and of course over all learn perspective and keep copying references the more you do it the better you get at it
  copy good drawing of animu hairs not from animu because animation is expensive and they cant be bothered to draw good hair copy from proper drawings copy and keep copying until you get a hang read muscle memory of how hair is drawn when to put a hair and where as well as their basic form as in how it splits in the edges basically just draw
    thanks for your replies i know that i cant avoid the grinding but at least i want to grind effectively one more thing where do you get good drawings from artbooks
  worry about grinding effectively less and focus more on grinding funly enjoy the process of drawing it wont feel like a burden artbooks rarely touch topics like the one youre having since its considered basic and something that people just feel outmy recommendation is to just browse danbooru and find drawings that you like draw characters from your favorite show or something its much more easy to do and the resources are readily available
refs inc
make way for the supreme ref
  big agree anon why cant we all just be nice  sowwy my sketch doesnt look that good uwu
  sorry
  wtf happened to yu
  nnothing happened to me i just cant draw
  ur style is cute desu
  try this video maybe    
watch speed drawing of guy drawing anime  doesnt use construction or loomis or any of that stuff  just draws exactly what he wants right off the bat  how do you do this boxes are fucking boring please dont use the internalized meme thats such a low effort reasoning
  style
  dude dont worry about hair work on your head those pictures look like they belong on the wall of a fat teenage furry girl from 2006 worry about hair when you can draw a half decent head which honestly shouldnt take long considering its a circle with 2 wrapping lines and a small jaw anime does not look like what you drew
  mastery is all subconscious read the act of creation the fact that you think professional artists have some secret besides thousands of hours of hard work proves how much of a regarded dunning kruger you are  boxes are boring  then youre a lazy fag wholl never make it
  the fact that you think professional artists have some secret  where did i say that retard show me
  literally post your work
  how do you do this  oh by the way i dont want to learn fundamentals  just because he no longer needs to visualize construction or perspective on paper doesnt mean he isnt tapping into it youre so dumb you cant even answer your own idiotic questions
  show me where i said that  cant  fails miserably  gets upset  rofl post your work you probably fucking suck ass
    wip your turn faggots
  rofl this thread was a mistake
  yikes
  ouch
  owie
        i love it how when someone posts their work you faggots immediately go on the defensive after your dick shrivels away from the shitposting and start mocking the guy who posted their work     not one of you weenies will ever post work during a debate never ever
  to be fair he was being an asshole when he replied to     and it turns out he sucks which is funny
guys stop fighting
  replied to  meant replied with
  oof
  sucks  lmao delusional pyw coward
  he wasnt being an asshole he was telling the truth and quite frankly the faggot he replied to was being snide about not telling him to practice box forms the irony here is the guy he saw drawing anime from out of the blue internalized the box forms to the point he can draw without conveying construction it doesnt mean he didnt use construction he has done it so many times to the point it becomes something mechanical
  defending someone else this hard
  not an argument
  i accept your concession
  against what your angry sputtering take a chill pill incel
  upset nobody liked his shitty drawing  um nice blaster gun i guess lmao
  still havent posted your work loser
      the argument here was that there is no secret except for mileage from observational life drawing in other words you study the fundamentals the other anon didnt want to hear it and so  was kind enough to tell it the way it is which seems to have caused some level of butthurt on all of you    i have reason to believe you faggots are upset because you fell for a trap and thought if you copied your chink cartoons long enough you would somehow be able to draw it from imagination without having to draw anything boring continue this behavior for years and copy without putting thought or any problem solving and you get your typical dunning kruger with a bloated ego refusing to accept the facts which is grind the fundamentals    not even him but you faggots have yet to post your work im especially curious to see just what kind of faggot is behind this level of coping
is this thread just calling each other chicken and daring to post work
  
  
how do draw like this
  with loomis but unironically
  what book
  thank you kind anon ill watch it when i get home     bbut is my style  i know anon but i have the almighty loomis for that and im already practicing i hope ill get better in a few weeks months
  the construction is already formed in his mind
  pretty gud anon i like how petty the others are that they have to samefag their insecurity at you no one even posted their work       mmommy he was being mean to me  kek what a loser
        this fucking level of self defense hahahah holy shit
when you construct a long face do you still use circle or do you use oval shape  btw anyone knows any japanese artist who draw long faces other than raita
qtchan girl scout
  this is nice i hope youll fix her left eye though
  how might i fix it its intended to be shut
  oh i see it reads as if the pupil is there but not filled in i guess what confuses it is the gun sight
  now this is some good shit
im pretty new to art but why would you fags want to even start with drawing anime anyway dont you want to capture things from life when you see a woman with beautiful hair dont you want to capture it and share it with everyone when you see your friend josh come home after a long day of delivering pizzas take a hit of his vape and roll some weed so he can feel normal dont you want to capture that essence and mood and share it with the world so they can understand it too
  people just have different taste senpai
  sure capturing reality can be great thats why i usually have some kind of camera on my person i draw because i want to express the imaginary
  thinks photography is the same as life drawing  thinks he can competently draw from imagination without having observed reality first   unironically ngmi
  i said neither of those things
    the real world is boring and terrible and anime girls are hot    do i need more reasons
  take a hit of his vape and roll some weed so he can feel normal  what a fag
  probably the gayest shit i have ever read ever
   photography is the same as life drawing   he can competently draw from imagination without having observed reality first    i would never imagine them to be the same since photos always capture reality while drawings of reality are mostly a percent exaggerated its boring anon and nobody wants to draw your drugged out friends for the 100 time i want to draw storys in my head like demons and other stuff
abandoned the study halfway because i couldnt figure out the hues/values the drawing has a lot of problems too  if i cant copy something like this than i dont even have a shot at drawing something like this out of my head  crying now
  im not the faggy drawing my high friends guy but  no one wants to draw your drugged out friends its boring   now if youll excuse me im gonna draw demons  lol
  not that anon but do you seriously think a drugged out pizza delivery guy makes as interesting subject matter as a demon i mean whatever gets your creative juices flowing i guess i just dont think most people find the two comparable
  uses an anime reaction image instead of a real person even though anime cant capture the essence of his mood
  pretty sure  is trolling the way he jumps from woman with beautiful hair to mentally ill stoner reeks with sarcasm
quick explanation for why drawing from life will make you shit at art  going back and forth between studying great artists and then drawing from imagination is like having a great teacher over your shoulder saying no faggot thats not how you paint you paint like this whereas drawing from life will quickly make you start krugging real fast and end up like the napolean dynamite kid when he did the drawing in the movie
  theyre both equally trite and banal people have literally been drawing demons since the beginning of time the fact that you think its some interesting and original idea is as hilarious as the burnout thinking people want to see another burnout in paint form
  holy shit youre actually a retard thanks for the laugh though anon
  yet when people are asked if they wanna see realistic stuff or some fantasy its always the latter because demons can always have different designs and show the creativity of the person to make art from something you said people have literally been drawing demons since the beginning of time drawing realistic realworld stuff is boring and static nothing ever changes and when it does people will oversaturate the world with it till its not original anymore
  excellent counterargument  whats your logic for why westerners are garbage at art
  ancient greece  ancient rome  renaissance italy  france  netherlands  various schools of art throughout american history  westerners arent garbage at art we all know it the problem is that you have shit taste and legitimately think cartoons are on the same level as fine art cant help tastelets
  not a single artist to come out of any of those places at any given point in history can even hold a candle to say yutaka nakamura or naotoshi shidas work in recent years or the best artists at kyoto animation the skill gap is just too high
  i didnt say it was an original idea just that its more interesting than a life drawing of some hippie
    fine art    my sides
  excellent counterargument  why do faggots like you say shit like this you know damn well theres nothing he could possibly say that will change your mind
  you could show me a western artist who can match the likes of japans top animators maybe disneys nine old men other than that good luck
  animation isnt even art you faggot its craft the only artists working in television are the writers
    this is some high level denial
  why are you replying to me i have no interest in your argument just pointing out the fact that youre baiting people into proving you wrong when there is literally nothing anyone can say fact or fiction that will change your mind so youre just arguing for the sake of arguing this place is enough of a shithole without people trying to shit it up with hostility
  literal childrens cartoons  grow up anon
    it must suck having to be informed by academia what the correct kind of art to like is
  you really dont know what youre talking about
so many krugers and idiots in this thread holy shit if youre going to prove something about muh anime vs muh ugly real life at least post your mediocre work to back it up
  youre right anime threads do consistently have the highest percentage of dks on the board of course were talking about a lonely pathetic demographic of virgins whore looking to escape reality instead of recognizing the beauty it contains ngmi
  yikes
  the hells a dk donkey kong
  im glad theyre all contained here and the joke discord server so i dont mind
  i know this feel
  use more pink and less orange
has anyone tried using bjd dolls to practice painting i heard theyre good for reference material
  yeah ive done a little of that myself also figures wellmade ones can definitely be insightful as to getting a handle on rendering cartoon/anime characters but i find that they work best when having a certain drawing/painting style in mind when studying them
  you could try following artists work flow/process by watching a speed paints or something i think that helped me but you would have to scrounge around for good videos lol unless another art process webm happens again but i doubt in it
question are the asians just better at anime style because of their practice in calligraphy   i was doing my practice for pen strokes and noticed that my strokes just werent the same
  there are the 4 straight strokes and then 4 s shapes for each one of those and then your circles this is all forms
  no anon its just the anime culture we grew up so were expose early to this kind of things
  too expensive
studying takamichi this one is based off comic lo 200811
  doesnt look like thats what youre doing at all
  post the original anon
  im taking some liberties its a first try so im hoping ill get better as i go      heres the original didnt go for an exact copy
    what exactly were you studying here those two pieces have different composition value color and style  the girl is posed differently and there is no dog a young girl on the beach with wind blowing her hair this is just you being inspired to create a piece with similar content in your own style
  looks neat anon the gun is having a tangent with the eyebrow though took me 1015 seconds to understand that it was a gun
  youre right i guess its not really a study afterall maybe i shouldve posted it in another thread sorry
  nta but its alright no worries
    art nouveau inspired you should say
  no its just the language barrier and laziness most people cant read japanese tutorials cant find japanese streamers wont study their process wont figure out through trial and error what brush settings to use  they want loomis to teach them how to digitally draw anime and manga or something
heres a mega of some of my favorite artists/artists entire gallery you may need to resort from oldest to newest      it also includes headshots of different girls from deresute and other works     i tried to avoid as much nsfw as i can but it seems impossible considering almost every pixiv artist draws porn lol browse with caution im also still uploading more
need critique
  why do normies love soft cell shading so much
  experiment with smaller nose shapes observe how other anime artists draw it right now it looks p western
how to fix arms anything to fix before color
  her overall pose is really awkward imo try doing the same pose and see which how you can make it look more natural and relaxed
  no because all the amateurs draw stiff too good artists draw dynamic gestures west or east the bigger understanding has more to do with shapes and copying previous works theres a lot more emphasis on distortion of perspective if you look at something even like draw comics the marvel way you can see this style built upon with perspective and volue a lot of japanese stuff actually tends to be quite stiff from tracing to learn or broken anatomy but good expression you can lamd in the middle but you need to know volume perspective and shape design    tldr draw more and make connections on your own from the media you consume overthink it underthink of how much thought went in to a drawing other people cant make the most powerful connections in your mind for you you make those from relating different aspects of life
  this is literally what bargue and still lifes are for work on seeing real life colors first you only see them symbolically now hornungs color book and gurney color and light are decent places to start even ctrl paint color studies    start with a much simpler image and turn it greyscale then you only have to learn about value
  thanks for the advice i actually used those resources and exercises quite a bit in the past but havent painted in a while so this was one of my first ventures back into it in a while  i have however found little value in studying from life when trying to improve at animestyle except in the very beginning when you absolutely suck at art since studying life tends to make you improve much more at painting lifespecifically than painting anime the artists with refined styles tend to have a specific set of patterns treatment of materials contours hues etc and ways of doing things that are very strict in comparison to artists who try to capture life and i typically find my time better off studying those patterns specifically  since that crappy study attempt things have actually been going much better now maybe ill post something soon
  its from a manga titled vagabond
there was a thread where you were supposed to draw this actress in anime style but i cant find it    so im dumping my sketch here
i tried to do this one today i dunno it probably just looks goofy
  so you aspire to be a xerox machine that replaces eyes with anime eyes
  i like it got a blog
  that looks pretty sick well done capturing the angle of the face and translating things like the sheen of the hair over very well i dont know how anime this is meant to be since you usually dont make the nose and lips as pronounced as this but its a very nice sketch nonetheless      i like that you captured the shading well and some parts like the legs and feet even look better to me but i think you got the size and angle of the torso long its clearly longer in your painting so you also ended up elongating the right arm to make the hand match up where it belongs in the photo which makes your arm look stretched and alienlike the left shoulder shape is also a little funky    lastly i think you ended up flattening the face a bit maybe the head is even smaller than its supposed to be the nose is smaller which is fine but it also lost some of the depth it gave to the face the lips seem less pronounced and so does the round shading on the cheeks at first i thought there was something wrong with the eyes but as it turns out i think theyre the most okay thing in your painting    this is just based on observation so it could be wrong and if you painted it by sight its a very commendable effort but im sure you can improve upon it
suprisingly the eyes are the most difficult to get right
  its not a perfect copy though in some ways but not others i prefer my rendition i think the original looks cuter softer but mine looks more refined next time i might use a softer brush for inking
    good job anon  now apply the stuff you learned from this piece by doing something from imagination
uploads all of their drawings on twitter  1 follower  how do you get followers lads
  i want to eat your art is that bad
  by having a hole in between your legs
  why dont you try to make her skin more shiny also at least make the background blue
  well i can tell you that that is wrong
  correction two holes
  both men and women have two holes down there please leave unskilled incel
  if youre counting the urethra women have 3 holes so maybe you should think twice before calling someone else an incel
  t googled female anatomy to prove a random anon wrong  go back to your anime incel
  
lots of lens distortion in these refs
  perspective great anatomy wrong
  maybe make them longer
  probably late to the party but i suggest you study arm bones as well as how to they attach to the hand bones her ears are not supposed to be sticking to her head but a little further away her left arm is going too further to the back
  get a tablet and stop drawing in ms paint
  unironically git gud have an appealing style and engage with people online only autists will blame it on females
  looks good anon
    im a prescriptivist  im a descriptivist  now lets argue what the definition its supposed to be actually trying to impose their approaches towards words on each other  your argument is flawed prescriptivism and descriptivism are subjective preferences one is talking whats technically correct and the other is talking on a contextual basis
  tried playing a bit more with proportions today shoulders a bit more moundlike breasts a lot bigger    every brush thats not the pixel art/binary brush feels like ass my lines are all over the place so its not like itd make a huge difference but the binary brush has no softness and it feels great to cut a line across in the canvas the other brushes just look so soft all the time and using them doesnt inspire any confidence in me      i like it if you told me yours was the original id have to believe you
  i used a tablet for the sketch and inked with a mouse  why would i drop mspaint
  because its shit unless you want to make pixel art even if you want to make pixel art that are better alternatives get sai since its free
  try a smaller brush anon
  this is funny bc i would kill to be this good i know that you are attentionposting though
  these shoulders are too broad and look manly but those honkers are making me bonkers
  his is the bottom one anon
how do i achieve this level of drawing
  unironically fundies
  loomis unironically  values studies  anime studies
  oh nice desu
  anime
  i wonder who could be behind this post
what do you guys think of clip studio paint
  pretty nice program
anyone do eye studies specifically any recommendations
how do i draw bodies like this 
  the answer is right there just have to exagerate the muscles
  apply pen to paper until done
  wtf is wrong with her face
  its call anime
    step one be a pathetic incel
  wow blog
  just trace pictures of hulk and add some boobs on it
  study bodybuilders learn anatomy then stylize and exxagerate for huge amounts of muscles  not that complex but it is hard
  
  looks fucking retarded op get a better fetish instead of monster girls with baki proportions
  but anon muscles girls are best girls
anyone have tips on travelling and painting im going to europe soon and want to do goauche paintinf especially for long bus travels and such    any tips for storing paint / storing water / getting a portable palette etc
can americans work for japanese animation companies
  doing what exactly
  if you have the skills theyre looking for then sure why not
  they are not americans but do you not know about webgen animators like bahi jd and guzzu they are not japanese and have worked for anime companies        
  dont animation studios overwork their workers much more than in america
  yes they do unless your a freelancer or you have a high position with in the studio
  learn japanese and become a mechanical autistic savant like japanese animators / painters
  nonjapanese have worked in the industry as the other anon pointed out wouldnt you rather consider doing your own animations and shows       considering americans do not actually animate yes
  this is a misguided question because there are very few traditional animator positions in the us to compared to japan inbetween animation in general is a laborious low paying entry level job which we dont do anymore we outsource animation     who the industry actually hires are storytellers and scripters who communicate through drawings rather than text this is why our cartoons look the way they do despite there still being some very excellent american animators pure animators are not the ones running most shows
  are they overacting or do they actually want to die
  powerpuff girls shit  they want to die
  nah it doesnt seem exaggerated in my opinion i actually expected them to look even more exhausted/panicked considering all the work theyre doing i wonder if this guy is okay now
  thats kai ikarashi     im somewhat relieved that hes still making cool stuff i hope hes doin better now than he was then
  why are they not using digital papers freakin everywhere and way slower
  using paper means that you dont have to buy a whole new tabletcomputersoftware license for every artist you have on board    also if a shot needs to be changed or corrected they can simply bring up the paper for the shot instead of having to deal with files corrupting or computers not working properly especially under tight schedules
  depends some westerners work in a couple anime or game studios but they pretty much lived their whole live there know the language and had prior experience in similar smaller places
  no their tools are genelocked
most of those companies hire entry level dime a dozen artist for their art sweatshops you probably wont be happy to work so hard for so little
parents took all my hundreds of manga and toys threw it into the trash and burned it to stop me from doing art    our boy is so relatable such a golden boy    
  t asian parents
  the girls a qt
damn so he was a poorfag his whole life in some backwater chink town with no perspective in sight seems you cant betray your nature as an artist    everyone should watch this vid newfound respect for runakun
  mustve threw away his glasses and all his books on how to fucking draw while they were at it  but he only replaced the shitty manga because of course he did and thats how he got to be where he is today  bad
his fans in here are trash but hes a solid dude
  most artists above decent level started out as poorfags people living comfortable lives have no reason to put themselves through the hell that is learning art past the point of mediocrity theres no good enough that will get you out of the ghetto you need to excel or just give up and conform to a shitty hopeless reality
fills ur feed with random tweets and garfield memes
be honest how long did it take for you to become good or decent with art     i feel like everyon is progressing faster and im 20
  depend on how you define good or decent with art  post the art you want to be on par with
it comes and goes sometimes you have a bad run and nothing much is worth keeping its a thing about art and the same with music all the practice in the world and you can still turn out trite rubbish also a slow development is a good thing as its a joy to watch people develop their art over their lifetimes not many humans understand this though but stick with it
started drawing at around 5 or 6 28 now 20 plus years id say
  whatever you want i guess    talent is real it seems whats the pint of people like me doing things if we were born 50 times retarded than fucking gods everyone is so damn talented and i cant even make a simple sonic picture look good what the hell    was it consistent i started at 5 too but had huge gaps in my life of me consistently drawing
i started at 20am now 25 and i am where i expected to be at 21 at this rate i will be 40 when i get out of /beg/
  not consistent but no big gaps either slow plodding progress over the years bit by bit
i started drawing when i was 30 and now im 31 and im already getting commissions and producing the kind of art i wanted to be producing at the beginning it seems like none of yall actually practice your fundamentals
  should take you 5 years at most from scratch
  practice your fundamentals   oh yeah that woulda helped ive only recently been in a healthy state of mind to think of seeking out lessons though most of my drawing life has been a stumbling mess brute forcing my way to a point i can competently draw im trying to follow lessons but i have ingrained habits that make it difficult
  pyw
    false
  this is the most demotivating thing i read all day no talent on my side confirmed
what do you mean by progressing faster if its only fundies anyone can pick them good from 10 years old or so but a good sense of aesthetics takes years if not decades and a lot of life experience
25 years and 1 hour
  what do you mean exactly by aesthetics
  probably design
  well you know what they say  
  anyone whos gonna tell you theyre decent is a dunning kruger
  post your fucking work    i bet my piss bottle you make furry porn and not even good at it
  happy birthday faggot
  depends on how much you practice and how quick you get comfortable with your process but its an ever growing process you constantly have to hone your skills
  what i consider good art is varied and interesting art that grabs your attention
  im 22 im under the same impression given that i have dedicated almost all of my life to this i should be much better than i am now
  im 22 im under the same impression given that i have dedicated almost all of my life to this i should be much better than i am now  no room for grief now just draw with age come with experience and passion i guess  im 23 and i just start drawing this year and  im not gonna give up
  two years
what would happen to someone like me that just posted their art online chatted and bantered with peeps and didnt care for the image  would i survive if i progressively improved got more attention and started attracting creeps lgbts and stalkers it makes me wonder    i just want to post my work with thought leave it there think not much of it and continued lurking would it damage me in the long run
  would it damage me in the long run  youre being paranoid youre also arrogant to think that anyone is going to even remotely give a flying fuck about you or the work that you post online     once you start doing it youll realize how much of a nothing you are and how nobody pays any attention to you so yeah  feel free to post your work and do nothing else
  this level of projection  ouch anon im sorry youve been an utter failure thus far
where u postin it
  well satan youll start to notice some of your stuff will get more attention that other things and that people arent necessarily always going to be interested in want you yourself want to see you have to able to resist that urge to please all those eyes on you the bigger following you cultivate the harder this may be popularity can subtlety change your creative process in ways you may not even notice but continue doing art for yourself and you will succeed    also depending on the platform and if you are well known enough not saying something about some issue or another can unfortunately negatively impact you it is the nature of the beast
    da mostly its not porn in case youre wondering but i do talk with some over there  used to be on tumblr but attracted too many libtards and furfags and twitter is just too crazy for me    i think i prefer da more since it feels more lowkey and has a better social aspect newgrounds is up there as well i think but havent posted anything there yet    i used to do art in community college and got high marks but always got shit for refusing to post it anywhere i dont know what to do  i think i like art for the socialising side but not for monetary gain art is also kind of personal for me too but i can have fun with it when i want to i dont like the fatcats
    i think that might become inevitable for me thats what makes me weary of it all i like sharing my opinions and being blunt about a lot of things even in my artwork which wont jive very well with some people and while the extra following might encourage me to improve my work and attitudes i kind of just dont want any of that since it could interfere with my thinking and creativity i also have a tendency to blog around the place as well sharing insights and ramblings but if i got more popular i think i would have to censor myself and start talking about drumpf america liberals nazis trannies etc and i just dont fucking care
  no one is going to care let alone put any effort into finding out its not important
whats your opinion on tracing as a training method    hinders/stunt progress training wheels solid training method fast or slow way to build up muscle memory and visual library    try to keep the thread on the most scientific level as possible wont read pointless drama as if tracing is moral or not     interested in you personal experiences and examples/input from famous/experienced people who traced
  tracing is inferior to iterative drawing but it can help you if youre in a bind and iterations are not helping
  training wheels   tracing is your training wheels and confidence builder it can help you demystify the work you might thought would be impossible to achieve it may also help your and eye coordination if you have troubles with it  however it will not help you in developing your understanding of art fundamentals because it is a purely mechanical process in that sense it can hinder your progress
  tracing is a tool it doesnt negativelly impact your fundamental skills in fact it helps exercise other skills like muscle memory coordination and cleanliness if you trace from a montage of many different sources it also improves your composition skills
  might not negatively impact your fundemental skills but only if youre also practicing those fundementals if youre just replacing construction with tracing however it does hinder your fundemental development
  the only thing tracing ever taught me was how deslimming and unflattering line art can be
well you will learn very well how to trace but it doesnt teach you anything in regards to form value or understanding because your brain is not doing the work
  this is painfully wrong unless youre literally just copying on autopilot without any form of critical thinking whatsoever i dont trace but i learned from bargues which is essentially tracing without tracing i could easily see how tracing would be very beneficial for an analytical beginner whos willing to look at their work and ask the right questions about what what tracing the image taught them and how they can better apply said knowledge to their next attempt ad nauseum
  maybe ill be tracer 
  it doesnt hinder because theres nothing to hinder you just dont make any progress in some areas of drawing    you learn how to hold a pen but dont learn what to do with it
  depends i like tracing a quick sketch if im just trying to paint it and want the proportions to be accurate so i can just focus on values     but im im actually practicing building up forms then no its a bad idea
  i personally found it useless tracing just slowed my process but if youre seeing progress keep at it
first of all you need to know how to draw to trace anyway for it to look good and there is nothing wrong with tracing basically every pro does it to speed up the process just dont take all of your advice better yet none desu from /ic/
if you cant make a side by side copy just give up
  if youre a beginner its more efficient to do tracing helps you get proportions right without having to erase/lasso shit 2000 times also when youre tracing over an image you can literally see the form of what youre drawing side by side copies are for when youre more familiar with proportions and whatever a lot of times when beginners try to do side by side they end up copying lines and forgetting about 3d form
  i think tracing by breaking the figure down into anatomy is very useful like proko does just drawing the thing as line art wont teach you how to draw it but im sure its good practice for line art skills like line control and line weight     although if you can draw what you traced from memory id reconsider
  tracing should only be used for accessoires like flowers in your drawings   the main focus of the image should come from imagination but if you copy something from references to add to your composition then you also can just trace it if you want doesnt really matter
  a lot of times when beginners try to do side by side they end up copying lines and forgetting about 3d form  which is even more true when tracing  tracings main problem is that you quickly tend to only focus on the lines you trace and lose the overview of the big picture
when you ink your own work you are basically tracing if you really think about it
  citation needed
  why copy photos when you could as well just make a photo instead that shit is pretty obsolete
  im already tracer
  biggest problem with tracing is that its very easy to just focus on line too much    which means you dont properly use construction despite needing it  and can make you too obsessed with the real drawing and its mistakes like  repeating the original work bad placements which can create bad habits    for me personally i try to always use as a base to work with but always careful to not overextend too much to the point where i just end up learning nothing and just kakashi the whole thing
  it might vary from person to person but imo its easier to remember to think about form when youre tracing because its a simpler task actually its kind of hard to forget since youre literally looking at the picture while youre tracing it  doing anatomical tracing and using wrapping lines and stuff would completely solve the problem
after constructing forms you end tracing over them which is easy the hard part is contruction if you want to learn lineweight then yeah tracing is good
   the point isnt to be a copy machine its to train your eye how are you going to draw from imagination believably if you cant even draw whats right in front of you believably
  if you cant do a master study which requires a lot of eyehand coordination and training to analytically observe and reproduce a drawing you cant make it  shoo shooo shitter
  thats why i said you only should trace for small things like accessoires shit like flowers birds symbols ornaments etc can be traced    but the main shit in your image should come from imagination if you cant draw it from imagination then you have to practice drawing it by using references but without tracing
  if you are gonna trace line by line then yeah bad tracing is still bad tracing    the point is to pay attention to the forms of what you are tracing just because you are doing it wrong that does not mead everybody has to do it the same
  please ive seen enough tracers to know that most of the time they dont learn a thing  tracing a couple of tricky lines sometimes is a thing or tracing to improve linework is fine but if youre doing a legit piece from scratch and traced more than say 10 of the lines sorry but you dont know how to draw
  tracing a drawing or picture and then deconstructing it by filling in the forms afterwards might be a valuable exercise though no
  lots of mangakas use 3d models software to build the pose they trace on  ilya kuvshinov legit traced for almost 2 years straight and thats when he was already a pro/patreon    i know where you coming from but honestly lots of people trace for years/everytime and they get away with it pretty well desu
  tracing on contours is pretty much pointless unless you are commissioned to do a 11 drawing/painting copy on a certain photograph etc    however tracing for studying can be useful i took some figure photographs yesterday and traced the pelvis with hip joints over the models was really useful on the evenings study of how to connect legs to the body after i proceeded to draw different models starting from pelvis i placed the simplified pelvis did gesture drawings for rest of the body and paid close attention to overall proportions and felt really more confident on attaching legs to bodies on different poses    will do the same thing for shoulder area tonight first trace over some joints and get overall feel of the muscles in the neckshoulderchest area and proceed to do figure drawings
  mangakas use 3d models to trace because its faster and they have to output an insane amount of work they are totally able to put out the same stuff without tracing it just takes them more time and they usualy only do that for complex poses
i think tracing is useful when you are using it to develop you own understandment of structure over the target picture    but it loses at lot of its value if you are simply doing it to copy the lines verbatim details like flowers foliage or drapery are some useful places where tracing the lines show benefits
  i would fill the forms without tracing youll actually learn proportions that way the most important thing is getting used to think on why certain things are the way they are and how big they are in oposed to the other parts
  mangakas can do that because they are getting paid to do it  time is a valuable thing to anybody unless you are a neet its a pretty consensus that saving time in general is a necessary thing
  my philosophy is quite the opposite    if you work with comics or manga you should get gut at drawing from imagination to shit out interesting poses full of movement and life    if you are a illustrator the focus is on the bigger picture the colors the rendering and the presentation so it makes sense to save time using a base already done
would it be good to trace as a total beginner that didnt do anything before i have a tablet and would like to get the handeye coordination and memory
  why not anon it might not help with learning to draw from imagination but you can use tracing to help your coordination alongside practicing things like straight lines and ellipses
  yeah thats exactly what i planned
  drawing is one part muscle memory and one part understanding of fundamentals you can be well versed in fundamentals but cant draw a circle and vice versa tracing helps with muscle memory or people that have a hard time actually drawing but if you already have good muscle memory it is better to then just use references so at some point tracing will hinder your learning especially if you start gathering a following but that will be for an entirely different reason
  tracing a tool  exactly tracing is a resource just like lasso transformation color change filters layers shenanigans  you shouldnt be too uptight about it its a great way to get results fast since you are reproducing the wheel and not trying to reinvent it  however if you want to do more stuff from imagination obviously you gotta practice imagination feel like a couple of shitty sketches from imagination trains your imagination/free hand skills by 10k while tracing a thousand pages helps around 1k in imagination
  i remember when using transform/lasso was a whole omg cheating and nowadays everyone uses it    freehand drawing only matters if you plan to stream/public drawing because then i would guess people would still make a shitstom about tracing if you dont trace in public i dont think nobody will notice it
  you can be well versed in fundamentals  what fundies mean being able to visualize/reproduce basic 3d shapes if you cant draw a circle you dont know shit about fundamentals
as a complete beginner what exactly qualifies as tracing i just put the op image on another screen and tried to draw it from that does that count as tracing
  if i dont trace the photo is it still tracing
  i was just making sure i dont know anything about art terminology techniques or culture
  its alright for getting back into the swing of things
  theory and application are two different things
  its called a study if its really similar to the original people can call you out for it anyways so depending on the subject you better post the original source and say its a study instead of claiming to be from imagination/oc to avoid any trouble
  who the fuck let you write the rulebook  do literally anything except for stealing other artists works and claiming it as your own  trace 3d model photobash spin the pad use a ruler dont learn loomis     no rules 
  stop chicken scratching my dude that thing ruins everything
  expecting a obvious noob to already understand form and line and not chicken scratch   if you are going to just say stop doing x without explaining why/saying alternatives better to not say anything at all    to the noob usually longer confident lines are better just keep that in mind watch dynamic sketching series or brent evinston drawing course any of those will cover the basics about linework
  i really dont understand why tracing wouldnt help expand your visual library i dont personally trace but id imagine that tracing an image once and then replicating it again freehand using forms instead of lines referencing your first trace would really familiarize you with the proportions of the subject matter especially if the next part of your practice is to then find a different real life reference of the subject matter and applying what you learned from your previous replications    can anyone explain what would be inadequate with this form of practice
  it helps people early on learn the language of lines    jack kirby and many comic artists started out tracing their favorite comics    in the end though its more observation drawing and attention to line weight that grows peope the most    you dont have to trace though you can just look at the shapes and draw them i typically use a mechanical ical pencil and rough in the proportions and masses then refine it and ink after
heres a spawn drawing i copied in my early teens because i was a huge fan its not perfect but gave me lots of good ideas
  in my early teens because i was a huge fan its not perfect  ah fuck off
  draw this image in 4 different lighting situations
if leonardo da vinci were alive today theres no doubt in my mind that he would trace from photos    no rules only tools  except plagiarism thats a rule no plagiarism
  without any form of critical thinking  see i try to analyze what im drawing and after a while i saw progress in some parts  eyes eye sockets mouth hair pupils ears  i can do those in a decent amount of ways even by imagination to some extent i can visualize them and give them form    but i still struggle trying to learn the proportion/anatomy to a similar level of comfort  i understand everything about anatomy and proportion in theory but i still not confident enough to reproduce those by imagination    i dont know if i should trace it slower faster doing heavy/light construction because honestly i used to trace as a hobby while listening music after a long day of work and only recently i have been getting more serious trying to do it everyday and without music sometimes     maybe im just being desperate for fast results since i started drawing recently  2 months but it doesnt hurt to ask for advice from possible seniors i guess
  you havent observed and drawn enough of the human form to have internalized it yet it will happen with time 2 months is a ludicrously small amount to have been drawing in the grand scheme so dont get discouraged
  thanks for the feedback asking because i have really being enjoying drawing was even thinking about upgrading my pleb small intuos tablet except when i tried to do by imagination and sucked so hard it felt like a sucker punch in the gut and i lost almost all motivation
  imaginative drawing is like playing improv jazz it takes a shit load of theory before you can start whipping up believable compositions straight from your brain the importance of drawing from life and doing studies comes from the fact that youre building a mental library to reference from when you do want to draw from imagination
    i highly recommnd doing it if youre stuck on a certain body part after several attempts of drawing it especially in foreshortening
  da vinci also would never labeled himself as an artist so that kind of renders any point youre trying to make moot
  yes because being an artist totally isnt a loose term free to subjectivity and you personal opinions matter    also modern art isnt a meme and pablo picasso wasnt a hack that was falling to obscurity and to get fame did those shitty paintings to get the attention from critics and pseuds at that time who called him a revolutionary genius
i used to trace all the time starting out im not really an expert tho so i dont know if my advice counts pic related is my attempt at this picture i obviously didnt trace or it would be more acurate
  kinda of a love/hate relationship with tracing for some reason i have no doubt it has its merits but it can be a real bitch stab in your confidence when you trace something in 5min and when you try to get a close result by imagination it takes like 15min    id say if you serious about drawing do some sessions with tracing or if you are starting out and need some confidence      how long did it took looks sick for a reference drawing
  thanks it took me like 30 minutes
  to those people around here talking about analytical tracing how should i be doing    should i do faster/messy strokes trying to learn the form im tracing on or should i go slower to make sure i learn everything   which method gets more gains in the long term
  dont trace the lines exactly as you see them    focus on the proportions and building your own structure over the gesture
    tracings main problem is that you quickly tend to only focus on the lines you trace and lose the overview of the big picture    very true
  thanks anon  sometimes i still get the urge to copy line from line  specially when i try a different style  but im using your advice and feeling some confidence in my own lines
does anyone have ahmed aldori tutorials by any chance    hes a pretty good teacher but sadly he started to paywall his lessons    is it on cgpeers or does anyone have the mega files by any chance    //gumroadcom/medders
  hes getting worse    like anyone who tries to hard to explain art the important yet nebulous aspects are completely lost on him and his students    better to just look at process videos muted and listen to podcasts
  wow for a minute i though the mods were doing their job were not your personal torrent tracker
  bullshit halfeveryone is pirating shit here and the other half is lol muh loomis    his youtube stuff is pretty good tho
  bullshit  i said we are not here to spoon feed his ass im aware that plenty of people pirate on this board i get that reading comprehension is hard for you but dont put words in my mouth
  achkmed is a scam artist he got real pissy when the site for his shit was leaked on /ic/ he pretends he doesnt come on this board and damage controlled to high noon    hell i wouldnt be surprised its ahmed himself making this thread just so that he can take down his own copyrighted stuff
  other noteworthy scam artists is the cubebrush guy also comes here and noah bradley also came here and leaked his own course
  scam artist what do you mean anon what was his scam he seemed pretty legit on his youtube channel
  why do you call them scam artists genuinely curious
    oh anon you dont know cubebrush guy for example has a cgpeers account and has a history on that site for being a filthy pirate himself you should have seen the drama he caused there his excuse to watch to see if his stuff has been uploaded on the site     but thats not true at all as he has an account as old as time itself since the site was near birth and he had no paid tutorials online in 20092010 hes a scam artist by taking advantage of people by making complete package tutorials by reteaching from other peoples paid content taking advantage of naive peoples wants of having a complete curriculum my course is all you ever need dont look elsewhere     noah bradley same thing he has an article on not going to art school btw go to my art school ill teach you all there is to know on art  while bradley boy isnt wrong and he did link other links to places to learn as if you have 10k to blow on online classes he knows this about the audience why not take noahs class for a fraction of the cost scam
  achmed is scam because hes realized the pyramid scheme and pretty much what op said on wall gardening his stuff dont be surprised he opens up his own school in the coming years
  dam i thought his courses were sht but i didnt know he was a scam artist thanks anon    and what about ahmed what did he do to be considered a scam artist
  theres not a single profession out there besides art that garners this much animosity towards the success of others and their willingness to teach for a fee
    teaching for free is one thing teaching to game peoples wallets is another thing clearly not everyone in the teaching gig is in it for your best interests
  nah usually teachers are people who couldnt make a living as working professionals in any given field
  how can anyone on this planet exist thats this delusional are we just going to ignore how loomis worked professionally for years and was plenty successful before he started writing books and thats just loomis since everyone loves parroting that name
  yeah thats some bullshit i dont mind paying for lessons if they are good but i pirate becuase a lot of stuff out there is shit
  cubebrush guy was a texture artist he uses his blizzard street cred as resume pampering    noah is known just because of his olden days on the ca forums hardly even near loomis comparability     achkmed admittedly is a successful artist i just really dont like his attitude nor his voice
  the blizzad move was weird
  though texturing isnt a bad job using it to create the illusion that he was a 2d artist there is so shady
  he is skilled enough to be a 2d artist tho
bump
  he said usually and its true most teachers are just people that failed are what they wanted to do then theres the few ones that have lived a long good life and decide to spread the message that they learned before they die but its few of them
  can i get a tldr on this guy my gf watches his vids all the time
  tell your gf to watch my shom lom instead
  why dont you look at people he copies  he even link them on his artstation
