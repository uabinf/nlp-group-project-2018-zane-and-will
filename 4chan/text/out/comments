  what do you guys do to pay the bills  i dont have billsi buy things with cash onlyi have lived outside for the entirety of my adult life14 years outside
  if you can get a job as a waiter or bartender in a nicer restaurant or bar you can make silly amounts of money ive pulled 400 in a night waiting tables and i have friends who can make 1000 mixing cocktails i gave it up for construction though clearing dirty plates for condescending pricks was fucking with my self confidence i can still pull 8001000 a week but its much harder work and you dont get to be choosy at least you learn useful skills
  i collect ssi
  i dont have bills because i leech off my parents
  i work as a forester so im /out/ most days    downside is that i dont ever have the desire to hike anymore in my freetime might start doing some more /out/ stuff now that its getting to winter and my workload slows down
  what is that job like what did you have to do to get there how does it pay

  machinist      i can afford a one bedroom theyre 1200 a month  holy fuck is it normal for a rent to be that high in usa i live in finland and my rent for a two bedroom apartment with large kitchen and a balcony costs 400 a month and that includes water and electricity
  i work contracts for the local lumber companies mostly because their salaried foresters are ancient and dont like being in the field much anymore so i end up doing the things theyd rather pay younger guys to do    i end up doing a little bit of everything like timber cruising and timber harvest layout sometimes doing consulting for local landowners    the past couple of weeks weve been slash pile burning which is the absolute best time of the year just cant beat getting paid to start dozens of bonfires at once    i dont make as much as the salaried guys do i make maybe 50k a year depending on workload but i get to be out in the field way more than they do so its a trade off im happy with    bachelors degree and impressing the right people while in college helped me get my current job

  post your paystub
  place i worked was like 2530 a plate with plenty of expensive wine and booze only tip out was to the bartender and thats only 10 it can be hard to get into a place like that but if youre not a fuckup its possible as far as construction goes it can be a bit of a challenge to get into without knowing anyone but you can honestly wait until the weather gets nice again and stand outside hardware stores with all the spanish guys as long as you work harder than the other guys youll get called back contractors dont mind explaining shit to new guys so you can learn a lot of new skills pretty quick dont bother selling yourself as a painter/plasterer professional standards will be way above your skill level and theres tons of guys who are good at it learn how to work with concrete bricklaying framing carpentry that kind of stuff but yeah 90 of getting into it is busting your ass and impressing whatever contractor calls you i know guys who stand outside lowes and pull 1000 a week in the summer

  i think most people are unhappy with their life choices
  yeah but i think thats because we live in a society that actively encourages us to want what the other guy has rather than appreciating whatsin front of us im not going to claim im completely free of regrets but i think ive done a decent job of living the life i wanted and not worrying about keeping up with the joneses
  i think anyone is okay if theyre happy and they dont hurt others if youre 40 and work at mcdonalds i think thats fine just try and find joy
  yeah theres this odd notion that your occupation needs to be some life fulfilling experience and for some people thats a reality but for most people your job is just a contemporary survival skill a menial task that keeps food in your belly and gives you a dry place to sleep your ancestors picked berries you stock shelves theres no rule that says you cant find fulfillment elsewhere in life

i live in a factory town i work in a factory pay isnt bad i dont care about women and ill never have children so i can live comfortably on my own fortunately i live in the smokey mountains usually go hiking every weekend see something new a couple times a month theres lots to see here
so firearm thread  i just bought pic related anyone here have experience with it for the price and weight you cant really go wrong im heading out onto blm land for a week to see if i can sustain myself with it taking a shitload of mres in case i cant  also i know all the regulations for shooting on federal land but anything i should be aware of besides whats on the official websites
  anyone here have experience with it for the price and weight you cant really go wrong  the breakdown 10/22 is much better but the ar7 isnt too bad at the end of the day its a simple blowback action 22 rifle meant to be used if youre in a pinch     pros  compact when broken down   lightweight   easy to identify/fix malfunctions   iron sights are easy to pick up and work well at 50m    cons  bolt handle is a pain in the ass when youre wearing gloves or if youre hands are cold   mags are not great   magazine release is also a pain in the ass   aiming can be weird because of the width of the wrist and weight of the stock     have fun on blm land do not try and shoot low velocity or subsonic ammunition out of an ar7
  what sort of malfunctions am i likely to encounter this is only the second gun ive owned after my 12 gauge
maybe because theres an entire fucking board 
  what sort of malfunctions am i likely to encounter  failure to feed if the feed lips are damaged failure to eject or cycle if you use low velocity ammo
  lol 22  lol no faggot you need a glock brand glock in 10mememeter in case ol smokey shows up
  for more killing power huh    
  i remember looking into these and doing loads of research theyre really neato rifles but id probably only want to use one in a literal survival scenario the biggest advantage that i can see the ar7 having is that everything fits within its self and if collapsed is easier to maintain as a previous person had said i dont have experience with this but the bolt handle is a gripe the magazine lips and the older models really sucked with cycling    id personally rather have a 10/22 takedown instead they come in a backpack that you can shove other stuff in or move it into another bag    or depending on what your exact wants / needs you can always get a 22 revolver i bought a heritage rough rider 22 single action they go for about 130 bucks and theyre a lot of fun to shoot 6 round chamber those will run any kind of 22 rounds as well subsonic snake shot etc     they are made out of zinc with steel barrel and steel cylinder cheaper metal but mines holding up just finethey also have a hammer block safety so you can load all 6 rounds safely     my only real negative with it is the factory grips make it look like a dime store cap pistol i had a friend design me some grips out of purple heart and he did another set out of oak i normally use the oak
  i have the same one op its a fun little gun good luck with your test more than i ever did with it
  its fun and handy and easy to clean and manage but it stovepipes like a bitch
  heritage rough rider 22    does the cylinder pop out easy enough and the empty casings fall out easily from it for using a speed loader with it i see they have a rod on them that you press to individually eject spent cartridges from the cylinder the safety mechanism looks nice too like you can load all 6 chambers without worry of hammer fall on the sixth and shooting a toe off
  i rather carry a good ol 357 whats the stance on 10mm anyways
what kind of pistol do you /out/ists carry for hiking and how do you carry i just got a g19x for my first pistol i hiked around with it last weekend on my belt but the extra weight kind of made my hip hurt
      harambe not hurt the bait
  my stance is 151  6
  keep two of them
  ive got a chiappa i know hear me out over/under 22 mag and 410 breakaction as long as you maintain it well thing works like a dream and it has enough punch to do just about anything you need doesnt pack down quite as much as those henry designs but the pack is durable awesome gun for a backpack
  interesting choice that looks pretty cool anon are the triggers nice on it cant tell if theyre single or double action
was thonkin about buyin a 22 lr suggestions on a reliable foremost option bonus points for lighter/portableish choices im not a jew but i also dont wanna spend the big money
  cz for one of the best you can get      good enough but probably jams like a motherfucker      lighter/portableish    you mean like a pistol/revolver with a revolver you can usually get a cylinder for 22lr and a cylinder for 22wmr like the revolver mentioned in   
  linking to cheaper than dirt  no      look for a used 10/22 compact
  saying dont wanna spend the big money on a fucking firearm always means im dirt poor and larping from my parents basement with allowance money and need something literally cheaper than dirt so it is no irony at all that website was recommended    get cz or similar quality so you wont get injured from cheap shit blowing up in your hands
  there is literally a whole board dedicated to this topic   
  marlin pappoose
  forgot to type the rest i just coped one for 160 bucks and threw on a weaver scope and im waiting for 3 25rnd promags for it in the mail gun is super reliable i went to the range and ran remington bulk in it about 200 rnds and only a cupple of stovepipes     only down side is it is a bit more finnicy to dissassemble compared to the ruger 10/22 but operates the same so all skills should basically carry over in the dissassemblely if you are not retarded    also the gun shoots about 75 moa to 12 moa with bulk so thats good    would suggest throwing a smol weaver scope on one they make it much easier to use     also it is significantly lighter than the ruger 10/22 and is only heavier than the ar7 by one of    you get a better barrel charging handle all steel and aluminum parts a bot release and aftermarket parts out the ass       get this gun idk how marlin hasnt put it back into production
  ruger magpul takedown
  they forgot to include the front hanguard better return it marlin stopped making all of their cool shit like the camp 45  also try some freshly ground pb youll never touch that skippy jif shit ever again
  ken and i will mate yeah their shit kinda sucks big dick recently
  looking at the marlin website it seems they just went 20000 fudd and now only make 6 different rifles 
  wizard nut grinder    sounds like my ex wife thank you ill be here all week
  8 shot 357 horse pistol
  you cleaned
  blame that on those fat cat bean counter fags at remington
  pic  28k to make nut butter    robbery
  its ok bro you dont have to buy the grinder the store has them already anyways once the customers buy 371lbs of delicious almond butter at 754 per lb the grinder has paid for itself
  i just use my mortar and pestle
  i kind of want one of those m6 scout repros as a backpack gun but the prices on them are ridiculous they go for like 800 here
        i know the 686 can hold 7 but the 357 and 10mm have comparable ballistics and stopping power if you use hard cast fatties never heard of a 6 44 mag     theres no question as to which is superior in a life or death scenario with nearly 3x the chances of landing a shot if you dont want to carry a full on rifle that is
  not op however this fag never said n e thing remotely political he stated there is an entire board for actual weapons and firearms somehow you brought orangeman into this how does that even correlate your just like those panzy left fags putting any type of blame to the repubs
  are you posting from a switchboard
  ill give that one to ya
anyone else think that the appalachian mountain range is just a huge joke the sierras are twice its size and feature way more interesting formations and characteristics i dunno appalachian just seems gay sierras are the real /out/
appalachian mountains   aka hills
the sierras dont have nearly as much character as the appalachians
i dunno it is a bigger version of the driftless area in mn wi the sierras give themselves away quickly there is no layering to the beauty their its grand for sure but that is what it is grand the subtle beauty of the appalachians is more my pace it is a magical well trod place new experiences are over each and every hill
the appalachians are far older and have far more biodiversity and biodensity the sierras and rockies are more overtly spectacular for those whose eyes are only capable of seeing that which is easy to see and for faggots
  its not a joke my dude its just a place most of my family came up on the east coast near the mountains and i currently reside in the same situation its just the place i live and i like it i like the people its not full of newworlders with massive ambitions and super sunny views on the world its old and seen some shit it knows how the world is and chooses to exist quietly its home it never changes not really
  mountains are a meme flatlands are where its at
  the appalachians are plain but comfy like a local motel that serves really good breakfasts you dont need fantasytier skystabbers like the rockies or sierras all the time  t guy who lives within sight of the rockies
  appalachia is comfy
  the appalachian mountain range is just a huge joke      respect your elders the apps are 480 million years oldthe sierra are 40 million years old the apps used to be taller than the sierra their age demands respect for their subtle charms of today
the sierras are full of cali cucks same with the colorado rockies so no much less comfy
read your kephart like a good /out/ist before spouting off bullshit
i think the appeal is sort of that last of the mohicans mix of dark woods rocks mountain streams etc
  this anon gets it
  i was going to type out a long response but the short version is please fuck off to la what a dumb post and im from the sierra
the best /out/ land is sinply that which you spend the most time on someone living in the appalachians with deep knowledge of the regions cultural/geological/ecological history is a thousand times more /out/ than your stupid ass thru hiking the sierras with john muir quotes on your nalgene bottle   t lives near neither range
  salt flats are boring    boreal forest now that is where it is at muh niggas
at least the appalachians arent boring
competitiveness with natural features is really fucking stupid and immature imo why disparage this beautiful environment because it isnt exactly like another one i get something like preferring colorado over kansas for /out/ings of course but no one is making you choose one or the other or rank them or whatever just feels like a shitty way of thinking about these things the appalachians are beautiful and full of history and character and im glad we have the variety available
  appalacians are gay and boring not even in the same league they are barely mountains
  size queen  im guessing you only hike mountains live on a mountain breathe mountains eat mountains and never visited a plain never been curious about a swamp and havent ever wanted to wonder about a forest thats barely /out/
  appalachian appreciation thread you say
  this thread is fucking stupid
  listen i am not trying to be a dick here ive actually hiked the at and the terrain is incredibly monotonous and uninspiring every step of the sierras is breathtaking whereas the ats absolute best characteristic is autumnal foliage which is like one month out of the year then its back to being shit
  see this is a great example it looks like any new england backyard
uncle ray and i can appreciate all three american ranges  
the appeal is societal anarchy in a seemingly endless forest growing on an insane topography of rugged ridges and valleys
  i am not trying to be a dick here  but you sure as shit are succeeding at it
  filter
  your loss we really dont care about your weird need to rank and weigh and make into a pathetic dickmeasuring contest everything genuine like some obnoxious buzzfeeder
  you ever been in the blue ridge area
  natural
  beautiful
    looks like boring ass hills
tiddy
  booby

  booty  or boobies
        high class
  the sierras are in california which is by far the gayest state in the country so by default the sierras are the gayest mountain range
  /out/  /his/  ive had moonshone from appalachian spring water  it was nice got folded that night and had my first beer with my dad a heineken somerset  passed through those mountains later on in life on a soulsearching car journey rainy as fuck
  i agree with you anon appalachia is shit and its dwellers can stay there    who /westside/ here
go to bed conor
im not going to shit on the appalachians ive had plenty a good hike there but i dont appreciate people shitting on the sierras
not being able to appreciate all /out/ for its individual beauty  pleb and sage
a challenger appears    
west virginia is really pretty
  ozarks  whats the difference between them and the appalachians arent there unique ecoregions
  a challenger appears  a challenger for the biggest joke of a mountain range
biggest deciduous forest in the world  no californians  ive made my decision
    agreed deciduous is the key the cycle creates a much richer forest floor and understory biodiversity and biodensity who the fuck would want to be out on a bunch of exposed rocks with faggots
  anyone else think that the sierra mountain range is just a huge joke the himalayas are twice its size and feature way more interesting formations and characteristics i dunno sierra just seems gay himalayas are the real /out/    see how that works
  sweaty appalachians
  better music too
id rather be in some dark hollow  where the sun dont ever shine  than to be in some big city  in a small room with your faggotry on my mind
  stay mad east cuck faggo
  stay mad lower 48 cuck faggo
  based
  lived intermittently in the sierra nevada and grew up just outside the foothills so i know my home mountain range    the appalachian mountain range is far far older than the sierras there are related mountain ranges in britain to get a sense of how old they are the sierras comparatively are new theyre entirely different ecosystems and entirely different regions neither is better than the other      ps stay out of my sierras homo
  too many humans on both the east and west coasts but especially the east id rather live in places most people dont like like the desolation of the deserts where the sun always shines and the fags and cucks drive through or fly over but dont ever stop
scottish highlands look nicer then most american mountains just because there smaller doesnt make em worse
    these posts are why op is a faggot
sierra nevadas are incredible but i guess if youve been raised with the appalachians then country that you know real well will always beat worldclass views like out west
  awww thats cute you think youre a snowflake
  t mountainlet
    agreed theres no beating banjo fiddle autoharp harmony singing folk poetry all rooted in long lineages of rich traditions and lore
  sorry youre having a bad day snowflake wanna talk about it
    size queens at it again i dont think of them as mountains more really big hills still beautiful and unique
we aint paid no whiskey tax since 1792
i play my grandmothers dulcimer and fondle the ancestral firearms and listen to hermit thrushes on the porch whereupon i cry into my redeye gravy at the beauty of such a simple life in the wilderness they had and lost
  well i dont fucking live two miles from the sierras so uhhhh get bent coastie
  but still just a hill
      comfy
appalachians are officially pleb filter  how did this happen it used to be the trail that even normies from across the country would go to but now even thats beyond them people have no idea how to appreciate the intimate nature of the intimate nature of the appalachians where one spot with no vistas in the woods actually has more going on than many grand vistas do shows that size queens never even looked at them too because then they would realize that the forests of maine or the loose rocky scrambles in pennsylvania are much harder to climb than much of the highest peaks in the rockies or sierras
i just received a psychic message from the appalachians channeling from them to you begin transmission    thank you faggots for thinking we suck and staying away to at least somewhat lessen the faggot traffic within us stay in the sierras as they are nearer to your faggot capital of the world    end transmission
  when will least coast mountainlets learn     tkansas
  gay
  the appalachians dont need to be huge its all about the character of the region which is too huge to be called just one region anyways
  god i would love to own a homestead on the top of one of these ridges    i wonder if there is a resource for that
  hes never been to maine
  ooh look whats that in the background
this thread  le happy appalachian marketing board mole      and ruin the view please dont human
  population density of 43 humans per square mile  no fucking thanks
  loose rocky scrambles in pennsylvania are much harder to climb than much of the highest peaks in the rockies or sierras    how is this a positive characteristic the mountains are shit  probably because they are not even mountains  that is why they are hard to climb there is nothing rewarding about it at all its just a pathetic attempt to call a pile of shit nature or a mountain when in reality the east coast has nothing for it at all and never will its pathetic just give up
  that just looks like bigger colder hills
  this is 14000 feet you fucking faggot more than double the size of anything the appalachians could even dream of reaching
  you have no idea about the history of these mountain ranges do you
  14000 feet  trees
app/long trail is called the green tunnel for a reason if you like profusely sweating horse flies 3 degree views and hiking up stream beds the east is for you
  sounds like someone who has done nothing but look at a map
  i grew up in vt hiked over 100 miles of the lt i love the sierras and only hike vt now when friends visit no comparison west is best
the appalachians tag in the rockies and california gets a sex change to a grassland after feeling inadequate
maybe you cucks should just learn to appreciate all regions nature before you call yourselves /out/doors people
  geologically the appalachians are an older respectable formation but it was formed from less impressive and less intense geologic events and weathering the western half of north america is sliding across the largest continental crustal plate on earth creating massive volcanoes and tilting massive chunks of the plates forming 40006000m mountains the weathering is more prominent in the west as well less than 500k years ago quite possibly the largest peak in what would become the lower 48 of the us was actually a volcano in arizona that lost over a thousand meters of elevation in its eruption it was believed to be around 4800m another example of this intense weathering rate is the vishnu base rocks at the bottom of the grand canyon which are 152 gya billion but the canyon itself was opened less than 10 mya by the colorado river there are either active or recently inactive volcanoes and hot spots in every state west of texas some of the older formations are up to 280 mya permian
  ormed from less impressive and less intense geologic events and weathering    less impressive and intense than continental separation from africa the appalachians were once part of the little atlas chain in morocco
  less impressive and intense than continental separation from africa  unironically yes the pacific plate is literally the most geologically intense plate in the world active partial land mass separation and island building is also occurring in the west not even mentioning the hawaiian hot spot yellowstone hot spot opening of the gulf of california very large active fault lines 3km of tectonic uplift in some areas etc etc
  agreed app is shit
  14k  trailhead at 10k
  probably 11 or 12 actually
    try 6k
  name of the peak and route
  except there are actually plants and animals in the appalachians
  lol sure buddy ive been out west a number of times i know the average trail elevation gain is only 4k
  is fire an animal
  no patrick fire is not an animal  droughts arent an animal either
  you havent been anywhere
  thats like hella right comrade totes nothing here for you at all dude better you just like stay far far away man
  refuses to name trail head or mountain because he knows hes wrong
  kek
  denali
  burn
  loser town
mountains good
just finished a sobo hike last week from me to ga did the pct nobo last year and cant say either was better than the other best part is the 4 months of peace and quiet away from faggots like you all the views are extra
  this its not some kind of dick measuring contest
  faggot
what are some good cheap sleeping bag and bivi bag options uk im not a complete nigger i have a job so it doesnt have to be dirt cheap just cheap enough to justify spending considering this will be my first time    im going to go wild camping for the first time this winter temparature will probably drop to around/just below freezing and itll undoubtably be wet
im in scotland im thinking about the vango tempest 200 2man from millets or a 2man berghaus trying to keep it around 150 and no heavier than 25kg theres an all season sleeping bag on there i want too but i forget which ill not be going out til spring so gonna check sales in new year
i should have said not getting a bivi i have tarps that suffice and hammock for where i can find trees tent is for when im out with my dog scotland is a bit mental at times
cumulus in poland make somenuce and well priced sleeping bags/quilts     what sort of bivy are you after domestically we can only really get big heavy waterproof bivys which are miserable to sleep in check out trekkertent for some awesome scottish made tents and tarps
scottish guy here trekkertent look good but even for 3 season stuff they look pricey keep in mind scotland gets all seasons in one day all year
  im more than familiar with scotlands weather their stealth 1 has stood up to the weather more than well enough for me its a seriously good tent for the price sadly the best tent for uk conditions imo is made by an american company mountain laurel designs solomid and trailstar are perfect for british hill walking
hey /out/ so i am planning on a trip to the south mexican jungle during december but ive never actually done any jungle camping in the past so what do you guys recommend
  you will die

wrong becky thisuh chick is cool but is purely gear oriented no actual /out/ the young lady from the uk however is an organic blend with most of the focus on pure /out/ and simply discusses her own gear from time to time without being shilly its also refreshingly organic to see her demeanor and process of being a humble learner without being all i am the fount of knowledge dispensing my wisdom to the plebs
getting ready for winter edition    hey there buckskinners longhunters and other glorfied larpers of /out/ what events or excursions do you have planned
  also proper blanket wrapping and leaf mattresses with j townsend

  the plan is another fourday weekend cold camp canoeing up the james river hopefully after thanksgiving been prepping for it making biscuit potted meat etc        i got a lot of respect for townsend and getting to meet him at my museum was genuinely a great time
  getting to meet him at my museum was genuinely a great time  i am sure it was he seems like a very interesting and enjoyable person to talk with

  never know when you will be laid for by a forestt moslem or a moor could not hurt
  thanks anon ive always enjoyed a more old school style for my /out/ings i got a few more pics i can post    i dont know about armor but when it gets really cold out ive found a gambeson to be perfect pic related is something i spend a lot of time in last winter sorry its not a bit better

  not sure if this would be up your ally aswell but this brown habbit has been my main clothing since i was about 13 easy to layer up under and can be perfect by itself in summer ignore the bad facial hair its gone now old pic
  i like the facial hair nigel thornburry esque
    very neat thanks ive actually poked around that armstreet site the other day and was looking at those boots and thought they were quite nice and i agree the facial hair is not that bad

anyone else super bummed by the onset of winter and its effect on outdoor activities    i like to go hiking and mountain biking to explore interesting terrain see cool animals or relax in peaceful areas during the winter all the terrain gets homogenized leafless tree trunks of varying structure conifers white stuff most animals are hibernating and its impossible for me to be really comfortable without expending a lot of setup effort because the environment is fighting back    i live in upstate ny with 56 month winters and some of the highest snowfall levels i dont totally hate the snow and i do appreciate the activities it enables snowshoeing skiing snow biking etc but they lose their novelty quickly     i still go out almost every day and make the best of it but it feels flatly worse most of the time than what id be doing in the summer and that sucks     how do you guys deal with this any suggestions to make the winter landscape more interesting lesserknown activities to try do i just need to move south
save up and head somewhere warmer for a month or two
  everything youre saying is true op i still love winter just as much as the other seasons but i admit i get tired of it a bit quicker i would suggest really thinking about things you can only do in winter and embrace that so you have something to look forward for the season snow shoeing and such also the experience of being /out/ during a heavy snowfall is unlike anything else  the stifled silence despite all the movement and activity makes for great photos especially at night also i like the discomfort and hardship of winter but maybe thats just the way i am i drag my friends /out/ during winter and i love it but get get pretty over it     idunno man winter sounds smells and looks pretty amazing to me even without snow you just have to bare more shit and overcome a lot more unpleasantness generally idunno if this is feasible for you but perhaps spend late autumn/early winter building a decent semipermanent shelter and then spend the winter enjoying it
  anyone else super bummed by the onset of winter and its effect on outdoor activities    worse here is that it no longer snows much and instead rains all winter and everything is neck deep mud we once had 4 feet deep snow every year but about 1015 years ago it started getting to warm now it is all rain with a smattering of nonsticking snow once in a while just enough hot weather to make plants bloom then a freeze to kill them im talking 7080f in january it is ruining fruit tree crops every year now
winter is where its at man no flies no mud and you can walk over lakes to access new terrain hike with snowshoes and beat down some trails then you can ride them trails on your mtb thats how we use to build our north shore style trails pull all the wood in on sleds to build up the ladder bridges and drops would do it all with axes and hand saw s a few of the trails wed even have a lil camp/shelter built and spend a night or two    your just going to need some warmer clothes layers are your friend but thats an other topic all together
  i prefer winter winter gives the air that crisp feeling work feels like work you can feel it warm you up from the inside the sting from the wind alone keeps you awake during those rough mornings where if it werent for how your cheeks were numb the warm confines of your blanket and sleeping bag would seem to call to you winter is nice
  sounds nice here i havent walked over a lake or pond in over 20 years
  i dont want to start a new thread so ill ask here    would pic related be a good idea to heat up the tent a little like if id hang it from the ceeling they seem pretty safe  would covering tent with thermal blanket help i was also thinking about seting up a tarp over tent for wind protection etc   what to use for isolating tent from the ground thermal blanket or something stronger
  absolutely not you may end up with carbon monoxide poisoning never have an open flame like those in an enclosed space even if it is a tent the amount of ventilation required to give you enough air to prevent that is too much air for that to heat up the place enough to matter    a father his son and his sons friend died that way here some years ago it was just a regular dome tent too evidently it was pretty terrible for everyone involved because it happened during an local camping event and there were tons of children and kids around it wasnt even for warmth they think since it was the start of fall
winter is a test of manhood which any man should not only welcome but relish it has not even fully arrived and were already seeing failures in some cases at the mere thought of its coming perhaps you should consider living in san francisco
  get a load of this larping fag
  im in the up so i dont have too much sympathy for your long winters but youll never enjoy it as much as the warmer months unless you embrace the unique opportunities winter provides sounds like you already enjoy some of those things i like how its easier to watch raptors after leaf off i like how public land is more remote at this time of year if you try and still get bummed out in winter perhaps try finding a situation that allows you to live further south at least seasonally
winter is when the real /out/ists come out    comfiest time of the year no debate
chances of bumping into other people in winter are much less especially if youre sneaking around
  winter sucks  posts pic of xc skiing  no i love winter once the ponds and swamps freeze over i explore them on skiis  i do get depressed from the lack of sunlight though
    exploring isnt very compelling when every landscape gets converted into the same marshmallowy mess however i get that some people dont care about the details like the varieties of minerals sticking out of the ground or what species of moss are growing on them and are just happy not to be indoors
run a trapline and start small game and predator hunting you will never feel more alive than longlining out of a series of shelters you made sitting innacave smoking a pipe and fleshing a coyote hide while a grouse roasts is my fondest memory
  same marshmallowy mess  its not though you can go places you cant go during the summer  you can get up close to beaver huts  i found a carcass on the ice once  you arent being observant enough if you think it all looks the same
  and the tracks every foot of the ground is telling an amazing story a story with food and furs at the end of it
  what kind of shelters
  lets see ive made/ used spruce bough leantos a half cabin out of railroad ties i found a cave with a natural chimney an old overturned rowboat an adirondak shelter on a lake and just plain tarps and such you stock them with food and supplies that you cache in a tree early on so you arent living out of your backpack
  winter hiking  fall hiking dont be a lil bitch op
    theres a line between manliness and masochism and i think you might have lost track of it
  sounds awesome do you have any reccomendation on guides/books/infographic
  shelters shacks and shanties  horace kephars woodcraft  prolly that dave canterbury book  that northwoods survival man from yt has some shelters  mikereed on yt as well
  insectless wonderland is a test of manhood    someone needs to dump you in blackfly and mosquito wonderland
  its the same place aprilseptember
    ive been in both blackflys whilst camping in florida worst scourge ive ever encountered anywhere mosquitoes in summer when living at yellowstone they even had shops selling shirts with a graphic of a man being lifted by mosquitoes that said get carried away in west yellowstone i thought we had enough of them in the south was really surprised by that i once laid out naked and allowed them to feed on me and after that ive rarely had them fuck with me ever again
  leave food in a tree in the woods    itt people who dont actually go outside thats called baiting
  i once laid out naked and allowed them to feed on me    you really shouldnt do that the chemicals that make up their saliva can trigger an allergic reaction even if youve never been allergic to anything before plus diseases are not fun
    i suppose next youll be trying to say the plants arent actually craving gatorade
        enjoy your hanging groin from onchocerciasis
  if only there were a way to seal food so that when hung from a tree branch in a sack it wouldnt be eaten
  faggot
  idiot they crave brawndo cuz its got electrolytes
  this is why god invented the equator anon
  tfw florida  suck my dick northernfags
  ok you win stay in florida we wont come there just stay in florida its cold up here flordiamen wouldnt like it
  this
to be comfortable in the winter requires good gear you need to have a sleeping bag that goes down to 0 and doesnt get cold and packs into the size of a football something like the western mountaineering kodiak which ive had for 8 years you need a good tent like a msr fury ive been running for 6 years you need down or highquality synthetic layers top and bottom you need fleece layers like patagonia r1 you need a high quality warm pair of winter gloves you can do work in that dont get wet in snow you need a good lantern that runs on white gas so you can have light when its dark 14 hours a day you need a good white gas stove so you can cook and dont have to dick around with isobutane canisters when its 10 degrees out you need to bring along high quality nutritous food to carry all this shit you need a backpack that can handle a big load and not be uncomfortable     all that shit costs money the reward is you get to see amazing shit in the woods i do a shitload of backpack predator hunting here in iowa on public land in january and february with my compound bow or ar15 its fun you have the place to yourself but you have to actually get off the couch and do it
  indeed the dude obviously a dandy hipster faggot is glaring because the actual man has made a statement of actual man shit and the two wenches are now salivating for him rather than the dandy hipster san franciscan faggot
    sounds like if youre not into killing random animals a lot of the more interesting winterspecific activities are off the table kind of unfortunate cause it does sound fun from a larping perspective
  the absolute cope of gearfags
  killing random animals  say hunting faggot
  anything less than 100 clean combustion will eventually kill you
  wouldnt want to exclude the trappers and fisherman like that
been feeling really down lately finally got up and went /out/ had a really great hike today took some pictures feels good man  post some feel good out stories
post pictures
heres one im not a very good photographer
i really likes the leaves changing color although i almost twisted my ankle so many times from rocks in the leaves
  nice thread anon glad youre feeling up
  that looks like the appalachians im going to guessvirginia
i backpacked  fished for about a week in sw colorado back in early sep     hadnt done that in about 8 years it was damn nice    back in the real world i feel like killing myself again but at least i can have something to look forward to once it warms up again
  im proud of you anon the photographs were almost as beautiful as your optimism 
  finally landed a job that has the schedule and pay needed to ski a lot this winter best part is its a small company with a kind owner so we can almost always take time off on short notice when a big storm comes through  skiing is my favorite /out/ hobby but it can be expensive and logistically difficult so this is a big deal to me no more dealing with weekend crowds angry bosses or cheap equipment is a great feeling
  does indeed look rather appalachian my homeland this is an awesome photo of an awesome spot in my book stone steps have a mythic feel
  super close guess anon pilot mountain is the name its very close to the appalachians
fascinatinga little near to the appas microrange    
  few days ago i met up with a friend we were going to go for a coffee but kinda decided maybe better if we go up on a mountain instead since the city is kinda polluted to hell in this time of year ended up being quite refreshing had some very nice views had a quite a good time in general snaped this pic that i like city is down in that fog
love snowy woods so much
were all going to make it bros
nice thread i was feeling similarly the other day and took a weekend off went camping on the coast fed myself with abalone i dived for off the rocks and read a book in a tent by candle light things arent so bad guys
  were all gonna make it br  gets eaten by a bear
started going on multiple day hikes with my girlfriend over the summer had our last one of the season last month it definitely brought us closer together and it had an overall positive effect on my mood its going to be a long winter but were gonna try to get out cross country skiing at least a few times feels good man
  stop anon youre making me want to quit everything and live in the wild now
  neat wheres that
grad school and general loneliness has had me suicidal and my only respite is the outdoors ive been trying to finish section hiking the at in pennsylvania since im near the middle of that pretty good location since i can pick between the easier section down south and the rocky northern section based on my mood really underrated state to go through with comfy farm views but i can see why thruhikers dread the northern section
  really sick and at home today boss wasnt happy when he heard i love mist and rain no such luck today
  if youre close to pilot mountain you should go check out hanging rock if you wanna get into fishing stone mountain has some excellent trout fishing and decent hiking
  wholesome
  what place is dis
  where is this i love this kind of environment especially with the mist
  been to hanging rock a couple of times great campground and some nice views  stone mountain is one ive been meaning to check out for awhile havent had the time with school
    cockle creek tasmania

  i just took the picture and kept riding i didnt go hunting this year no one to go with
  dangling horseshit off your rifle to exercise  throws off the balance of your rifle  you will now mount the gun high every time  you are now the worst wing shooter in ypur hunting party  ishiggydiggy learn proper shooting form avid marksman went on my first actual hunt this year took this buck 2 hours into our first day father in law was my guide
  up and atem anon  was able to fill my freezer within an hour in the stand yesterday
any of youse got suggestions on a good boar spear i heard cold steel makes good ones but they dont seem to be made anymore
  are you dogging them or tossing from a stand
    dogging i have good throwing spears for smaller stuff but id rather not throw when it comes to boar
how do i get into hunting i dont know any hunters or outdoorsmen usually i hear start with squirrels or rabbits but im not sure what id even do if i got one maybe theyre small things but i dont want to waste an animal for no reason    ive taken a hunters and gun safety course im familiar with guns and bows but thats where my knowledge ends
  dont be afraid to just go into the national forest and shoot a rabbit or squirrel if you get worried about doing anything just look up a quick youtube video i suggest carrying a cupple zip lock bags with you also dont hunt rabbits or any small game in the summer some nasty stuff comes out on those animals like dorment muscle worms ticks fleas and other shit just stick with hunting em in the winter
  i do not have one but have seen these at gun shows and they seem to be good quality    wwamazoncom/coldsteel4000346europeanspear/dp/b00hzik36gsubscriptionidakiailshyytfivpwuy6qtagduckduckgod20linkcodexm2camp2025creative165953creativeasinb00hzik36g
when brainlet coworkers say hunting with a rifle scope isnt even hard  hheh totally guys btw ive never been successful hunting like that or even in general _
got access to couple thousand acres of private land in utah bagged a doe first day still have a cow elk tag just gotta wait till it snows in there
  southern zone ny reporting in   side effects from flu vaccine is shutting my muscles down
whats a good knife for field dressing deer any suggestions
how do i into hunting anons i dont have any friends or family to teach me but i do have a rifle
  what do i do with the carcass
   you eat it thats what hunting is for you pull off the skin and guts season it cook it and eat it     what you think we just shoot the fuckers for fun
  literally any drop point folding knife that will hold a razors edge  ive always used a 4 buck its what my dad used and what i learned to skin a deer with
  forgot pic
  not sure how to do that properly nigger
  youtube you retard
  spoon feed me more daddy
  i use a mora to skin gut debone and processing
  im new to /out/ whats up with the mora meme
  its cheap admittedly its better than pretty much any other knife in its price range but there are still much better knives out there that just cost more
anyone here bow hunt looking at getting into it
  thanks been seeing a lot of mentions of it here ive always preferred fixed blade for work since i tend to lose pocket knives so ive been just buying 30 gerbers from walmart the past few years im pretty rough on them so they dont last too long think ill get a mora companion next
  used to bow hunt a good bit and my whole crew are avid bowhunters what you wanna know
  son just skin the animal gut it and cook it  youll never be a dad with this attitude
  having children
  humanity thanks you
  youre not my kid this is the fucking internet literally the biggest fucking collection of knowledge in world history and you ask some shmuck on an indonesian basketweaving board to give you a playbyplay of skinning a rodent
  well first off ive never hunted in my life and not too many of friends do it either so im pretty ignorant of the topic i mostly go fishing if im doing anything /out/     i cant really decide which bow to go with mostly im thinking crossbow but i think id enjoy either a longbow or compound bow as well whichever one i choose is there a recommendation for a sort of intro bow to go with for any of them ie what should i look for in a bow     other than that any tips would be greatly appreciated
  hunting gen  wtf why are you asking for information  generals should be banned 4channelers cannot be trusted
      ya gonna stop being a whiny cunt now
  never hunted in my life  i would highly recommend starting with a rifle as bowhunting is much much more time consuming since you have to be proficient with a bow and that takes a lot of practice and because you have to get much closer to the deer 1030 yards ideally    which bow to go with  if youre into crossbows thats a good start but it doesnt translate well into an actual bow longbow or recurve are typically sightless and shoot by feel which means even more practice before efficient id recommend a compound for sure to start my first was a fred bear g2 affordable and very good bow     tips  start by finding out your draw length then get a bow to fit it look for a bow that can be lowered to about 30lbs for starting since shooting a bow uses very different muscles than you are used to using and they will undoubtedly be weak at first then look into anchor points learn how to accurately judge distance and start practicing only other thing i can think of is do not jack your bow up to 70 lbs like most people anything over 55 and all your doing is buying your arrow deeper in the ground
  btw on draw length anchor points and setting sights jewtube has great info and these 3 things are probably the most essential aspects of archery along with judging distance    archerytalkcom is an invaluable resource and a great place to find good used bows too
  i been skinning treerats wrong all these years  thanks anon
  yeah i was being a real b a nigga there gonna make some rabbit stew after a big cold snap
    appreciate it anon ill look into starting off with rifle hunting first and will check out archerytalk too
  happy hunting
  tfw too sick to go innawoods
anyone have any experience hunting on public land ive never really been hunting because i never knew anyone with any land but i just started working for a county that has a lot of game land i have a 22 for squirrels/rabbits a shotgun for birds and deer  my concern is that i hate sitting still i feel much better walking around and id like to stalk a deer but im worried ill walk through someone elses spot and piss them off or someone will hear brush moving and put a slug in my chest without looking for the orange
what do you guys do with everything else but the meat of the animals you hunt do you tan the hides  make anything from the bones and antlers going to get the hunting licence next year and i dont want to be wasteful
what books are good to read for someone whos never hunted before but wants to get into it i dont know anybody who hunts so this would be my only way of getting information im reading steve rinellas book right now specifically looking for books on white tail deer hunting
  youtube and taking your states hunting course
  being able to sit still is an essential skill stalking deer is pretty difficult as moving quietly is a challenge often youll be walking and kick one and shoot it running or will see it off in the distance and have to fire a long shot as far as walking into someones spot it really depends on the person some people are autists that will get pissed other guys like myself are usually happy to see someone stumble through more often than not your stumbling through the woods will kick deer to us and if nothing else its nice having someone to talk to as far as accidents are concerned the orange is pretty damn visible and every hunter knows enough to confirm their target before shooting firing blindly at moving rustling brush is a good way to waste ammo
  got third biggest on our property 7 point not very wide tho
  could only hit the last weekend of deer season in mn they were completely noctournal in my usual hunting grounds and without time to scout i didnt see a single one  got to see some turkeys up close for awhile though and found a little grouse buddy who likes peanuts
can anyone recommend me a decent beginners pellet rifle ive done quite a bit of research but the sheer amount of choices is a bit overwhelming    as far as features im looking for i pretty much just want something i can shoot rabbits squirrels and maybe starlings with probably a 22 and either spring or air powered    is there anything out there at a decent price i can get as my first pellet gun
i havent been able to go rifle hunting yet due to classes piling it on before finals i did shoot one opening day of muzzleloader though
finally got one of the hogs to stay in the open long enough that i could feed her a 64 grain sleeping pill
what are your strategies for staying warm it was in the mid to upper 20s here and i froze my ass off and had to bail i was wearing 7 fucking layers i dont think more layers would help i had on thermal long johns thick wool socks and insulated pants and boots for tops i had the long johns plus a 100 gram fleece tucked into my bibs then a button up shirt then a hoodie then a field jacket with the liner in only lasted about 3 hrs
  forgot to include my beanie and hood of the hoodie for my head
happy thanksgiving from east texas i saw a young fork horn buck 4 does a coyote and a bald eagle this morning
  insulated boots  i mean actually insulated with thinsulate ive got 800g 1200g and 1500g laceups and 1000g and 1600g rubber pullons the 800g are plenty until it gets down to around 0f even standhunting but some of the shit i do involves standing in water or being out in 30f  grid fleece base layer  one of the few things the army got right and surplus can be had for 35 a set  high pile fleece overshirt  clearance rack at cabelas some weird camo pattern  primaloft puffy  its actually the liner out of my duck hunting coat super breathable super warm but about as wind resistant as cheesecloth    then depending on whether its windy or rainy either the duck hunting shell which is goretex and has a good storm hood or an under armour fleece lined hooded jacket    hat  either a fleece beanie or a wool knit jeep cap depending on how important a brim is to what im doing  gloves  some hot shots waterproof hunting gloves 60g thinsulate or some burton ski gloves 100g thinsulate depending on whether im around water  handwarmer muff  drake neoprenefleece handwarmer has a kangaroo pocket sleeves for chemical handwarmers and shotgun shell loops     i have managed to stay warm enough while trundling around on snowmobiles with 150f windchill/50f ambient and standhunting down to 30 with no cover
  ive messed around with tanning the hides of deer pigs and raccoons before its a pain in the ass to do it all yourself and i doubt ill do that again ill usually boil the head down to get all the hide  meat off of it and then put it into a strong hydrogen peroxide solution 40 volume cream peroxide developer get a gallon jug of it at a hair salon supply store pic related to bleach the skull and make a european mount out of it as for the bones hide and guts i haul them off down in the field somewhere and dump it scavengers will have it all picked clean / drug off within 23 days
  ive been using a buck folding alpha hunter for like 6 years now to skin deer and wild pigs i like the blade shape and how it feels in my hand theyre like 60 on amazon
  bald eagle  99 sure that you saw a caracara
  nope it flew up into the top of a tree and i watched it through my binoculars for 30 minutes 100 sure it was a bald eagle the land im hunting on is right between 2 large lakes that have multiple nesting pairs of eagles
    also we rarely get caracaras in my area im pretty far north in east texas like 45 minutes to oklahoma arkansas and louisana
well ive got about 5 pounds of venison going in the dehydrator pic related right after i added the meat to the marinade should have some good deer jerky in another 810 hours
  marinade looks good but some of that stuffs cut awful thick    if youre having a hard time slicing it throw it in the freezer until its almostfrozen makes getting even thin slices 1000 easier
  yeah some of it got on the thick side most of it is between 1/4 and 1/8 thick though so itll be alright i have a commercialstyle dehydrator and itll eventually dehydrate even the thick parts pretty good might take 1416 hours or so though    i was in a hurry and cut the jerky up right after i cut the meat off the bone so it was completely thawed i agree that it works much better if the meat is still partially frozen
  here it is after 3 hours in the dehydrator
  sat 4 days in central forest unit wisconsin saw fuckall came back a day early for the holiday and doubt ill go back likely ill take the ol pumpkin lobber in the southern kettle morraine the next 3 days and hope to see anything
well i got a doe this afternoon she came out about 100 yards north of me and had a yearling with her here in my county of east texas during rifle season you can only kill doe from thanksgiving day through the following sunday without a doe permit issued to the property so im glad that i got her today and dont have to stress about it for the rest of the week i made a good shot exit wound is in the picture and she ran about 3040 yards and dropped just inside the woods
  here she is hanging up on the gambrel in the barn this side shows the entrance wound right behind the elbow missing all the areas with usable meat
  exit wound side i didnt realize that she was at that much of an angle when i pulled the trigger unfortunately the bullet got into the small intestines a bit on its way out
  cross section shot showing both the entrance and exit wounds she had a ton of fat on her more than any other deer ive killed around here my skinning knife has a bunch of fat still smeared all over the blade im gonna have to soak it in hot water and dish soap to get that shit off of it
the jerky is coming along nicely too still needs a few hours though guess ill sip on some whisky and shitpost until its time to bag it up
        not bad shot placement definitely could have been better but a quick kill is still a quick kill
  i dont really know what to tell you anon i grew up with a dad and a best friend whose dad hunted all the time your best bet might be to go to your local shooting ranges and ask around there for people who hunt and like teaching newbies how to do it maybe join some local hunting clubs my local national wild turkey federation and delta waterfowl chapters are pretty active and have banquets a couple of times a year where they rent out the civic center and there are hundreds of hunters in attendance where you can talk to the people at your table from my perspective it seems like hunting is one of those things thats really hard to break into as an outsider
  what can you do with killed deer or other game if you dont intend to eat it for yourself anyway pretty sure its illegal to sell or distribute in my state
  yeah like i said the entry point was perfect  right through the heart and behind the front leg i didnt realize she was quartering towards me so much though she was moving and i took the shot thinking she was more broadside than she was oh well that just made the skinning and quartering job a bit stinkier than it had to be      you have to give it away my best friend is on a lease out in west texas with a bunch of trophy hunters who dont give a fuck about the meat from their animals they only want the antlers he brought me 5 deer last year that those guys just gave him i happily processed them all and filled my freezers with almost 200 lbs of venison
  a few states have hunters for the hungry programs that work with processors and take wild game meat to redistribute to needy families
whats the best way to tell a living deers age i think weve got some young 8pointers but i want to let them grow a little
  
  thanks    ultimately i think ill stick to doe this year ive been hunting on my land for 5 days and so far ive seen maybe around 9 does to every buck
  ive seen maybe around 9 does to every buck  lucky bucks they are getting more doe ass than /k/
  the older bucks who have made it to their prime dont usually run out into the open until they hit the rut and even then they really dont like coming out into the open and prefer to stay in the woods watching / stalking the doe the younger bucks are stupid and have never been shot at so they dont fear the open spaces
is predator hunting ethical i dont want to eat coyotes but i do like the pelts but ive always been taught to eat what i kill whats everyones consensus
  i shoot yotes for fun and to keep them from fucking up the cows
gonna take the sister to do sporting clays tomorrow hope she catches the bug so i got someone to bring with me when i start hunting
  anyone hunt elk here
  yes
own private land  see dozens of does every day for the past week  only a few spike bucks  invite friend over  he kills a ninepoint at 7am
  thats some amatuer shitjust boil the skull antlers out with a little dishwashing liquid as a surfactant for an afternoon h2o2 does fuck all good you dont want the skull too white anyway looks gay
  at least the anon was honest enough to tell you to look it up instead of giving you any specific advice that would surely be wrong
what is a good lever action rifle is merlin ok
  get a pre 1964 winchester model 94   
  first off your primary enemy is sweat not the cold when you sweat your perspiration will collect then cool then freeze and then youre worse off than you were at the start layer just enough that youre not really cold but not so much that youre sweating so the more active youre going to be the less you should wear wear things like wool that wick and breathe to get wetness away from your body also get a stocking capthey fucking work   second unless youre working in a fucking warehouse leave any steel toed boots at home all theyll do is freeze your toes solid youll start being cold within 10 minutes regular hunting boots or boots with breathable toe areas are much better for cold tolerance     third invest in warmer packs put some in the toes of your boots in your gloves on the back of your hands and get some of the huge body packs for your core if your core is warm your body wont pull blood circulation away from your hands and feet and youll stay warmer longer
  ethical where coyotes are nonnative aka anywhere east of the mississippi youre doing the whole ecosystem a huge favor by murdering the hell out of them
  god tier winchester 94  high tier henry 3030  mid tier marlin 336  low tier mossberg 464  buy used if you can youll save a lot of money over new and your gun is most likely to be in that happy zone of broken in but not shot out
nonhunter here ive always wondered does hunting save you money does the money you save from the meat you get outweigh the price of all the gear you have to buy
  early on no but with multiple successful hunts you can save money if you do all the work yourself
  does the money you save from the meat you get outweigh the price of all the gear you have to buy    in general no you break even on groceries after a few successful seaaons the gear isnt really the biggest factor in the startup price either its the licenses youll have to buy and the gas to get where youre going the repeating costs stack up fast
  buying ammo  not reloading  get out npc
      while white people the most altrusitic group of people who invented space exploration and the ones who care more for the environment are dying out third world mcdonald wrappers in state park brown savages and souless whale/bear hunting dog skinning asians are spreading at an uncontrollable rate    do not abandon your burden white man youre doing the world a disservice by not procreating and introducing educated children into the mix
    alpenflage    god tier taste anon whats that hat my tism is attracted to it
    break action 177s or 22s    i use the gamo whisper silent cat for most of my hunting ive never had a problem with gamo theyre a good brand
  depends on how and what you hunt some methods are very economical others arent   tfw i can fill a huge chest freezer with snowgeese for a 5 permit 20 in ammo 10 in gas and a dozen odd hours of sweat equity  the same quantity of venison would run me 80 in permits 10 in ammo 100 in gas and hundreds of hours of sweat equity
  dogs are genetically dumb though its extremely relevant in the way it trains aka education just like humansif other races educated children with the exact same education they would be very similar anyway
    dogs are dumb compared to humans but the comparison here is between dogs themselves some dogs are much smarter than others some are much more prone to violence and much dumber some border in between and if we move the comparison between humans the same applies if you want to risk yourself or your family trying to prove were equal then do it by moving to these savages countries but dont bring them here under the impression of minor insignificant differences take risks in a way in which only you might suffer due to emotional led miscalculations do not put us at risk    even if for the sake of the argument what youre saying is true youd still be educating these ungrateful and jealous hateful races with the white mans knowledge and discoveries that they were incapable of attaining themselves    lastly people have thought like you for hundreds of years please tell me how are all the third world countries looking despite insane efforts to educate train feed clothe and support them i used to be one of those imbeciles trying to play babysitter going to foreign countries to administer aid but look at our own cities and nations overrun with the very own filth we worked so hard to protect    our altruism has spelled our demise
  what cap is that youve got style anon
  tfw used to hunt with sb loads in a surplus mauser    i can relate to you anon    switched over to a savage 99a though and 300 savage works just as well    good year this year
tfw living in denmark  hunting on public land is not a thing  paying to hunt a deer costs more money than my rifle  dont have my own land to hunt on or know anyone who has    wat do /out/ i dream and dream of the day i get to go deer hunting
  as a texan that can go literally whenever i want dont dream too big    hunting is boring cold and not super fun until you actually see and shoot something
i found a primitive camping spot that allows hunting bird and squirrel and other things if/when in season but i really dont think i have a bird/squirrel gun what should i look for i set upon a shotgun so should i just look for any shotgun in a 20 or 410 gauge does it matter o/u sxs or pump
  a used pump or a break action single will be your cheapest options 410 shells can be hard to find or expensive but i love using it for squirrel both 12 and 20 gauge are fine and as a bonus you can use them on deer if you ever get the urge
  as an avid outdoorsman i dont consider the hunting experience fun only when i see or shoot something   i enjoy every second of being outside because its the only time i really have to myself and my thoughts   so hunting is never cold or boring to me
  whats a good way to learn how to strip and clean game ive always wanted to get into hunting but i dont have anyone to teach me in person
  search this page for the word youtube
how do i cook wild duck so that it doesnt taste awful so far ive tried duck nuggets and they were awful
  step 1 dont try to eat any ducks that primarily eat things you wouldnt ie divers shovelers  step 2 get every single last scrap of fat off it dont bother trying to pluck and roast wild duck breast them out the fat is radically different than commercial duck moreso in divers but even mallards thatve been feeding in grain fields arent very close to commercial duck  step 3 either stew it a long time goose and duck make excellent beef substitutes in crock pot stroganoff or dont cook it beyond medium rare duck and goose cooked well but not so long it falls apart gets very chewy    i like to sautee/panfry strips of duck breast either with wild morels in butter or rolled in breadcrumbs and the cheap powdery parmesan cheese from a canister quick easy delicious cut thin enough i almost never miss a pellet    goose makes good jerky too basically take equal parts worcestershire sauce hoisin sauce and teriyaki mix them together as a marinade let sit in the marinade in fridge for 48hrs and dehydrate/smoke as you would any other red meat
im a man now boys first ever hunting trip successful after 100 hours of airgun preparation autism odd thing is the squirrel is an absolute fucking unit with nicki minaj ass ive never seen a squirrel this big in person must have been getting ready for winter my redneck neighbor who let me use his woods said to cook in croc pot and then grill with bbq sauce so i guess i will be trying that
how do you hunt i find blind and tree stand hunting boring af    id like to romp around but theres a ton of leaves everyewhere
  this anon again is this worth checking out if i know ill go plinking/squirrel hunting i feel like i should hold out for a 22 magnum or something to give myself flexibility in taking slightly bigger critters i dont want to shoot a raccoon or rabbit unless im 200 sure the round does the job but idk dunno bout hunting so im here getting some learning done
  get yourself a good ol mossberg 500 in 20 gauge a shotgun is easily the most versatile weapon you can own drop anything from squirrels to bear by just changing the shell
  found this scrape and a bunch of other deer sign on saturday lost the trail in a really thick grove of brush though havent seen anything new since im sure hell be back since he did a lot of tree scraping and turf kicking but since its public land for all i know someone else could have gotten him already
  youre right and you know i forgot about it until you mentioned it but xcaliber makes those drop ins i could find a good o/u 12 or 20ga get the applicable drop in and have whatever i want there are drop ins for 12ga to 4570 iirc let alone drop ins for 12ga to 20ga or 12ga to 22lr 223 17hmr etc o/u arent super packable though but oh well    theres an added bonus of taking to my rod and gun club and not scaring boomers too
  the thing about o/u guns is you absolutely cannot cheap out on them dont make the same mistake i did youre better off getting a gun to specialize in what you hunt i say someone who hunts a wide variety of game in na should have three guns a rimfire rifle for small game a shotgun for birds and a rifle for large game in a versatile caliber like 308 270 win etc a magnum rifle as well if they also hunt dangerous game of those three the shotgun is the best thing to get first dropins are a meme honestly specialize
  find the right kind of animal to hunt then pheasants are good for walking     i like hunting big game by hiking to vantage points and glassing a broad area for 30 min or so at a time im like you i dont like spending all day in the blind
  whatre the best gloves/finger mittens to keep your hands warm when sitting in a blind doing nothing
  a handwarmer muff
  take hunters ed watch youtube videos google any questions you have and just go thats what i did i refuse to let my mayward fatherless upbringing keep me from doing cool shit if you have specific questions post them here
  actually a solid idea im planning on harvesting some coyotes soon definitely gonna make one from a pelt
  congrats man nothing like your first successful hunt for me it was one of my most satisfying moments
good youtube resources for skinning squirrels and coon and rabbit and such i wanna get as much knowledge possible before i go out proper /nodad/  /noscouts/ here gotta teach myself
  ive got a neoprene and fleece one intended for duck hunting its extremely useful has a rainproof kangaroo pocket and a row of shotshell loops ive used a handful of different ones over the years and its been by far the best    downside is being neoprene its heavy and bulky
  how far should i expect to shoot in very thick underbrush filled woods and extremely hilly terrain asking because when people say 100 yards i dont know if i could even find a spot on my property thats 100 yards of brushless ground
  the longest shot i get in east tn is often 80 yards the very first deer i killed was at 287 yards but the closest was 9 feet the last 3 were between 30 and 50 so average is around 50
  no one to go with  fucking normie
  here in the river bottoms of missouri my average shot is around 40 yards the longest shot ive ever taken was 95 yards and the absolute longest possible shot on the property i hunt is a powerline cut thats 150 yards long but youd be shooting uphill which isnt safe and ive never seen a deer in it anyway
    i mean thank goodness for that because i can shoot 50 yards but not 100 still confusing why people say 100 yards is the minimum for hunting though
  out west probably or at least theyre flatlanders corn and onions fields prairies etc
  so 4channel now changes soy to onions aight
  its been like that for a bit tbqh
bowhunting whitetail during firearm season this weekend am i fucked
  nah just wear your orange and youll be set good luck anon
  yeah but will the rifles spook all the deer to the point where ill never get within 50 yds
  not likely the shooting and blasting might run some to you play the wind and youre gucci
  i used to have one and loved it it was very beat up but was a straight shooter and it was a rifle i wasnt afraid to beat up i gave it to my father because he mentioned that he used to have a rifle like that as a kid he shot it once gave it to me to clean and store one day i came home and he had pawned it for some trivial bullshit thing i was both pissed and disappointed
  thanks i appreciate the recommendation ill look into it i was looking at a few gamos but i wasnt sure were to start
  fox squirrels get huge my nigger you were probably thinking of your typical gray squirrel
  truthfully you need to be able to sit still for game like deer unless it rained the previous day so the leaves are soft enough to stalk hunt also when its really windy you can sneak on them in bill bottoms and draws but its gotta be really howling to mask your steps if you got lots of leaves on the ground
  i have a fold up chair that sits really low like a few inches off the ground i strap this to my pack and hunt from spot to spot for deer you still have to sit in a spit for an hour or two but its def more mobile than blind or stand hunting ive had good luck with it but you need hilly terrain to give you some vantage points i dont see this method working in mostly flat land or thick woods
  lmao i know this exact ad its an older model without the accutrigger and i think the dude wants way too much for it pretty much any 22 will work for squirrel and i killed a coon sized ground hog this year with 2 shots if 22lr from like 30 yds using hollow pointed cci standard you might be fine with 22lr for coon sized animals if you just shoot them in the head which wont be hard
  did you pee in it theyll usually investigate if you do id still hunt it even if someone else got him if there is a lot of sign another might take over his scrape line
  i hunt land like you describe hilly and forested all my shots in the past 4 yrs have been inside 50yds
  so much thisyou hear a lot of shooting on opening day but after that i notice its fairly quiet
  ive got an older marlin 1895 in 4570 with the microgroove barrel it shoots pretty good with the 325gr hornady ftx bullets that i use to reload for it i bought it used from a local pawn shop for like 350 and it had hardly been shot the action was a little rough at first but i took it all apart and spent a couple hours smoothing everything up with emery cloth and its been through maybe 250 rounds since then with zero issues
  i made some duck and dumplings at duck camp a couple weeks ago and everyone loved it
  pee in it  interesting idea makes sense but ive always kinda thought against pissing where i hunt i dont wanna make too much stink
  there isnt a lot of the us where a 100 yard shot would be extremely rare id only have to go about 5 miles before the average shot would be in the 90120yd range and the furthest possible would exceed 1000 yards because of croplands and empty fields     with most firearms a 100 yard zero will work for everything from 150yds and in without having to really worry about holdover/holdunder and most public ranges go to around 100 yards max anyway so its a good general standard to go by
  try filling your freezer full of ducks or bear i spent 1500 on bear hunting this year including permits bait gas ammunition i spent another 150 on processing and another 200 deposit for the shoulder mount i have 3 rugs already and waterfowl hunting not snow geese is even pricier
  yeah a 100 yard zero is pretty good for most rifles ive found that for my 308 with my particular load that a 200 yard zero is a better option though that way everything from 0200 yards will have the bullet impact within 2 from the point of aim whereas if i had used a 100 yard zero then by 200 yards the bullet would be impacting a little more than 35 below my point of aim    of course if youre only gonna have 100 yard and under shots where youre hunting then theres no reason to zero your rifle in at a longer distance than that
  compare that to a 100 yard zero with a 200 yard zero even a 250 yard shot would have minimal holdover under 4 whereas with the 100 yard zero id have to hold over almost 8 at 250 yards    im shooting a 165gr bullet at about 2650fps muzzle velocity a gun shooting a faster bullet like a 243 or 270 would of course be shooting a lot flatter out to 400 yards
  my girlfriends dad is a big duck hunter and he took me hunting with him and some of his friends this year ive hunted all my life but ive never hunted ducks or even bought the federal duck stamp until this year that bullshit is crazy 3 of the guys had professionally trained duck dogs training costs a minimum of 2k per dog hundreds of decoys with a lot of electronic mojo and other brands multiple blinds built and set up chest waders i bought some cheaper ones from academy for 180 out of state licenses and permits were from tx their duck camp is in arkansas were like 150 for me and id already bought the federal duck stamp along with my tx license beforehand or it wouldve been even more expensive between the 6 of us we got a grand total of 13 ducks over 2 days of opening weekend it was fun and all but i just dont see what the big deal is and i damn sure couldnt justify spending that much money on a dog and decoys its a lot cheaper and easier to put up a corn feeder and till in a couple acres of food plots to kill a couple of deer and all the feral hogs i want
  waterfowl hunting is even pricier  again depends on how and where you hunt  1020 in gas depending on how far i go per day  maybe 10 in ammunition on a good day usually around 250 a year i shoot around 2 flats of fiocchi  60 total in licensing and permitting fed and state duck stamps state license for the year  im using the same waders ive had since i was 15 i shoot a 600 shotgun i traded for used all of my clothing besides my wader jacket is either normal daywear or milsurp bdu pants ecwcs grid fleece all told including my multitude of hats and gloves ive got maybe 600 tied up in hunting clothes and it lasts years to decades the total cost of all my decoys is maybe 200 i find and refurb a lot and pick up clearance/used decoys and ive got around 8 dozen across all species    i hunt public land thats wade in only its hard work and i usually dont do great but its cheap and something i dont need to plan weeks/months in advance    taxidermy can be expensive but ive been duck hunting somewhere around 30 years and ive only put 7 birds on the wall  pic related from the 25th literally just hugged a tree while standing in waist deep water  if it werent for hoodies it wouldve been a slow day theyre neat to watch though
has anyone here successfully meleed a deer its not legal to shoot projectiles anywhere remotely close to where i live but deer are everywhere theyre not afraid of humans unless you get within a few feet so all the stories in this thread of how much trouble people have to go through to find one and how far away they need to hide are pretty alien to me    there is no prohibition here about killing deer/other animals as long as theyre in season its just that the area with is populated in a wide radius so guns/bows are out im thinking some kind of long polearm like a glaive or poleaxe is the way to go spears are banned for use against deer for some reason but theres no word on any other kind of weapon advice
  out of curiosity do you live in florida
  ny
going out for my first time tomorrow after work finally got my rifle sighted in wish me luck senpai
  i disagree with the general faggotry that has followed this as such here is my recommendation for you as the others have said find a way to kill something small squirrel or rabbit is fine take your time wait for a headshot or front shoulder shot do what you can to try and get a clean kill once dead just start with hacking a back leg off said animal try to keep it clean and treat it like any other piece of food free of fur no grass/dirt/leaves on it remove fur put your favorite spices on it roast it slowly near a fire try not to char it bring your favorite beverage to drink with your meal enjoy it relish in being a predator respect your kill contemplate what was hard and research it further so next time youll do better youll be smoking over bull elk in no time      the above may also apply to you
  looks nz as fuck
  good eye you are quite correct sir
  love my benchmade steep country
  hey jerry how should i photograph this knife so it looks bad ass  well tim you should go with a rustic or hunting vibe  that sounds awsome hand me that rusty flat stock and that tin of airgun pellets
what to hunt in or around nv any good spots prefer varmints for now ive shot a few big jackrabbits but id like something consistent for free meat
is it possible to pick a random spot on public land and get a deer or do you need to know the hot spots
  yes its possible but you will not likely gets deer vs having previously scouted and pick a spot based on sign or actual sightings that being said going in cold sometimes works so i wouldnt pass up the opportunity if its the only move you can make this year for muzzle loader season i went to a completely brand new spot cold and shot a doe although as i said it was more luck than strategy
  thats a big deer where you are from  sad looks like baby deer
  red dirt  fallow field  ripped jeans uninsulated jacket in a meme camo and poorly fitting combat boots  70lb buck with 2 tines  im going to go out on a limb and say central nc or northcentral sc
  going off the vegetation i say texas maybe north of sa
  70lb buck with 2 tines  if so then something is wrong with their deer san an region bucks are smallbodied but even 15yo deer tend to have bigger racks than that that would definitely have qualified as a cull buck when i was in the area
  i had one go to the feeder a few times this year that was a 6 point with at best a 12 spread and 23 tines i let him be as i was almost positive he was the spike that was traveling with his mother last year hogs are bad this year and are cleaning out a lot of the food our bucks need for those sick gains we focused more on killing hogs then harvesting deer this year that and yotes
  i recall mcqbushcraft skinning a squirrel in a video in his earlier days
  i really want to propose laws to ban niggers asians and spics from going outdoors  they just ruin everything  you have to bribe them to maintain nice wilderness in their home environments    hmong are definitely the worst all over  but spics are getting there and they just turn any place into a fucking inner city public park at night i dont even like europeans in national parks but at least they are human and respectful and decent    really the only people that should be allowed in the outdoors should be nz aus usa can and scandinavians
  has that fag gone pc and stop making hunting videos  all his new content is just bullshit orv and camping
  not all blacks are niggers and not all niggers are black after gun season closes all the parking lots which are normally clean is full of trash like cans mcdonalds wrappers cigarette boxes and shit in the last several years of hunting i have run into a single black person exactly two spics and two asians and this is over like a 5 yr span so youre right some niggers are shitting up the woods and they look a lot like you
how good of a round is 762x39 for medium to big game     i got an sks but i plan on getting an ak next year for wild boar shenanigans     if i dont get an ak ill just end up using my 300memeout pistol build but still
  youre the gay redditor of the thread
  762x39 is okay for medium sized game up to say white tailed deer out to about 150 yards or so ive killed several wild hogs and deer with an sks and ruger mini30    the problem is that a lot of guns chambered for 762x39 are going to be 23 moa guns and a lot of the ammo available is cheap inconsistent steelcased plinking ammo manufactured in former soviet union countries and isnt going to have the best performance when it comes to hunting if youre gonna hunt with it then get some decent ammo like hornadys 762x39 loaded with their sst polymer ballistic tipped bullets
  neither did i so i taught myself by reading a lot on subject/watching videos its no substitute for innawoods experience but itll at least show you the ropes before you go hunting first and foremost git gud at shooting if you arent already i know that seems like a no shit sherlock thing but i know people with rifles who cant shoot the dick off a naked pedophile at a playground from 50 yards     also depending where you live you should consider getting a bow or crossbow where i live most of the public hunting land is archery only if you go the compound/recurve bow route get a lesson or two from an instructor so you start out on the right foot and dont develop any bad habits
  not only do you need to be good with your rifle but you also need to sight it in before every hunting season the amount of bad shots that ive seen / heard about people making with a rifle that they havent shot in 3 years is just depressing they shoot the deer in the guts the ass or blow a front leg off and then the next time they shoot it at a target they discover that its not even hitting the paper i know people who have had the same box of 20 shells for their deer rifle for almost 10 years
  look for hunting in germany
  nv has godtier mule deer and elk hunting might be hard to draw a tag though
  hard to beat a havilon they are so light and with replaceable blades they just cut through animals like butter
  i been using one for about 4 yrs now shit is goat and the replacement blades are dirt cheap
  also suggest getting a muzzleloader you can get then shipped to your door modern inlines are simple and safe i hunt in some shotgun only areas and i much prefer my ml over a shotty better accuracy and less meat damage also you get to hunt with a gun much earlier than modern firearms fewer hunters too and the deer haven been pressured like it is during modern firearms you might even be lucky enough to avoid the fucking zoo that is opening day of gun season
  one day im not skilled enough for that yet im thinking jackrabbits are good practice and ive spotted a few coyote
  so is stalking not as popular anymore ive also been told by some family that calling on public land is dangerous because you run the risk of another hunter walking up on you and blasting you  but most of my family is fudd so i take it with a grain of salt
guys how dangerous is it to go camping in a place that allows hunting should i wear an orange vest
  well the risk is not zero but in my experience its nothing to worry about it really depends on how large the area is and how much hunting pressure it gets i would highly recommend wearing blaze orange you dont need to go crazy but at least a hat or beanie
  i call on public land but i dont do it a ton no one should be shooting at noises stalking still goes on but is definitely less popular than stand hunting i do both in north eastern us while stalking is more fun and satisfying it had its place some circumstances and environments just makes it exceedingly difficult relative to being in the stand
  no thats a 100 gun on the used market he overmodded the fuck out of it and now wants a sucker to give him his cash back dont let him take you for that ride you can get a brand new ruger 10/22 from bass pro for less than 200 itll be a better rifle all around as well as having more options to mod should you want to do that     literally any 22 rifle capable of reliably hitting targets from 50 yards away will work fornsquirrel hunting you dont even need a scope either though i admit it does help for reference i do my squirrel hunting with a raggedout old montgomery ward 22 rifle from the 1930s that i found at a gun show for 50 works like a fucking charm too   bottom line is you dont need to spend that much on a rifle just as long as it works properly and is pretty accurate go to a gun shop that sells used guns and pick one up off of the used rack for 125 or so 90 of the time itll be more than good enough   the biggest thing about squirrels is they are incredibly wary if you can stalk close enough to one without it running behind a tree trunk literally any 22 rifle will work and those skills translate very well to other game tooif you can stalk squirrels successfully deer are going to be fucking simple for you
  nice wood  no homo
  literally
  the entry hole is a perfect location for the exit hole  always aim for the opposing armpit    with that said grats on the recovery and a clean kill meat in the freezer is meat in the freezer
    i hunt thick forests too longest shot ever has been 60 yards if that   whats mattered more than anything for me has been getting the gun to my shoulder and making an aimed shot quickly and if i couldnt do that right the first time then the ability to reload and getting a second shot off quickly as well i am now more convinced than ever that a compact lever action like a winchester 94 or marlin 336 is godly for such hunting situations   you dont need anything more than 3030 at such ranges either youll likely never have a situation where it cant do the job great shooting ammo is at every walmart in the land and its often the cheapest thing in the ammo case
  deer dont really make the connection between loud noises and imminent death that said they do make the connection between seeing or smelling strange creatures in the woods and not wanting to be around them so invest in great quality patternbreakup camouflage and lots of scent control when youre bowhunting it matters
  everything pees in the woods theyve done studies and deer arent really bothered by it they just sniff it and wonder but dont make the connection between the pee and you unless they see you pissing       florida  florida gives zero fucks about what you use to kill bambi as long as you do it cleanly also deer are nowhere near that abundant down here there are far too many parasites and not enough cold weather to kill them all off
  762x39 works great for deer and hogs out to 200 yards or so trajectory is comparable to 3030 despite its smaller size thanks to more efficient cartridge and bullet designs   ammo availability is the rub though milsurp fmj ammo for 762x39 is cheap and everywhere good hunting ammo is neither youll want to invest in american name brand ammo for best results
   deer blab blab blab  that is just something people say to justify shooting baby bucks   needed to be culled  whores you pickup from the bar will say something like ive never done this before   yeah say whatever you need to so you dont feel like a whore
  honestly this most see a small rack and just shot it but in  you see that i have passed or potentially passed on the same buck for 2 years now proper management is important for a healthy population
anybody ever tried one of these subcaliber insert things i just ordered one figuring it might be good for small game without having to bring another rifle along
  what one did you get the short non rifled ones are shit the longer rifled ones are ok up to 100ish yards depending
  its for a rifle not a shotgun so its just smooth until the bullet engages with the rifles rifling
  he used it correctly you knobhead
  if the ammo is smaller than the barrel its not going to engage with the rifling genius
  32acp  dunning kruger traps and gents
  32acp is 3125in in diameter 308 is actually 308in in this case the ammo is actually larger than the bore and gets squeezed down
  literally
  trying to get into hunting as well specifically white tail but i have a question about squirrels is there a reason people hunt them besides just target practice do you eat them i cant really agree with just killing something for the sake of it just my two cents
  nearly everyone who hunts them eats them numb nuts they are delicious
  with decent softpoint ammo fine    decent softpoint ammo is neither common nor cheap no your barnaul/tula/wolf/surplus/chinese softpoint ammo will not expand reliably if at all due to the steel jacket and lol just expose the tip of m68 it should be good enough design
  skin them gut them throw the carcass into a stew until the meat falls off the bones squirrel is pretty tasty
anybody have gutting/dressing guides to post
    had no idea thank you
could anyone here give some advice on hunting in bongland i want to hunt small game rabbits squirrels et cetera but have no land to do it on and i cant find anything about people with wild land who allow rabbit hunting id like to camp out there too so foresty areas would be best/comfiest but im easy on that  is the only course of action to find farmers who are willing to let me do some pest control for them if so how would i go about finding them
went to public hunting area to scout it and almost got fucking tacked by 3 young bucks while i was walking one was 5 yards away moving its head left and right trying to tell what i was while i was shitting myself what was amusement at how close they were running quickly turned to worry about having to wrestle a deer the little patch of woods had droppings fucking everywhere so hopefully they will be there when i go back     what was amazing was how blind they were i was wearing a full blaze orange shirt froze as soon as i heard them and standing in the middle of a 10 foot wide vehicle path and they trotted right up to my face if i post up in that patch as many days as i can im sure to see them eventually right
  not from bong but i imagine its much the same anywhere you just gonna have to knock on a lot of doors i bet most ppl who know aspot arent trying to have anymore people on it
  if u go back there youll be guaranteed one given enough days their sight is shit but their nose will bust you i had them come within feet of me too it actually happens all the time if u are down wind of them especially if youre in an area where a lot of human scent and activity is the norm
diving thread diving thread what should my landlocked ass know
practice clearing your ears a lot
look up perilymphatic fistula and barotrauma and be careful out there
  take diving classes its a lot of fun i would practice learning to clear a mask and snorkel and do it underwater so your comfortable with it when you take diving classes you will be several feet underwater and have to take your mouth piece out to clear and a lot of people get freaked out
  im trying to go freediving tomorrow boys apparently the faggot park services closed downmy favorite spot due to manatees being present when they are fucking there all year round but now its special  do you guys think it is a good idea to take a girl with me most of my hobbies are solitary and exploring/diving is one of the few ones that can be social and would like to find a cool female to go with me
  closed downmy favorite spot due to manatees being present when they are fucking there all year round but now its special  lol wtf i thought theyre not endangered anymore
  youre not even allowed to touch them i understand fucking jumping on them is illegal and you should be arrested for that but fucking touching them gently and getting fined 300 is so retarded
  good luck with your idea
learn to swim
newfag to fishing here im from libya so i fish from the mediterranean coast surf fishing but i was wondering what was the difference between spincasting spinning and baitcasting in regards to rod design reel design the environment where these are used and the type fish theyre designed for
  youre in the wrong thread anon
  fuk
dont overpressurize your ears when clearing    fucked up mine when i got my license and im having tinnitus ever since    just go back up and try again slowly
  you can fish and scuba tho
  getting to where you are comfortable not being up and down in pain and scared is really helpful you might be 80 ft down and a fish smacks your mask off enough to flood youre now blind the salt is stinging your eyes your mask is full of water and the last thing you need to do is react remain calm know the burn will wear off just affix your mask like you would above water exhale through your nose like youre presureising it go ahead open your eyes to the burn or fresh salt it probably still feels like youve got a flooded mask but you have probably cleared it probably
  ya lungs and brain explode if ya go up too fast
  i desperately want to hug one they look snuggly as fuck
  this im scared of decompression sickness but i guess its only a big deal if youre diving 30m which a beginner wouldnt be doing anyhow
  freediving  solitary  i shiggy diggy what do you think will happen if you have a shallow water blackout anon
  why is that faggot kissing a male fish
  actually your blood boils
  go do your padi rather than getting just your aow keeping goin back for classes once youre qualified most of the people training would rather train further at pretty interesting sites    clearing ears and clearing water from goggles are the common ones and learning not to gasp your air and burning through your tank is another but these should be covered in your training    buy a stainless steel rod to bang on your tank for attention its ten times more effective than wailing your arms about      regardless of depth you should still follow proper ascenscion techiniques saftey stops you still have air in your lungs that expands    always watch your buddies back and check their gear and they check yours before a dive
  i dont think you have to worry about your lungs as letting air out is absolutely trivial air bubbles trapped in your eustachians or your sinus chambers can ruin your day tho
  go do your padi    i am on chapter 3 of the written part of my padi open water doing the written stuff online so i can just go right to my confined dives when i get to the resort i am really glad im going the padi route it lasts forever and they hammer in all the basic shit about assent/descent the dream is to take my padi certs all the way and start getting into wreck diving the idea of scubaing around a sunken ship makes my heart race
  this
going diving in the galapagos islands in a month and in super excited my first time ever diving too
  its the best excuse to get out and see stuff training for diving certificates like i said guys doing the more senior stuff usually prefer to do it at sites that are at least enjoyable    yeah padi is pretty recognisable globally
  bang on your tank    i lost a diver because she didnt have a tankbanger we looked for her for hours and found her washed up with the bends her bcd had inflated out of control and shot her up to the surface like a balloon out of a pool it sucked man if we could have reached her while she was inflating we could have fixed it but she was in the rear when it happened
  check their gear and they check yours before a dive  begin with review and friend  buoyancy weight releases air and final check    what caused this to happen and where do you dive master out of
i want to throw everything away and be a dive instructor how to do this  aow  havent dived in 15 years yikes  have about 6070 logged dives but lol  have some passive income  should i just have padi take all my money is naui a meme where is a good place to do this tia
  do gue fundamentals to get back into the swing of things you dont have to drink the koolaid and dive their way but ive not known anyone who got nothing out of the course  from total nooblet autists to seasoned padi course directors with a cave pass
  thanks i hadnt heard of gue and just did some light reading on it looks good and sensible i am familiar with criticism of padis cert system unfortunately finding a fundamentals course near me is difficult until next august i am not in a rush i suppose  but padi is always there everywhere and always ready to take my money plus theres the probably oversold avenue to employment that padi offers rec teaching isnt something my heart is set on it just offers from my perspective the best possibility to get started in the field i miss diving like crazy and i was passionate about it before life derailed things i now have an opportunity to get back to it  thanks for your reply
  no ones stopping you from continuing down the padi path and their rescue class if taught by a decent instructor is among the bestrated its also common to find crossagency instructors anyway  the dive shop attached to gue hq itself offers padi courses for example if anything fundies should further refine your skills in preparation for future leadership roles      if you cant wait and want to jump in straight utds essentials course is a good alternative  created by the guy who built much of gues fundies curriculum but i personally feel theyre a little too eager to flog their gear     as for rec teaching id say give dming a spin first because diving for personal enjoyment is very different from teaching a bunch of hungover partytypes in thailand how not to get themselves killed
  ive graduated to scubaboard and am reading about the koolaid and how likely you are to be someones dm slave likely  the more and more i read about the koolaid the more i want to drink it  any estimate on  for the gear of the top of your head/good manufactures i am totally out of that loop as well
  i personally dive a halcyon wing with scubapro regs but it really depends on whats available in your area what you can afford the gear config doubles a full tech loadout and where you can get service where are you based is there a second hand market you can get cheap kit from     best you reach out to one or two gue instructors you intend to take the course from and dont make the mistake of thinking you need to buy halcyon  its good stuff but often not worth the full sticker price
how to combat shark
  shark attacks on divers are exceedingly rare unless youre spearfishing or fucking with the shark
  i wonder who could be behind this post
  did she died
  i dont believe thats the question the other anon asked anon i believe what he said was how do you combat a shark not how much of a free love hippy are you
    you punch them in the nose or poke them in the eyes you can even flip a shark upside down to disable it with great white sharks you want something pokey that will keep some distance between you and the shark
   looking at fish balls  nigga you gay
why is the ocean so much clearer than freshwater ten foot visibility is very rare in freshwater most of my lakes are about 4 feet max but ive seen down 20 feet in the ocean
  whales
  in the summer you get serious algae blooms which limit visibility in warm freshwater     additionally most freshwater lakes have silt bottoms whereas the ocean has sand sand particles are a lot heavier and sink back down to the bottom quickly after being disturbed silt is the total opposite if you disturb a silty bottom in a lake with no current it can take hours or even days to settle     i have been in a freshwater lake 3 days after an open water class and there was still an impact to visibility     that being said the ocean can have shit visibility too currents storms and runoff can bring or stir up particulate into the water certain locations just like fresh water can have seasonal visibility looking at you dominican republic    if you find cold freshwater like in the northern great lakes you can find crystal clear freshwater look at pictures from tobermory in ontario you can get 50 feet of visibility easily up there
im not really sure where a skiing thread goes on this goddamned website /out/ /asp/ /sp/ /b/ but i figure this is the best place to start    ive been skiing all my life but have never bought skis myself always rented parents didnt want to buy me shit id grow out of with mixed results as an adult    im of average build and pretty much exclusively ski in the northeast usa so lots of ice and more sheer surfaces    does anyone have any decent recommendations for brands/styles i can look out for
  i frequently browse newschoolers and stay up to date on ski industry news since its my passion id recommend asking there as well under gear talk in terms of buying skis we need to know some information  build  how much do you want to spend  where are you skiing  what is your ability    youve already given us 2 of the 4 so ill do my best and give you some thoughts     since youre in the east coast you wont be skiing tons of powder as such you dont need anything over about 100 in width for a ski heres a few lesser known companies id look into in terms of skis  j skis  on3p  fatypus    if you ask about any of these on newschoolers often times the owner of the company will answer you thats how revered the website is in the ski world the biggest advantage of buying from these companies is that theyre made here in the factories under the supervision of the minds that designed the skis and not something made in china doesnt mean companies that outsource are bad but i like these better for their innovation all 3 of these companies have great durability on3p in particular     now for the skis  since youre an east coast skier id definitely look at j skis theyre out of burlington vt made my jason levinthal whos been making skis since forever started line but wanted his own project ive never skied a pair of his but their website has excellent feedback id look at the all play or masterblaster for you from them     tldr go ask newschoolers you will have people post in your thread who own the ski companies telling you about their skis usually not trying to sell you but just inform you
also whos fucking stoked for the season here in utah
  thanks very informative and highquality post    my budget is in the 400700 range retail i said i was skiing all my life but to clarify i can casually handle doubleblacks on the east coast which are mostly just glaciers by the end of the day
  okay yeah in that range check out these skis    armada arv 96  blizzard cochise  on3p kartel 96  j skis masterblaster all play the metal  if you like stiffer go on3p j skis are softer usually arv line is solid overall
  you dont think the arv86s would be too narrow of a waist do you
  no if you prefer a narrower ski that would work too i ski in utah so i wouldnt want anything under 96 myself but im sure 86 would be fine back east
    op here just grabbed this sick pair    thanks for all your help ill be looking out for a smaller cheaper set for the wife soon enough shes a decent skiier but not nearly as experienced and doesnt care to go quite as hard as i do
  those are sweet
  i am although i never skied before will be spending 6 months in utah for work
  where do you plan on skiing
  small manufacturers can have quality issues that are a side effect of the presses/layup process they use less capital for materials/customer service/equipment effects the final product in a huge way and is often masked by the popularity with the skier base no one wants to look these manufacturers in the eye and tell them they have quality control issues or that they make 2x4s which are unsuitable for anything other than powder days or parks or that the skis i just bought cant be tuned because they are twisted garbage and can never be flat i agree with supporting these manufacturers and they are great on a shop floor as everyone wants to buy the fucking things but i wouldnt recommend them as an entry level ski unless the buyer gets to put hands on the thing the cost is normaly very high compared to the quality you get    t have worked for 20 years managing ski shops
  yeah j skis specifically has a factory blemish area on their site i think i wont deny that i prefer to buy skis from indie ski companies i also think that in large part the fact that these guys are all skiers makes them more honest to the community that supports them i bought a pair of 2016 d senders from fatypus and theyre a beast of a ski also buying a pair of bentchetlers later this yearin picture if youve worked at ski shops for 20 years ill bow to you on knowledge of the actual products that come out of these but i hear more from the community newschoolers regarding quality and durability issues from major companies like faction or linenow a major company for sure than anything regarding j skis or other indie ski companies unless of course you skied your brand new on3ps into a ditch also ive read countless stories where these companies were happy to work with you if indeed there was some kind of issue with your ski op isnt entry level either     i ski at snowbird and alta myself but i hit park too now and then at brighton and alta and the bird are basically natural terrain parks for rails i use rock skis but on jumps i absolutely want something solid under my feet that can carve both ways and i know wont skew off on the landings so i think its irresponsible of you to say that a shit pair of skis is suitable for park jumps     out of curiosity where do you ski these days
  can smell the wax from my roommate prepping his skis right now feels good man      used to work at the dps manufacturing facility wed grade every pair on quality from af and sell them accordingly since the raw materials alone are so much goddamn money as and bs go to the stores cs to proforms / employees ds to the demo fleet lul and fs went straight into the trash   a / b either perfect or very minor defect that would never be noticed  c cosmetic defect minor structural issues bad camber line / thin base  d major defect offset parts tooling damage  f this ski will catastrophically fail within 1 season its so fucked dont even let the employees have it for free    i think most companies now know to go all out when a customer complains so that no bad pr goes onto the web we certainly did shit like express shipping to japan isnt cheap
  utah midwest east coast and pnw are where i ski now we have resorts and shops all over the place i agree that junk skis arent the thing for park riding but also think that lightness is over played when durability is more of a factor you simply dont look for the same things in a park ski as you do a groomer or off piste ski and a beefier ski that doesnt have elements to add torsional rigidity is more acceptable regarding line and faction small manufacturers dont sell in mass market/discount shops and have a smaller very enthusiastic user base a core skier is much more likely to ski what they bought and chalk any failures up to their own fault over the brand they are stoked on
  oh shit thats awesome newschoolers always calls it dentists preferred ski but were all broke ski bums who are jealous we cant afford shit im sure you guys do really well though i see a lot of dps in the cottonwoods and theyre too much for me to afford if youre still in utah hit me up at the bird i wear a big red skisuit usually ski without poles go fast and love to get big air
  completely agree on the durability factor i dont tour so lightness means nothing to me and i prefer a heavier ski that can bust through stuff i do like butters though so the d sender was a perfect ski for me in that its hard enough to be a ski for all the lines i want to ski yet still has enough flex that i can do the occassional nosebutter or tail butter
  i will be in layton area so considering getting a season pass to snowbasin and take the ski bus since i dont have a 4wd vehicle
  how many class f failures did you guys have dps makes a nice ski
  i have heard great things about snowbasin i wonder if theres enough traction here to make this a general because there used to be one on /asp/ before it became a desolate wasteland of wrestlefags
  i cried a little when asp died
  yeah you really cant argue with carbon fiber i grew up skiing midtier freestyle skis from line / volkl back east and my first season out here on dps was a trip  ill keep that in mind m8      very few it was always something absurd and unlucky shit like using the wrong mold block the press computer fucking up or completely annihilating the ski with power tools by accident the person responsible would get a stern talking to the rest of us would have a laugh then back to business as usual   dps makes a nice ski  gotta agree there the owner and lead engineer are both great guys who know their shit inside out
  do you still work in the ski industry
  not really i do some private lessons here and there but thats it dps as a brand / cutting edge market leader is cool being a factory grunt is not  im focused on getting avy training and certs this season and hitting the backcountry since i never had real shit like it back east
  thats pretty cool the average guy in a lift line doesnt get what production is like the few factory tours ive been on make me really wonder what the guys in romania making our rental fleet are dealing with
  me neither i have a prius also out of curiosity do any of you guys post in other skiing forums
latest ski purchase
  thats pretty what kind of bindings are you gonna put on those
  probably a tlt speed but may want to keep the old heavy bcs mounted
  for sure its like any other factory job youre dealing with roomtemperature iq coworkers all types of hazardous chemicals particulates / fumes 220v power equipment etc   being the guy doodling in autocad and testing prototypes all year is awesome takes a long time to get there though
bump gonna be hitting the bird 3 days in a row tomorrow should be good
been rocking these for a few years great buy thick enough to carve pure pow but thin enough to make me cum buckets on corduroy     question though ive got a pretty good jacket right now but im considering moving on from it i ran into this one i liked but the sleeves dont have the layer of down feathers  theyre just made out of a thick material a bunch of the clerks at teh joint i was perusing tried selling it pretty hard on me and swore it would do well in the winter but i have my doubts
quick question can i wear thick rim glasses underneath skiing helmets
  similar questions   if im going skiing for the first time in a decade and am functionally an utter beginner do i need to wear a helmet since ill mostly be doing easy low speed shit   how the fuck do you wear glasses with a ski helmet and goggles should i just get eye surgery and be done with it i hate contacts
  yes always wear a helmet the worst head smack ive ever taken was cruising the corduroy down to the base i wasnt paying attention hit an ice patch and went down hard if i hadnt been wearing a helmet i would have had a pretty bad concussion  you can get goggles that fit over glasses theyre called otg goggles
  not him but ive got a question  have pair of rossi s7 pros  love them to death  beat them to absolute shit   maintain them myself  ptex metalgrip and wax  jb welded a blown out edge  theyre 162s  got them when i was a 130lb 53 skelly  im now a 150 pound 58 19 year old boomer  i want the most bang for buck not the chinkiest cheapest   im skiing ice coast  id say im pretty good won third in a couple of local slaloms but i love big air  wouldnt call myself a parkrat i hate rails but i live for medium and large features   i want to go fast sprint grass smash glass and eat ass  what would you recommend
    19 year old boomer so ill assume not much in the way of cash   150 lbs at 58 you might want something longer than 162 id recommend around 170 in length because length helps when youre on icemore edgemore grip also youll get more leeway on landings if you end up a little off balance or backseat  if you can afford them id spring for a pair of this years arv 96 if not take a look and see if you can find last years arv 96 both are great skis the newer is supposedly a bit better all mountain but i have friends who do crazy stuff on last years arvs out where i live in snowbird     heres two reviews from newschoolers on each of the skis im recommending these 2 specifically because theyre generally a bit cheaper price wise than some of the other options out there new blizzards or factions could run you a shitton of money whereas armada generally makes their stuff a bit more affordable while remaining fairly durable   in terms of where to buy them i dont know much about the east coast but sometimes you can find great deals online on what are essentially brand new skis so id check craigslist places like that before ponying up some big bucks on brand new skis if you are short on dough not thats a bad thing just a reality of being 19 im 22 barely i remember         
  id also look into the k2 poacher which is a bit of a stiffer all mountain ski as well as the j skis allplay that our other east coast friend bought above they make them in a bunch of different graphics but the allplay are a bit more expensive i have also heard though that the allplay is an insanely fun ski
also ill just trip so you guys know its me posting about this stuff in this thread or any other skiing generals we might make here
    thanks manon
  i need a new snowboard bag and local store has a good stock   do i get one that has straps like a backpack or one with wheels  price difference between the two is like 60 and 200
  really depends on how much you fly and how much money you make
  im not planning on flying with the board that often and im not looking to spend much snowboarding is a every now and then thing for me not something i do all the time
  just get the 60 dollar bag then since you wont be rolling it around airports no need to drop 200 bucks on something like that honestly if you have a car do you even need the bag
  i dont have a car havent driven in 12 years
could anyone here give some advice on hunting in bongland i want to hunt small game rabbits squirrels et cetera but have no land to do it on and i cant find anything about people with wild land who allow rabbit hunting id like to camp out there too so foresty areas would be best/comfiest but im easy on that    is the only course of action to find farmers who are willing to let me do some pest control for them if so how would i go about finding them
  needing to find a farmer to shoot a fucking rabbit    my god ive never been happier for 1776
im inheriting 120 acres of land and im trying to figure out the best way i can use it its down south in australia hidden in a little valley maybe 20 minutes from the city centre population of 1 million    some ideas are    organic/community farming  high return crops saffron ginseng etc  winery/vineyard experience  event location weddings concerts etc  golf course  paintball arena  4 wheeler race track
  sell half of it so u can just be a hermit
  this
  anon i will toil for turnips and pay you in harvest if you let me live on your land
  maybe citrus like lime
  should get a bunch of /out/ists on some land and they each get their own shack and they have to garden their own foodbut if you kill a deer or something big you have to give op half for being on his land
  
  might want to try posting in ausgen mate some people there might have some ideas
apiary vinyard insectiaries biodynamic community etc
id do high return crops or winery and probably sell a few acres first that way you have plenty o money to get started on your dream plantation
  120 acres  20 min from city centre  
  farm organic fruits and razorbacks make brandy and bacon from it build some ponds so you can farm some fish and shrimps build a smokehouse and a bbq barn
outdoor gun range
puppyfarm
can i raise well behaved dogs on your land i can patrol the boarder with them in the off time
  well behaved dogs wont protect anons land from a caravan anon
  do waco ii australia too
  this
  cut it up into 1 acre blocks and sell each for 200k if youre that close to that large a city youd easily be able to develop it
  adelaide  
      hey brah were sortof locals do what your neighbours are doing and lease out plots of land for graziers or become a grazier yourself its as simple as renting parts of your land to primary producers who run sheep or cattle they drop the animals off they graze for a couple of weeks they get picked up again and you get the cash equivalent of renting out ten small apartments in the city
tbqh if i had that land i wouldnt develop it at all id keep my day job have a wonderful vast stretch of green wilderness to live on which would keep me happy forever especially in a decade or two when everything for a hundred km will be a shithole concrete chinese ghetto and then youll be able to sell and retire relatively young as a multimulti millionaire having basically owned your own wilderness for most of your adult life for me its not worth the money while im young and able and interested enough to enjoy it
  ill raise the alarm of the other leechers on ops land well be the militia
  what sort of land damage can this cause
  id imagine fertilizing and grasscutting isnt so bad for the land
cultivate the natural ecosystem of the area and promote native species i dont know much about australia or hunting there but if native wildlife flourishes there are definitely ways to profit from that
   australia promote native wildlife
  this
make a small shallow artificial lake and stock it with native fish itd also attract mammals and birds and herps
build a house  start small farm to feed yourself   tell everyone to gtfo   live out out your life in peace
  land damage usually comes from clearing the land before cows/sheep are grazed there of course if youre using chemical dips you might get some of that leaching into the environment as runoff which isnt that great
  contact your local chambers of commerce im sure some members of the high society and city developers would love to see your land and opportunities
  ecotourism brah clear a few spots for safari tents leave the rest wild charge 200 pacific pesos a night
as an adelaide fag you have to be talking about adelaide in your description honestly do up and buildings/cabins and rent it as camp/cabin site on airbnb
  sell me a shack for a thousand bucks
    its an /out/ reinvents feudalism episode
  what about a big drinking hall on the land
  cover it in bindies  let immigrants settle there
  in australia a city is basically any town 20k pop or more sometimes lower
  literal heaven on earth  feels for this feel
damn op jealous as fuck south australian here too and id love to live in the hills down a quiet valey like that 20min from the city wew   can i at least bow hunt some bunnies  foxes there    wait theres an ausgen what board    this desu    this too when the range isnt being used lol
  ausgen  theyre over on /int/ with all the other country/language specific generals     /int/ generals are even below /vg/ standards in terms of autism though
  good god get a landcare or restoration group on that site what look like weeds there are an eyesore    me being a bio nerd id try to construct ecosystems around the place throw down a few logs on that overgrown creek and engineer yourself a pocket wetland    plant up the hillsides and other decreased productivity land with some native covers on advice of a botanist or equivalent take care of that land op because tons of country land plots seem to give 0 damns about it    if youre willing im betting that you can convince a few companies to give you money to restore your land offer a sort of offset system in the long run you can turn this into a sort of resort spruiked by the fact that theyre relaxing on a land being restored to its former state    though damn anon thats like a 50 hectare playground    build yourself a goddamn rainforest and wetland so that you can have prime ministerial visits every drought and have them tell you that your somewhat basicass stuff is the solution to australias drought crisis
  no its not     australia has 5 cities if youre generous you can stretch it to canberra darwin and hobart only because they are capitals no one says im going into the city today if theyre headed to ballina 25000 or wollongong 300000 hell even newcastle or gold coast dont count
small vineyard sell grapes onto bigger producers
  im in give me 5 acres to work with
  how in the fuck is the gold coast not a city    build some downhill mountain bike tracks
for those of you who want to do a secret santa this xmas this is another reminder thread for you    for those of you who dont know in past years a few people of /out/ have posted their amazon wish lists for xmas then bought items on each others lists to spread cheer this reminder thread helps people to plan ahead so they will have enough money to participate
heres some tips on how to help keep yourself anonymous while still using amazons wishlist system if anyone has questions comments or knows something to add to this speak up so it may be changed
  storm whistle  ultimate happy floote  based geeps poster
  that is anons happy floote poster an offshoot of geeps but not geeps and not the person who made the original anons happy floote song it is merely an example wishlist
  bought for a few american anons last year felt good to spread some gifts hopefully someone will pick my list this year
  ill pick your list anon 3
how do i buy some anons presents
  once people start posting their amazon wish lists the world is your oyster    ill try to have one up over the weekend
i cant believe the year is almost over yet again thanks to absurd levels of hospital bills for literally nothing i probably wont be able to participate the last payment is literally in december lol
happy to see a secret santa   i was setting up to make one after checking for keywords but forgot secret and santa until i was about to his post     what was the former we used last year for our list i dont think we were supposed to use the whole url
  i think just the wishlist number the 9 digit number at the end of the url worked in previous years
huzzah
  some people posted the entire link and some posted only the number but i think some people are gunshy from other boards deleting and banning for posting the links and such i think only a few boards and staff for those boards allow it i know /out/ has done it for a few years without problem hopefully this year will be the same    when people post the number it will be the 13character code at the end of the link like this        just copy and paste the xxxxxxxxxxxxx to the end of your own wishlist replacing the code on your wishlist that should get you there there is a problem when the code comes from a country that isnt your country because the amazon url will be slightly different like amazoncouk instead of amazoncom i recall there being a huge list of codes last time or the year before and someone had ordered them via countries through trial and error not a fun thing to try to do if the list is 50 entries long    if board staff allow id rather people just post the entire url so that confusion and errors over codes and countries doesnt happen that would make things go more smoothly just keep in mind that the report function has a dropdown menu with the selection this post is advertising or begging on it we will just need to see if the spirit or the law takes precedence this year      very nice
  i asked for clarification in /qa/ here 
      lets see what happens
  not a bad selection
ill probably post mine when it is finally december but only if i can swing a little cash and participate fully
oh that time of the year again the one my hate for living in brazil reach untold levels
  but anon amazon is quintessentially brazilian
so when are we supposed to post our lists    ive got my savings ready
    start posting anon    the best way for this thread to get views is to bump to the first page
    dont be that consumist  lets wait at least november ends
heard it was time to post  
  it takes a long time to get going plus shipping etc last year we started late and a lot of anons suggested we start earlier this year plus the holiday doesnt matter anon its all about the giving
    as much as i agree with your manga selection your list should be tailored to /out/ interest
  i really love this tradition but last year ive gifted two anons something of their wishlist and got nothing in return maybe it was because i live in germany but anyway lets see if i get something for someone this year as its still a nice feeling to gift something to you guys
  seconded on that sentiment      if i can set aside some money this time ill participate i figured 25ish and try to spread that out over as many anons as i can
  thats kind of you   well then ill definitely look into other guys lists again this year    never too late to post my own list because im in germany its only accessible via de     amzn dot de   slash registry slash wishlist slash 19j7ysnr0boh
deutschland    this reminds me theres a language translation thing at the bottom of every amazon page the de has several languages but the com only has english and spanish      well if/when i do participate i wont mind if i get nothing since that really doesnt matter too much to me
seems like a good time to post mine      saved up the last few months for this looking forward to gifting you other anons
merry christmas    i received a nice whetstone last year and i gave a nice wool blankie it felt good     link 
  your list has an addon item meaning the person buying must buy 25 worth of stuff from amazon in the same order with that item in order to buy that item
  they can buy it it just wont ship until it can be stuffed in another package to that address  theyll get it next time they buy something
  this wishlist doesnt seem to be setup properly i think it is this problem    click on the big 3 dots    in the upper right of the wishlist to manage the list put a check in the box for     third party shipping agreement  yes let amazoncom share my wish list shipping address with thirdparty merchants to ship purchases from this wish list    unless you give your shipping address to the person buying from your wishlist it wont work for 3rd party items that amazon/amazon warehouse isnt selling/managing you can either change that setting or double check to make sure you find items that either of those do sell you can search for such items by making sure a department like sports  outdoors is selected near the search bar and scroll down the page on the left side to check boxes amazoncom and amazon warehouse in the seller section see pic
  ive been testing it out and it wont even allow you to go to the checkout if thats the only item/total under 25 it just gives you proceed with shopping instead also it seems you have to buy gifts one at a time for different people so the addresses will go to the correct person instead of adding everything to your cart and checking out
so lets start this  amazon us  2xppaqvsmi31y  1hz9utlctcp4f  inw8m9etg0qq  8h0ad8332c02  26re2ohys8yl1    amazon deutschland amazondotde  19j7ysnr0boh    im the mexibro but my list is in amazon us 26re2ohys8yl1 all my items are eligible for shipping to mexico so take in mind there will be a more or less 3 in shipping    rember you can access any amazon country with your regular email/password and you can pay with your visa/mastercard even if the prices are not in the same currency so no excuses for not giving gifts to the eurobros
well since everyone else is doing it why not heres a floote diving in      i dont own anything on this list but have used some things on it in the past it can also show other anons what cheap things there are for their own list i think i did everything correctly but time will tell i also added some notes and warnings to some items as example of what to look out for    im also broke now i spent more than i planned lol      i was able to order something off this list took forever wading through lists just to order something though hope this anon is still around to enjoy it      i couldnt get anything on this list because evidently my card/bank is like lol germany fuck no hopefully that didnt botch up a bunch of other stuff for me so i dont need to call them and complain on monday well no us to de gift giving for me sorry      i ordered something on your list hope it finds you well also on your list  sorry this item cant be shipped to your selected address when selecting your address it was the digital fish scale thing that i tried first and it didnt work because of the address but i got something else to work instead
it seems a lot of the regular amazon/amazonwarehouse seller items are temporarily free shipping no price limit when they were free shipping with 25 worth of goods i guess it is for xmas or something
  probably a cyber mondee type thing yea
im really looking forward to hike the sierra here in south baja im just taking what i have laying around my home and a plus if you could help me out it is far too early but happy holidays
  far too excited i forgot the link  
im too paranoid to post my amazon link but may buy some anon something if youre the buyer no one besides amazon can get your details right
  i fucked up again i figured it would be better if i used amazon us like the mexi anon above  amazon us  36t4wj67uebg9 
  i made a list with a lot of low cost stuffs  2ofr7ol5wxjhl  i can buy stuff for other anons starting the 5th when i get paid
  yeah it seems that only buyers can see the adress of other people
  germanon here yeah i remember it being a hassle buying stuff for us anons last year i wished they made it more usable   i also hope you didnt botch anything but man youre a good guy
will start checking and buying other anons wishlist on mid december    heres mine 3cgu42bk6p04z
  thank you very much kind anon this is my first time doing an amazon wishlist i fixed it 3
    lol yeah those peso prices might scare off some people who dont realize
  fucking oof
  that would be unfortunate mexianon should mention that in the post
  check the image here  it lists ways you can further help keep anonymous and things to look out for when selecting items      yeah some of their stuff really needs to be better designed and implemented like when i tried to change payment types there was no listing for paypal which is like insane there were a lot of other stuff just nothing i could use
  man that pocket bellow collapsible fire tool looks super useful i about blinded myself trying to blow on a fire the other day when using wet wood took forever to get it going and the smoke was super thick because of being wet with one of those pocket bellows i wouldnt have been half blind or smelled like i rolled in the fire for half an hour
  amazon seems to bestrictly against paypal i dont kniw maybe we should try including ebay wishlists ifthats possible
  maybe we should try including ebay wishlists ifthats possible        i think any website is fine just so long as theres at least two people who can exchange regardless of website if any odd websites pop up just google for site reviews to see if it is legit and all that im not too familiar with ebays wishlist though i have an account there i do know that people have been able to find me via ebay to message me when i havent purchased anything from them or viceversa i wouldnt consider it all that secure but then again amazon isnt all that secure either in regards to anonymity    amazon seems to bestrictly against paypal     amazon payments is a direct competitor to paypal and credit card companies like visa which has its own online payment solution over 23 million customers have used pay with amazon to pay on a thirdparty website according to the company  apr 4 2016    i wonder if you can link your paypal account to amazon pay account lol at least ebay uses paypal
    thanks anon    i bought three people gifts last year and received nothing so this means a lot   did it give you an eta on the package im out of town for a couple of weeks
  thats ok i dont expect an anon to send me everything on the list maybe they pick and choose what ever fits their budget
    i think i posted my wishlist wrong so here i go again 8h0ad8332c02
  you are welcome oh yeah this post  package eta is on the left of this image this post  package eta is on the right of this image if you have someone to receive your mail you may need to notify them i dont see a place that tells me what method of shipping is/will be used when the seller finally sends it out i may get a tracking number or perhaps you may if you have your email account tied to it in some manner i dont know about that part with wishlists and orders if it is coming by standard mail then you can notify your post office to hold your mail until you return to get it both packages for either person shouldnt be more than shoe box sized unless someone has a triple boxed fetish      it works for me to view at least and is listed here  with those who posted prior

  down wash    interesting product and the reviews seem good for it ill probably be making diy down stuff next fall/winter and was wondering how the hell to clean them ive been reading guides like these    
  thanks man here goes nothing    
  thank you anon you can be sure that the gift will be see some actión
link      looking for some cool outdoor stuff ive been needing for my hike up mt taranaki
  hey not looking for too much right now just the axe to cut down pesky trees on the property and the life straw the rest of it is just a personal list for reminders if you are inclined to give any of that too then feel free thank you in advance
  you could use this one to add waterproofing  
  yeah that is a restorer since down is naturally waterproofed the mistake most people make is to dry clean them which strips off the natural waterproofing seems all they need is a gentle wash and dry with normal soap      youre welcome      were sorry the web address you entered is not a functioning page on our site    double check your link anon
2 year secret santa veteran here last year i bought an anon a nice 18650 flashlight and another a single person cheapo tent like last year i will gift anyone that gifts to me if any of you that have already posted havent gotten anything in a week or so reply to this message and ill help you out i tried to keep it cheap on my list there are several items under 10    link to my list /wishlist/ls/ip0dywjhg7v2
  /wishlist/ls/ip0dywjhg7v2  i cant access your list is it on de couk or com 
if someone gets something for you itd be nice of you to post a photo of it when it finally arrives      the seller has finally shipped this one pic me here        no notification yet on this one being shipped yet me here         just use the code on the end      like      looks like the link works for me when using the above url
    this is the correct link thanks    let me know if it works for you now anon
  yes now it works just need to figure out how to buy something and then proceed if i have enough money right now
  when you are on someones wishlist page you click on the add to cart button and it will change into a proceed to checkout button click it and youll need to search for and select anons address header in the list of addresses you can use if none exist then it probably means that particular wishlist has not been setup for 3rd party sellers and the item you chose was being sold from a 3rd party seller either choose a new item until you get one that you can send or have that anon change their wishlist settings like described in     it sounds like a lot but everything is straight forward for the most part
  hoping to get some good gear for a nice hike of the presidential range and wild camping near lake winnipesaukee ill be sure to get some stuff for fellow /out/doorsmen when i get paid next week
  yes thats completely clear im the german anon and have to figure everything out with the credit card information etc
if i buy something for someone do they know my full name and address
  nope amazon acts as the middle man
  when you do post your list too im in the us but last year bought a gift for an anon in the uk and it worked fine
  lol well good luck then        i think theres a selection you can make to do it anonymously but i know it should have your name at least if you send it as a gift it will automatically write a 3 line note like    to anon  blah blah blah  from anon    and it will use the names on the account/address for those name you can change that entire note if you wish
heres a pic of the wool blanket an anon gifted me last year it arrived just after christmas in time for that cold snap the east us had last january its the 25 60x90 inch one and its warm as fuck can definitely recommend
  wool really is damn comfy i need to get some new wool blankets my last one died it was nearing 50 years old and suddenly sorta just started breaking down
  hoping to get some more gear before i go back out again for the winter but well see what happens on a broke college budget
another europoor here very happy to see this taking off again it wasmch fn in the past years    here is my list amazonde/hz/wishlist/ls/21w7v9ydou82s    waiting for my pay from the treeplanting job i did in the last months to come through then some gifts will go /out/ i hope it will be before christmas
    not going to be seeing any family this christmas so hopefully i can spread some christmas spirit to some anons
  hey im glad youre enjoying it
remeber guys if you post your list you should give at least one gift lots of folks are leaving their list and not gifting anything    amazon us  2xppaqvsmi31y  1hz9utlctcp4f  inw8m9etg0qq  8h0ad8332c02  26re2ohys8yl1  3rx8e1vs6wtns  36t4wj67uebg9  2ofr7ol5wxjhl  3cgu42bk6p04z  1fccverk5i0z1  ip0dywjhg7v2  2a5x9o7oib1sm  3zb14d6nzav7  1prdu0q8wft3w    amazon deutschland amazondotde  19j7ysnr0boh  21w7v9ydou82s
  i second this notion  heres the ones ive gleaned from this thread and tried to order up in a list for everyone    us    3rx8e1vs6wtns  2xppaqvsmi31y  1hz9utlctcp4f  inw8m9etg0qq  8h0ad8332c02  2ofr7ol5wxjhl  3cgu42bk6p04z  xliq27loi0x6  ip0dywjhg7v2  2a5x9o7oib1sm  3zb14d6nzav7  1prdu0q8wft3w    mexico    26re2ohys8yl1  same anon on this line mexican amazon 2zjat6tu21s5e and us amazon 36t4wj67uebg9     germany  de    19j7ysnr0boh  21w7v9ydou82s    canada    1fccverk5i0z1
you made a mistake anon 26re2ohys8yl1 is not from amazon mexico its from amazon us with ship to mexico it is cool is we do it like this  us    3rx8e1vs6wtns  2xppaqvsmi31y  1hz9utlctcp4f  inw8m9etg0qq  8h0ad8332c02  2ofr7ol5wxjhl  3cgu42bk6p04z  xliq27loi0x6  ip0dywjhg7v2  2a5x9o7oib1sm  3zb14d6nzav7  1prdu0q8wft3w  26re2ohys8yl1 ship to mexico  36t4wj67uebg9 ship to mexico    mexico    2zjat6tu21s5e same guy of us amazon 36t4wj67uebg9    germany  de    19j7ysnr0boh  21w7v9ydou82s    canada    1fccverk5i0z1
  good catch i didnt see the distinction at first i probably had too many tabs open at the time
        would it be better for someone to make a google spreadsheet or something kinda hard to read and validate that there arent duplicates or missing shit in lists here
    i dont see why not especially if it keeps things straight
    thanks for the update
  this one is in mexico city now and seems to be going smoothly      this one still has no info on it being shipped or not the seller has a 99 rating the only negative review for the seller is that the item wasnt received but amzon fulfillment staff has a note saying it was the amazon fulfillment centers error if ive had no indication it has been shipped by monday ill contact the amazon fulfillment center about it
    unless im doing it wrong i tried to buy you a gift and i didnt see your address can you make sure its added
  he may have not added it correctly or doesnt have 3rd party address thing in  turned on and the item needs it

  fisted to death by a roastie    what a way to go
  god i wish i was that sheep
  im thinking where on earth can you hunt in norfolk
jenna gearing 24 said she left the trip early because she didnt like ms switlyks attitude and said taking the sex toy was disrespectful to the dead sheep   killed the sheep worried about disrespecting it
  fpbp
  
  killing is a one thing but fucking around with it is another
too american for the brits
europes northmen here  stupid cunts a hunter respects its prey because its natures gift to get food from it not a thing to fuck around  american idiots strikes again i dont think all americans are idiots dont get me wrong 
is shooting domesticated animals considered hunting too nowadays
  theyre not hunters theyre shootists that use living targets
  respecting your kills is part of the hunt making sure it doesnt needlessly suffer and not desecrating something whos life you just took are easy easy things to do   if you kill an animal you better use as much of it as practically possible    fucking it with a rubber fist that can slip into her hole without any lube is barbaric
  guns  england   fake and gay
  im thinking of the opening scene in last of the mohicans when they take the buck
  respecting your kills is part of the hunt  this is such bullshit its like insta whores saying they do it to empower women when in fact they do it for instant gratification and ego jerking  at least own it most hunters are just like ops hoes obnoxious sacks of shit others the steven rinellas types and wannabes are always in pr mode trying present hunting to the masses in a more palatable way and playing the conservationist card when in fact all that matters is to find a way to fulfill their primal instincts in a modern world a very minute part does indeed hunt for sustenance and nothing more but those dont share their bloodied kill on social media for likes praise or debate   and again lets not pretend that the average hunter the majority of the community wouldnt hunt everything with a fur extinct if allowed to do so or in exchange for a few hundred bucks    1100918  rinella still thinking that anyone besides impressionable 15yo buy into his blood thirsty desires mascaraed as this spiritual mambojambo
  gas chamber
theres something inherently broken within you if you dont mind this
    fuck respect its just gross shes probably the type to reuse tampons too
hunting sheep   what the heck
  im pro hunting but yeah this was a cunt thing to do
    wild/feral sheep and goats are a thing anon
    maybe in your spasticated opioid addicted country anon
  i know there are quite a few of them where i hunt the sheep are still sheep though and is herded off the mountain every winter before the snow comes theyre not wild in the same sense as deer moose etc these are animals that doesnt avoid human beings they even approach me when im sitting at a hunting spot i had to shoo them away last time
switlyk  either russian or ukrainian most likely ukrainian
  youre clearly retarded and dont know any hunters besides the sensationalist tripe shown in ops pic also actually go read some of rinellas work in american buffalo he derides market hunting and over exploitation of animals pretty thoroughly youre just throwing out broad generalisations for peoples motivations for hunting but it feels like youve never actually given it any thought or even talked to someone who has   youre weak in character you come from a family with no sense of tradition probably divorced parents you live and work in the city you feel frustrated often and youre so far removed from the sources of your food that tearing into another package of whatever garbage doesnt even make you bat an eye anymore
  thats right palm her off on another country until it suits her then itll be all my god given right as an american
  did they shove that inside the animal
  yes anon yes they did
  t brainnletanon with the iq of a dead bee  swiftlik  holding fisting fist  lel
  nobody has more respect for animals than hunters at least hunters who arent douchebags it takes a lot of skill in most cases for a hunter to take an animal and to do that you need to learn everything you can about that animal in so doing you will gain a lot of respect for it and even a love for the animal       ive never seen an american hunter do something like this in america
  damn dude you pretty much missed all shots but hey that doesnt matter because you did nothing but ad hominem anyway you just need to listen to rinellas latest podcast on rogan and the part where he talks about australia and new zealand to understand that he has a clear facade in place but when let loose he shows his true colors    generalizations and stereotypes exist for a reason this new way of cleaning face on social media still cant conceal all the retardation within the hunting community and its also pretty pathetic to hear hunting groups to make a fuss because some mountain lion killed a couple tards in a year to use it as an excuse to go after a species same with wolf or grizzly   but muh meat  but muh daniel boone era frontiersmen ate nothing but bear    the general public protests against ops and rightly so meanwhile most hunters come to their support and praise and some others not entirely brainlets condemn those whores because they know it damages their multi million dollar pr campaigns the later are just deceiving cunts and sacks of shit too just doing their best to hide it    steven i killed that artic fox totally for its meat and not because i wanted to give a fur hat to my wife rinella
  life is only temporary but respect is forever it is also one of the things that sets human apart from animals if you dont understand why being respectful is very important in all situations you might as well be some black living in a savage island thats your intellectual level
  so killing the animal and removing its one existence from this planet is aok but fist fucking it after its dead and can feel or sense nothing isnt okay gotcha  that makes perfect sense
  life is only temporary but respect is forever  thanks socrates im sure the random nobodies who died 100 years ago that no one knows anything about really care about their respect lasting forever within a month everyone will have forgotten about this lady killing a sheep and once shes dead no one will ever know or remember anything about her just like you or i
  t hasnt watched deer hunter
  i think all the hunters im in contact with would have called the whole thing off if a bunch of yank cunts were taking the piss
  why is england such a fag country
the sun is sinking in the west   the cattle go down to the stream   the redwing settles in her nest   its time for a cowboy to dreeeam
    i mean were not the ones posing with fist shaped dildos
  girls are not gay because they love being penentrate anon      
purple liiiight  in the canyons  thats where i   long to beee  with my threee  good companions  just my rifle  poonyy n meee    gonna hang  my sombrero  on the liiimb   of a treee  comin home  sweetheart darling  just my rifle  pony n mee
  so do gays faglord you should know
  i kill animals for fun and there is literally nothing wrong with that i eat the meat i support conservation organizations and all that shit but i would not want to kill animals were it not fun sport tell me why i shouldnt
  taking life  fun  im not going to tell you anything if you cant work it out yourself maybe you should be culled
  no u
  i kill animals for fun  no shit thats the whole point of my post eating the meat is just a consequence thats why i call rinellas and the likes mischievous sacks of dirt at least trash like yourself are upfront psychopaths
  people are genetically programmed to enjoy hunting otherwise they wouldnt do it and would starve to death learn evolution a little
  the fox hat provides warmth and comfort why not kill the fox for the warmth and comfort
  i cant control my instincts  wow talk of being a nigger        the fox hat provides social status and a fashion garment that will sit in the closet waisting space  fixed that for you
  killed the sheep worried about disrespecting it  virtue signalling hipster hunters like to pretend they are noble by saying a prayer to a fucking dead sheep to make themselves feel better
  who is rinella and why are you obsessed with him
  stereotypes exist for a reason  kek stereotypes literally exist because people make assumptions about things they know nothing about
      getting this mad on a sri lankan honeyglazing forum
  man you need to lay off the kool aid any non pc psych proff would set you straight in about 45 minutes
  which stereotypes arent true you cant name a single one
  underrated
  stereotypes are a product of your brains pattern recognition function if enough people recognise the same pattern the stereotype can spread throughout the public consiousness even someone who hasnt recognised the pattern for themselves will assume its true howeve without a recognisable pattern in the first place stereotypes wouldnt exist
 chhecked  based and hakenkreuzpilled
  are those supposed to be deer in the photo why are they so fucking small
  neat before or after the animal died
  millenials have so much yet unable to learn anything by themselves   jfcalmighty if you actually read the photo you would know they were supposed to be sheep because they actually are sheep soay variety most likely next time im going to whack you with the spoon instead of feeding little cretins like you with it
  the ones leftists believe
  its a joke as a country person i think its funny city people are such sensitive faggots muh hunting is evil fuck off its a part of the culture every sunday in my area they quite literally release the hounds and let the roam around killing whatever they find its great as it keeps the pests down city folk will never understand this hunting is part and parcel of living in the country and if you dont like it fuck off
  the question isnt about hunting here are you retarded its about fishing dead animals even for a joke and then publicly instagramming the degeneracy it not necessary and its not something you parade in public unless you want berating hell theres nothing morally wrong in some people minds with fishing dead animals some people are even sexually aroused by it but if you cant understand that publicly displaying such filth will get you berated then youre a hard that deserved the same tell me anon did you even read ops picture or did you just weigh in with muh shootings
  as another country person i think it makes her look like white trash
  i kill you for fun but lots of respect though    yikes
  man if i lived next to you id poison your dogs
  fucking it with a rubber fist that can slip into her hole without any lube is barbaric
  respect for the intensity of wild things is the same as respect for your parents    read a book       im from the country hunt obsessively and think you sound like a tasteless trailer trash peckerwood
  i know and thats probably the thing that surprises me the most
  t freshman sociology major
  i feels for this poor gook what happened
    t doesnt have hunting culture
huntress  i didnt know that was a word i thought hunter was neutral and one would use huntsman or huntswoman to refer to gender
  its the whole gay dont say actress because they might have a secret dong thing millenials are doing
  ive never heard of that either
  wow guys look at this noble gent so learnt and scholarly read a book and you get to be held hostage by cheap psuedo spirituality just like him and every other hipster
  apparently being able to process the idea of respect having different meanings and being performed in different ways is spiritual and somehow constraining you heard it here first folks
    fucking assholes borderline sociopathy to not see why even for your own psyche if nothing else its good to maintain a healthy respect even for the animals you kill      agree with this anon i just dont think these things are contrary i hunt for fun and wouldnt otherwise i still think it is very shitty to mock and mutilate dead animals fun doesnt have to mean shit i dont take seriously it is an enjoyable activity i do because it is enjoyable but i still take the fact that im tracking and killing something very seriously
  fucking millenials
  do you think sheep are made in factories
    lions are dangerous  nah im just being stereotypical im making assumptions im sure if i jump into this lions den theyll greet me and love me for my human guilt    replace lion with nigger and human guilt with white guilt
jesus christ i hate these stories almost as much as i hate the people who make them and repost them  this is defamation just because a dildo was involved the rules are somewhat different now  and is that not a goat or do i need to learn the differences between every species of goat and sheep
    the dildo is honestly the lesser of the issues present which includes humiliating the animal with anything other than a god damn selfie
  american hunter here  its an animal do whatever you want to it    people that believe in the sanctity of the hunt dont live in places where hunting for survival is in living memory
  people that believe in the sanctity of the hunt dont live in places where hunting for survival is in living memory    mate i have spoken to tribesmen in peru and ghana that have built much of their culture around the sanctity of the hunt and respect for their game youre full of shit
its an animal and one that you killed who gives a shit what you do with it after you murdered it anyone who cares that this girl fist fucked it better be a vegan and should also get up in arms over people smiling with their deer take if you eat farm raised poultry or beef they are treated much more inhumanely than this sheep
  mate i have spoken to tribesmen in peru and ghana that have built much of their culture around the sanctity of the hunt  sounds like they were blowing smoke up your ass for touristbucks  i spent a week with a tribe in panama and they said the same shit but you could tell it was bullshit    ive hunted dozens of animals from missouri to texas with friends local to everywhere in between and the only ones that ever made mention of silly shit like that were either im 1/90000 native american larpers or suburbanites  the great depression hit parts of the us hard and many didnt recover until the 50s/60s   my parents grew up poaching to feed their dozen brothers/sisters and the same is true for a large portion of people i know  im telling you at least in america nobody who sees hunting as a utility rather than a sport spends time praying over a cooling hog carcass while its innards stink up the place
    what is this movie with the fellow watching rio bravo
  im not going to say you should give a prayer and spend a tear as thats just not my sentimentality however show some level of professionalism and dont shove dildos up dead animals asses or anything the equivalent of shitting on them  its a reasonable result for people to call these girls a bunch of pricks
hunters really frown upon acts of disgracing/disrespecting the dead animal yes its dead and wont feel it but because its dead you and your family get to eat so give it the respect it deserves however she didnt put it inside the goat hopefully or near its mouth or anything like that she only showed shes a roastie and has no sense of humor so basic female shenanigans
  this
  we dont rape or viciously mutilate dead enemy soldiers we dont do these things because we have humanity we can take human life the most important of all life but we dont destroy further than that out of respect and morality now why the fuck would it be okay to fist animals hunted for good damn reason
  i couldnt give a hoot what this person gets up to their own time
  alaskan here youre a cityslickin larper or youre fishing for yous my mom grew up in a town of some 50 people living off the land from her living memory is where ive learned to show some common decency i grew up in a town of a couple thousand and mentally going down the list of hunters i know none of them would be encouraging this kinda shit even now that i live in the city where people just drive along the highway and shoot shit off the side of the road and call it hunting i still cant imagine most people getting off to degrading dead bodies       there are degrees between hipster bullshit of praying and thot bullshit of fisting you can show some reverence theres no reason to be disrespectful or encourage others to be
  what if its preparation for gettin on your time
why are you mentally stunted autists talking as if she actually anally necroraped the sheep instead of just posing with the rubber fist next to it
  hows the weather in somalia ya groid

  ive known about it since a long time ago and im a 30 year old boomer but its probably because i play games set in fantasy settings and they tend to be pretty progressive    however some quick and dirty googling tells me this first recorded in 13501400 huntress is from the middle english word hunteresse  
  nobody who sees hunting as a utility rather than a sport spends time praying over a cooling hog carcass while its innards stink up the place  thats the whole point you inbred mother fucker you respect it because it feeds you you dont worship it you dont toy with it you eat it and you are grateful hippie ceremonies sociopathic games and roastie jokes are the same level of wasteful
who the fuck travels to england to hunt
  im sorry but if youre saying no one who hunts for utility in the us wouldnt thank god for a big buck or hog youre an idiot
i dont normally like reality shows but i am drawn to the idea of the battle of the sexes are there any good reality shows that do this without some eventual integration    im watching season 2 of the island with bear grylls right now because they have one island of men and one of women i recently watched survivor one world but was less interested because it was more about obstacle course type challenges than of surviving and even with that they got integrated halfway through    are there other shows survival or not that show the differences between the genders
i think real life is a pretty good show just bring some random woman and some random man out into the wild pretty sure both of them will be bitching non stop and will die really quick
as a thought experiment how would you have a fun and safe time with the least amount of stuff i came up with this packing list     1 raincoat   2 wool shirt   3 linen trousers   4 leather or rubber boots   5 gaiters   7 poncho quilt    8 mittensox   9 bivy backpack   10 umbrella   11 mat torso insulation  rain kilt   12 cook pot with stretch silicon lid as bottle   13 spoon   14 toothbrush   15 tetrapak water bladder   16 bug net as a neck toque   17 phone lantern map   18 compass   19 map   20 red light for night hiking   21 headphones / earplugs   22 medkit   23 alchohol stove   24 alchohol pouch   25 lighters  26 razor blade or knife    any ideas for packing less
actually ive decided this is a stupid idea for a thread apologies
  is a gaiter one of those neck warmer things ive been considering getting oneare they any good
  id probably go for hammock  tarp if i was going minimal    cook set  alcohol stove  gps   rain jacket  down jacket  hammock  tarp  sleeping bag  backpack  lighter  ferro rod  metal single walled bottle  food  gloves  shemagh    for an overnighter itd be pretty comfy light and minimal imo    food  shelter  water  heat
    i never have to sleep in the woods the longest time i am out there is from morning until its dark and i have learned that every pound of stock i bring end up weighting almost 10 times as much at the end of the day when i am coming back and it can get annoying since i always bring back stuff like plants/minerals/moss/some wood etc     i can fast for a day no problem and to do this once in a while is good i go to the bathroom and hydrate myself correctly before i leave solar cream on i get my big knife that i use to ply or cut and bascially thats it i used to bring a big trappers basket but its sort of not really ergonomic  too heavy for random trip where i dont know what to expect i prefer to use empty ice chest bags taht i can fold
  this is considered minimal  boots  knife  canteen  all food and clothing on site procural
  life saver
  i fail to see how a list that big can be considered minimalist
  gaiters are pic related  the general idea is to stop getting shit inside your boots and stop the bottom of your trousers billowing out and getting snagged or fraying
shirt  pants  socks  underwear  shoes  blanket  matches  pot  metal cup  metal spoon  water bottle  food  rope  stuff shit into the rolled up blanket tie with rope sling rope over the shoulder  use fir branches for sleeping  obviously only works when its warm
      good luck sleeping on a norwegian hill what are you going to do spend 4 hours collecting and drying out moss to make a bed that instantly gets soaked by clouds
  this would be for like 4050f nights and 70f days no special circumstances like poisonous creatures nofires zones ect obviously  muh knife is all i need  might be true but this list is what id bring to be /out/ while keeping it simple    1 plashpalatka rain/shelter  2 zlite pad cut down a little  3 surplus wool blanket  4 reflective blanket     5 single wall wide mouth bottle  6 spoon  7 3 knife    8 wool pants  9 tshirt i like cotton doubles as bandana if needed  10 wool shirt  11 neck warmer/hood thing  12 2 pair socks one extra thick for sleeping  13 boots    14 map  15 compass  16 medkit  17 phone keep it off / airplane mode for pictures  18 toothbursh  19 lighter  20 backup firestarter    if you go during sumer you can get most of your shit done during daylight no need for a headlamp a well made fire will provide light warmth cooking water purification i like to make the hudson pack blanket roll for light trips history is a good source of minimalist hiking tips
  these look handy for going off the trail
  zlite pad cut down a little  how do you like the zlite anon i have a nemo tensor 20r which has been great it weighs 13oz is warm even on snow rolls up into 1l nalgene size but you have to blow it up which allwas concerns me should i try the z
ctrlf  altoids  phrase not found  mfw
  the z lite is the concertina ccf mat i cut mine down to six panels which is just long enough to cover shoulder to hip you can cut down the inflatable mats but its tricky and they are expensive thermarest already make a short version of their inflatable mattress though
  wtf lad who would willingly go to nrway
  ive owned/used a few inflatables and theyre comfy and warm but i made the switch because having a ccf pad is really useful snow/rain have a dry place to sit windy use it as a windbreak while cooking
still waiting for minimalism lads
  mostly good in wintertime you dont get snow down your boots  supposed to do the same in warm weather with mud but i never find them that useful for the wet
  its actually pretty beautiful if you can handle the cold so i guess most people on here would like it
  it was a joke la would give a finger to fuck some qt in a tent on top of a fjord
  10 umbrella  what a faggot  26 razor blade  oh my god
  alright i have been camping a few times in most seasons early winter included close to freezing    here is the minimalist approach  get a knife get a hatchet also dont fuck up your knife bring some cordage a fire kit matches lighter maybe a rod get a wool cloak real medieval wool cloak it keeps you warm even when wet the embers dont burn it out and protects you from the elements acts as a blanket you can pull it in or open it up when sitting at the fire get a steel cup or canteen or a pot you absolutely need to be able to cook it makes a world of difference bring plenty of food and water we are talking about 1 pounds of food and 5 pounds of water per day at least twice that if you want comfy you can bring a tarp its probably gonna help with the rain at one point they are extremely useful
  also you dont really need utensils i found you can make a makeshift eating implement out of twigs and your knife you dont need a spoon just slurp from your canteen and use chopsticks you can make small skewers to use instead of fork for stuff i love to roast bacon when im camping its the main thing really bring nice bacon and roast it on coal use the skewers and your knife to eat you can bring a spork there is no harm in it but its not essential    find ways to improvise for example after you made your rain shelter make a bench for yourself from what you find make a wooden slab/plate for yourself doesnt have to be fancy at all jut a clean cut surface to put food on or maybe you can find a flat rock and clean it up in the fire
  one more trick if you clean up a branch and bring flour and salt salt is very important btw you can make some fresh bread over the fire after you made the dough with water and salt and flour your can wrap it on the branch and cook it over the fire unwashed eggs also keep very well in cold for several weeks you can have a nice bacon and eggs or cooked eggs with your fresh bread
  he doesnt know the untold joys of having an umbrella in a downpour  he cant be content with the most basic cutting tool  razor blades can cut packaging cordage make tinder shavings shave cut toenails remove splinters skin small game clean gear etc i can snap wood with my hands and with lever force on rocks and trees what else do i need a larp knife for
  you are retarded sorry
  this
    not him but of course a knife is better but sometimes the point of minimalism is to challenge yourself getting by with just a razor blade is elitetier pushing your limits and seeing just how resourceful you are is half the fun of being /out/ at least for me anyway
  elitetier  cancerous attitude but you do you
  hard to be that minimal when you dont live in florida
  the virgin ad hominem vs the chad rational explanation
  if you bring an umbrella instead of a poncho/raincoat and a razor blade instead of a knife you are a retard sorry
  fuck you im stuck here
  ops item number one raincoat
  youre not world is your oyster
find where a bear is hibernating kill it skin it smoke the meat set aside the fat take over the hibernation hole build out of it venture out find woman take woman make children grow tribe
okay /out/ i reported someone i know personally out of spite i have proof that this person illegally took 2 deer via spolight bait and bow without having proper licensing for hunting inside a deer reduction zone in indiana whats the chance that this asshole gets caught and what will happen
  bootlickers get the rope
  100 with proof if by proof you mean actual proof and not just you saying so
  no one but you fucking cares
  i have pictures of the carcasses texts that are admitting what he has done is illegal and that he doesnt care because i can just tell them whatever
  no one but you cares  oh but the revenue thatll be generated if this asshole is caught and fined will make the officers and the asshole himself care
  how likely will he find out you ratted him out and will he come after you was it worth it was he also maybe dumb enough to try to get those deer illegally taxidermed or processed by a professional you might have witnesses then if they didnt already contact authorities themselves or were faggot buddies of his who processed the deer anyway
good poachers are thieves
  not likely to come after me i honestly dont care if he finds out because he thinks somehow he is invincible and above the law and he claims to be such an expert he had his father butcher the game but has 2 hides and 2 gut piles still rotting behind his garage
  also totally worth it if you knew this person you would do the same also off subject this idiot thinks slavic countries are the best since his parents have immigrated from slavic countries and they said things were totally fine under communism not that this bothers me because they were indoctrinated as is he but it just adds to the shitpile of a hunter this person is
  lastly to add flame to the fire he admitted to me in a text that he had shot the deer on his property sent me identifying photos in front of a tree and told me he shot from his window with the aid of a spotlight
      is this one of your faggot buddies you just got tired of whats the matter cleetus he sold you some cut meth if seriously he thinks he is above the law he will come after you he will be dumb enough to get caught with your gutpile in his backyard but youll be damn dead
  not a friend and never has been although the meth comment is flattering i surely dont smoke cut meth only the purest this kid is no killer he was threatening to off himself because he got beat up by a kid with a fucked up hip and leg he has some problems overly cocky and above everything but when he gets beat up or women deny him anything he turns into a pussy especially when le is envolved
  on his property    you done fucked up if it was on private property theres fuck all you can do about it and state hunting laws and seasons dont even apply
  op is a faggot    legit meme
  private property is still regulated by state hunting laws in indiana you still have to follow season dates and regulations only real difference is you can hunt with big boy rifle calibers if youre out of city limits
  op is a faggot  yeah pretty easy to spot poachers alike huh
  unless your land is registered as a profitable farm theres fuck all you can do about avoiding hunting seasons and regulations
  youre either clueless or baiting wild animals are considered property of the state and no matter whose property they are on you have to abide by state and federal regulations when you hunt / kill them    here in tx where there isnt much public land to hunt on the vast majority of hunting takes place on private property game wardens here are allowed to trespass on private property with no warning and no need for a search warrant to catch people engaged in illegal hunting activities on private property     the only way you can kill these animals without needing to adhere to hunting regulations / seasons is if you have a high fence game ranch with a deer population that came from captive nonwild breeding stock if wild deer can enter / exit your property then you have to abide by all the hunting regulations  laws youre not even allowed to hunt wild hogs a destructive nonnative invasive species on private property without a hunting license unless its a high fence environment
  the local game warden here said that over half of the people he busts for illegally harvesting deer now comes from people forwarding text messages emails or facebook posts to him if you turn the shitbag in to the game warden with the texts as evidence then theres a pretty high likelihood that hell be ticketed
interesting fact  30 years ago men did not rat on one another like little bitches  poaching is a pretty fucking disgusting crime but snitching on someone in your circle of friends shows a huge character flaw   i blame the socialist values pop culture has endorsed    men no longer understand how to act like men
  poaching is a pretty fucking disgusting crime    not really 30 years ago most everyone did it now theres jail terms for it instead of only fines it is management for tourism not for environment
  i know a guy that shoots deer in season out of season on other peoples land from the road etc just to kill them he doesnt take any of the meat and most of the time he doesnt even take any of the antlers unless its a big buck he just leaves them there for the scavengers he kills 1520 deer a year usually hes like 60 something years old and has done this his whole life     theres another younger guy in my town mid20s who has been arrested / ticketed over 50 times for trespassing and poaching hes permanently barred from ever getting a hunting license in tx ever again but he goes out every weekend and trespasses on the old shut down coal stripmine land like 20k acres with a rifle and a spotlight and kills any animal he sees my friends dad is in charge of land sales and reclamation / mitigation out there one of only 3 people on the site anymore and hes the one the game warden calls when they catch the kid out there and asks if the company wants to press charges of course he presses charges but the kid either just gets a ticket or spends like a week in the county lockup at most before hes out and doing the same shit again theyve caught the kid on the mining companys land 6 or 7 times this year alone and he poaches along all the county roads on that end of the county    sure the average poacher might not kill many more animals than a lawful hunter but a few bad ones can kill more animals than dozens of hunters who follow the law
  at that point they arnt even poachers they are borderline serial killers who use animals to subdue their urges they need to be culled from society
  this    those people need counseling and jail time theres some pretty fucked up shit going on there
    the worst part about the older guy is that he has a lot of money goes on african safaris every couple of years has like 2 deer leases instate goes on multiple hunting trips every year to colorado kansas and montana etc its not like has nowhere to go hunting or doesnt have any opportunity to do so during hunting season hes been retired for 56 years and thats all he really does with his time and money but he still keeps a rifle in his pickup truck and shoots any deer he sees from the side of the road if no ones around
    thats quite an imagination you have there anon you should be a writer
  poachers deserve everything coming to them this is one situation where property forfeiture is merited
  believe what you want i actually shot my first deer a doe sitting in a stand with the older guy when i was like 9 years old he was on the same deer lease with my buddys dad out in west texas ive known him all my life somehow the guy has only been busted for poaching once in his life he had his hunting license revoked for a year or two
  hearsay is evidence  lolno
  its all the extra little details that expose the pathological liar its the finely woven story  this skill is forged over a lifetime of bullshitting and tempered by the pain if being exposed for his tall tales as a child
  screenshots  gutpiles  blood trail  but yeah hearsay
im personally friends with several game wardens hell my old man was one for 30 years before retiring most have some kind of compassion if you are legit poor and need meat on the table some will turn a blind eye to it the real assholes are the ones shooting at night and killing more then tags allow ive even heard of a few pubs buying it from these fools one day f the crazyist things ive heard of is them setting up shark fishing hooks in apples hanging from a tree    then you get the ones that just kill for fun and or are too lazy to drag the meat from the woods if it doesnt land on the logging road they leave it it seems to be an issue with some native hunters and theres fuck all the law can do about it they scream racism and thats that this is a topic i could go on and on about
  definetly not poor things have been handed to this kid all his life vehicles money equipment and that kind of thing is why he thinks hes above everything because he can turn to his parents for shelter but if or when he gets caught theres nothing that they can do because this isnt a soviet slavic shithole and you cant give police 100 to fuck off
  sounds like you need to go to the jelly school anon
  gutpiles and blood trails are evidence a screenshot and statements made in a whatsapp conversation are hearsay
  i hope someone offs you one day for being a filthy bluecocksucking snitch  actually the worst type of friend
  you are wrong
  legitimately this op if you where not such a spineless bitch maybe you could fight him if you had an issue with it like a respectable male human you sub basic bitch
  turn in a poacher
  nigga the court get a warrant for the messages directly from whatsapp they have cause from op
  fight him   no longer have legal high ground    now a felon   yeah okay
  honestly as a biologist its a fucking deer theyre practically pests at this point shoot away
  this is how beta males rationalize
who cares   deer cause too many auto accidents just let him kill them   there are more deer now in north america then there were 300 year ago
  honestly op go kill yourself bro first off you are respecting and upholding an unconstitutional law when you arent even being asked to second you are ratting out your fellow man for what he didnt do anything morally wrong fuck you faggot this set me off
  thou shall not steal
  romans 127 exists and yet you are still a faggot fuck off deer suck op is a rat bastard etc
its not ratting out if the other fuckhead is a fucking rat and he very clearly isnt that great of a friend otherwise you wouldnt even consider to rat his ass
unless the person who did this is a complete douche then dont report him  / its wrong but mind ya own business
  okay /out/ i reported someone i know personally out of spite  usually you get a reward  i have proof that this person illegally took 2 deer via spolight bait and bow without having proper licensing for hunting inside a deer reduction zone   he knows you have that proof  in indiana whats the chance that this asshole gets caught   depends if he has evidence of a crime in his house and/or if youre willing to provide evidence/testify against him  and what will happen  hell get a year in jail and 10k in fines youll be hunted down and killed with spotlights bait and bow
youre that fucking customer that complains because an employee didnt say hi loud enough when he passed by     nobody fucking cares
  whatsapp conversations are hearsay look up what hearsay means even a photograph taken in a nonprofessional capacity is hearsay op will need to testify in court for it to be admissible as evidence
  at this point they probably dont need ops testimony or any of the conversations or photos    an anonymous tip is probably sufficient to get a warrant to collect dna evidence and compare it to the poachers hunting licenses for the past 10 years along with the records of any butcher he claims to use or his uncle cletus freezer if he pretends the meat was a gift    they take poaching pretty serious
help me choose left or right relative sizes accurate right is french trade axe left is british trade axe    french looks quirkier but the simplicity of the british one also calls to me both are pretty accurate tomahawk replicas
  i think the left one has a better blade edge position relative to the handle
  the right will will be more useful in the long run because the beard is longer and you can get your hand further up to do more detailed work with it
  id go with the brit hawk if i were you on account of the angle of the blade any pic of the head profiles
what are some other tomahawks or hatchets you guys recommend for throwing im very good but looking to get better hoping to get a few decent ones compared to the 10 ones i have now

pipes are for fags smoke cigars like you have some self respect     muh frog morton
  such a great post
comfy ground
  lawl dont be mad because you have no class manboy
can you spot my hammock
love this place even more when the weather turns and less chance if people
  how do you like that windcap ive only ever seen the preinstalled ones like on mrbrog pipes
smoking  jej    be op   pick aesthetic image  has the definition of a turd  sums up pretty well the average smoker
  cigars are for fags smoke a cigarette if you have even a shred of selfrespect
on the topic of cigs i smoke reds but theyre too sweet anyone have any recs for something that tastes more earthy
  why are you in this thread
guten morgen      i hope its on the hill at 11 oclock      also this i normally smoke outside never had any problems with wind
  i like it well enough wind really needs to be going for it to be worth it buit when on a boat or a dock or something like that its a life saver it does scratch the cake on the inside of the pipe so theres that its also very useful for packing a bowl sticking hte pipe in your pocket and be ready smoke when you get where you need to go cost very little worth having as an option    if you mean here then you right  if youve never had problems with wind you havnt tried smoking outside with enough wind
its weird buying some old peterson estate pipes and seeing how small they are i suppose pipes went the same way as watches and ended up getting bigger as standard thankfully theyre in decent condition under the crust and wont need much more than some white diamond and carnauba applied stems were awful though one looked like it was made of milk chocolate it had oxidised so much
  pics comparison to other pipes interestimg
  ill try to get some pictures together just as some general thoughts on estate pipes for anyone considering them  the are a few things to consider first is avoid anything with a broken or missing stem finding replacement stems is a pain and usually requires a custom job id also consider how much work you want to put into restoring the pipe you can get pretty far with elbow grease and household items but they cant fix chips cracks or holes the best estate pipes are dirty but otherwise undamaged    as an example the first peterson had some nasty charring around the rim deep enough i had to sand it down and restain it the only reason i had leather dye of the right colour is because ive dabbled in pipe making it has other marks and nicks that with enough time i could fix  but this is /out/ not /fa/ i have zero doubts im going to drop this pipe at some point while camping so im not going to obsess     one useful thing to do is to invest in a reaming tool expect a cake in the bowl draught hole and shank thick enough you can spread it on toast some 400 grit sandpaper will finish the bowl and a few dozen pipe cleaners coated in isopropyl alcohol will clean the draught     as a final point id recommend not starting with an estate pipe the only reason i know ive cleaned it properly is because i know what bobs chocolate flake tastes like in a new pipe estate pipes have decades of tobacco oils impregnated into the wood  its really easy to see a bowl that looks clean but makes your tobacco taste like whatever they previous owner smoked for 20 years just buy a missouri meerschaum theyre cheap and can last you years
there is nothing i want more right now than to go watch a sunrise with i never ceases pipe i have my sunday morning plans
  i dont even know what i just typed
just a rainy day in wa
  where do you get tobacco from ever since they passed that stupid law i cant find any actual good tobacco around sucks /
how hard is it to be addicted to nicotine if i smoke out of a pipe once a week will i get addicted
  i go to a tobacconist near pikes place its called market tobacco patch and ounce is 8
  addiction potential depends on the individual not the activity but in short no you wont become a pipe addict
  nwpipesmoker is that you
got a new pipe today  camera doesnt make out the wood grain very well but its very pretty  just about to have my first smoke with it
  getting water on your pipe  yikes
  the youtuber guy stuffthings said he got certain blends through smokingpipescuuum bevause they apparently ship to wa idk about that though but you should check it out and see if the do i know pipesandcigarscumm wont
how does pipe smoking compare to chew/dip is it possible to switch i started dipping instead of smoking because of the convenience but ive always enjoyed the aesthetics of pipes more
  my man its up you to decide i can tell you though that youbwill get far far more nicotine fom chew/dip than pipe when you smoke pipes and cigars you enjoy the flavor the ritual and smoke rather than the buzz i personally went from cigs to dip to vape and then pipes the pipes are much more fulfilling in a ritualistic sense but keep in mind that you are dealing with combustion so moderating is key
  good to know i actually really really enjoy the flavor of natural tobacco and the process of a dip im just worried about pipes not having enough nicotine to keep me going do you have any recommendations for stronger more natural pipe tobacco i have an old pipe my grandpa gave me that his great grandpa gave to him but it needs a new stem before i can use it
how do i get pipe tobacco in a 21 state 18 year old zoomer btw
  wait 3 years until you grow up enough to realize that pipes are for fags
  looks top notch man
  suck my swollen girthy throbbing sopping wet gurgling pipe my dude
  1 go out of state  2 join the military they get exempt in ca  3 just get it through someone else
ordered it yesterday im pretty excited to try it out will keep you updated
tobacco is going to get crazy expensive in my country so ill probably have to quit cigarettes and rollups pipes seem like a good option    what do you think about long stem wizard pipes are they worth getting
  theyre called churchwardens theyre a cool smoke and primarily intended for use while sitting down they arent really suitable for holding in your mouth by clenching as the majority of the weight is far removed from your body which is why i dont go for them if you like how they look though go for it pipes are a tool for consuming tobacco and theres never been a better selection of blends to purchase
  they used to be when pipes were usually made out of clay the long stem would keep your fingers from being burned by grabbing the flaming hot bowl     now with pipes mostly being made out of wood its not as necessary as it used to be they still look great but the length is now just for fashion   and if you like going /out/ its just one more thing to break more easily
  churchwardens provide a cooler smoke with the long stem i much prefer it for getting the most flavor but i also have a pocket pipe for portability
cutting the filter in half helped a lot i mean i need a little smoke
  and fresh tobacco this bag is about a year and a half old open the whole time
  mail it in  duh
  drop it into a ziplock bag with a damp paper towel seal it up and wait a day or two the water should rehydrate the tobacco and bring the flavor back
do you guys get your mouths burnt/tastebuds destroyed    i quit smoking cigarettes for 6 months but would like to have tobacco from time to time thing is idk if its worth it my teeth are getting whiter and i can smell stuff again i also never liked not inhaling and always burnt my tongue whenever i smoked cigars ive never tried a pipe though
  when i started years ago sure  everyone does when they start i mean theres plenty you can do to avoid tonguebite outside of simple practice use a filter use a system pipe use a plib use a churchwarden avoid aromatics and other tobacco with a reputation for burning your mouth the only thing that will stop your teeth colouring is brushing them after smoking which i expect most pipe smokers do anyway since very few smoke more than once or twice a day
    if i was to load up on tins what is the best way for me to keep them fresh for long periods of time
  your best bet is mason jars unopened tins are hit and miss some are great but occasionally you have one whose seal is shitty and you can tell the humidity had been slowly escaping over time safer just to jar them all right away since youll have to do it once you open them anyway
  so many good deals if you like englishes i will say hearth and home black house lived up to the hype and edges out white knight    pic unrelated just wanted to post my favorite pipe
first time trying cap black didnt expect it to be sweet maybe its the tea
  this is an intelligent post from an intelligent man
  why come in to this thread then you boring faggot
  once a week absolutely not 35 times a week maybe depending on the individual you dont get much nicotine from pipes
  irish flake  dunhill royal yacht  a french one called caporal not very common but its what i smoke
  i smoke my churchwarden at home everything else is for travelling parks bars etc
anyone have suggestions for pipe tobacco thats actually easy to smoke and stays lit preferably strong and flavourful ive been smoking for a year and i seldomly get a bowl i can enjoy without excessive relighting
  you must be smoking some cheap cigars or trying way to hard to inhale most quality cigars are packed tight which requires some effort to take in a mouthful of smoke but not so much where you have to put some muscle behind your breath do not inhale cigars wait a bit between each puff you dont want the cigar to over heat     id recommend trying out one of these cigars  alec bradley so far any i especially like prensado  padron no 1 or anniversary series  punch they smell weird but taste good  a fuente grand reserva        can anyone else recommend quality nonamerican tobacco cigars i    i know that they make cigars with pipe tobacco now but ive only seen them with the unflavored tobacco do they make flavored pipe tobacco cigars
fill me in on pipes are they any good  how long can i be huffing and puffing for i heard something about overheating is that an issue  whats a good place to start where can i find a nice pipe that doesnt break the bank in sweden
  i like joya de nicaragua joya red in particular brickhouse and perdomo
  oliva v and san cristobals are about the only cigars i still smoke they are great
  any ribboncut from jfgermaine they cut it down to a fine shag i can pack it as hard as i like and it still burns like a champ but with any tobacco you should be fine if you use less than you think youll smoke packed looser than you think you need        fill me in on pipes are they any good  sure some people smoke for taste some for the exposure to nicotine over a longer period than a cigarette without the cost of a cigar    how long can i be huffing and puffing for i heard something about overheating is that an issue  you can smoke for anything from 10 minutes to 3 hours without intentionally smoking slowly most people will struggle to get a bowl to last that long the size of the bowl and the density of tobacco after youve packed the pipe will determine how long it lasts you can always fill the bowl half way if you fancy overheating happens when you smoke too fast the bowl heats up and becomes uncomfortable to hold and may start burning through if there are holes in the bowl wall but thats honestly quite difficult to do   whats a good place to start where can i find a nice pipe that doesnt break the bank in sweden   missouri meerschaum make corncob pipes theyre good value cheap readily available in most places in europe their quality assurance could be better but youll find no shortage of people that swear by them pick one up and try to find something like orlik golden sliced aromatic blends usually with sweetsounding names will more than likely burn your tongue
  almost forgot to mention the best gauge diameter are the thinner cigars as thick as a normal male thumb fingerthin cigars become hard to draw and thicker ones have less flavor     this is because most of the cigar flavor is in the binder/wrapper think area x2 vs volume x3))) the rest is usually filler tobacco with mild taste         thanks i will check these out
  without excessive relighting  define excessive relights are fine unless youre talking about every couple of minutes for the entire bowl then its not a matter of the particular blend but your packing density tobacco humidity and smoking pace you can get almost all tobaccos to burn well if youre controlling those variables
maybe you lads can give me a bit of help when i get close to the end maybe 3/4ths empty my pipe starts making a crackling noise when i draw in im not puffing heavily on it smoking normally as far as i can tell although i have only been smoking about a month im pretty sure its not the gurgling that people describe that means the tobacco is wet its like a regular campfires crackling what does this mean if anything
  your embers are getting close to the moisture that has collected at the bottom of the bowl and its boiling off perfectly normal and seems to happen more for obvious reasons on more humid tobaccos and youre right its distinctly different from gurgling which is liquid being trapped inside the air passage
is fall objectively the best piping season i think i think so
pipin
  no because its cold and miserable but now that i finally have a house im building a heated woodpaneled smoking room in a shed so ill be able to smoke in the winter and late fall    pic somewhat related going for that style but far more compact
  thanks man
  but the cooler temp makes the smoke more crisp
  that doesnt sound real
  cooler smoke is universally desired lower ambient temp keeps heat down smoother smoke that and fall leaves just look so lovely
  cooler ambient temps affect on the temperature of smoke will be negligible unless your pipe is seven feet long and is paper thin its going to be nearly the same temperature on a 100 degree day as a 20 degree day when it reaches your mouth the pipe itself will insulate the smoke from outside conditions and even if it didnt the time it takes for the smoke to travel from the bowel through the stem and into your mouth wouldnt be enough for any meaningful cooling to occur smoking has more fuddlore than shooting does like people that think a green flame is cooler and better for smoking than a normal flame all that said fall is still my favorite time to smoke because of the leaves that reason is totally valid
  unless your pipe is seven feet long and is paper thin  a long churchwarden falconstyle pipe with a heatsink all along the metal stem would probably work to cool it especially if you made the stem a little wider to accommodate tiny aluminum baffles inside like a suppressor    it would be a pain in the ass to clean but it would definitely be cool
  itd be best to make those cooling fins hollow too so they act as part of the baffle and the smoke expands into there to cool idunno know though i dont really smoke pipes im a cigar man myself
why are weed pipes not allowed im new to /out/
  radically more popular and would more than likely overwhelm these slow but persistent threads with that said theres a specific relationship between pipesmoking and /out/ in the form of lunting try it a nice pipe of ennerdale in the outdoors is a treat
  weed is by the ridiculously stretched and americanized view of the word a drug a far cry from pipe smoking in spirit no personal problem with either itst just a very different topic    and as far as i cant tell widely there is no recognizable artistry associated with the production of weed pipes or with the smoking of them    plus decades of pipe smoking has made pipe smoking and out a thing just look at george w sears
    thanks for the responses fellas goana pick up a pipe to give me another cool thing to do when i go camping from here on
  the type of pipes used for the two dont really overlap
after restoring the peterson system pipe i bought ive found that small bowls this being the smallest bowl i think is practical really arent forgiving of bad packing technique with big bowls you know you can make up for it by fighting with the ember for 20 minutes but with small bowls that 20 minutes of work is most of the bowl with that said the ability to smoke a bowl of irish flake when all you have is 30 minutes is wonderful sometimes id like a bowl before work but i cant go through an entire bowl of it in my cob country gentleman in less than an hour and i dont want to smoke half of it and then force myself to finish it in the evening when i might prefer something different i dont know about the us but these old peterson pipes are readily available online in the uk and are generally a third of the price of petersons contemporary equivalent 317 shape if anyone has questions about restoring estate pipes ill try to give an answer and provide some of the resources i used
a pipe a lake view and a campfire  does it get better
  gå in i närmsta turkkiosk och köp en pipa kostar vanligtvis 150300kr eller beställ en billig variant via tex nettotobak
  norrbotten här  närmsta sak till en turkkiosk är pizzerian och sist jag var där såg jag inga pipor  tror du att macken kanske skulle ha dem jag vet att de har cigarrer där
  inte en aning gå och kolla det värsta som kan hända är att de inte säljer det och att du får beställa via nätet  ebay har massor av bra pipor för under hundalappen så det är också värt att kika på dock tar det en månad eller två innan du får pipan om det är från kina
    just go to danishpipeshop and order mm gentleman for 150 dkk no need to resort to shitty chinese pipes have some self respect
  i wasnt planning to i bet the chinks would poison me
  one single reason  dude weed lmaooneoneone  potheads are annoying as hell  to be clear nothing wrong with smoking it once in a while its the typical stoner i cant stand
  cigarettes are for fags smoke a hookah if you even have a shred of selfrespect
well my pipe was tasting pretty bad but now it tastes fine didnt do anything starting to feel comfy like im in the hobbit
is this gay or is it as rad as i think it is    they also have a ton of less expensive hobbit pipes
  pretty rad the stem is neat apparently they use beechwood with an internal acrylic passage and endpiece    i just love churchwardens maybe thats why next pipe will be a churchwarden poker or maybe a regular poker that ill make a churchwarden stem for
  what state 20 yo njfag here very lucky to work at a family friends tobacconist ive been smoking pipes since 16 and cigars since 17
  as my grandpappy said   cant trust a gook as far as ya can throw em
  my grandpa was resistance odd cleaning out his attic as he always aluded half jokingly as far as we knew to having a quite sizable stash    when you know your grandpa made damn fucking sure no one would find the thing you are looking for as his life depended on it how the fuck do you find that thing    grandpa had a radiomaker friend though was pipe smoker
this is your gentle reminder that dunhill blends are still scheduled to be axed
  good thing i just got my order from pc 
  i have a good size jar of night cap i was pleased it lived up to the hype it might be my favorite blend
you might not use them but those filters sure do get real dirty
just got 2 ounce can of cornell  diehl billy budd to smoke while /out/ in the mountains its my first cigar tobacco blend and it is really good earthy cool and a really high nicotine content gonna be a comfy winter
any blends you guys recommend as an intro to perique
is this any good i like big bowls and balls
  cd poplar camp is pretty nice
  dunhill elizabethan if you can find it   also escudo uses perique as the thing that distinguishes it from a straight virginia blend that tiny bit of flavorful bitterness in there is the perique
  straight perique is how i did it i could only get through a bowl before i felt like i was gonna die from the nicotine but it tasted delicious and ive loved it since
i just ordered this  it should come by halloween im very excited 197 in depth x 83 in diameter chamber and an attached wind cap as pictured i think itll be a quite fine lunting pipe
  that cap is extremely cool i wonder why theres not more of them about they seem to be overlooked a lot which is a shame since the clipon type have a bad habit of ruining the finish on the rim with the buildup of moisture and tar even peterson didnt bother when they made an outdoor series of pipes which is weird since the uk and irelands biggest import seems to be wind       depends on how you smoke really if you hold it while smoking im sure itll be great but ive been punished with sensitivity for clenching heavy straight pipes for too long so i usually restrict myself to lighter pipes like cobs if i want a straight pipe and a smoke that is longer than an hour these days       also  heres a recommendation for a savoury blend  dunhills aperitif they sell it as an obviously aperitif but it goes well as a morning pipe try as i might i cant get tongue bite from it give it a go before the doors start closing and people start buying tins in bulk
  i usually stick to using them twice all my pipes are army mount so theres no harm detaching and attaching the stem after every second smoke
  i prefeer herbal tobacco
  all tobacco is herbal
  smoked out of a nongmo freerange pipe with a responsiblysourced petroleumfree stem i hope but seriously  what are tobacco alternatives like theres a company called honeyrose that make a few blends here but they cost twice as much the only reason id be interested is because spreadsheet phil is announcing his autumn budget on monday and the bastard is going to increase tobacco duty even further
from a trip later this summer  havent had time to post in 4 months now been occupied in the army
  cute looking doggo
  the only time i really smoke a pipe is when i go /out/ i used to smoke while driving but enough cops pulled me over to investigate that it stopped being worth it my neighborhood smoke shop sells their own blends which are fantastic used to smoke a cheap bracken pipe but got desperate and used it for weed which essentially ruined it now i just smoke missouri meerschaums till they burn in
if i buy 250g box as opposed to 50g tin cant find the blend im looking for in tin size will it keep should i get a little airtight jar or something
  are you into furries or into men
  you should be putting all your tobacco in jars once you open it
  both actually
  if you want it to keep and it isnt in a vacuum sealed tin youll want to jar it glass and airtight if you can if its an english or virginia blend pack it loosely and open it every now and then you want it to age in the jar if its an aromatic pack it tightly and keep it shut  unlike english blends they dont age well the casing and topping protect the tobacco from the environment and age in place of the leaf this means instead of developing taste you end up with a weaker aromatic     also goddamnit spreadsheet phil kept the duty increase and put another 2 on my pipe tobacco i swear to god my christmas bonus is going entirely on tins this year
i have a question for yall  what exactly do you guys see in nicotine highs and why do you choose them over something like alcohol i cant include weed since i havent tried it  to me personally a nicotine high just feels kinda heavy and sorta unpleasant in comparison to alcohol
  you dont smoke a pipe for a nicotine buzz
  i mean yea but you get it anyways
  pipe smokers supposedly smoke for the flavour and aesthetic
  yeah if you weigh like 50 pounds never have i ever gotten a nicotine buzz from pipes or cigars only cigarettes
  i get a sort of calm focus with pipes it only happens if i smoke two or more bowls in a row though which is pretty rare       smoke stronger cigars and more than one in a session or smoke indoors where you can breathe the second hand smoke
  see     also after smoking for a little while you wont get the buzz anymore you quickly build a tolerance to nicotine
  i used to smoke while driving but enough cops pulled me over to investigate that it stopped being worth it   used to smoke a cheap bracken pipe but got desperate and used it for weed  big think
  let me break this down for you chum in case you dont understand   most pipe smokers will smoke cigars most pipe smokers enjoy both cigars and pipes though the experience is different   i prefer pipes because of the variety in terms of flavors where as with cigars if you want the full reach of what you can smoke you will need to be putting down some real moolah   not all of us have a trust fund or live in venezuela
    you want to go for a drier style of tobacco if it is too wet then it wont light or stay lit properly sounds like your brand is either naturally wet or has gotten damp somehow   spread it out on a cookie sheet at a gentle 20 degree heat for 30 minutes that ought to dry it out without spoiling any flavor       cant go wrong with a good bulldog style tobacco pipe made out of briar you might also consider an estate pipe there should be plenty of second handers to buy in sweden and they are easy to clean      overheating is only an issue if you repeatedly pack and smoke         don kikis red bands were a particular favorite of mine when i lived back in na nicaraguan hand rolled but the tobacco is habana similar climate so you were getting an cubanesque cigar without cuban prices     monte christos are nice cuban cigars    avoid quoroms unless youve got an iron lung quorom blacks are only cigar that ive ever had to lie down after smoking because i was light headed very strong    meharis are an indian or java style cigar so smaller quicker smokes but nice if you can only spare the time for a quick drink and smoke     i always recommend paired drinks with your cigar or pipe whiskeys or brandy are a good choice        its definitely the comfiest season for it       nice restoration anon       a beautiful frau prepping dinner for you while you smoke thats about all i could add         get estate pipes if your really not able to afford new upmarket a good pipe is a generational investment and as long as its in good condition and cleaned properly there is no real adverse differences   i restored a gamut of old pipes my favorite one was a beautiful walnut colored briar that ive recently lost on a bus ride  1950s make hadnt been smoked since the 70s at least and was in a right state when i bought it but with the right cleaning was as good as new i paid probably 5 cad 3 to clean
i got a zippo so i could stop buying new lighters but you cant really get the flame to cooperate    and i got the stuff to refill bic lighters watched the video but its a little difficult
  he gets a christmas bonus  i am so goddamned jealous of you       what are tobacco alternatives like  its been awhile for me but the last time i tried it the distinct impression i got was of it not being worth the time effort or money i spent on it i threw it away after two bowls and i hadnt even smoked real tobacco at the time
anyway to be sure the mouth part doesnt touch anything when i set it down i have a little stand but
  for what purpose
  i smoked sage and other stuff before i came of age its really not bad
when you clean your pipe real good and now it hits too good
  coming back under robert mcconnell under slightly different names
  i know a few who do their go to blends are 5 brothers ojk and haunted bookshop look at matches860 dude does it for the nic
  close  theyre match blends
  i have had no issues using pic related even manage it in light winds
so i want to get a pipe but i dont want to get cancer  why do yall still smoke even though smoking causes the big c mostly looking for someone to justify my purchase of another corncob and tin so i can start it up again
  even though smoking causes the big c  when done frequently over decades cancer risk with pipes is negligible over baseline population
  citation needed
  from what ive read kk are producing the blends under the mcconell line same recipe different leaf source since its another company there might be some difference but dunhill was basically just an old brand name anyhow dunhill has not produced them proper for a while murrays took over after dunhill and then went away and then got revived buy standard lane which are going away now too
does posting itt come with a fedora
  i second this question
  there are tons of glass artisans for weed pipes idk where the fuck you got the idea that stoners were just huffing smoke from tin cans   breaking the rule just to post pic related
  it was hitting too good starting to calm down now got some gook back in it
  if it does they forgot to give me mine     i feel cheated and demand satisfaction
  citation given    from the us surgeon generals famous 1964 report on the health effects of smoking yes that one    page 86 93 on pdf file   for current pipe smokers table 5 men smoking less than 10 pipefuls per day have death rates very close to those of nonsmokers   for heavy pipe smokers 10 or more per day two studies show increases of 15 and 12 per cent in death rates but the other two studies show little or no increase   the overall mortality ratio of 105 does not differ statistically from unity     note at bottom of the page  statistical significance throughout this report refers to the 5 percent level un less otherwise specified in testing whether an observed mortality ratio of smokers relative to nonsmokers is greater than unity the probability is calculated that a ratio as large as or larger than the observed ratio would occur by chance if the smokers and nonsmokers were drawn from two populations having the same death rate if this probability is less than 005 5 percent the observed increase in the death rate of smokers relative to nonsmokers is said to be statistically significant at the 5 percent level the results of significance tests will be quoted only for mortality ratios in which the number of deaths raises a doubt as to whether the difference from unity could be due to sampling errors    tldrthere is more variation in mortality rates between randomly assembled groups of people than there is between groups of exclusive pipe smokers and nonsmokers   cdcs words not mine
  its a convoluted situation to be sure the blends were made by dunhill then murray and now stg/orlik kk have distributed those blends but have never made them its not entirely clear what recipe kk are using they havent received the rights from bat hence the names and stg/orlik have no reason to hand out their recipes which are likely the only ones that can be used in 2018  what do you do when the recipe calls for 20 syrian latakia particularly not when stg have an interest in continuing to produce their most popular pipe blends so the best guess would be that theyve found either murrays or dunhills original recipes and reworked them to use available leaves    ill have to try their equivalent of aperitif im sure ill like it but im not sure itll be the same theres a lot that goes into a blend that isnt tobacco kp found that out when they were remaking old gowrie  you can get the same leaves but youll never get the same water environment and staff cracking blend though
  im not really a fan of them but do your thing anon i am a corn cob man myself
  apertiff durbar and elizabethan were the only blends worth a flip to me
oh manly men a young buck is in need of advice i am interested in getting a pipe but i am very much not interested in the negatives that come with smoking thats mostly why i havent taken up cigarettes should i be more or less worried about that aspect of smoking when it comes to pipes
  as a pipe smoker i would honestly say dont start if you are a cigerette smoker sure switch but this might sound conspiratorial but atleast for europe belive me it wont take long for them to deny you medial attention if you were ever a smoker    smoking is carcenogenic sitting around a campfire is carcenogenic if you sit around a campfire roughly as much as you smoke there should medically be no issue
  i am in the us i dont have to worry about anything but my pcp having a hissy fit and i understand that since its not already a habit for me i shouldnt start but going from what youve just said there shouldnt be any problem with me smoking a pipe once a week on a hike then
  see    you have nothing to worry about pipe smokers are statistically indistinguishable from nonsmokers
oh fug whats up /out/ seekay poster here i started smoking pipes when i was 16 because i was a goddamned edgelord but its been years since i broke them out    my collection peaked at around 12 or so during my brief college stint but i often gave them away  my core group has remained two mario grandis and a corinzio    is mg still around    also is cornell and diehl still a thing they were making waves back in 20082012 billy budd was my favorite for a long while
    also harkening back to that time period what ever happened to pipefriendchs and all the other pipe presenters on youtube
    billy budd used to be my favorite if they still make havana daydream i always considered it a very similar blend just slightly mellower
every pipe tobacco i have ever tried just burns my mouth really bad do i just have shitty tobacco or is this normal i smoke cigarettes and cigars and have never had that happen
  likely smoking too fast or tobacco is too humid
  thats called tongue bite and its a small steam burn caused by steam going up the mouthpiece and condensing on your tongue   youre probably either smoking too fast packing your tobacco too tightly have pipe tobacco that is too wet or some combination of the three fill your pipe looser than you think you should and smoke it slower than you think you ought to   also test your tobaccos moisture by pinching it if it feels at all damp itsbtoo wet if it crumbles its too dry and if it is dry but springs back its just about right
  when folk say smoke slower does that mean put the stem to your mouth less often or when you inhale do it slowly does slowly also mean deeply i am never sure if i am taking in too much or too little
  puff less frequently depth and duration doesnt matter as much
  both   take puffs less often and draw in more lightly when you do   if you just keep sucking at the pipe repeatedly theres no time for the moisture at the bottom of the pipe to escape any other way than up the stem and into your mouth letting the pipe rest a little between puffs will give any moisture that builds up time to evaporate away up through the bowl and away from your mouth this is also why packing more loosely is important it allows the moisture to escape before it builds up and turns into tongue bite or foul tasting condensation     likewise with your draw youre not sucking a milkshake through a straw more like sipping a glass of water the slower and easier you go the better the flavors and the better experience you will have
  i am very grateful thank you
bikingpiping comfy af in fall
is a churchwarden good for a first time smoker
  if youre planning to walk around with it no if youre going to be sitting and smoking sure churchwardens are great
im thinking about switching from the hand made pipe i use now to hand rolled cigarettes in order to save pack weight can anyone recommend cigarette papers im thinking elements or juicy jays but those boat really bad
  did you make it out of pic related    a briar pipe weighs fuck all are you serious
  id go with a standard sized pipe to start     first off theyre going to be cheaper the mm cob pipe in the op is 7 while a churchwarden is most not even the cheap ones are going to cost about 20 or more     second churchwardens came about before the use of briar when pipes were mostly clay and the long stem kept your fingers away from the flaming hot bowl  with briar now on the scene you dont need a pipe to be that long wood is a much better insulator than fired clay so your fingers arent burnt when you grab a hot pipe even by the bowl   third churchwardens are too long to really be good for /out/ stuff long stems are fragile and ceramic is not very tolerant of being bounced around day after day which is why their realm was confined to places where people were mostly stationary like houses taverns and wardenhouses in places like churchyards and prisons when people were really going to be doing /out/ things with their pipes they wanted them either short and light so they could go into a pocket without breaking easily replaceable or both so reedstemmed clay pipes which break down easily and the thing most likely to break is found growing wild alongside every river and creek on three continents are the most common types of the prebriar eras /out/ pipes the clay bowls were small compact easy to make and cheap while the reed for the stem was basically free
  in my experience those are terrible papers ive had positive experience with job 1 1/4s i just prefer 1 1/4s in general as theyre longer raw or just plain zig zags i dont smoke pot anymore but they all work really well for tobacco too if you can stand the company that owns raw they burn really slow and evenly and theyre all natural hemp paper
just picked up a polished antique nimrod from ebay i love it its great
  just take a real slight hit if i take a big one it burns my mouth doesnt take much
  also too clean a pipe seems to burn more and maybe using alcohol to clean it
  but it cleans it so good idk what else you could use fellas
  i will check it out i think i read some things about it on the internet too thanks for the tip
  i posted earlier that i just bought some billy budd so yeah theyre still a thing
what are some interesting quirky weird or must try tobaccos
  ive been meaning to try a lakeland blend at some point but i keep forgetting to look for some people seem to either love them or hate them the biggest criticism seems to be that they smell and taste like soap and/or your grandmothers handkerchiefs
smoked 2 full flakes of peterson irish flake in my meerschaum really knocked me out lol kick back at the campfire
  sutliffs mixture 79 is one   its like the american version of a lakeland very herbal and supposedly hugh hefners favorite blend when he smoked   to get the best out of it you need to smoke it slow and definitely try it in a different pipe than your favorite until youre sure you like it it can ghost a pipe like nobodys business
just picked these up today both of them are prettt nice the irish oak is quite mild and the erinmore flake reminds me of a university flake with less plumb
  did you like the university flake im going to buy a new tin of tobacco tomorrow a samuel gawith or a peterson dont know which one yet any recommendations pretty new to pipesmoking ive had kentucky bird and dunhill nightcap already and liked the dunhill best
    i just picked it back up after a few years hiatus i remember liking university flake but i would always have mostly latakia blends in my rotation and would only go for other varieties here and there    if youre interested in university flake you might try the erinmore first uf was quite syrupy per my memory and was a bit of a finicky smoke the ef has very similar qualities but with thewelldankness i suppose dialed back    nightcap was among my favorites and its sad to see it going again i also loved billy budd and habana daydream from cd and the whole frog series from mcclelland but thats apparently gone now too
  1792 flake from sg is one hell of a dark flake and a personal favourite of mine but if you want something lighter and more allday squadron leader is a solid but mild english    on the peterson side i like sherlock holmes it tastes like it smells and it smells like an aircured virginia tobacco barn
always thoughts tying it together with cord was kinda odd but i have never tried it myself   mors will die within soon  makes me sad but he lived a life full of adventure
  hallo mein deutscher outdoorfreund ich rauche auch ziemlich gerne den early morning pipe kannst du mir zufällig gute literatur zur jagd empfehlen sowas wie ferdinand von raesfeldt
    tobacconist here didnt have what i was looking for so i picked a dunhill mixture 965 instead
    go with virginia/perique blends natural flavor and plenty of nicotine     briar fox and blockade runner by cornell and diehl are favorites of mine
  cigars all taste like the same shit   you end up having to pay 60 dollars for one good quality cigar which is almost always a letdown meanwhile you can buy the best pipe tobacco for like 12 bucks and you can get 20 bowls from one tin
  dry your tobacco out before you smoke it if youre having relighting issues
  kendal flake is probably my favorite lakeland blend
  reliable choice im stocking up hella hard on emp nightcap and 965 since dunhill is closing shop for its pipe tobacco
someone give me the 3 best tobaccos to start with that i can buy at a local store thanks
    1 one of the following   dunhill early morning pipe  dunhill my mixture 965  dunhill nightcap    2 some aeromatic just ask to smell their jars of whatever you think will smell nice    3 a virginia blend   3 nuns is a good one if they have it       id actually advise against going aeromatics because all the sugar can make it harder for newbies to start with same with any oriental blends
  i have a few cheap aeromatics my uncle gave me disgusting i prefer the taste of tobacco   what do you think of frog morton my uncle swears by the stuff that and prince albert but hes an old guy ya know
    erinmore flake and university flake are both great semi aromatics made with quality tobacco     dunhill early morning pipe is a very good choice too its a light english blend that you can sip on without getting a hard nic hit      i feel that nightcap would be too strong for a beginner
    great series of tobaccos but then again everything mcclelland made was top notch i think my favorite frog morton was on the town nothing tasted like it and nothing can even compare to it too bad they went out of business i wish they would just sell their recipes to someone else 
  there are some really good aromatics out there shouldnt dismiss them all
    hes right  dont be quick to dismiss aromatics true the american style of heavily cased cavendish isnt everyones taste but a solid british aromatic like ennerdale is a completely different ballgame its a typically unsourced but accepted claim that british law prevented blenders using artificial flavouring in their blends so in response blenders instead used natural flavourings that were available at the time youre talking rosewater and other floral additives rum whisky liquorice and tonquin ennerdale lakeland/rose/geranium 1792 tonquin and navy flake rum are primary examples of historical english aromatics these days there are no such restrictions and the primary differentiator between american and british aromatics is the presence of cavendish with british blends generally being a mix of virginia and burley with a top coat of something rather than a cavendish blend     with that said theres nothing stopping any side of the atlantic making either type we have a great lane 1q knockoff called american delite that gh make
anyone want to trade with me  i recently got 2 tins and 5 pouches of jf germains special latakia flake and i wouldnt mind trading one 
im pretty impressed with this irish oak so far im especially appreciative of how forgiving it is when it comes to tongue bite and gurgling i smoked cigarettes for the last three years and only quit about 7 months ago so coming back to pipes and remembering to slow things down has been difficult    even the erinmore flake is pretty good in those regards it takes quite well to the sort of circular breathing techniques i used to use i for flakes
  i think i wouldve liked to try frog morton but since they closed down i dont think ill ever get the chance
  cavendish isnt a tobacco but rather a process by which tobacco is steamed to become more neutrally flavored and amenable to taking outside flavors both virginia and burley can be cavendished     nowadays the primary difference between american and british aromatics is the base tobacco that is cavendished and used for the blend american blends are primarily burleybased whereas british aromatics tend to be virginiabased
  are there any blends that use nonflavored cavendish ive only ever tried cased cavendishes but id like to see the natural product i want to try growing tobacco next year and im curious if its worth cavendishing some of it seems like a fairly simple process
  there are some black cavendishes around which are minimally flavored usually with just sugar but thats probably as close as youre going to get
  cheap cigars are fine but paying a whole lot for a dog turd rolled up in a tobacco leaf is just wasteful
  been thinking about stocking up too but i dont have a lot of money that i can miss so a 50gr tin of each will cost me like 50 euros already not sure how much id like to spend on it
  dunhill nightcap or any good stanky oriental around a fire right at dusk
  buy from the states and tell that to write that its not tobacco on the shipping form
  4noggins sells internationally cant speak for europe but they know how to send stuff to leafland without arousing suspicion i very much enjoy ordering filter accessories from them
  thats a shit lighter u got there brah
ctflf snus  0 results  desu im planning to switch back to cigars and pipes since its too easy to stay buzzed all day with snus even if i love it
  gorgeous pipe anon well done
  06 is my city
stupid question from a pipe smoker beginner what do you think of an oom paul or whatever you call where you live are they good for /out/ings
  its a pipe shape pick the one you like the best and go for it it makes virtually no difference the only thing to note is that if you like to clench bent pipes like an oom paul bring the center of mass closer to your face so theres less tension on the jaw clenching a straight pipe takes slightly more effort but ultimately the biggest deciding factor for most people is aesthetics if you like the shape go for it
bikin n pipin   its getting a bit nippy lads
  you probably smoking too much try something with less nicotine its best when you dont even know youre affected by n you just feel slightly calm and focused for no reason
  i think the shape is cool but i wouldnt buy one i smoke out of the wind and hold my pipe in my mouth as a result anything that hangs so close to the jaw ends up getting smoke right up in my face and into my eyes for this reason i stick to half bents ie peterson 999 or full bents light enough i can clench it forward instead of letting it hang
  love it i had a nice rusticated comoy one but sadly i lost it while /out/ somehow
  this was it its most likely rotting on the forest floor but i hope someone found it and took it home
    definitely keeping my eyes open for a new one been looking at the volkan ones but i havnt gone to look at them in person yet
  thats one thicc boi
  man this pic is just what i have in mind for my /out/ings even the pinewoods
  cant remember if that trip was before or after new years 1718 might be fun recreating the pic
  smoke sparingly and dont inhale
  i used to smoke a pipe all the time but ive switched to cigars because of less attention needed to smoke them but i still enjoy a bowl every now and then
  frog morton is god tier cigar nigger
  frog morton  im very curious now
  maybe if i try with one of these 
  how do you smoke if in the run they are so wet i cant even light them and when i dry them enough for them to light one folded/rolled flake makes many big strands that are way too loose in the bowl to smoke reliably
  make sure you get a pipe with filters and use them that might help
  runtin
  could always dry it to the appropriate level rub it out and pack normally ive found i have more control when i do this to flakes rather than folding and stuffing
  brush your teeth use alcohol free mouthwash use balsa or charcoal filters savinelli already had the eu validate that their filters remove 70 of tar drink something nonalcoholic while smoking stop smoking when you get tongue bite or have any other oral issues dont smoke every day and dont inhale stuff you potentially already do    if you do all that youll reduce your risk below that of any study on oral cancer and pipe smoking that exists today since they all assume daily smoking without filters and dont consider proactive oral care
    sadly out of production now
  in flake form they are harder to light than normal to really smoke them right you need to rub the flakes out put half a flake into your hand and rub it between your palms until it is broken up and stringy then put into your pipe and light up should light and smoke like a charm
  thats a vauen gandalf from their lotr line of pipes and tobaccos    overpriced hipster shit imo
    never really fell too much in love with churchwardens im more of clenching man
  i can not wait to get a new pipe go out and to try to recreate this set
  roll your own not difficult just takes practice then you can smoke bali shag or drum which has the taste you seem to be asking for maybe see if you like american spirits
  a plowpoint tarp shelter is a great configuration for one man shelter just make sure to angle it so you can atleast comfortably sit up inside how big is your tarp
  its a 3x3mt tarp i won its enough for a 2mt guy actually this is the first time i intend to go out in this style i already had sleep in cheap dome tents when i go fishing or just out but now i want really go deep /out/     inb4 someone say what a noob  yes maybe im a big noob but i want to learn and change it thats why i ask for help
  oh and thanks for the ideas i really thinking to use this style of shelter
  it is the bowl never gets hot and it sits perfectly the average smoke time is about an hour
    a 3x3 is perfect actually the tarp you see in the pic is 290 x 248 m which was an ass because it was asymmetrical i have since upgraded to a 3x3m myself go on a day with good weather to get your feet going     finding level ground is crucial you will wake up dreading life if not  having some ground protection is nice in the pic its just a ripped up trash bag  tie one corner to the tree first at slightly below or at head height depending on wind if theres more wind lower it down then place the opposite peg to the tree then the other two and your done  lay it into the wind obviously  make sure you have a good sleeping bag and pad perhaps collect natural padding like spruce bundles but please dont cut them off live trees just to get a little more below you and a bivy bag if there is risk of rain and then selecting a good site is very important so i would say only go in good weather until you get the hang of it  and thats about all i can think of right now
  these are solid advices thanks for the tips
  tfw no /out/ bf  also to be on topic nice pic
  this is a pipesmoking thread not a polesmoking one
getting better at rolling tobacco but i like pipe too tastes kinda funny though
  what pipe is that love the rusticated look and that scene is comfy
man i love me some aged burly flake smells like a tobacco barn and tastes like raisins
  go to a good state and buy tobacco
love smoking  smoking is bad for you  feel a little guilty every time after i smoke   fuck
   is bad for you  not for pipe smoking at least there is no empirical evidence that suggests this is the case over nonsmokers
  life is bad for you anon
  im a doctor and can confirm that you are going to die at some point
got gifted this old porcelain pipe for helping a friend clean up an axe head and putting a handle on it

and heres the axe still needs some work
  cavalry pipe
  yea theres like a german name for em but i dont speak that filth so i cant remember
    i think in english theyre generally described as a tyrolean/bavarian/german pipe sometimes a hunters pipe i forget the german word as well i know ive seen it before
      gesteckpfeife  which is hard to translate directly something along the lines of arrangement pipe maybe
  ed as a tyrolean/bavarian/german pipe sometimes a hunters pipe i forget the german word as well i know ive seen it before    anonymous 12/01/18sat153907 no1407    gesteckpfeifen jaegerpfeifen tyrolean pipe all acceptable names
    ha that was my first thought pipe is too long and has no vinyl bit probably not him
  cavalier
  can anyone tell me what the stuff you see here is on theese  it looks like cork but here it seems like it could be leather or something it is kind of flaking off should the porcelain of the bowl just sit flush with the porcelain of the v shaped part
im interested in becoming a game warden or something but one thing ive noticed doing some research is that the age limit is 36 ive been told that this is so that you can do your 20 years to get your retirement before being forced out im also told that years in the military can carry over into federal jobs for retirement purposes if im over 36 but i have enough years in the military that i could still get 20 years before being forced to retire do i still have to be younger than 36    any other kinds of federal /out/ jobs that are cool im also interested in things that are seasonal but most park ranger positions ive seen seem to be mostly just collecting entrance fees
  if you dont mind the danger wildland fire is awesome thats where i started out after using the gi bill to get a degree even if you dont plan on staying in it forever it opens all kinds of doors in the forest service and in state and local parks corps of engineers is great too good pay and retirement and lots of job opportunities depending on what your skills and education are the job can be boring at times but it kind of depends on the season if youre really looking to be /out/ as a ranger look for interpreter jobs fair warning though even most of the low level jobs will want you to have a degree in natural resources physical sciences forestry etc its just how the job market is theyll all be fairly competitive veteran status is a plus and even better if you have a disability rating
  bureau of land management has lots of /out/ jobs because they manage massive sections of public land just be prepared to be hated by both the libcucks and the conservatards
most field jobs go to young people because their knees are still intact i probably hiked 600 to 1000 miles for a job in 4 months doing 1015 miles a day going up and down a mountain side in the sagebrush steppe of oregon sometimes in blizzards and heavy rain all offtrail i was in great shape but blew out my knee at my next job
  does your time in the military carry over towards retirement    im looking to commission via ocs but id like to do something /out/ after i make captain assuming i make it and im wondering what my timeline looks like im already 27 so im thinking 36 might be a bit of a stretch to get in under depending on how things work out trying to be as informed as possible even though this stuff would be a ways down the line for me

gonna be spending a few days in yosemite and i have a fear of bears are there any ultralight bear traps i can bring with me to setup around my tent something like pic related but obviously not metal since thats too heavy
  howabout you stay the fuck home in your section 8 housing apartment complex you fucking hispanic nigger    or maybe youre jewish  either way if youre afraid of bears stay out of the woods and go walk around valencia for a while foo dey got trees n shit up there vato serio foo
    gun
  snare wire  really thick snare wire
      there are people here who actually fear black bears  i wish peoples skin tone was attached to their posts  there is absolutely no way white americans consider black bears a threat that requires preventative measures
  just how detached from white america are you most whites in america are afraid of fucking spiders and moths
  im white
  keep all food away from your tent    bring a pistol any caliber will do
  based
  maybe you should get a whistle and stay home
havent seen this thread before
  you will get in some serious deep shit trying to trap bears in yosemite let alone anywhere in current burgerstan those nps queers will go right up your ass if you shoot a bear at a national parking lot even if theyve stated youre allowed to carry a firearm and defend yourself from bears   keep your food the fuck away from your tent but not so far that you cant unzip your tent and yell git outta here cocksuckers as you lamp them and also take some bear mace learn to use it before you go to the woods ive never used it myself tbqh ive ran into a good number of bears foraging through my trash and its always been   me yelling something autistic and bolting at them as they flee in a mad panic   i probably wouldnt try that with a grizzly and black bears undoubtedly can be dangerous but you honestly have a better chance of being hurt or killed by an herbivore
okey so i have an idea for meal prep just a day trip meal though    okey i got the original idea from one of the field and stream books  it was a meal prep that is contained within a wide mouth nalgene bottle  you will need baggies small containers etc  you get small totillas beans sherreded lettuce anything really and put them in the baggies and containers except for the tortillas they can just go into the bottle    the idea is that you have enough for 56 totillas of wholesome goodness    rate idea
i fail to see why you need the nalgene for that if you already have everything in bags
  this cant i just shove all these small baggies into a bigger baggy use the bottle to hold vodka or water

sup /out/    im a dungeon master from /tg/ looking to improve the way i adjudicate and describe travel and camping outside the bounds of civilization could you answer some questions for me please    do the benefits of a campfire at night offset the drawback of being easy to spot at a distance if dangerous creatures are a concern    how do you build a campfire that doesnt choke you out with smoke if its rained and all the wood you can find is wet can someone feasibly carry around enough dry fuel to keep a fire going    is it feasible to forage and do a bit of hunting on the go or should you expect that to seriously cut into the distance youll be able to travel    and if youre into rpgs what do players and dms usually get totally wrong about going innawoods
  real wild animals are all scared of fire
  do the benefits of a campfire at night offset the drawback of being easy to spot at a distance if dangerous creatures are a concern    animals are drawn to warmth they see city lights and theyre not inclined to come check out what will attract them is warmth and food you have when you go to sleep best way to avoid them is singing jolly songs or talking loudly about your dd sessions this is sure way to repel animals and girls    how do you build a campfire that doesnt choke you out with smoke if its rained and all the wood you can find is wet can someone feasibly carry around enough dry fuel to keep a fire going    depends on the rain wood isnt wet all the way through maybe the bark camp in somewhere sheltered do feathering and slowly burn twigs and shit to build larger bonfire then you can drop in even fresh lumber or use fucking mage spells you dumb fuck    is it feasible to forage and do a bit of hunting on the go or should you expect that to seriously cut into the distance youll be able to travel    hunting with weapons and on a spot is a prehistoric meme that got made into a sport by renaissance dandies bored with castle amusements real hunters did it with traps what we call illegal hunting today place some traps and get yourself some hares otherwise get some dogs still you gotta train them to find the game    and if youre into rpgs what do players and dms usually get totally wrong about going innawoods    retarded warhammer derived armor with exotic looks and oversized pauldrons will get you killed in a forest by a rat youll be as slow as snail because paths are overgrown or nonexistent and you will break legs or bruise ankles because you have no idea where youre landing with feet walking in the countryside is completely different than in the city this is a reason why show like the walking dead is impossible you simply cant walk in the woods you need to goose step or whatever its called
  and at the ened disregard everything because rpgs are fantasy based and no rules apply
  campfires raise moral  they arent to be used if your hiding    splitting the timber lengthways means dry inner timber    forage yes hunting maybe a rabbit or wood pigeon/pheasant if your lucky not fishing though unless you set traps and return back there    that theres monsters everywhere usually its pretty sparsely inhabited
  fuck it ill bite im bored anyway  do the benefits of a campfire at night offset the drawback of being easy to spot at a distance if dangerous creatures are a concern absolutely fire provides warmth makes the preparation of food easier and allows you to dry wet gear wild animals instinctively avoid fire if your party is worried about detection from human/humanoid eyes there are ways to make your fire less visible google dakota fire hole    how do you build a campfire that doesnt choke you out with smoke if its rained and all the wood you can find is wet   the trick to building a fire with wet wood is to build as much heat as fast as possible again google dakota fire hole very efficient way to burn damp wood and use that to dry out firewood before putting it on the coal bed  can someone feasibly carry around enough dry fuel to keep a fire going  that depends entirely on the size of the fire a small cooking fire for one probably a larger fire for a group camp probably not they should at least be carrying some dry tinder and kindling though as this will make it easier to start a hot fire right off the bat to dry out any wet wood they gathered    is it feasible to forage and do a bit of hunting on the go or should you expect that to seriously cut into the distance youll be able to travel   define a bit hunting and gathering takes time and definitely reduces the amount of distance one can travel in a day if youre supplementing other supplies it wont be so obtrusive id say maybe expect one day of food production for every three days of travel but that is a very rough estimate depending on terrain weather and food availability    and if youre into rpgs what do players and dms usually get totally wrong about going innawoods  just how long it takes to get somewhere on foot especially in dense forest or mountainous terrain theres a reason most humans never traveled farther than 20 miles from home until a few centuries ago
  not owlbears
  these are used when you need to stay hidden but require a fire for some odd reason
    normal fire people see it and attack animals stay away  dakota fire people cant see it and dont attack animals may attack since they cant see it    smoke levels for each will be a problem with wet food smoke attracts people while it dissuades animals the dakota fire hole reduces the amount of overall smoke due to the design normally these are shown to be dug under a tree so the branches can disperse the smoke and you dont get detected however making a fire under a tree can have disastrous results in regards to forest via via a root fire this is increased drastically when you actually dig down into the ground and make a fire under ground level    if someone is pursuing you making a fire pretty much ensures they will find you the odor of smoke is readily detected and easily tracked back to the source without much effort the only time id consider making a wood fire while being pursued would be while extremely dehydrated and needing to boil some unfavorable water/snow to consume
  do the benefits of a campfire at night offset the drawback of being easy to spot at a distance if dangerous creatures are a concern    if you are being pursued dont make a fire if you are trying to keep animals away make a visible fire if you simply dont want to attract too much attention make a dakota fire hole or build log reflectors to help keep the light contained log reflectors help direct some of the heat and help the fire in windier conditions smoke odors will always be an issue if you want to stay concealed    is it feasible to forage and do a bit of hunting on the go    foraging is pretty easy theres only so much out there that isnt edible you just need the proper knowledge of what not to eat and how to prep what to eat hunting is something different trapping is a better thing to do since you can set up traps go to sleep and check traps in the morning you can still hunt but that will either be luck as you travel or youll need 12 days to hang around an area to learn the game trails and habits to stalk/hide and kill game    how do you build a campfire that doesnt choke you out with smoke if its rained and all the wood you can find is wet    stay upwind use a tube to blow on the embers to get things going that can be a campfire bellows from amazoncom or just some plant stalk tubes that will help keep your face out of the smoke and you can get the fire going much faster    can someone feasibly carry around enough dry fuel to keep a fire going    i carry enough tinder and kindling with me to start a fire using wet fuel while the first fire is going ill try to dry extra kindling for the next fire twigs and such dry pretty quickly    what do players and dms usually get totally wrong about going innawoods    everything if theyve not done it before or for very long if you are subsisting exclusively on foraging and hunting youll be doing that 99 of the time you are awake until reserves are built up
  id contribute but this guy got it right
  you simply cant walk in the woods you need to goose step or whatever its called  do americans really
  this is sure way to repel animals and girls  tfw have gf who likes dnd and weeb shit while i go /out/  feelsgoodman
  ill go straight to the last one the rest already have all the right answers    letting the players set up an elaborate camp in complete darkness this is near impossible do to moonlight is enough but thick forest cloudy night  you need light  thinking it is impossible to sleep in negative temps without a tent and fire proper clothing and blankets as well as ranger knowledge make it possible although its not easy  making hunting too easy i know its supposed to function as a game mechanic but its usually not as easy as finding tracks and following them it takes a day at least making it realistic could be fun
  do the benefits of a campfire at night offset the drawback of being easy to spot at a distance if dangerous creatures are a concern  dude its dnd besides humans you got a shit ton of humanoid fucks out there a camp fire usually attracts bandits kobolds usually people cook over a campfire so even the smell can attract bigger things    how do you build a campfire that doesnt choke you out with smoke if its rained and all the wood you can find is wet can someone feasibly carry around enough dry fuel to keep a fire going  you can find dry wood any where if you know how where to look i camp in a rain forest its easy to find dry stuff as the base of bigger trees also put wet wood next to the fire to dry out dont burn green shit    is it feasible to forage and do a bit of hunting on the go or should you expect that to seriously cut into the distance youll be able to travel  forage as you walk shoot smaller game as you come across it or get a pack mule to carry food gear etc    and if youre into rpgs what do players and dms usually get totally wrong about going innawoods  i get nothing wrong im the dm and its my world most people i play with dont go /out/ so i dont give them shit for a lot    dont get hung on all the small details just makes you stress
  making it realistic could be fun    dont get hung on all the small details just makes you stress    the small things and details can add a great deal of depth but only if the group is receptive to it and the dm doesnt have trouble with the added complexity
  a lot of times that great detail goes un notice or drags shit out for to long given i play and host for larger groups usually ten people so you cant go into to much detail or else by the time youre done doing that every one is done explaining what they did 20 mins have passed irl time for something as small and minor as setting up a camp
  a camp for ten people would take like an hour to set up irl lol if it took 20mins then they all must have spring loaded tents
  it all comes down to personal taste i would say a detailed camp setup is a cool thing to do once but best to just skip it the next time maybe go into details when conditions differ drastically eg in a blizzard when they would have to prepare differently
  those are good suggestions kind of like you have a skill set for camp stuff and you can upgrade it through one session of more detailed stuff then that will give a roll modifier for later times if you want a better modifier you do more details
  how do you build a campfire that doesnt choke you out with smoke if its rained and all the wood you can find is wet  wilderness lore dc check 13  is it feasible to forage and do a bit of hunting on the go  dc 20 to hunt/forage at half speed 25 at normal speed 30 at double speed

257 thanksgiving edition    anon needs to lern 2 count    previous thread      thinking about picking up a new hobby want to get a memecaster havent mastered the palomar knot click here         talk about fishin
  correct op image
you had one job kevin
  nah mang that was anon from the previous thread who made it so i fixed it and then wccidentally posted the fucked up one anyway
what are some fish that arent full of mercury and dragonforce
  basically everything freshwater and not from the east coast
nice glutes but shit manly waist
  tradeoff with fit women is that they lack some of the beautiful womanly aspects that said fit women still are beautiful
  all women are beautiful if theyre beautiful to begin with
  like anon said  one job
  how do i get a tall blonde gf that likes to fish bros
  dead toof
  are big ass bass safe how about trout
  unless you are a baby a pregnant female or sombody that can not produce selenium naturally then yes
  big bass arent good if you catch a nice one take your pic and release it to fight another day bass in the 1013 inch range are unironically the best size to keep and eat
  this     if youre worried about pollutants the older and larger predators are always worse in addition to that the big ones are never as tasty like anon said fish just above keeper size are best
keeper size is below 15 inches
  im in love
  ay zurris i dont know if you know right but remember that fly reel from that combo in your basement the drag blew out and the spool grinds against the frame unfortunately that means the reel is dead but it served well for almost two years its caught a number of great fish including a coho salmon plenty of carp pike bass and a few steelhead and died of old age/natural causes  quality 4chan gift/10  now im off to start saving up for a redington behemoth
  happy to hear that
  cant wait to tell this to my girlfriend
i filter these threads because sexual stimuli is bad for the mind
  was thinking the same thing
i forgot to go back to the tackle store during the hours when the cute girl works there shes so beautiful i dont even need to buy any tackle right now but i might buy a package of gulp or some jigheads just so i can talk to her at the register
burbot
im just beginning with fishing i have a light rod and some spinners  1 jerkbait  any reason i didnt caught anything last evening do i just keep trying
  so many reasons that youll end up getting answers to while you continue fishing  but maybe we can help out of you tell us where you were fishing like state and certain type of water
  south west france from the side but yeah i guess i just have to try a lot    apperently theres a lot of perch in the river i asked a colleague that fishes a lot
  big bass are safe  shitty pic couldnt find the original
  the only european fishing i know of is tafishing channel on youtube perch and pike are probably in the river i assume which should hit lures how has the temperature been sudden drops sometimes turn off the bite
  no freshwater isnt safe check consumption advisory for different inland states theres a shit load of completely off limits fish eating due to pcbs dioxin and mercury it is also getting worse every year with more places and more species added to the lists      the higher the fish is on the food chain the worse amount of pollution it will contain insect eating fish will have the least amount like rainbow trout or bluegill higher ups like flathead catfish musky and large mouth bass will have the most
humans are mad gay for polluting the water how does this nonsense even happen
  chinks
  rarely are the advisories for mercury theyre usually for pesticides and shit and theyre incredibly generous upper limits youd have to be subsistence fishing some of the nastiest shithole waters for it to effect most people
  i forgot to go back to the tackle store during the hours when the cute girl works there shes so beautiful i dont even need to buy any tackle right now but i might buy a package of gulp or some jigheads just so i can talk to her at the register  and that faggots is why you should hire female cashiers
  in the northeast we had dye factories spewing out heavy metals and mercury if i understand correctly most every body near me isnt safe to eat out of  so when are we doing a role call for secret santa
they said it couldnt be done but even my retarded ass managed first and only trout boys
  theres a reminder thread here to ask in i guess 
  nice work i wish i could go trout fishing here but i eat everything i catch and the only trout here is stocked and fed fish food that is made up of other fish from other states im not eating those things
  my options are eat stocked trout or travel across the state more or less only one of those is a real option at the moment
  yeah id need to drive 150 miles and catch 4 rainbows in tiny streams if i wanted any lol
hey alpha northerners is a flasher/fish finder really necessary for ice fishing i can just judge how deep it is based on how much line i let out i borrowed one from a guy for a couple hours caught a couple and one trout that did not even show up on the flasher when i gave it back i caught a whole family dinner everyone i talk to says a flasher is a difference maker but with my experience i feel like i spent too much time focusing on the screen as opposed to actually fishing my current method is to keep drilling and spend 15 minutes max at each hole even if there are fish the flasher would pick up they might not be active my method only finds active fish what do yall think
  the last couple of years the fishing thread has had its own secret santa
  i feel old when you say that its crazy to think how long these threads have been going
  its really weird to think about how long these threads have been going
    wow im drunk
  from my completely uniformed opinion i feel like if what youre doing is working keep doing it but you also have to think about how many people are on the lake youre fishing if theres a lot the flasher may become necessary     again idk wtf im talking about bc our lakes never freeze
  it became quite colder the during this week
what is the most kino game fish
      those homegrowmen threads have been going for 10 years now they started on /ck/ for what seems like a couple millennia ago      check out  and weigh in your opinion on the matter
  i cant believe i have stuck with it for this long considering i already gave up fishin for pussy and tools    it has been so slow i dont know how many people would even be in on a secret santa this year but im down to do it if we can get at least 5 people the first one was great because a saltwater yuro anon made me discover one of my favorite lures ever flatt shads
  in the time ive been tripfagging here pepsifag has always just included it in part of this thread hed make the first post a rollcall for secret santa you send him an email with your address and what kind of fishing you do maybe you exclusively swing flies for steelhead so someone would buy you intuder wire and stinger hooks or maybe you are a bass guy people might get you some meme lures or trig hooks there as usually a 2530 dollar budget and when yours came in the mail you posted it in the thread  pic related what i got last year
  thats a good system
  i snagged like half these lures the first time i used them sorry zuriss
  zurris always gives the best gifts    its pretty solid
  considering i already gave up fishin for pussy  literally what
  i took her fishin a couple times but i have also been working shitty hours and dont get off at 3pm all the time like i used to and i spend my saturdays dealing with the pussy its good tho and sundays are for housekeeping so i can barely find the time
hey laddies im spending thanksgiving in tampa and need to catch some fish ive never been very lucky down here but mostly because i have no fucking clue what to fish with from shore anyone have any tips/spots for the south end of tampa bay
  have fun with that red tide i was just there the other weekend and so many fish floating around st pete and ft desoto
  its apparently better down south towards bradenton im in apollo beach so hopefully its okay here havent left the house to see what it looks like though
  i think i was there 3 weeks ago and you could barely spend more than 10min on the beach because it made you feel like you had bronchitis    we got traces of it on the atlantic side this summer but i have never felt anything like that
hello friends pretty new fisher here my dumbass accidentally ordered a telescopic baitcaster rodkastking blackhawk iionline should i   1double down and but a baitcaster reellooking at shimano casitas  2try to offload the rod at a loss   3pop a spinning reel on itguides are not fixed in place since its a telescopic     returning it is not an option
  offload it or worst case scenario trash it    yes throwing it away unused is still a better option than sticking the wrong reel on it and putting any baitcaster worth owning on a telescopic chinkshit rod is tantamount to nailing your dick to the side of a moving train
  but anon whats exactly wrong with the rod only bad things ive seen people say about it is that the rod tip is fragile and thats rare    also if its a shit rod and breaks cant i just replace the rod with a better one
    just use it or keep it as a back up and stick a cheap reel like a black max on it and keep it in ur car for impromptu fishing
  telescopic rods in general are  less sensitive than an 80s era fiberglass catfish stick  likely to slip and collapse while fighting a fish  nearly impossible to line the guides up on   have the balance and ergonomics of a brick at the end of a bat  theyve also historically been very fragile in that the guides snap off easily from their feet but the last 3 years or so has kinda changed that
  black marlin hands down
  fishing on thanksgiving day only landed two bass i failed 4 hook sets was surprised that the bass were hitting with the temperature but i guess it wasnt cold enough to stop them however was much breaking in the water like their normally is
    can testify to that  no rule without exceptions though good telescopic rods allegedly exist ive just never come across any  last tele rod i owned i bought 10years ago first outing with it i got snagged on some kelp put moderate pressure on the rod and swiftly it went from telescopic to a threepiece ei it broke in two places to this day i still suspect it was a manufacturing defect but it has still kept me away from telescopics since and yes it is anecdotal and by no means hard evidence that tele rods suck  i feel tempted to buy one again soon though to have in the trunk of my car for when i have 10minutes near some water from time to time
kinda new fisher here any baitcaster can be put on any rod right
  i wouldnt worry about it
  spin casters have their own rods with wide eyes nearest to the reel bait and line casters have rods that have smaller eyes using a bait/line caster on a spin cast rod might cause unneeded wear on your line same goes for using a spin cast reel on a bait/line casting rod
  hmm that doesnt strike me as intended     so as long as i put any baitcaster on any casting rod ill be fine if i put an abu garcia on a st croix or something its not gonna be an issue
  hmm that doesnt strike me as intended   look up acid rod
  ive got a dicks brand okuma stratus v on a zebco rhino toughtm and havent had any problems with the combo or other mix n matched combos now the reel itself is kinda shite but thats an issue with the reel itself not the combo together the gap is too wide between the spool and spool housing so back lashes on it with thin enough line run the risk of getting jammed inside the reel body and nicking the line if you manage to rescue the backlash
  as anon pointed out baitcqst/spin rods have different guide size/spacing configuration using a baitcast reel on a spin rod will increase the chances of birds nesting
  interesting never heard of these before       yeah i kinda butchered my initial question but thank you for the help guys i knew baitcast reels for casting rods and spinning for spinning rods but wasnt sure how close brands had to be     appreciate the quick replies hope you all have a good one
  brands are irrelevant anon the trick is to match the rod and the reel and the line with the application ive got four almost identical baitcast combos that i use almost exclusively for barra fishing which i understand to be similar to your snook light enough to cast all day but the blanks are a glass/graphite blend for good pulling power i often have to fish in tight cover so 7ft rods just dont work for me which is why im quite fond of pic related
bought this supposed to be here on friday the 23rd of november gonna be using it in stained brown water
  thanks anon i really like the portability and convenience of not setting up every time  ill try this one out and if it breaks i might buy the eupro travel rod      the blackhawk ii looks pretty good online not sure how it will hold up in real life though i will update the thread after ive tried it for sometime    is there any downsides to fishing with a decent reel but bad rod worst case scenario is the rod breaks and i buy a new one right
  those storm baits arent bad but nothing incredible i like running them in areas where i hang up other lures since the single hook on the top allows you to just bounce them off of the bottom and rip through weeds    looks like a good color choice though
  i was born and raised with 1980s k mart bought spinning rods and reels anything other than that is a bunch of liberal propaganda and marketing ploys rods and reels that cost an extra 100600 bucks wont catch you that many more fish patience learned knowledge and attentive focus will always be far more fruitful than expensive gear ive outfished plenty of folks with expensive apparatuses with a rod i found under a bridge and old guys who stand in freezing cold water in the same place from before sunup to sundown outfish me believe otherwise and you lose the point of fishing its no different than any other activity that being said dont bring a 5 foot rod to the surf and dont bring a 12 foot surf rod to a brook trout stream
  caught this mo fo during a record breaking hot winter in deep gulf coast texas like 4 years ago salt watwr trout are rear at the jetties even more during 98 degree farenheit weather i catch and release cause i refuse to buy a fishing license autistic ideaology i threw him back cause im not a complete nigger also disregard my spelling im drunk and on the devils sugar
  fuck im an idiot forgot pic
  i disagree anon with qualification  for the average pleb a kmart special combo will do the job for general soak and hope fishing but as you become more specialised the gear you employ must change too i agree that learning to fish learning the correct rigs knots how to read water lure selection is important but using the right tool for the job is vital you will not land 40 lb caranx ignoblis consistently on pleb gear how you came to the conclusion that its a liberal conspiracy is beyond me btw
    all very true but i find that the more i learn from fishing the more i discover about what i would like in a piece of equipment usually lighter stronger more durable or with a certain type of action that facilitates my own laziness     there is no substitute for skill and experience but imagine having the skills the knowledge and some halfway decent equipment      nicer equipment can make the experience more enjoyable improve the learning curve and make you more eager to get out and fish might even help you stay safe like sunglasses or wading boots     the best is generally unnecessary but to get the cheapest is also a disrespect to ones own limited time on the water     surely this justifies my fishing expenditures right
newfag to fishing here im from libya so i fish from the mediterranean coast surf fishing but i was wondering what was the difference between spincasting spinning and baitcasting in regards to rod design reel design the environment where these are used and the type fish theyre designed for
  fish finder  know fish are there despite getting nothing  no fish finder  guess fish dont exist anymore
fellas i stored my kayak sitting on the ground all winter and now the hull is flattened in the middle  is it gonna stay like this or will it go back into shape in time
bought the shimano seabass vengeance bx in mh 210 for 30 bucks pretty stiff cant wait to go spinfishing with it  can anyone recommend a decent spinning reel with front break that might fit this combo  is the nexave any good   or should i invest 10 bucks more and get the sedona
starts at 23mins      heres something neat a guy making fishing line from old dogbane plants and a gorge hook from a deer bone
  hog farms here in east nc did a lot to fuck up the waters here once the hurricanes hit and the hog waste lagoons began to flood it caused massive fish kills
need some sure fire ways to hit trout ive gotten skunked the last 5 times i went out and the waiting game aint paying off    fishing 2lb test either power bait blown worms dipped in garlic oil or a combo of the both    need to try something new
  double meh she aint even fine  she could fish though
  hog waste lagoons    christ there should be better government regulations for shit like that like setting up methane biogas power plants so theshit can be dealt with in a highly usable manner
  theyre actually a fantastic method of disposal and reuse if they dont flood the hurricanes brought all time record flooding nobody had expected or foreseen
  but they are hurricanes what is wrong with people
  pretty sure people were too busy shit flinging over kavanaugh to give a shit about hurricanes at the time
  what so we care about  drama  hurricane  no we want drama    well i guess they got a double dose of shit flinging
  they are hurricanes  which at most tickled the balls of the carolinas once a decade and only really hit once every 150 years theres never been flooding like that ever before for the most part its a nonissue that far inland
  it is amazing how many times ive heard that line of logic after a disaster lol
anybody score some black friday deals
  thats a big collection of fly reels
  so by your logic the people living in boulder should be 100 prepared and actively plan to be flooded out and the people living in miami should be 100 prepared and actively plan for weekslong blizzards got it youre retarded
4chanx isnt updated yet    jesus fucking tap dancing christ
  tfw i havent updated the thread yet so it still works for me
  kek the native thread watcher and settings are a horrorshow
  i had to work so no
      11445 is out and everything works again
  using 4chanx  oh so youre one of those kinds of drama fag autists from /b/
  4chanx is a really powerful script for better use of 4chan im not sure what it has to do with /b/ if you are using native/vanilla 4chan you must have an sm fetish
just dropped 450 on a shimano curado dc/megabass orochii xx perfect pitch combo i feel kinda gross for spending so much but i think itll be worth it i got the combo to drag jigs and pitch those are my favorite techniques anyone else buy some cool shit
  got some 4 and 5 oz jigs did i get the short bus al gag or does the tail normally come oriented like that i guess itll undulate more but an eels body is turned the other way
tomorrow going to be my first day jigging for trout what should i expect
  seeing as it was designed for avatarfags to deanonymize /b/ and for spammers to circumvent captchas yeah its garbage and its users largely fall into one of those categories
  your entire post is incorrect maybe you are thinking of something else
  sore muscles and no trout
  been using the curado since the bsv model theyre great just remember to oil the levelwind pawl and use the lightest oil you can on the bearings like winger or gun oil
  are you literally just making things up
  is there any downsides to fishing with a decent reel but bad rod worst case scenario is the rod breaks and i buy a new one right    pls respond
  what kind of answer do you want if you yourself say the rod s bad then yes there must be a downside to using it
  the first guy who responded to me said i would be fucking myself if i put a decent reel on a shit rod but it wont harm the reel in anyway right worst case is i buy a new rod ill still have my reel functioning yes
  but it wont harm the reel in anyway right  i dont see how it would
  it shouldnt hurt the reel but if i had to pick between a shitty rod/good reel vs a shitty reel/good rod id take the good rod sensitivity is so important for new anglers so they can correctly learn how to hook set detecting those bites will help out a ton
  your gears may take a harder hit because the rod might not be taking on alot of the lure or fish you catch like a decent rod would but i wouldnt worry too much about it just upgrade later and go out there and fucking fish
  the shittiest chinese reel on amazon is till way better than the best shit they were using 50 years ago im drunk and ive just been spamming your post my bad bro
  the only time you could possibly harm your reel is if you are using a super stiff saltwater rod with a freshwater reel the drag on the reel is set to be as tight as possible and you are using 50lbs fishing line and you get snagged on a rock or the line gets in a boat prop or you hook a shark/5 feet long flathead catfish then all the force applied to the line will go directly to your reel theres a chance it would strip whatever drag mechanism it has or perhaps twist something off like rounding some gear teeth but even in that situation all youd need to do is release the drag enough to properly account for such a situation and nothing would be a problem unless you perhaps ran out of line    basically no it wont harm your equipment if you use the equipment properly regardless of the mismatched gear
          cool guys  thanks for the input ill get a shimano caenan and pair it with the blackhawk ii  if i enjoy fishing ill probably upgrade to a better rod when im not broke
  remember that a rod is a tool and there are many types of rods for many different types of fishing so take the type of fishing you want to do where you want to do it and use that to help you find a rod  reel that matches it it can make all the difference in how easy and problem free your experience will be
  hola senor
not sure if i should drive 2 hours to an inlet to try for tautog never caught one or drive 15 hours to a river to try for walleye never caught one either or just keep catching stripers where i live
  keep catching stripers where i live    togs are fun and good eats stripers fight harder but are mediocre eats you have a tough decision ahead of you
  i guess im just getting bored with stripers the fall run has sucked ass the last few years where i am and i havent caught one over 30 inches in years
anyone get anything nice for black friday was considering buying a new 26 oz jigging rod since my st croix is pretty fucking ancient and the rod/reel are heavy as fuck and pretty tiring rod blanks must have made pretty big leaps from 2002 right im sure id feel a huge difference if i got a lamiglass 2g or a tfo
  went out and got some ice fishing gear today
can someone pls identify
  some sort of trout or salmonoid for sure
  looks like a small chinook salmon during spawn
  would definitely eat her poo
  fish
    tfw no olympic gf

  on a spinning rod i think i would rather have a nice rod with a shitty real than a crap rod and good real    probably flip it around on casting but its no fun trying to finesse stuff on crap wobbly rods      got me some new tools sittin til xmas no fish gear though
thinking about buying myself this for christmas  want to use it for shallow water shakey heads so what do yall think
  the only possible way it could harm the reel is if the reel seat is metal and so poorly shaped that it marrs the feet of the reel other than that you will be fine    you missed one possibiliy ive seen it first hand  hook stingray  fishing rod is a broom stick with eye guides  spinning reel  googan with 40 pound mono and maxed out drag  stem connecting the feet of the reel to the rest of the reel snaps  reel goes flying  takes every eye guide off the rod with it  googan cant fish anymore  my line stops getting crossed every 15 minutes  funny as fuck
anyone caught a smallmouth buffalo before was looking at fish/lakes in my state and saw them listed they put up a good fight
  damn that looks nice if i ever start fishing again my next spinning combo will be something like that 6670 ml/fast with a ml size real about the same size as the pfluerger 30 size or okuma 25
    yeah chinook is my best guess too  quality dink/10
  i actually thought of the snapping thing just didnt type it out with all the word salad
yeah no fuck wooly buggers ice dub fuzzle buggers work better and are easier to tie
  spinning is really underrated with bass fisherman lately desu ive fallen in love with weightless dropshots and shakeyheads    i get that if you want to get a limit in a tourney then power fishing with memecasters and cranks is great but i think its sad how people go to their local pond with that mentality
anyone collect vintage lures a buddy went off the deep end and started hustling ebay lure websites and garage sales looking for old aussie hand made timber lures he just sold 2 of pic related for 550 a piece and still has 2 left he bought 4 for 400 its fucking insane what boomers will pay for to hang shit up on their man cave
  eh i had to get out of the house thanksgiving day i didnt wanna deal with the stress like last year  caught a couple of bass forgot to format the camera so ran out of space lmao    by the way my camera is shit some lame wanna be gopro but eh better then nothing  also i was in a rush wasnt able to find the app to make sure the camera was facing the face area but eh  i have the app now
  spotted trout pretty common in streams and ect
  only 2 words i heard out of that were thanksgiving turkey god that mic is awful
  true but fishing season is over here in florida in 2 weeks so not in need of a camera till after spawn  wanted a gopro but i have other things like getting parents some thing for christmas
    t boomer    skill and good gear are synonymous the better the gear the greater fisherman you are capable of becoming
anyone like uncut angling on youtube ive been watching his videos hes ugly af buf has intresting vids
any tips for catching crappie from the shore on a small lake without a boat a lake that gets extreme amounts of pressure even max depth unless its been dredged out since the last survey is 26 feet
  hes a strange dude but goddamn does he catch quality fish
would it be more efficient if i use a float for surf fishing if i was casting from some place where the water is already deep not from the beach  so that the hooks dont sink too deep and get snagged and to target pelagic fish  see pic related the reason im asking is because i never saw anyone use a float on a surf rod
ive always wanted to get into fishing but got no one to teach me i dont know one end of the fish from the other what do  also i live in taiwan but theres hardly any taiwan specific information in english as far as i can find
  look for spots with structure try different methods to catch them i mostly use jigs and tiny kastmasters for crappie       i use casting bubbles and hammer bombs for pelagics from shore they float and has weight to cast far lots of people use floats in the surf hammer bombs are easy to make yourself too      why is that lure collectable
  ill try jigs and hike to some more inaccessible places though i dont have any spare cash for more or smaller spoons and no spoons to cannibalize to make one to fish with i have my doubts though at the lake im fishing ive stood over schools of panfish and jigged and watched as they looked at the grub with extremely mild curiosity before fucking back off under the brush
  the issue i tend to have with panfish grubs is that they generally have to be able to fully engulf the grub to get on the jighead hook and not all sunfish have the hinged jaws that can do that i have the most success with inlone spinners 1/16 oz little kleos and kastmasters
  bobber   splitshot   live worm    they eat bait too
  aint nobody over here trying to spend 2 4 for live bait every time we go fishin    plus theres the whole depth thing on top of not having slip bobbers or bobber stops
  you could buy from aliexpress  they have cheap and decent gear but also very crappy lures if you do a good search you probably find some that do their job very well for reasonable prices  my experience is limited to small freshwater lures though i dont know if the china stuff can handle large pelagics and tight drags
  for 
  you gotta learn from fishing with someone or by yourself cant learn from us telling you  i mean someone can give you all the information but you gotta go out and do it to really believe and learn the truth  like some fish eat differently and stay in different parts of a body water so you have to use the right bait the right hook and/or reflector/lures the right scent and the right reeling method to get their attention  all in the right temperatures and time of day    it sounds complicated on the surface but its not that hard to just buy a rod and a reel some bait a few hooks and weights and just go to a lake and sit around and enjoy being /out/ its when you start getting into other methods of fishing that shit starts getting complicated    throwing a hook out into the water isnt that hard
  sucks being poor and not resourceful
  do you have snakeheads we used to have a malaysian anon a couple years back and he said that was like the main sport fish
  rogue river michigan about 2 days ago
  fucking lo e his videos on depression i feel like he gets it
  those poppers are triggering me
could ohios problem be that nobody keeps green sun fish in stead throwing them back leaving them to overpopulate and kill off bass/trout/etc on close shore locations lake erie tributaries and small inland lakes and ponds
  honestly couldnt tell you some lure makers are more sought after than others
  hola amigo how about this weird weather change good for fishing though
newfag to fishing here   would i get mercury poisoning from eating an entire yellowfin tuna by myself   i just love sushi so much and i think it would be cool catch my own roast me
  nah you wont get sick from ahi the fatty belly meat holds the most toxins but is dam gud to eat dont forget to keep the collars so good on the grill brushed with teriyaki sauce my uncle smoked a whole football yft for thanksgiving it was good
  why is that lure collectable  i could be wrong it that looks like a leeds lure the guy who made them terry leadbeater or something used to make them in his shed by hand and the use of metal bibs stopped in the late 80s/early 90s the leeds highjacker i think is still made in small batches and is generally only found in two orsotackle shops in one city but now has a plastic bib that is just glued in  injection moulded lures too over the market around when makers like reidys and gaden states production    also nice popper selection third row look a lot like hammerheadz
  fuck these mother fuckers i live in pennsylvania and somehow the northern snakehead had infested our waters for quite awhile back in the early 2000s and destroyed a decent amount of native populations of fish game commission ended up having to make a rule to kill all snakeheads that were caught no catch and release
  youre not supposed to catch and release snake head literally anywhere you go in any state
  yes
  theres a bunch of idiots in md now who love snakeheads and get mad when you slaughter them theyre fun to catch yeah but youd better believe im killing every single one i catch
  once again 
  its like any other fishing    cover water  dont stand in the same spot and keep casting give a spot 1015 minutes and if nothing bites after many different retrieval speeds and maybe trying a different lure move on     fish are not complicated put something they like to eat near them and they will bite if the water is muddy use bright colors like gold or chartreuse if the water is clear stick to natural colors like silver or transparent     most predatory fish cant resist a jerkbait like a rapala xrap if presented correctly perhaps the ultimate bait in this category is a chatterbait with a softplastic trailer this has caught me everything from a 15 crappie to a 22 largemouth to a 28 wiper to a 34 channel catfish here in the states
  okay so say i still want to catch my own yellowfin tuna   how much can i allow myself a year   also what saltwater fish can i catch with a handline i saw some indians fishing with handmade ones on river monsters so i amazoned pic related never caught anything with it though im a landlockedfag
  how much can i allow myself a year   how much do asians eat per year
are bucktails applicable to freshwater fish i never see them used over synthetic skirted jigs i wanna practice my bucktail jigging action but its a 2 hour drive to the closest non city shorefront
quick question    berghaus or kelty for a full sized hiking pack  cyber monday and i figured id ask here instead of /k/
  mystery ranch  hill people      kelty
  well where da sales at
  let me put it this way one day i was so drunk i could not stand up on the steep bank i sat down on having ran out of worms but not rum i baited my hook woth blades of grass and fallen leaves i caught perch for an hour until my buddy showed up and helped me up
  i baited my hook woth blades of grass and fallen leaves i caught perch for an hour
  to be fair he said he was drunk
  panfish bite on anything ive caught them on bare hooks
  you can doubt all you want but perch do not care if it is food or not all they care about is if they can beat the other perch to to it it is like being the first to comment on a youtube video it could be a video about licking a fat mans underboob but someone will be happy to be the first comment
  lol like 50k in reels jesus christ
    and ive watched panfish observe jigs spinners and spoons live minnows dead minnows and cranks of all sizes with complete indifference as well as viciously attack a worm baited hook until that hook became exposed only to then fuck off completely forcing me to pull the bait out of the water and reset it    in fact the only place ive ever caught pan fish with an artificial lure was out of a suburban creek with a hard to access bank that got no pressure ever because nobody knew it was a tributary of the major river  and ive fished quite a few bodies of water besides
  that doesnt make his story any less believable
okay this is epic    
  this is not newbut yes it is cool
  yeah im a bit late but damn if i didnt get a curado 2 years ago id totally get this
has anyone ever fell through the ice ice fishing
  for the extra 100 it is not worth it for me as i have been casting open face for 20 years but i could see the value for the younger generation
wobble heads and gulp for fluking came in today anyone get anything nice
  been using baitcasters for about 5 years while im pretty good with accuracy and casting i still get caught out every now and then with a nasty backlash the 100 would be well worth the peace of mind of never having to unfuck a nasty birds nest ever again assuming the system will last as long as the reel does
  best of luck to you i do not say this is a dimb idea just that it is not for me until the price comes down more these used to be 400 my chance of a bad backlash is in the 1 in 500 cast range so given my personal income to price of reel i will pass
  hair jigs      close
  are you really surprised at my doubt when those are my experiences fishing
  jealous these are still going for 450 here in australia when you try and look at american sites you might save 100 but then magically the shipping is almost always that amount anyway this applies to pretty much anything online im with you once these go down ill consider it till then my current curado will do
  then think of my price as being 500 realy when it comes to international exchange price vs gold/gram is a lot better for 1v1 comparisons your price for a reel might be more than mine but still within cost limits
  i tried not to fucking laugh at this one   bruhthere are places in this world where panfishing is better than anywhere you have ever fished before just because you havent had those epic days doesnt meant those epic days dont exist   now you may understand that    or maybe not
  nothing wrong with the curado anon ive belted dozens of meteries with them just do t try to use them in black bass
  my legs fell through once but i pulled myself out immediately
  black bass
  large mouth small mouth spotted and red eye bass are all considered black bass due to them all belonging to the micropterus genus
  thats cool and all but i would imagine he means black sea bass
  so whats wrong with using them for bass though
  i doubt youd want to use a reel with 150 yards of line and a drag system designed for freshwater to go catch black sea bass but thats just me      nothing theyre great
fish dont taste good imo
  even pro anglers backlash sometimes its just a part of fishin
  honestly same fishing is still my favorite thing to do though i just let em all go
    niugini black bass a member of the family lutjanidae like a cubera but bad tempered
i just wanna ice fish bros
  then drop some ice in the water while you fish
  we have ice but just not enough to fish on yet might go poke around a bit tomorrow after class and see how its holding up
  idiot says what
how do i know which parts of the coast have what kind of fish if they do at all also is there a way to find water depth from the internet google earth was no help
  scope out structure at low tide look for swells and rips in the current patches of breaking waves ect that indicate a change in the bottom composition
  if youre looking for depths find a chart for your location here assuming youre in the us then just zoom in to where you want to see 
how hard is something like this to do     the duration the spool freely spins is fucking absurd there are a few types of bearings available but the orange ones have the most positive reviews are those the bearings i should be looking at or are there better options
  takes literally a minute or two to put them in get the ceramic ones drop of reel oil when you drop them in and your setup
  i might be retarded because i cant figure out which of the bottom 2 i want they both seem to be ceramic hybrids of some sort its the bottom one right
  where you at       tduper retawd easy bref ive refit almost all my reels if you run into problems on your reel look up alan tanis website buy some gud bearing oil and stick them in a hook awl helps to pop them up but i did my bass reels with a metal pen top just remember ceramics are noisier i refit a og newell reel and it sounded like a fucked up skateboard wheel but would spin for minute easy tosses iron like a champ bearings are a easy upgrade you have to break them in and keep them serviced tho which means a little more work but it aint shit
  just buy the highest abec  you can afford in the right size of course teh higher the abec  the better the bearing
  to low test for jessie    to much muscle for you
tfw want to go fishing everyday but too afraid of mercury poisoning from daily consumption   what do
  let the fish go duh
which spot would you recommend for angling   which one would you recommend for squid fishing
  heres a bing maps image
  those chartruese gulps are great they make good trailers on spinnerbaits too
  i for one can not wait for out northern snakehead overlords to arrive where i live the fishing here is terrible both for sport and eating the gov has to stock everything anyway and thats only in govrun waterways none of which are in my area and very good the main places i fish only have rather small native fishes theres no large species of bass either catfish are bullhead the places with channel cats are merely fishery stocked that were fed on fishfood all their lives the places that have shovelhead cats are polluted as all fuck and no one is allowed to eat them
  switch to species that have the least amount of pollution in them those will be ones that eat mostly vegetation and/or insects and are lowest on the food chain like bluegill/sunfish rainbow trout suckers and carp the worst ones are those that are highest on the food chain eating other fish like pike musky bass flathead catfish etc the same thing goes for salt water just look up what the diet is for the fish and target the correct ones usually theres no consumption restrictions on vegetarian and insectivore species the only real big problem is in salt water where theres a red tide where the entire food system is being contaminated from the bivalve filters on up the food chain to humans not fun times    i advise you double check your local regulations for the consumption advisories anyway heavily polluted waterways will have all manner of pollution toxins and heavy metals one within 50 miles of me has an advisory where you are not supposed to eat anything at all from it no matter what species it is other places the advisory is only for specific species either defining how much you can eat depending on who you are and in what time frame or flat out saying no to a species    i have my own pond and mostly eat sunfish
will i catch fish surf fishing from the east coast during winter
  hell yeah
  im not sure how many years of good fishing you will have i always say you gotta catch a few to understand theyre so much more aggressive than any native fish bass arent going to chase a small fish into the rocks basically out of the water on shore sneks will when guarding the nest and fry most native fish will chase or nip any potential predators sneks will grab em with those sharp teeth hook a lmb and theyre retarded and will sometimes swim to you and make the retrieve easier sneks will dive and burrow and run you into weeds and sticks
  maybe be a little bit more specific about what part of the east coast
anybody got a shit hot tuna/mahi/wahoo/etc trolling lure to recommend looking for something for my dad for xmas were out of marathon key weve got a lot of tackle between us but always looking for the next big thing or sleeper to haul in the toads    usually get him tuna/mahi bird rigs but the sharks havent been as bad at the humps and he hasnt been losing them as frequently to teeth
  make a few woghead rigs sails and small marlin will climb all over them too
  ah didnt explain properly defrosting a bait for demo stand by
  feed top hook thru gill space and the use wire tag for lock head thats 2nd pic
  wind bait spring over bait head to lock you can pin the rear hook if you like
  shitty freezer burned bait i know run your thumb down the spine of the bait to free up the baits movement can run with a woghead as subsurface or a pink squid as a skipping baiti cant get the right hooks here but a gamakatsu 10/0 front hook and 8/0 trailing  can troll them upto 10 kt maybe more from a rigger
  to add to this fatty fish generally contains more shit than nonfatty no rule without exceptions though where the fish belongs in the food chain matters more than how fatty the meat is
a gift for /out/ists one of my favourite knots for leader to lure connections it makes a better proud loop than the lefty loop imho afaik this is called the moosenoose     tying in an old usb for visibility    1make an overhand loop and start the knot like a leftys loop
  pass the standing part of the line through the loop twice but must be the same way it came outdont pull it up yet
  pass the bitter end as shown moisten and tighten this knot is superior to the leftys loop in every way desu senpai
        thanks we have good luck with ballyhoo rigs for sails but were fishing them live off a kite mostly were starting to get more into wahoos which never seemed to be around our area much in years past ill pick up a few of these setups seems like a good rig to troll over the reefs in general
go fishing with buddy  he snags a carp on a lure  greedy pelican attempts to eat carp   carp somehow escapes lure is now stuck in pelicans bill  get pliers and remove treble hook from pelican hope hes learned his lesson    keep clear of their wings jesus fucking christ its like getting pimp slapped they have some power in them
  i find it is more about how you trim and prepare them than anything theres also the problem with people thinking all fish needs to taste the same
  fatty tissue hold most of the heavy metal buildup so trimming bellies can help a lot but bottom feeding apex predators like catfish are always gonna be more risky than eating lower on the foodchain i almost never keep fish when i want some seafood i get deenz or cook something with anchovies  what the fuck is it with people insisting on wading into the water i see dudes up to their nips in murky ass water for an extra 5 feet of distance probably less considering the height they lose walking down the seabed
  im new to this board so forgive my ignorance but are you the real kvd if so i met you at the dr on m43 several years ago grew up in oshtemo just outside of kalamazoo
  braid  marauder     the best hoo trolling lure black/purple tony the tiger colors slay hoos    does yuor dad popper fish       mexico  throw sardina out  pelican slams it   unhook pelican  throw out sardina   same fuckin pelican slams it again    realize pelicans simply dont give a fuck
  i meet a lot of kids kid
  no its just some black dude in florida who doesnt even fish anymore
  yes hes the real kevin van dam
  i was a kid then it was probably 10 years ago now that i think about it grew up fishing baseline lake and gun lake
  pelicans are pretty reserved here and mostly know to stay the fuck away lest they get shit thrown at them its only popular spots where dickhead tourists feed them where they get aggro
damn i love ice fishing
  i thought it was a white dude who lives with his parentsin texas
so i was thinking about going pike fishing this weekend southwest pa should i bother or is it too cold at this point and just wait for ice fishing
  i finally went ice fishing    felt good to get out and drill some holes give the ol rod a little wiggle this little guy was a blast on the ul rod with 2lb test
  great day on the lake landed 4 large mouth bass    fucking chinese piece of shit camera ruined the action i really need a gopro but bass fishing is about done for the rest of the year might try next weekend
has anyone ever used one of these as a spear head i am thinking of getting one for spearfishing
  needs bigger barbs longer forks more spread out or fewer that close together
    im probably just going to use it for panfish who swim up close to the shore/pier i am going to throw bread crumbs at the surface of the water and when the fish come up to eat ill strike them ive seen someone do this in a youtube video before he caught like 4 pan fish using this method
  check if that is legal in your state in a lot of states you can only spearfish for rough fish ive used that style of spear for suckers and redhorse and it worked great but i cant see it working well for bluegill the fish would either slip through the tines or you would lose almost all the meat if you get a solid stab
  this nigga   bruh you should straight up be a namefag its bout the same thang you tryna doyou meet the criteria because youre a total faggot  namefag yursef in here if youze want /out/ peeeps to look at yur shit and get clicks however gay it bee     4chan 2018  smdh      we use one for frog gigging
too much ice to fish in open water  not enough ice to ice fish yet  why am i even alive
  this guy again anons you guys were right about telescopics my friend extended my rod into a wall on accident and it snapped on the bright side i found out i like baitcasting thinking of getting a kuying swordsman travel rod now is that a good idea to pair with a shimano casitas or do you guys have recommendations needs to be a travel rod
  why ya haten girl
  either namefag ur self so we can filter you or move to reddit ur faggoty blog posts arnt wanted here
  this  how its gonna be for the northeast until like january i may just go for it and have ice picks on and blankets and towels in my car next time the ice gets close to 2 inches     ive fished on sketchy ice before places where old holes used to be and what not     its so much safer ice fishing in the spring compared to early winter because in winter its colder outside and theres snow covering the ice so you cant tell where the bad ice is in the spring the air is like 4050 degrees and you wont die after you fall in plus you can tell based on the color and texture how the ice will be i didnt first go on the ice until it had 6 inches last year but in the spring i fished way less
  tfw live in the northeast
what is the best general purpose rig designed to catch the largest variety of fish in surfcasting
  id give it a go desu
  the fuck is that contraption
  not him but it looks like a heater to keep his hole open
    its a flasher to tell you when theres a fish near your bait
    absolute state of southerner    kvd please make the next thread first ice related
  a heater to keep his hole open  truly the male to female trans world has gone to far
  sloots dont like the cold so its hard to find pics
  a castnet
  just use a hook and line baited with bread cheaper and easier
  i hear his fingers smell like coffee
  what is that box on the waist
  only catches queen fish
  not him but that looks like a tiny heater so he doesnt get cold
  fly line cleaner thingy or fly box
  paternoster and pulley rigs depending on how far you want to cast  grapnel sinkers are good to have if conditions are rough
  i got a storm gommoku kaiten that i will use mainly for tai raba and slow jigging from 180 euros just 100 cant wait to use it  
      
how would one go about doing this /out/ do you or anyone you know have any experience/stories concerning squatting in state forests or parks
  beware of drug operations if they think youre going to expose them theyll make sure you disappear and are never found
  theres a pretty consistent number of seasonal workers that squat on free bureau land in utah and work summer jobs in moab they just play musical campsites all summer long every two weeks everybody just rotates to a new spot 5ish miles from their last one  the bureau doesnt really care unless they leave a big mess or disturb other people same situation in places like alaska and the olympic peninsula in washington on usfs land  dont squat in state parks theyre smaller and the rangers/staff have more free time on their hands so theyre out for squatters and hobos stick to federal land and rotate campsites every two weeks as long as youre not in a posted no camping zone youre not breaking any laws
  the only issue with rotation and whatnot is that id like to eventually build a home on some federal land and not ever have to deal with money again maybe sell furs and woodcrafts for bullets oil etc when necessary since buying property to homestead on would still require property tax
  that wont happen you might get away with it for a year or two because most bureau/fs posts are understaffed but theyll notice a permanent structure being built if you want to be a public land hobo you need to be at least semimobile   if you want to homestead theres lots of dirt cheap land in alaska and if all you build on it is a dry cabin youll pay next to nothing in property taxes
  haha you are the sad faggot who cant afford a few hundred  better not piss off mommy or she will throw your lazy ass out
  youre adorable
  they just play musical campsites all summer long every two weeks everybody just rotates to a new spot 5ish miles from their last one    this really is the best way to be homeless see the world and still live in relative comfort      build a home on some federal land    not going to happen they will tear it down as soon as it is discovered you really are better off saving up a bit of money and buying some land it is actually pretty damn cheap in most bfe locations    not ever have to deal with money again    also not going to happen with a permanent location unfortunately however property tax is usually really fucking low you might need to pay 5001200 a year for a little bit of land youd be exempt from many other taxes and things for being well under the poverty line if you are not making lots of money a year then again youd also qualify for lots of things too like free things from government agencies google up stuff
  then again youd also qualify for lots of things too like free things from government agencies  inb4 op says he doesnt want to live on government charity but still wants to build a house for free on government land
  are some of those just rivers
  a lot of the land along the banks larger rivers is either public land or commercially zoned so nobody technically lives there  a lot of the green areas on that map are also uninhabited because its not actually worth habitating quite a lot alaska is uninhabitable swamp land even the injuns didnt live there and many of the big chunks of green on hawaii are because of lolvolcano plus theres the huge tracts of desert in the sw and the high plains that are basically uninhabitable without massive water projects
    you cant take adverse possession of government land they make the rules they tell you no    best you might be able to do is stake a claim and live on that property thats one of the ways you might actually be able to do some permanent structures not free but not terribly expensive either    
  see the world in comfort by living in a shitty tent eating shitty food in free blm campgrounds with other bums
buy decent tent either with no floor or cut one out  get large backpack  go out to some large uninhabited national forest lands  camp between a few spots enough to keep you out of trouble  when youre at a spot be digging down into a hole through the tent  carry out the dirt in the backpack one load at a time shawshank style and disperse along trails etc  when moving between sites cover and camouflage the holes helps if theyre far out of the way to begin with  repeat  figure out how to sneak in some wood to brace with    after a while enjoy your network of underground hidey holes as decently permanent living structures
  this sounds like something a homeless bond villain would do
  youre retarded you cant even park your car in state parks without paying    forest
    state park employee here can confirm
  i squat on public land and its ok to do on blm land in some placesoutside of that you have to keep moving camp because you create trails to where you are and cars if you park on the road will let leos know someone is back in the woods and you will get bustedso dont use cars and keep a clean camp and it helps to bring duff in and throw it around camp so if an leo finds you you can say youve only been here 3 days when youve actually been camped 17 days
does anyone here have any insight when it comes to living in montana i have been scoping out various areas in the united states to purchase a home in and montana seems like a viable option given the low cost of living and massive amount of /out/ activities
  youre at least 8 hours drive from anywhere
  i dunno i heard its pretty full
    girlfriends family lives in flathead county    cons  cold snow and ice for 78 months  summer is hot and smokey from fires  cost of living isnt as cheap as youd think  lack of real job market    pros  outdoor recreation everywhere  still has small town community feel    i would move out there in a heartbeat if i had a job secured first op
    yeah the job issue is real unless youre content with low paying tourist service industry or such or you have a skilled trade like carpentry or such and agreed on the cost of living it costs more to transport goods there because everything is so relatively remote    i lived in a rented camper in a very small camper park like a trailer park but with permanently mounted campers which was kind of rare and relatively cheap at 400 a month including all utilities 1998/99 money my jobs were all 8 an hour snowmobile tour company suit/helmet/gloves rental outfitter motel housekeeping imax usher short order cook    if you are indeed content with that level of living its pretty easy to find that kind of work in tourist towns because significant portions of the local population are transient and seasonal so theres pretty regular turnover    you can also get in on that level and network your way into other things i made a friend out there that came with family in a small pull behind camper got on a carpentry crew and by the time i left he was a ranch manager which included an awesome ranch house
    yeah its pretty cheap to live out there renting and doing seasonal work to actually put down roots though is hard housing prices are going way up in western mt girlfriends uncle manages a builders supply store and does pretty well there is a living to be made out there but it takes some resourcefulness seems like the best way to go like you said is skilled trades/construction or getting into management in retail/tourism companies
  lived in montana for 2 years at umt now back in utah    pros  if you like white people this is a place for you  beautiful scenery  low population cities  friendly people  midlevel cost of living not that cheap not that expensive mind you this was in missoula    cons  hard to find lowskill work took me over 3 months to finally find a job at a sporting good store  if you dont have a car like i didnt at the time getting around is kind of troubling everything is pretty far away from each other  air quality seems clean at first but in the city of missoula coal trains still run through the city uncovered which can cause people with sensitive respiratory systems or issues to be irritated    other  not sure if pro or con for you  cold weather for half the year i loved it but driving in it could be a pain  a lot of the businesses in the city were family owned which is good but that meant a lot of them are closed on sat/sun
its not that great stay where you are
  housing prices are going way up in western mt  gee i wonder who could be throwing around meaningless monopoly money and jacking up prices in western montana
  how /k/ is montana virginia is getting really gay and is starting to act like the blue state its been for the last 15 years
  so you want to live in montana    
  you will learn to drunk drive   also fuck off we are full
  its actually pretty expensive and very full try washington instead
  yeah the job issue is real unless youre content with low paying tourist service industry or such or you have a skilled trade like carpentry or such  tons of tech companies in bozeman and missoula these days
    i only passed through missoula but had to make semi regular trips to bozeman it would be interesting to see how things have changed over the last 20 years but i personally wouldnt have ever considered living in one of those places at the time to me bozeman was where you went when you had to have something you could only get at walmart it was good to have access to when needed but nice to have a couple hours distance from as well it was almost likened unto having to make the trip to atlanta for something scaled way down into a more tolerable level
  it would be interesting to see how things have changed over the last 20 years    so much somanypeople     that being said  its all relative and it still super easy to be /out and inna in minutes and high quality out at that     and a 20 minute drive in any direction puts you back in old school mt and 20 yrs behind
everyone here is really mean dont come  you can breath underwater here too it takes a few minutes tho
  responses like this are so tiresome people say this same shit about every state ill move wherever the fuck i want thank you very much
  yeah theres good food and beer to be had but living in bozeman proper doesnt appeal to me at all
  yes but youre more than likely an urban soiboi and wont be able to handle not having a starcucks on every block and will hopefully move back to whatever shithole from whence you came within a couple years
  this is probably one of the more soiboi proof boards on this website for what its worth
  youd probably be surprised instashit has created a lot of wannabe outdoorsmen
  montana  not a shithole
  but why leave
   if you like white people    low skill work   why have you not offed yourself anon
  correct it is not
  defending your home is tiresome  while he isnt really doing anything the end goal is just need to make your state unattractive to the urban locusts i suggest driving around new subdivisions and multifamily housing and throw bricks through out of state plate windows and selling guns to your local pillbillies
  i know browning may look bad but helena isnt that bad
  yea cause everyone needs to learn how to drunk drive
  if everyone learned how it wouldnt be such a big deal people dont even know how to sober drice and then they get to drinking and then kill people/ property
  drive
  browning is literally 3rd world
    talking about 3rd world when i lived there i made semi regular trips to the crow reservation literally natives laying all around in the streets passed out like from one spot could see maybe 20 of them scattered around    i did witness something truly majestic once there at the res i was at the place where crazy horse and his men killed custer and his which was my usual reason for visiting its essentially out in nowhere but across the road there is a visitor center / museum pretty small never saw anyone else there other than the person working standing on the front porch using the pay phone to call my father didnt have cell phones back then id call home maybe once every couple of weeks looked up and topping the hill of the road was maybe 100 natives on horseback in full traditional regalia it looked like the real deal 1700s thing    they came down the hill and entered a large field to play some sort of annual game there was a small handful of elders there to watch i was literally the only white person there this place aint much of a tourist draw at all i asked this one femanon elder what was going on and she told me they were celebrating killing custer and i was going to be the stand in it was a fucking transcendentally astounding experience that i just happened to luck up on with the timing
  its all relative given that the anime and horsefucker boards exist
what muscle groups do i need to hit to start backpacking
your back
obtain backpack  fill it with __lbs of stuff  carry it around until its easy  increase load weight and repeat process    profit
  put something heavy in you pack and do some squats and jumping jacks to get your legs used to performing with the sudden increase in weight   also core strength is important for balance with a big pack on
  weighted jumps  youre an idiot
c a r d i o  a  r  d  i  o
  its all forearms
dips then progress to weighted backpack dips and keep adding weight youll be huge in no time
stronglifts  10 kilometers running
  its just walking you tool walk more
  walk uphill more
i just walk with a weighted backpack  when i have time on weekdays i walk around 10km/6 miles with 10kg/22 pounds  on weekends i usually have a lighter load but walk as far as i can for about 6 hours when i dont have any other stuff i need to get done
regardless of going /out/ if you cant meet the minimum standards in picrelated you need to improve yourself these standards are not difficult to reach if you are not a fat body if you have a disability then it is understandable but you should still strive to maintain a level of physical fittness that you are physically capable of
    worked for me     pic related
for what its worth bringing my squat and deadlift from 135/185x5 to 335/405x5 and doing a little bit of conditioning on the side with the rowing machine and not getting fat did a lot more for my ability to carry a fukhueg pack than actually hiking with a fuckhueg pack     having said that you really shouldnt be carrying a fuckhueg pack anyway unless its your job or youre packing out elk quarters and for that your basic general fitness stuff will do just fine run walk row or cycle to get better wind lift to get stronger if you feel like you need to kettlebells are fun pushing a sled or dragging a tire mimics the joint angles of hiking up a very steep hill but is lowerimpact and potentially more convenient depending on where you live
  i can easily do that but push up and sit up repititions are not an indication of anything past 20 except how good you are at those exercises 10 weighted pushups are more impressive than 30 or even 40 normal ones
  walk/run and look up starter strength    making up something will only fuck you    l o n d o n  o  n  d  o  n
  brain put some decent thought into your kit and you can be comfy with less than 30lbs for a week
  nothing backpacking is easy i went from sitting on my ass for 9 years without exercise to hiking 100 miles climbs sucked but anybody can get up and over
  i completely agree with you but you try explaining that to a few big army types the apft is changing in 2020 but honestly the new test isnt all that amazing either it does take emphasis off of pushups and removes situps altogether however in favor for a form of curling pullup
  starter strength  starting strength    and gomad
  upper and back trapezius  deltoids  legs calves  quadriceps  hamstrings  arms triceps  biceps  forearms  id rank in importance as so for backpacking id also place a high importance for someone to focus on their posture when sitting in any chair driving and especially sleeping also just give yourself a test run with a well estimated amount of weight on your back to see what muscle groups you need to work on personally
  legs  cycling is good
squats deadlifts and rowing machine    i 1st class my pft and cft without running a mile
  lost
ss  gomad
    i still use this bodyweight routine i do when traveling and dont have weights    when i do have weights i would say that back squats and deadlifts are the most useful lifts for people like us who walk around under weight all the time
grappling    sounds dumb but it works everything you need in proportions you need them worked plus it is fun enough that it doesnt feel like a traditional workout
  so youve decided you dont need cartilage in your knees anymore huh
hey anons why arent you living the true /out/ life in a comfy green commune   
everyone welcome  unless your worldview differs from mine    the faggotry
  anarchy symbols  listing a bunch of rules underneath tho
speciesism
  they could have just wrote no politics that would have been more inclusive but thats not the point here its about their commune and according to that 30min video they seem to have a nice thing going despite whatever their /pol/ views may be i find it hard to believe that many here wouldnt agree with some of the shit said and like living in contact with nature and telling gov to fuck off as possible at it is these days
  they seem like nice enough people but this is not my idea of a true out lifestyle these people are hiding and standing still for me its about going forward and seeing new things also even in the best conditions which this is not that many munching boomers or smoking that much weed would stress me out
  i would rather hop on the rainbow trail and attended gatherings in national forests where im free to read and discuss fascist literature like platos republic and hobbes leviathan
  id love to live in a commune but theyre all chock full of hippy bellends that eat vegan only and talk about politics and like how we should all totally like get along man     id be up for starting a cult where we buy over some land and just live normally but with mysterious rituals and such
  people who are willing to share to live in communes and generally more open minded most of them lean left theres no way around it its sad to say it but right leaning communities are jebus loving paranoid types that are expecting and wishing to shit to go south its not funny people to be around but for you to for you to fully enjoy something like that leaf commune you sure as hell need to be like them or at least very open minded otherwise after a couple days you would want to start hitting people in the face with an hammer
  im not even some paranoid nutjob wanting the fall of society so i could do so much better without international trade i just want a place in the forest with a clubhouse some robes and a few illegal stills just middle of the grounds guys that like moonshine and robes how hard is that to find
  while i also hate the fags its worth understanding that anarchy means no rulers rather than no rules
  a rule is nothing without someone enforcing it  it is simply council if not enforced if enforced it is command and comes from an authority
its a shame that most people drawn to this kind of thing happen to be insufferably hipster worse than hippie it should be far more common
  rules of anarchy  all are welcome  these are not welcome    op smells like /pol/ bait thread
  how about a cult that doesnt talk about religion or politics and does pastoral pursuits with family instead    tfw all conversations with anyone you meet is about religion or politics and they always start it like it is something they have to get off their chest and your their priest
  politics from greek πολιτιkά translit politiká meaning affairs of the cities is the process of making decisions that apply to members of a group    a cult is a very political thing
  seems i was too poes law when posting
  all welcome here  no fascists  lmao
  cant have rules without a ruler to enforce them which means if they have rules they have a ruler which means theyre the antithesis of anarchists
i did but as a country lad born and raised i got too annoyed by neighbors being closer than 1km
closest green commune to me is 700/month rent
    like it should be every human society is like this
commune  commun  communist  not falling for for your tricks marx
  what you want are college educated hillbillies most fun people to be around smart enough to shun the whole trailer park extractive economy scene country enough to shoot whiskey and handguns while hating commie faggots with
  i want to but im in south georgia and there is none
mgtow commune when
  does vice insist on these quirky vocal fry hipster valley girl employees just to prevent bad people like me from watching them
  kek
  nothing wrong with being exclusive just dont lie about it for social points
going to try and do the same thing only /pol/ oriented so the same sign but inverted   and saying degenerates keep out at the bottom
    sooon friends soon keep an eye out for the thread hope you guys like alaska and /pol/itics     for real keep an eye out things are looking promising well make a thread when were ready to collect members total area is about 11131 acres if we get all the land
    why have you to make all fun things gay mgfaggowtry is just another poison find a nice woman and have a nice big family its like you fags havent been listening to our lord and savior vargster
  find a nice woman  ha
  that goblina was the worst girl ive seen in a long time what the fuck    she was so ugly unpleasant pathetic and gross even the hippies didnt seem to like her too much
  t unworthy numale
  t beta male piggy bank
  this mgtow is just another ploy to prevent 1st worlders from breeding        this is what happens when you get all your ideals about women from entertainment media and have no clue about real women then you are repelled because you are socially inept and realize that your long held ideals are nothing but mind poison pisswater
  i dont deal well with humans in a confined group for long periods i go /out/ bc of a masochistic desire to be totally alone its cathartic in a way theres no one to save you and nothing out there cares whether you live or die its up to you alone
  tfw my post about an alaska settlement was interpreted as a mgtow post      i do not understand
  the true /out/ life  comfy green commune  thats more like the true comfy hippie commune life  anarchy symbols followed by rules  all welcome here no fascists  hmmm wonder who wrote th  theyre all on mushrooms/drugs eating spaghetti sauce hamburger kimchi smoothies  sounds about right
  go into commune  kill all black people we must enstate rules and order  no one likes you  wtf
  see 
  go into commune   full of white people  kill whitey  everyone loves you  wtf

  enforcing power and ideology through violence is fascim blacks can also be facist the sign specifically states no racism your infintile understanding of politics is very embarassing please remember you must be over 18 to post on 4chan
  enforcing power and ideology through violence is fascim  based retard   fascism is class cooperation  corporatism  statism  fyi a stateless society is antifasvist by definition
  stop making up stupid definitions for words so you can call yourself it at high school without everyone thinking you are a nazi you fucking dolt
  making up stupid definitions  thats what the original fascists defined fascism as you mongoloid
  he thinks the statement no racism isnt partial against wypipo  are you a disingenuous brown/jew or a genuine fool
  as /out/ist its your moral duty to shit on and shame mgfaggsters
  me and my 16yr old friends agree that this is what this word means even though the rest of the world understand it to mean a different thing    anyway youre getting away from my point that of course a society of people without a leader dont want someone coming in and trying to be a leader
  people who invented an ideology do not get to define what the ideology is about  based retard
  no im not 16

  after a long day of pouring the community urine bucket on things doing shrooms and operating a chainsaw i like to sit down to a nice tepid bowl of rotting meaty pasta sauce blended with whatever its maximum comfy
  fascim  infintile      
  ahhhh yeah that makes sense  alright i yield
  i didnt realize you were mussolini  reminder that fascism grew out of socialism to justify the state enforcement of that ideology
specism what are they zoophiles
  probably
  vegans
    why were right here on 4chan of course shitposting in between sessions of fucking our tight tight cousins
    anarchy  /ˈanəki/  noun  1  a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority or other controlling systems ie laws/rules  2  absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual regarded as a political ideal
  its not truly free unless im allowed to threaten the existence of other people
  disliking someone doesnt threaten their existence calm down
  technically fascism is only totalitarianism per gentile all the other shit got added later and even then protofascists like f t marinetti were pretty much anarchists so even thats up for debate you cant really define fascism as a doctrine because thats never what it was    not really it was mainly disgruntled wwi veterans being disgruntled mussolini was a socialist at one point but he became a pariah after he openly declared his support for wwi so your point is null
  racism sexism speciesism transphobia are simply disliking someone    how sheltered of a life do you live
  i dont like trannies explain how my dislike is threatening their existence now stop being so hyperbolic and calm down
  no specism  oh neat a vegan commune  so essentially no hunting and fishing either
  because trans people get murdered in much higher rates than nontrans people as a result of transphobia again how sheltered of a life do you live lol
  trans  people  also theyre just going kill themselves before they turn 30 anyway what difference does it make if they get killed by someone else
  trans people get murdered in much higher rates than nontrans people  x doubt    regardless you havent explained how my dislike for trannies threatens their existence disliking/hating someone doesnt always result in murder so calm down
  whos going to pay for your hrt treatments or even be able to produce estrogenic drugs in a postcollapse society  enjoy your sodomite commune trannies wouldnt last a week in an actual shtf situation

what is the best survival and /out/door living shows   no bear shills teir shit pls
  survival  bush tucker man season 3 is all historical australian survival stories comfy with a very nice hat    
thanks this is something ill binge watch later   i enjoy the ray mears extreme survival early productions   its pretty comfy and factual also dual survival is pretty good 
survivorman that canuck was the only one who actually survived everyone else was just pretending
  alone  pretending
as shitty as it is especially due to rules like no large game alone is probably the best pound for pound because it gives a more legit sense of what its actually like to face the struggles of day to day life under a longer term survival situation you get to see people going through actually being hungry trying to function while hungry and trying to rectify being hungry which is mostly shown to be impossible without being allowed to take large game    anyway since all shows suck for varying reasons its the best turd in a big pile of shit
  post the milf
  you posted it og dual survival with dave and cody was the shit
  other than the endangered deer in patigonia where is there a restriction about the size of game that crazy dave guy shot a deer that escaped in the last season
  this why did they have to fire them and start introducing all those annoying faggots
    i only saw maybe the first three seasons i havent had tv since 1993 so i just binged them on a pirate site all at once a year or two ago
uk series bear grylls the island  that stuff is good even with bear shills    eden channel 4   was hilarious a bunch of brits move to isolated scotland end up trying to kill each other torch one of the only remaining girls houses live only on deer get chocolate and fun shit smuggled in illegally and continually fight over fucking nothing its probably the most realistic survival shtf situation since 9/10 people on it are average cowardly cucks even though they were selected for aptitude and roles   it ruled but try and watch a sped up compilation instead    most hilarious part is they werent even acknowledged for a few months channel 4 literally stopped filming them and left them to their own devices it was never broadcast lol serves the dickheads right
  ive watched a shit ton of them    id suggest you to watch survivorman avoid the ones about bigfoot and the ones with his son dual survival just the first season maybe the second one and alone    i wouldnt bother with anything else if you are craving for more go watch ray mears documentaries
im trying to think of some which ones do you all recommend

captain fantastic
  why you flanking me bro
        the rape scene didnt even need to be showed and i think the movie would have been better off not showing it not because it was a rape scene but because everything was setup to never actually show it and to only heavily imply it showing it was like they had some focus group audience of retards who couldnt keep up with the plot and needed spoon fed it was also flashbacked at the wrong time which completely fucked with the flow of the movie it was like someone changed the channel in the middle of a show to something else

          another vote against   lets combine every crime thriller movie cliche known to man into one movie  plus mediocre acting and the scenery porn people bring up to cover its shortcomings is one note and not worth watching the whole movie for

  watched that with my 3 year old about 6 months ago it holds up and has one of the all time greatest scores  
in live in an mostly urban country no forest/ flat countryside with atleast 200 inhabitants per sq km  in case of a major happening i will probably be in a city how can i survive there which type of plants can i eat can i try hunting or should i rely on scavenging
  i live in the netherlands btw maybe if there is any possible happening it might be a flood
  you get out before a major event a city will use up all its supplies incredibly quickly because thats where all the people that use supplies like to live then itll just be warring gangs for the last scraps till the meanest baddest gang survives and heads out to fight the baddest gang from the next city
  the issue is that even the countryside is reaally populated and flat should i do like pic
  dont listen to this retards just do this fill you house with supplies and board that shit up dont open for no one not a soul let them all die and when the dust has sattle and you can only hear the wind do some scouting and try to find information about evacuated zones and go there when shtf it wont be a war with shit ton of artilary destroying everything so you house will be some what intact just dont open the door and answer the screams of the masses let them all dieenglish isnt my main language so sorry if there is to many mistakes im just a lurker
    watch this do the exact opposite
birdscatsratsdogs and look into insects also if there will be any left when the shit calms down  boil them thoroughly though   but you will probably need at least a pellet gun or bow for that or really good trapping skills

  apparently its fake
    the siege of sarajevo was the siege of the capital of bosnia and herzegovina and the longest of a capital city in the history of modern warfare3 after being initially besieged by the forces of the yugoslav peoples army sarajevo was besieged by the army of republika srpska from 5 april 1992 to 29 february 1996 1425 days
  you gonna get raped by nigger gangs the first week
  hes not saying the bosnian civil war was fake lol just that dudes account of the siege the city he claimed to have survived in does not exist and the author is not actually bosnian or even yugoslavian the guy who wrote that was a belorussian larper who was trying to make a quick buck selling prepping books and courses to westerners im not saying the information isnt potentially useful for shtf but most of what he described never took place women whoring themselves for a single can of soviet spam etc in bosnia there are literally hundreds of books and millions of people still alive today who lived through the war it was only in the 90s if you want to actually learn about what it was like    t croatfag born after the war
  you should do this assuming you know how to operate a boat read the weather fish etc a boat is the ultimate gtfo vehicle if you live close enough to the ocean
  anyone whos actually serious about survival would not live in a metropolitan area
  run towards the city wearing all black during the day  if you happen to be out in the open move quickly   use less traveled areas like railroad lines which are out in the fucking open  perfectly good wooded area next to the train tracks to ambush people who are doing exactly what this guy recommends  mfw    thats within the first 5 minutes of the video jesus anon you werent kidding about doing the exact opposite thing still going to watch the rest of the video though because these shows are a guilty pleasure of mine i unironically own a few seasons of man vs wild
    you need    1 guns and ammo because people are savages in survival situations where resources are meek  2 food and water at least enough which can traverse 50mi with what youre carrying on your back  3 a dog who is trained to attack on command it will be faster than you and a buffer to die in your place in case of attackers  4 water filtration and multivitamins you use the filter to filter water and use the vitamins to supplement yourself when youre eating garbage  5 a radical sense of heroism and desperation because what else doesnt get you out of a shtf situation other than balls to the wall gusto and mojo

  domestic cat is probably the most dangerous invasive species of all mammal kin they need to be exterminated

  but every continent has a domestic of the pantera genus anon
i live in the uk rewilding is almost always detrimental to the habitats within the uk    its unfortunate because the argument of we fix things by just not doing anything and leaving it all be is an extremely easy one to explain and to push where as explaining actual beneficial conservation activities can be difficult because you cant get the average person to sit still long enough to listen about it    this only applies to the uk before you all jump down my throat
  id argue that we as a species are worse also its us who bring domestic cats everywhere we go

  ive watched into the wild like 20 times in the past week im feeling pretty rewilded
  only in the pnw which is or wa or norther ca  elsewhere just find out the meaning of man self dominance being firm in your descisions practice essential skills such as starting a fire woodcraft cooking etc basic bushcraft  be completely in control and in agreement with your understanding of the truth dont waiver when others question it even if you later on acknowledge that maybe you were wrong  find youtube vids on a martial art and practice what you can self dominance starts in knowing your own bodys mechanics learn your limits and gradually push past them dont let others make you waiver on your path    but yeah your eyes will start to show how wild youre getting    i lost my eyes wild eyes due to some events in the last 2 years so im trying to get that back im starting with the main culprit and working from there once ive dealt with him ill be able to get my sight back my self dominance and eventually peace of mind    i dont like to destroy others hopefully with this clash ill break him down and build him up stronger hes a cuck onions boy sadly hes in his 60s so i need to restructure his world view    tldr  a wild man is one that has dominated his flesh and destroyed the chains that others have placed on himconqueror and unapologetic
  just get a dog that does that
  based also cats are not suitable as pets anyway they also drive birds lizards and mice to extinction because theyre native to africa not eu/na  theyre literal niggers you should train your dog to kill them on sight its legal too if they trespass on your property my uncles dog kills cats regularly

  hes talking about the shrink who put him on meds and im pretty sure wild eyes are what the rest of society calls crazy eyes    and before he calls me a cuck onions boy yes i do bushcraft yes i can start a fire yes i train mt/boxing yes there is full contact sparring but if not killing cats and not having gay sex makes me an onions cuck boy  call me french onion soup
  french onion soup faggot let this manly man of sane mind explain his reasons and stop putting words in his mouth and gang stalking his tulpa     half of this thread is peoples personal feelings relative to them what does rewilding even mean but hey at least its the probably oc and not the weekly pastas of  what knife/tent/boots/rucksack do i buy  how do i crap in the woods  normies and car campers get out of my /out/ reeeeeeee   how do i run away from moms basement and live innatent  how do i become alex supertramp  cast iron is great/terrible

  i live in scotland and went river swimming yesterday rewilding is absolutely possible in the uk wtf are you talking about
  oh and i was 30 feet from beaver dens and the whole area is full of beaver markings
    things like muirburn and heather swiping on moorland moorland has been expanded by man in this country but now that its here and is managed the way most private land owners do its an incredible habitat for all sorts of flora and fauna  its an ecological paradise but people see it being set ablaze and freak out or assume thats bad or that because it looks like a barren hill rather than a forest that theres nothing there and that it should go back to being woodland all that happens if you abandon heather moorland to itself it just becomes engulfed in bracken and mature heather 8 feet deep that supports rabbits and not much else raptors wont touch it its too dense for larger mammals theres no light or space for anything else to grow    we have something like 80 of the worlds heather moorland in scotland alone and a good chunk of the rest is in england but yeah we could totally rewild that by planting a man made pine wood on it     then theres forestry people look at us out working in the woods felling trees and planting and changing things and wonder why things cant just be left so that nature will take its course well much the same would happen perpetual wind damage creating holes in the woods which give new opportunities for the wind to get in and cause even more damage an abundance of fuel for fires not to mention the fact that most small woods have been planted by man for specific purposes at this point cover for game or livestock wind breaks screens you name it     weve done so much to the environment at this stage that letting nature take its course would be a disastrous in the long term the average person that seems to thinks visiting the wales or going north of the central belt in scotland is going into the wilderness is ignorant of all of that though try explaining that to them nevermind with the science to back it up theyd rather recycle whatever chris packhams opinion is and let nature take over

what is going on in this thread   stop using the climate control in your home unless its something that needs tended just keep the pipes from freezing  when something breaks fix it dont buy a new one  go to the store and buy raw ingredients no premade food in your whole house  pick a few outdoorsy topics you like and start reading on them extensively avoid screens except to learn new skills  if you have to buy something make sure its bought secondhand and longlasting/ easily repaired  make peace with uncleanliness dont live like a pig but know that not everything has to be sparkling and dirt wont kill you  there youre 60 rewilded and you didnt have to leave your slumhole apartment the rest is just going /out/ and practicing the things you have learned about from the books and observing natural patterns and such
  it sounds like a normal day in méxico  kek
    this    also  dont shampoo your hair everyday do it once a week at most   take cold showers  stop living within the constraints of time maintain a healthy sleep schedule but go to sleep and sleep in whenever you want without stressing  stop worrying about useless little everyday bullshit
  youre correct on the facts but i disagree with your conclusions rewilding the uk would be pretty easy if we just reduced useless subsidized sheep farming by 80 and reduced the deer population back to reasonable levels     walking around highland perthshire you see tree saplings on every little scrap of waste ground forests are much more diverse than heaths the only reason oak forests dont grow on wild areas is the deer eat all the saplings but you still see lots of oak saplings trees are trees they will grow anywhere there might be some butterflies and flies on heathland but apart from that its pretty lifeless and heather doesnt stop trees growing you often see birches colonising heather areas that farmers have left alone
  i actually came back to say most of this its been shown that trees evetually do grow back and block out the light to bracken eventually and species weve lost or have become endangered would flourish again of course there are species that wouldnt benefit anymore from the lack of open spaces such as moorland but there are other areas of open land where they would still survive this article although discussing farmland i feel is still relevant mildly and has point for and against    i know you are northumberland anon and i know you have a bias nay maybe vested interest in the moorland but with several options of rewilding i feel you are maybe blinded by your requirement for livelyhood and what a nice way to earn a penny or two rewilding to return britain to its older more natural state living on the edge of moorland that will famously kill you for not wearing your hat ive often pondered this very subject and wonder who would protect the interests of these forests from development and human interaction and sometimes i come to the conclusion that at least the moorlands are protected and upkept because of the revenue dumb grouse shooters provide im much rather see woodland and trees than dour wet endless moorlands i do go out on but would leaving the moorland to rewild really provide that  theres only one way to know find out
  not schizo but i could be misinterpreted as such what  said about crazy eyes is the closest i can say tho i like the term from an anime the sight of kings or something like that    its a look that shows determination that looks as if youre being pierced like the one looking at you knows everything good or bad about you    as for the breaking of the old dude hes a simp/white knight who doesnt really understand how the true system is set up nature and its hierarchy and has fallen for the construct that society has set up think sjw    also no meds/shrink im actually pretty grounded in reality though i do try to understand things on a deeper level descent into chaos since i have to bring to some kids im involved with currently but i dont get lost in the chaos      youll find that the descent into chaos and not getting lost is the most essential to rewilding since it helps nurture your selfdominance and everything thereafter is you building upon it    attempting to rewild without self dominance will leave you with many weakpoints and insecurites    but i think that part of the rewilding falls to /x/    another way to think of rewilding is to think of the term sovereign since everything tied in with sovereignty is the liberty of the wilderness but the self dominance surety and rule of oneself
  oh and as to why i lost my eyes crazy eyes  a girl a lie a simp and my own unwillingness to speak

    i need you to understand that without going into details you just come off as batshit insane youre not helping anyone rewild by causing them to associate the concept with the mental image of a raving lunatic
    gis  followed a gis course during my bachelors degree seemed a cool way to use ecological data in a practical/policymaking way whats so soulcrushing about working as a gis analyst
  i do poos on the lawn
shit piss bathe and eat in the wild when i can i rarely eat what i havent grown or killed myself
  most engineers look down on gis because its not as complex as the other applied fields you dont really develop the same quality stem skillset assuming petrol is gone engineers are mediocre fags in general why not take the bit more fun and less headaching route
  i need you to understand that without going into details you just come off as batshit insane youre not helping anyone rewild by causing them to associate the concept with the mental image of a raving lunatic  k  who or what is the highest authority in you life what dictates your actions  a concept a person a desire an object lifestyle  meditate on this thought you have to know what drives you  after youve established your personal authority your god your interactions with people must be dictated by this authority your morality    youll notice that if you follow this youll probably have a lot of contentions/arguments/fights with people over seemingly stupid things dumb arguments revolving around your morality    but how does this help rewild you  you are establishing your own system outside the accepted system and because the accepted system cant control your actions impulse thoughts you will be wild by all who see you this doesnt mean destructive unless thats the desired goal and conclusive moral tenet but it mean chaos unrestricted chaos with no master or shame to act  this doesnt mean to be constantly at war with people just that those people have no say in your world    in effectyou have become wild but the sweet part is the change that happens internally you have this great internal security surety in you actions your thoughts become calculated theres more way more but me not being able to articulate myself better ill leave that for better people to divulge one of the external effects of this internal change is the sight of kings which is that crazy eyes but damn that sight is what women are looking for and with reason it shows that you have your own kingdom that you rule and you rule supreme though to name it crazy eyes is a bit off id describe it as a piercing sight that shows determination self dominion fire and an ability and disposition to deploy force if necessary     is that good enough
  i should add    one of the reasons that solitude help in cultivating this wild is due a lack of external influences putting their input while you meditate on god    you want the purest source of your god and to build your morality or laws based on this    if your god is wild then you must find the essence of wild  if your god is liberty find the essence of liberty if war the essence etc      only when you mediate on the enssence of your god can you discover the laws governing him/her and once you establish those laws and act with conviction then youll be in your own world/kingdom and you will be seen as wild unless your god is already accepted by society then youll be as wild as a hyena in a pack of hyenas but even then they are wild compared to pride of lions or herd of buffalo

    you should read some of jeanpaul sartres work on absolute freedom i agree with many of the concepts you mentioned though the way you convey them is a little roughhewn     what i meant though is your personal story if you reference to something you experienced in such a summary way you rob your audience of the opportunity to judge your actions and motivations for themselves in a way you are restricting their freedom to interpret your ideas and thereby hampering their progress to becoming the masters of their selves we build our identity and our ideas not only through introspection but also through observation and subsequent analysis of the observed and how it fits within our current views
  heres the disgruntled gis analyst rant  because your boss will never be a gis person youre going to be made to do a bunch of really stupid shit by people who have no idea of what giscience entails i havent made a map in two years and the giant sluggish global mccorp that bought my firm keeps pissing off the dangerman who keeps threatening to pull our arcmap license which is the only way i can do my job inb4 open source that toolkit i need does not exist anywhere else there is a whole team of software devs working right next to me who arent allowed to build the tool because a legion of middle managers at mccorp stole all of our servers and told us to move all of our processes to the cloud and they are busy doing that im training four employees and responsible for getting a dataset of over two million features with complex attribution out of the door to market every quarter and i dont even make 20/hr

  the very concept of conserving other species exists because of white men you nihilist nigger dont lump us in with parasites who just want to mindlessly consume
  sup fellow gis anon    you tried whitebox shits got hella functionality
  no my question though is why was this dead thread brought back to life  see  another anon mentioning that this thread was dead        i agree with many of the concepts you mentioned though the way you convey them is a little roughhewn  im not much of an intellectual or well read im a simple man given the keys to the universe with limited instruction or information    thats the best ive got as for my story it was just a stepping stone in reaffirming what i already knew    consider this  youve discovered the truth and your behavior matches it  according to how ive described it above  you meet an individual that is threatened by your sense of self dominion and security he then starts showing his insecurity and looking for minor flaws in you to justify an attack or discrediting you  at every meeting he looks for a weekness in you while unconsiously showing tells that he has insecurities and is actually being guided by a false idol female on the pedestal    cont
    that is him a cowardly white knight only fighting when he thinks he can get away with it as a justification to deal with his own insecurities     all of his behavior is dictated and falsely justified by this false idol not by any conviction of truth discovered and established within himself but an external force which is why now his behavior has changed recently when i showed a bit of direct assertiveness against his position he shirked and started showing his insecurity after thrashing around so to speak and throwing indirect insults speaking as if hes god himself indirectly trying to insult me and weak justifications and then indirectly trying to make peace by indirectly saying that we were both to blame    when he tried to get information on why i showed assertiveness which is threatening to his position he sent his son after i didnt give any information he sent his wife and she did her own probing and failed now i am just dropping them and leave them scratching their head but he never talked to me directly never this is what i mean by dealing with him it means putting him in a corner where he cant feign ignorance and avoid accountability where he wont hide behind his wifes skirt or his son    another trick he has used when confronted by others has been feigning that the holy spirit is guiding him and thats why those other people are being offended when his topics always coincide with arguments or disagreements that hes had with the very people hes offended    had he come to me and talked to me face to face i wouldve been clear and honest direct but he wanted to play being prudent while letting a problem he started grow way beyond his control all to avoid accountability    he confused me keeping my mouth closed the same as not being able to defend myself and now he knows that will counter him at every mistake he makes and thats why he has changed his behavior and routine    cont
  now the reason this whole thing happened in a deeper level is do to his god is truly different that mine i have always chosen truth and started from there even if it hurts or keeps me alone    his god judging from his character is his wife and keeping her pleased the truth is secondary if he can twist the truth to match his goal hell do it otherwise hell ignore it
  another trick he has used when confronted by others has been feigning that the holy spirit is guiding him  is this guy in some sort of cult you have a weird life anon please continue
  is this guy in some sort of cult  hes christian but its funny that you mention cult a new girl a relative of mine joined us for a while but she told her brother that she felt it was like a cult i had the same feeling but i didnt know exactly where to place that feeling till he said that and it pretty much fits and its the reason i believe that he was threatened by my appearance there and attempted to destroy who i am because my being there shows faults that he has and thats a threat i think its also his way to avoid being confronted or held accountable      im a reflection of his weak selfdominion his weak convictions weak authority etc dont get me wrong he can speak with gusto about god he is very excitable about prosperity not biblical prosperity tho joel olstein prosperity as in you come to this churchthe building and god will bring you prosperity this church is the temple of god antibiblical etc    i recently flipped the script and hes started settling down as explained above but i still need to work him over to fix those flaws i dont hang out with people that lower my attempts at selfperfection or whatever itd be called and if im obligated to stay around them its either keep them far away from me or build them up    youd be surprised how making yourself wild will have a lot to do with this perfection since you wont allow less from yourself than the best and wont accept anyone making you degrade yourself into complacency and not reaching perfection unless the individua wants to wild himself just to fuck around or to do degenerate shiet then hed be already in the other end of the wild spectrum    i think thats that for a quick explanation leading up to the loss of my eyes    this is stressful since hes not my responsibility but i have family that goes there and theyre new to christianity and i dont want to dissuade them but the leader is doing that himself
  hmm i will check it out thanks
  ill add on probably this last post    the reason i mentioned the loss of my eyes is because of this one reason    if youre not careful someone will come around and attempt to destroy you either directly or indirectly    theyll attack your convictions your character your views in life every part of you that youve worked on that shows that youre secure    they will be threatened by your confidence  you will be seen as a threat they see that you are a threat because your words are confident because they are true because your actions are confident and sure because they are based off of your truth every thing you say will carry such a weight and power that the most minor thing to you will wound them     you are a threat because you are true  and because of that they will attempt to attack you from every direction by any means using anything that they can even your own family and those you love    and if you dont catch it and you dont counter when needed if you dont have someone you can lean on not trust because an argument can turn them against you when you are exhausted from the constant attacks you will begin to lose your confident posture your sure step and that fire in your eyes    for me this was the case and i hope that in some way it helps those who are trying to wild or trying to regain their wild
so let me try to interpret your words you had an argument with a female maybe your ex girlfriend maybe you share other ties your argument escalated to the point where she either insulted or assaulted you and you responded in kind or with restraint because this girl is placed on aa pedestal by at least her mother the father has confronted you and/or sent his son to confront you you have somehow rebuffed them and somewhere along the way the father has made a slip up that left him vulnerable before you a vulnerability that opened him to hearing your words    tell me how close am i
  you had an argument with a female  yes/no i tried to put a barrier between a female the mom of the girl i wanted to date and myself to limit the interaction and protect myself from false accusations which worked to an extent  the reason that i wanted to do this our family has a habbit of getting the unsolicited attraction from females some females with my dad sometimes even flirt with my dad in front of my mom my dad is 70 this happened the year before last and its not the first time   maybe your ex girlfriend  no mother of the girl i wanted to date  maybe you share other ties  shes the wife of my moms cousin three times removed and her husbands cousin once removedi think  complicated stuffdont judge    your argument escalated to the point where she either insulted or assaulted you and you responded in kind or with restraint  no assault but when i did try to put up the barrier think limitations on social interactions she did get offended and her actions the next few days was to dress in a way that confirmed what i knew but wanted to avoid confirming    because this girl is placed on a pedestal by at least her mother the father has confronted you and/or sent his son to confront you  idk about her parents but it wasnt they who confronted me but the pastor and it wasnt even confrontation but attacks from the pulpit along with looks and basically ostracizing me which was just him since i continued talking with everybody else even her mother after the fact as if nothing happened    cont
  another way to think of rewilding is to think of the term sovereign since everything tied in with sovereignty is the liberty of the wilderness but the self dominance surety and rule of oneself  anon freeman
  i jerked off in the woods does that count
  he tried to take up a cause that wasnt his to take    this showed me that the pastor and his wife are the nosy gossiping type at one point almost a year later i was around him and his son and i mentioned something relating to civilization/society and its downfall is akin to a vain/whoreish woman relating to the bible book of ezekiel that same week as were sitting around during a study the girls mom mentions that shes not a vain woman almost out of place and gives me a defensive look as if she was trying to make sure i knew    this confirmed other things about the pastor and most likely his wife since i doubt he had a private conversation with this relative    it wasnt till after he tried to brush it all under the rug as if nothing happened and treated me in a way as if expecting me to be complacent with that that i decided i wouldnt stand for it    its one thing for him to act out of ignorance but to work on his faults so i gave him an opportunity to fix his faults and seek me out and talk not once did he attempt it but decided to act as if he never did anything    you have somehow rebuffed them and somewhere along the way the father has made a slip up that left him vulnerable before you  that brings me to this septoct when i took initiative and caught him on his own turf and he realized he slipped and went on the offensive when he saw that it didnt affect me he went on the defensive when he saw i got gutsy he tried to go on the offensive again and when he saw it didnt work he tried the we all are at fault and eventually when he saw that i wasnt having any of it he sent in his son so probe then his wife then he and his wife    not once has he directly come up to me to confirm if i have something against him and i already realized that he wont since he want to have the fall back of feigning ignorance and avoid accountability    a vulnerability that opened him to hearing your words  cont
  a vulnerability that opened him to hearing your words  vulnerability that i can exploit at a later time to justify being critical towards him in the future and to at more pressure on him till he snaps other than that i havent caught the ha moment that i can use to expose his character in the light where he cant squirm and depend on plausible deniability    i have a few things im looking to exploit  his prudence which hes proven isnt prudence but cowardice to speak in a way that will put him in a place of accountability  his leadership which hes shown he lacks by lacking proper ministration/oversight  his inclination to fight from a distance and not talk face to face using others to do his dirty work    overall its more fun and entertaining than a game of command and conquer or any tactical game ive played recently since most of the moves have to be read and analyzed in my mind first then look for a way to apply my moves sadly for him i spent my teens reading military field manuals looking for ways to apply the art of war honing my charisma and analyzing and deploying units according to their abilities    this man weaseled out from serving in the mexican military and im sure he doesnt understand why god is also called the lord of hosts being in adversity is my realm i do this all of the time  pic related its me      close but not really since its not feasible for a poor or uneducated man such as myself    yes
  thru hike did it for me warning tho your soul dies out there and you become something else you realize how empty existence really is
  your soul dies out there  isnt it the other way around
  isnt it the other way around  yes it really is
    you are weak and small youll be crushed by natures wrath in the coming years ill help
  i dont think youre insane anon i get where youre coming from easy to see what the others saw but they just do not understand decucking goes so far beyond what most redpilled people can understand into mental territory that they do not even know exists
  it has been my firm belief that the totality of the bible is designed to expand on these simple concept    deprogramming from the lies and reprogramming with a sincere search/desire of truth/decucking/liberation  personal responsibility/control of ones sphere of influence/sovereignty  and maintaining them    the enuma elish basically sets the groundwork telling us what is the extent of our cuck like behavior and unwillingness to be responsible and the bible gives us the key to escape it even if theres no belief in a god too many people are quick to accept the mainstream presentation of it 503c1 preachers and miss out on the truth behind it    thnx for seeing past the ramblings
  lets burn copernicus oh wait the people doing that werent real christians aka no true scotsman    i really enjoyed the dark ages absolutely hilarious that it took 1500 years to catch back up to the ancient greeks on basic matters of science and philosophy no wonder the english women went with the pagan viking chadbros instead of the unwashed cuckolded christian men
  the catholic church was perverted by the synagogue of satan long ago gnosticism was the true religion of jesus and thats exactly why the catholics were burning the gnostics and theirs texts for 2000 years you mention the ancient greeks  gnostic thought was founded there in the west at least
  dark ages  funny how it was the christians that were persecuted martyred for their faith at around that time and on even till now by the church and other religions and governments and even funnier is the fact that most cucks are on the left of the atheist inclination    why were they martyred and not left to live  because they wouldnt bow down to false gods or doctrines  conviction  which is something that those who arent wild would do in a split second if faced with the same option see christians and jews who converted to islam rather than die they werent chads they were the true cucks    now since you were quick to mention the dark ages id like to mention the connection between the dark ages islam and the crusades since they all go hand in hand    heres a hint  islam  began mid 7th century  crusades  began at the end of the 10th begining of the 11th century in response to islamic invasion of christiandomread as murder of christians from the christian arab nations way up into christian spain italy greece etc the evidence is there in the arab genes that the population have rape babies  dark ages  same as the crusades    also what  said  islam is a tool of the catholic church an extension of the pharisees aka jews and the inquisition directed towards christians labeled heretics is the best argument against your muh no true scotsmen    seek the truth god first before entering into religious politics    ps  sorry to other anons for veering off topic this is my last post on this topic religion
  was home schooled in the forest with spears and no electronics so never really tamed till i went to a public high school by the end of high school i had stopped wearing shoes normies laughed but i fought the system last summer i discovered the joy of wearing only a loincloth and using mud and ash for natural camouflage stalked a lot of animals just to admire them
  this is the best way to go /out/ wearing clothes when theyre not needed just dulls one of your senses without any benefits
  isnt pic related quote from that exkgb dude i watched the interview a few years back scary stuff
  what is the relationship of truth with power
  yeh yuri bezemenov      it depends on your position in relation to the truth    you cant hide the truth and if the truth reveals your weakness it is a stength for your adversary to know your weakness    youd need a wiser man than i to draw the connections for you/us
  well most people who werent raised by wolves need to wear shoes because their feet are too weak and atrophied to avoid injury
  i once jacked off on a mountaintop
    this guy knows
    what the fuck are you even talking about right now
  im saving money on heat by turning it down a bunch and just getting used to being colder  when it really gets to be winter im just gonna layer
  rewilding is almost always detrimental to the habitats within the uk  false place is full of near worthless farmland from an ecological perspective
trying to rewild myself by going on a longdistance hike this summer i have a month to kill and think that the complete oregon coast trail would be the best option for me    thoughts/tips what other good hikes of similar length are there
  ive wanted to do something like this also
  like to get some quality out time in a loin cloth and boots barefoot when possible but the snow and ice can get to been a bit too chilly on the toes after a while
  are you grateful for the way you were raised   sitting through high school must have sounded boring as hell
  sauce pls
im considered or rather planning on becoming a vagabond and leaving my shitty urban serf life behind i wake up every day in fear and wanting to scream because of the realization that ive been raised as a slave to modern civilization its agonizing to feel like a trapped animal every second youre awake and not being able to do anything about it besides simply cutting it off and leaving    i seriously want to just fuck off and become some wandering hermit i dont even care about dying at this point because i would rather kill myself than remain a slave ive never felt freedom in my entire life
  absolutely based    you only live once buddy fucking do it i know im romanticizing it and id be bored stiff craving my bed by the 2nd night but fuck dude at least id go out like a man
okay /out/ how do i embrace asceticism im looking for peak /ascetics/ here
  i rape grown men
  i didnt think id get to the point where id instantly be suspicious of someone based on their eyebrows and that could ruin a photo for me but here i am a very sad man
  ere you are pal took me a good minute to find this i never thought id find a reason to share it hope you like it  
this seems interesting but people like    ruin it
  100 im so unbelievably grateful for my parents high school was really boring but i didnt stop me from going /out/ and it was only temporary im in the infantry now and although they make me wear boots i still get an awful lot of time /out/ which makes me happy
  sauce would be me anon
i go out in the state forests and hike around and shoot shit with my sks  waiting for deer season to end before i go again cause i dont want an arrow in the back from some deranged deer hunter
  rolling around in the dirt and barked at passerbys  nah im kidding i took some survival classes and learn new skills
  stop being fussy with food stop leaving parts uneaten because you dont like them i have noticed a difference between how my grandfather leaves nothing but bones after a meat dinner and me eating like a bitch just getting the nice parts i changed that and you could say it is quite rewilding
  i have to know  why would you do this
  for to learn the ways of the cold and freeze out the weakness
      this is great im going to try this over the weekend

  sorry i meant the rocks not the flora
i havent shaved in a while
  holy shit it might actually fit me  feeling good about it  i wanna go wild
   it is the burden we must bare
  what is your motivation for asceticism spiritual religious philosophical something else    it is important to know what this is to help to determine what the form the ascetical practice one should take to be    im going to wager a guess that is st francis of assisi in the pic you posted and if there is any meaning behind it you might enjoy the series how to live a simple life by peter owenjones hes an anglican vicar that follows the rule of st francis for a whole year specifically not touching or handling money in any form    if you like that series then i can also recommend extreme pilgrim by him as well both of these are available on youtube just search i have found these documentaries insightful in understand asceticism as a whole better even if it isnt always about that and only touches on certain perspectives of it
whats the best way to excise the söy from my bones through /out/ activities
  i recommend killing something and eating it
  stalk people  pretend youre hunting them observe people from a concealed elevated position follow them and track their movements see how close you can get to them undetected follow them laterally off the trail sneak in at night or other opportunity and steal something small or edible    pretty primal shit mildly dangerous completely accesses your savage predatory monkey brain
    both incredible suggestions thanks anons

i need to fence an acre i have no money so ill be doing a wattle fence ill be cutting down the wood needed over the winter the wood is mainly young growth pine trees i live in southern canada where we can get 20 winters and deep snow    question  1 how dry will the wood be by spring time will it still be flexible because of the melting snow  if not  2 will submerging the wood make it flexible again how long should it be submerged  3 any zero cost tips to preserve wood from rot skinning too young to have bark lightly burning
why not just wait till spring and use it as you cut it down it will be most flexible that way and dry in posistion
  1 for wattle fence you need to use green pliable branches for easiest building seasoned stuff will require some finessing seasoned wood flexibility will depend on wood type and species    2 soaking the wood will help make it a little more flexible but not by much it will help introduce extra fungal spores into places they shouldnt be and make them rot faster steaming is a better method but the amount of material involves will make that prohibitive    3 not much you can do for free removing the bark will help prevent water from laying in against the wood every time it rains without the bark they will dry out much faster however partially seasoned wood with the bark left on would be better to start with that way when you remove the bark the wood wont split as it dries out at a faster rate using species like locus or cedar will have natural antirotting chemicals in them burning wood for preservation is actually a technique called yakisugi or shou sugi ban that will need a lot of fuel for an entire fence but is a viable way to help give them a little bit of extra weather resistance    check out these threads     theres also another method but it will depend on the type of trees you are using that is to take an easily rooted tree such as willow and make a living fence you shove the ends deeply into the ground weave them into whatever pattern you wish and keep them watered if they grow and are all the same species they will form into a dense fence all the cross sections will also grow together as one trees there are many designs this is the cheapest way to make a very long lasting fence you cant do that with pine trees unless it is the tree with root ball they dont root from cuttings that i know
  if youre needing to keep small animals in/out a wattle fence is a good idea but a fuckload of work if youre doing it to keep large farm animals in and people notified a splitrail fence is a lot less work and can be easily done with dry wood
  1
  if youve got bigger logs on your property why not just do this type of fence    i saw them in williamsburg looks easy to do and fairly sturdy
  a worm fence really needs a post in the corners if animals are involved
  the amount of time its gonna take you to build a fence like that around 1 acre is enormous    you could probably spend 1/4th the time by getting a minimum wage job holding a sign on a street corner and then buying barb wire
  too much time i need to collect now and build in time for spring      no willows and growing a fence would put this year to waste      a lot of work the animals are goats and if the fence holds pigs the next year      no money for mesh      i need over 1000ft this would take a small forest       agreed my family is pushing for that this year will determine my life though wage slave or farmer    summary  1560ft fence length    520 sections and posts  chop 67 posts per day jan  feb    15 600 slats   chop 2025 slats per day jan  feb    95 days sundays off    in march 20 holes per day place 20 posts per day slats in 20 sections per day minimum    animals in on april 1st    i originally wanted a solid wattle fence but i may do 1nch gaps maybe halving the amount of slats needed     im going to do my best but may instead create a wattle around the garden for new chickens instead 320ft total push back the goat/pig fencing for next year which will hurt me because i need livestock asap    pic not mine but my original prototype was a brush fence posts holding compacted loose brush to form a dense wall ive gone over cheaper and faster options i may have to go down a notch from wattle to brush  in any case the posts are a must i can fudge the post spacing if i need to switch between the two fence types brush now slowly replace with wattle     i have access to a forest and the material is plentiful
  start of december to end of february i mean
  becoming a farmer when youre already poor is a real bitch
    i would not put that much effort into building something that flammable    have you ever raised a goat before    do you know how easily they can climb over fences    you could make a pen for them at night and stake them out during the day
  you cant afford a fence but you are going to provide a heated building for winter for them will you slaughter all of them in fall
  the animals are goats  on an acre  so it will be few goats i guess you might as well just chain them up and change the spots everyday  i guess you will be just pasturing them because you got no money for feed
  goats  acre    you only need a strand or two of electric fence even adding a 3rd strand will be very inexpensive just put the first strand at nose height for adults and the second strand at nose height for the kids all additional strands go below the nose height fiberglass rods are really cheap plugin fence chargers are really cheap too    youll need about 835 feet of wire for a single strand of wire to go around a perfect square acre more or less depending on the actual shape of your acre just multiple for each extra strand of wire where i live a 1/4 mile roll of 14 gauge fence wire 1320 feet is just under 40 at one store and a 1/2 mile roll of 17 gauge fence wire 2640 feet is just under 35 at another store short fiberglass fence posts are anywhere from 150 to 3 each but you can use wooden stakes as long as you use some insulators you can make your own insulators from black plastic water/gas pipe dont use white or red pipe because the suns uv will destroy them quickly i dont even know how many black plastic pipe electric fence insulators ive made over the years for myself and my neighbors oodles of them at least a plugin fence charger is as cheap as 3545 depending on where you can find/order one    thats the cheapest easiest and quickest fencing you can install    goats are escape artists making a solid wall fence for them means they just use it to climb over youll need electric anyway to keep them in
  electric fence  isnt it a bit overdoing it
  not for goats
  nope for goats to stay in you need electric fencing anything else theyll just climb over
  no money for mesh    why dont you make some fucking money you literally have like 4 months youre saying you cant come up with like 100 dollars in that time are you retarded or just that lazy you dont need to cut down 100 fucking trees to make a fence for your bullshit    get a job this shit pisses me off you could shovel snow this winter and make enough for your entire fence
impossible
hardmode no bushcraft ill just make my socks out of bark each night shit
  1kg try 450g
not counting clothes possible i went an entire weekend with just my modded mora companion mg and a fiberglass recurve bow during bow hunting season for small game it was totally just to prove that i could originally the plan was to go in with just my edc modified companion and carve the bow myself or make a bundle bow but upon practicing at home i discovered that its just not worth the trouble to make a bundle bow of green wood that shoots straight with high enough draw weight for small game and it took way too long to carve a bow out of dead seasoned wood so i would lose too much time so i said fuck it and took my vintage 45lbs draw fiberglass power jet and just carved my own arrows in the field and did duct tape fletching    total gear    morakniv companion mg with the following under a paracord wrap on the sheath  water purification tabs one unlubricated condom 15 of jute twin 2ply 10 of black duct tape 30 1100 paracord 20 braid of 550 as a sort of lanyard on the belt clip ferro rod and striker that screws together   handmade leather belt pouch containing a small folded piece of leather and a few scraps of fat wood   45lbs draw weight 60 1961 ben pearson power jet recurve bow with string silencers    built a shelter out of tree limbs and downed trees lashed together with paracord with a builtin cot to keep me off the ground built at an angle to reflect heat from the fire onto me made a like fire circle carved some arrows from tree branches duct tape fletching hunted two rabbits gathered water from a nearby stream with the condom in one of my socks boiled it in a pot i made from birch bark for drinking water with purification tabs for good measure gathered some wild onions and other greens made rabbit stew enjoyed the weekend     it was one of those things where i was hanging out with some friends we were watching reruns of survivorman and dual survival and they dared me to go hunting with as little as possible
  ps thanks for reading my blog post kek
  that was an awesome account anon got me inspired
  normally i do my bushcraft weekends with a decent amount of gear hammock hatchet freeze dried meals etc and just spend the weekend doing green woodworking innawoods and sometimes i do full normal camping trips where i take my whole backpack which has about 30lbs of various gear like billy can/pot mess kit camp stove etc but my next goal is inspired by two things the jomsviking youtube channels and recently finding out via dna testing that my dads side that i thought were german because of our very german surname were actually all from norway and sweden and only moved to germany about 70 years ago so im going to try a weekend camping only with tools and clothes my norse ancestors wouldve had access to i already actually have historically accurate clothing as best as can be discerned from historical accounts and digs but im forging my own seax since theyre all either expensive as fuck or total garbage fantasy replica shit im going to dry my own meats and making my own brown bread butter etc and spend a weekend in the brutal cold where i live its a warmer day today at 6c with wind chill making it feel like 3 or 43f but feels like 21f for murricans with 40km/25mph winds so winter should be sufficient here to emulate what my ancestors had to endure winters here actually get considerably colder than they do in sweden and norway and ive gone camping during winter before but never intentionally limiting what i take with me to stuff that wouldve been available in that area 9001700 years ago so i may tap out before the weekend is over
  a liter of water weighs 1kg
  yo dude that sounds incredible but please be safe you dont have anywhere near the brown fat that your ancestors would have had nor do you have access to the endurance conditioning they went through since they were toddlers you can get a chill that will fuck the rest of your life up  im still numb in one hand 2 years after a trip where i didnt put my mitten on fast enough and my digits turned blue  warmed them up half an hour later but the numbness never left my hand  be careful you fall asleep on an arm and cut off circulation its okay when youre in your house or a nice heavy duty sleeping bag but in ye olde kitte you lose a hand to frostbite without even realising it til morning comes remember that experienced woodsmen had a pain in the ass hard time staying warm at night without huge fires until the invention of puffy insulation bags and down bags
  i genuinely appreciate your concern not something i expected on 4chan but then again /out/ is one of the most bro boards there is    im a literal lumberjack so i spend up to 20 hours a day in this nasty bitter cold and whats worse is that i sweat in this cold im pretty well conditioned for the task but i will have my roommate on hand though hell be about 50 yards away doing his own camping with some chick so ill have the option to tap out and get warm if shit goes sideways it also helps that my roommate is a doctor and hell have his own medical bag as well as the first aid kit my stepfather put together for me based around the most common shit he saw as a firefighter/emt near a state park i definitely wouldnt recommend people try the stupid shit i do to test myself not even with the same safeguards i have in place
  if its all made of feathersit is attainable
  comfy post anon have any pics
    oh yeah while i made a shelter that i stayed at for two weeks and all i brought with me was my edc folder and a fully stocked rv    i dont mean to be a dick but going slightly hungry for a weekend while you sit in a crude lean to whittling a rocking chair isnt really a challenge or relevant to ops question about as you are hunkered down in one spot for a majority of your outing im glad you had fun    as for the question at hand its obviously possible assuming you have deep pockets and the trail has hotels and restaurants at 1 day intervals you want a better answer we need a better description of what you are looking to do 30 day hike with no chance to resupply anywhere of course not 5 hour hike with the family after church on sunday 100 doable youre question is fucking stupid
  take your reddit spacing and fuck off to a place where youll be rewarded with upvotes for desperately trying to one up someone elses story
  reddit  4channel  doesnt realise this is basically reddit for people who want to larp that this isnt reddit
  impossible  no  suitable approach for anyother than a very particular enviroment  no      but going slightly hungry for a weekend while you sit in a crude lean to whittling a rocking chair isnt really a challenge or relevant to ops question  this           larping as a viking for the weekend doesnt have anything to do with a 1kg pack
  11kg alright i think ive got a pretty viable list put together youd be limited to fairly warm conditions as the quilt i have list is rated at 40f but paired with the wind jacket and down vest youd probably be ok into the mid 30s it includes a viable shelter rain gear fak water purification sleeping mat and a pack that would carry up to 2025lb total weight so if you could fit it in you could carry 45 days food 
    also i was assuming by 1kg you meant base weight
  p much this
  i cringed during the first 10 seconds and now im too embarrassed to watch the rest
  thanks faggot my question isnt stupid you are so let me spell it out    1 kg of hiking gear   not food water or fuel since that is a constantly changing number   not everyone needs to pack like a marine to go for a hike
  its not is it have done this i might actually try and get this setup together in reality itll be a bit heavier as ill get the poncho tarp in the thicker 074 dcf otherwise id be pretty comfy with it add in a light bivy bag my borah ones weighs like 114g and it would a pretty viable loadout
  not bad is it

i went outside once heard some squeaky noises and ran back in never again you guys are crazy
    muh    reddit     spacing    separating two independent concepts with a paragraph break is not reddit spacing its just normal english i suppose you didnt know this as you also thought my comment about turning an rv into a survival shelter with my pocketknife was oneupsmanship
    your question is beyond retarded let me give you an example of a non retarded question   hey guys i am doing specific trail at specific time of year is it possible to do this with less than 1kg of gear not including food and water    as i said your perfectly fine with a day hike and absolutely no fucking gear at all but good luck hiking up everest with 1kg gear youre question is stupid unless you give us a very specific situation
no
for my needs     i have a very dialled in set of gear just about everything is multipurpose and clothing is chosen to be able to be worn to bed even in rain this means i basically have zero kit beyond food when i go to bed at night so i am able to choose any size shelter can you help me i have a little monomania and autism about choosing my shelter imagine money is no object since if its too expensive i would order the materials and diy it myself    where  europe winter and summer exposed areas and below treeline too  what  something i can hang out and read in during a storm that wont draw attention when stealth camping and most importantly wont allow slugs to crawl on me or my gear i have a really bad phobia im working on i would also like it to be as compact and light as realistically possible for long distance trekking     i figure a bivy  umbrella would work in warm dry summer but would be miserable in a 5 hour rainstorm on a windy peak plus slugs would crawl all over the netting near my face and this could ruin the trip    a tarp tent like the hexamid is this the most compact option
apologies for selfish thread but this has become an unhealthy obsession and i know /out/ has some very experienced people and people who think outside the box i just want to choose the perfect style shelter and end this obsession its giving me sleepless nights over something as lame as what shape tarp and how itll fit into a backpack what the fuck
  teepee or lavuu with a wood stove is max comfy  its kinda cold and super wet here a lot of the year
  nigga im looking at one of these how big is yours link to website of company    im coming from a big fuck 4 person tent thats bull tits in the winter as its only a 3 season
  seekoutsidecom  that pic is the redcliff and its like a 6man  i have the silvertip which is a nice 2manpersonal shelter  i got the medium size stove and its still all like 8lbs
there a fucking tent thread up you lazy blind cunt i was all up for giving you advice but fuck you if you cant use basic features of this site you dont deserve help you deserve aids i hope you die
  sorry mate i posted this thread at 5 in the morning didnt think to read the catalogue
  holy fuck calm your autism you tard
  perfect thanks nigga

do you guys have any recommendations for a stylish yet practical canvas backpack that i could use everyday but also do woods stuff with  the bag i use at the moment is not good for camping i just use it for my job because im a bike messenger pic related
  stylish   wrong board
  bruh but camping
sounds like you want a frost river
  you could try the mission workshop bags or just opt for a chrome backpack i did the bike messenger thing for a 3 years and thought about a single bag that could do it all trouble is youll only get a bag thats a compromise itll be kinda sucky for both and youll most likely have to pay a ton for it btw where you work was mid atlantic and kinda miss it sometimes
  just get some hipster bag from ll bean  pic related is like 90
any large waterproof bag chrome makes one that holds 40l and its pretty good the only problem is that its heavy  dont look for something stylish youll never find something /out/ worthy
now that the dust has settled what did he mean by this
now thats what i call comfy
  hes obviously making himself into jerky
  showing off his great feet to get more subscribers obviously
  memer do you even know what you mean by this
what do you like to use ive used all four and my favorite is hand built shelter and just camping with no shelter
  holy fuck you dunce theres a fucking tent thread up
    bivvy bag keeps me warm and dry without the bulk of a tent the stupidity of a tarp and the labor required to build a shelter    if its nice out camping with no shelter and just enjoying the stars is also pretty blissful
i have a 11 pound mummy bag with 2200g of down i just throw that on the ground anywhere i feel like sleeping
no bugs and no rain  nothing  no bugs and rain with trees  tarp  bugs or rain and no trees  tent

  why tuatahi axe its too heavy

  why tuatahi axe its too heavy    because thats my fetish

  yeah ive got one its good for timbersport training but for working all day a 35lb hultafors is better
  but for working all day    i dont think id be doing that id just be delimbing felled trees when their position would allow for doing so safely but for the most part id be using the saw to work slow and steady and with little exertion is the motto when working with basic tools no point in taking risks and rushing the axe id mostly be using to drive in wooden pegs and what have you as i build a shelter from basic 1 foot thick lumber id supposed to just be a 9x4ft box that would allow me to sleep without being eaten alive by a cave bear

    just buy a bow saw blade and make your own bow saw/buck saw i made a buck saw for a hacksaw blade last night because i couldnt be assed to go find the hacksaw but had some spare blades i made it out of some old seasoned sycamore limbs i split i would have made a bow saw since that is quicker and easier but everything i had access to was well seasoned or too thick and couldnt bend easily    when innawoods i only take the blades with me it takes all of ten mins to make a bow saw out there maybe 30 mins for making a buck saw due to the extra knife work involved i use a bow saw for general limb cutting and the bucksaw frame for actually bucking firewood or whatever when i leave and go home i just take the blade out and the paracord off and toss the rest on the ground to rot or use it in the last fire i make

  and theres always some down syndrome who cant read
  can make a shelter easily out of trees squirrel hide sleeping bag  only need 22 to hunt small game can survive off 12 squirrels a day the axe is my self defence  dont need to use the flashlight every night  how to books about preparing plants and animals that were alive 25000 years ago or very similar  last one is plausible
  i would bring them precisely because of my lack of experience yes
  the axe is my self defence  kek
    150ish calories in a squirrel giving a total of 300 a day going to need a lot of squirrels to make a sleeping bag of sufficient insulation value my logic would be bring a sleeping bag bigger gun to shoot bigger animals and who gives a toss about butchering it properly just feast on the hind legs and make jerky from the rest spoilage is going to be a massive problem instead of flashlight maybe some kind of wind up torch if you must have a light

i always thought a personalized journal with edible and medicinal plants their uses cultivation pest prevention ect would be fun to make    along with guides on how to make antibiotics or at least medicinal tinctures and makeshift bandages would be fun too    theres so much you can put in one for most regions that it wouldnt be a bad idea to have one most survival  books arent even region specific enough to be useful to you in a crisis like that

ive dabbaled in snowboarding when i was in high school but didnt get really into it   im 32 now and thinking of trying to getting into it   or is it too uncool for an old man to hit the slopes
  35 here  do you want to hurt yourself and also get sucked into a sport that costs like 75 for a lift ticket as well as a new deck boots and bindings youre not eleigible for the high school kid discount anymore at the mountain
  lol yeah i dont mind putting down the money its more if i can find a group or something thatll teach a grown adult and im not learning with 13 year olds
start mountaineering instead the only gentlemans sport
  honestly as a snowboarder of 14 years who started at age 10 i really regret not having gotten into skiing from the get go instead i was all hopped up on tony hawk ps2 games and wanted to do something with boarding in its name dont get me wrong its been fun but theres far less utility and crossdiscipline applicability to boarding vs skiing one day when i have the income to do so ill make the switch but for now my meager discretionary funds are sunk into boarding so a boarder i remain you can pay for one on one lessons at most mountains if you dont want to be learning with zoomers but itll cost more than group lessons     tldr take up skiing especially xc snowshoeing or what  suggested dont fall for the boardmeme
  i am 32 and ride i also make dough it sounds like you do too take a few private lessons or find adult classes just so you dont get lumped in with a bunch of 14 year olds i wouldnt worry about cool and uncool everyone cool at a resort mountain is a tool or country club thug also no one is really looking at you unless you do hollywood runs and even then no one really cares      i would also apply the rule of 10 dont buy any gear until you have done it 10 times in a year just so you dont sink a grand into something you never use
  i find that the older snowboarders are the most chill its the older skiiers that tend to have a telephone pole stuck up their asses if you wanna be really cool just snowboard anyways because fuck what everyone else thinks       75 for a lift ticket  jfc go to a less pozzed hill i pay maximum 30 a day for the hill i go to 200 for season pass which pays for itself if you go every weekend   pic related my backyard
  jfc go to a less pozzed hill i pay maximum 30 a day for the hill i go to 200 for season pass which pays for itself if you go every weekend  op is 32 and probably has a job and its probably mondayfriday looking at a somewhat local mountain to me which isnt a ski resort destination by any means the weekend rate for an adult is 88  
  not gonna lie to ya i would definitely pay the 80 to snowboard that hill it looks like amazing fun
explains a lot about this board that there are so many snowboarders here
  patricians ski
    lmao enjoy your broken ass and exploding knees    ski down with your body
    sell or change your board shit for skis and boots or you could rent material its not expensive or hard to do i
  ski less injurious than snowboard  is this nigga fo real
  you forgot sliding down on your belly after a running start penguin style
  is it too uncool  no its not do it but do skiing and get into ski mountaineering eventually      jfc go to a less pozzed hill  some of us like skiing on mountains anon
  fuck that picture is awesome      op you are literally the snowboarder version of me only a couple years younger  skied a little in high school but moved out west earlier this year to learn how to properly ski and begin ski mountaineering everyones got different goals of course but basically ive managed to find snow to ride every month since april so far except for august and september   also snowboarders are pretty fuckin chill lots of awesome splitboarders in the backcountry
  guy on the left in that picture is just chilling on the cornace doesnt even know hes about to die
  nah dude i was 30 when i first learned to snowboard   heres the reality though   the first day snowboarding sucks a lot you will fall you will be covered with bruises it wont be so bad of theres good fresh powder though   skiing vs snowboarding skiing is way easier to pick up as a newbie and you can do it at older age my mates 70yo dad still goes skiing every year and when i worked in hotels wed always get 80 and 90yo skiiers check in skiing its also easier to move across flat ground   snowboarding though is more fun if that makes any sense on a good powder day its like surfing a never ending wave also snowboarding is better in shitty conditions skiiers have a real hard time on icy or slushy conditions like in spring snowboarders dont give a shit   if you fall in a tree well on a snowboard though youre fucked skiing you have a decent chance to get out by yourself
  best place to learn to ski for cheap is go to japan and get lessons from an english speaking instructor   lift passes are 15 a day there and a days lesson will only set you back 20 or so as well
  best place to learn to ski for cheap is go to japan and get lessons from an english speaking instructor   lift passes are 15 a day there and a days lesson will only set you back 20 or so as well  hot springs are amazing after a day of falling on your ass learning how to ride
  some of us like skiing on mountains  lol the poster you quoted is in mn wheres he supposed to go
  jfc go to a less pozzed hill i pay maximum 30 a day for the hill i go to  enjoy your 400 vert sounds totally worth the money
   snowboarding is better in shitty conditions skiiers have a real hard time on icy or slushy conditions like in spring snowboarders dont give a shit    id push back on that in powder snowboarding  skiing on hardpack/ice skiing  snowboarding    reason being that skis can have 2 edges in the snow while snowboards can only have one this provides much better traction and control in icy/hardpack conditions for the same reason though skis have less surface area on powder and are more likely to get caught either way both sports are great but skis are definitely more versatile
  go nuts dude get a lesson and try to listen to your instructor if you get an american or a kiwi they tend to be pretty good as other anons have said japan is great the big fields there are expensive and lessons arent cheap but the snow is unrivalled the food is spectacular onsens are amazing and theres heaps of middle aged dudes who snowboard there    dont listen to this fag
  as other anons have said japan is great the big fields there are expensive and lessons arent cheap but the snow is unrivalled the food is spectacular onsens are amazing and theres heaps of middle aged dudes who snowboard there  i dont think op is moving to japan to learn how to snowboard are you high
  bro youre not living until youve travelled to japan to learn how to ski and to america to learn how to eat cheeseburgers
  youre 32 and still worried about looking cool
  not moving to japan to study the way of the board  get away from me you filthy casual
  its a cheap country best powder in the world and lift passes and lessons there only 20 a pop also post ski hotsprings
  best advice i can give you is to get yourself a short wider pair of skis i didnt really start hitting mountains till i was about 32 yrs old other than a few times on smaller hills when i was younger i am good on skates always have been i am good on skis as well naturally wasnt long before i was hitting double black diamond runs and what a rush but to me i have to attack them and its do or possibly die no shitting  boarding is different and i dont enjoy the locked into that position and getting around with one foot out doing that technique a friend of mine was learning snowboarding at the time and i thought no way in hell would i rather that but to each his own
  great advice you should listen
come to nz jajajajajajajajajajajaja
  29 here only ever skied or snowboarded on school trips thinking about getting into skiing this winter season  how often does one have to go skiiing before it makes more sense to buy your own gear instead of renting   also what sort of outerwear should i be getting
  oldfag here only started myself at 29  now 42 and still go every year  probably if i would start from scratch again id take up skiing as ive been told its faster to get a hang of italso the two sticks make waiting   breaks a lot more comfy  other than that once you get the basics down i really see no difference in un coolness and ill probably keep on doing it till my body gives out  if you have the money just shell out for private lessons i took grouip lessons when i started and my group was 4 people from 2226 ish  nobody would care id think
    can vouch for the hotsprings  but lift passes are usually 30 40 euro a day accomodation is also a tad more expensive than say austria or italy or france atmosphere is chill and relaxed food is good  but no apres ski 
  it all depends on you my dude  you can generally get second hand clothing and stuff like gloves and goggles for cheap and depending on where you are you might be able to get skis for cheaper than renting  theres a few cost saving things you can do i use my rain jacket as an outer shell sometimes if its not too cold maybe you dont need to buy or hire a ski jacket at all but i will recommend that you dont try the same trick with waterproof pants  owning your own gear is also a huge quality of life improvement over renting but until you dont need to rent anything you wont get there  the one thing that people say you should buy are boots and they are right but boots are expensive the return on investment there is up to you to calculate vs renting good boots from a bootfitter will help you more than you might think but yeah id probably still hold off and go a few times before buying anything to make sure its something you enjoy first
  i would say 12 times a month would make sense to buy your own gear   but i think the bigger requirement is how many years you go   if its something you see yourself doing long term then it makes sense to get your own gear but if youre the kind of person who picks up a hobby for a year or two then drop it just rent
32 fag here been skateboarding forever only recently got into snowboarding and i love it best advice is to quit being a jew and take some private lessons  learn to carve and have tons of fun
  go to a recycle shop or 2nd hand store preferably near a ski resort and buy second hand shit just know how to check for gear thats fucked vs gear thats still in good nick   my first set of snowboarding gear set me back just over 100 all up at the recycle shop in whistler   14 for a helmet  32 for a snowboard  10 for goggles  10 for boots  15 for bindings  30 on a good jacket  already had my own gloves and pants    ended up replacing the pants gloves goggles and bindings with better ones later in the season
  best advice is to quit being a jew and take some private lessons  this do 2 or 3 halfdays of private lessons well worth the money
  skiing fucks your knees dog
  it fucks your feet way harder than anything else d e s u
  i worked in hostels and hotels maybe its still because snowboarding is still relatively new but i was always amazed getting guests in their 80s and 90s check into the hotel to go skiing i think oldest we had was a 92yo guy we first thought he just came to get drunk and hit on the young girls but he was killing it on the ski hill   we also used to get a pair of best friends in their 80s come twice a year every year for a week each time to ski and drink together to get away from their wives
    hey i worked at a ski resort for a few years to get through college    age  your age isnt an issue as far as injury or aesthetic youll be under layers anyways so noone is going to see your wrinkles youre also young enough to bounce back on the things the most people hit if you decide to start dropping into cliffs just go on a powder day if you decide to hit up the park you might hurt a bit longer than the teenagers    price  buy a pass on an offseason passes are usually the best deals if youre planning on going crazy during the ski year some resorts also offer passes for volunteer work so if you work a certain amount of days for the resort you could get a season pass id recommend you just pay the pass though the resort will use you as slave labor    coming back to snowboarding  i have never seen it take longer than 3 consecutive days of boarding to pick up the basics people always fall a lot and get really sore on the first days but once that curve is out of the way its a lot easier to progress quickly    backcountry or local hills  you can train yourself on slopes that arent groomed the style will be a bit harder for a novice but its something to consider if you want to improve without having to go to a resort every time backcountry is kind of a vague term i wouldnt suggest you go into avalanche prone areas with very steep slopes and high snowfall until you have training and a couple of years under your belt
dont worry at all about looking cool something about the mountains makes everyone laidback and nonjudgemental      others have already discussed the finer points about your options so all ill say is that you should go for it you will not regret your decision a nice day on your board is as good as great sex        i recommend spending a little more than 10 on boots    something i might mention is that i almost always unsold gear from a few years ago mountains also often sell old rental gear in the early/preseason
  i just bought snowpants and a jacket new kept the tags on ill check out a second hand shop  i have leather driving gloves but no snow gloves i have literally zero snow gear still hoping to get my shit together and try it out next week on my time off
i am convinced that noone on this website shreds park prove me wrong /out/
  friendly reminder to all itt that avalanches are absurdly dangerous and deadly one of the worst ways to go out comparable to drowning   these things have the kinetic energy of a freight train they are a force of nature like a tornado or earthquake    if youre not certified and want to go backcountry take a course it will save your life  avalanches can occur on slopes as mild as 35 degrees  always bring a beacon probe and shovel know how to use them and practice often  check both the weather forecast and avalanche danger forecast before setting out  if youre with a group stay spread out on traverses and when descending    theres a lot more to it than that though please take it seriously as others can be killed by an avalanche you start training practice caution and discipline will help keep you safe
go for it its my favorite winter sport because of the backcountry aspect theres so much variety and even rudimentary skills will be a blast on the slopes but youll fall a lot if youve never boarded before start on little hills and try to hit pow runs thicker/fluffy snow instead of groomed runs falling is much more forgiving in pow for beginners i see lots of older people on the slopes as snowboarding has become much more popular in recent years if you dont have a set up go to your local board/skateboard shop oftentimes they have better stocked gear and know what they are talking about so you can get the right set up big stores like rei zumiez etc always have less customization and employees with no knowledge a bad set up really makes it tough on a beginner to master the beginning stuff
  yea i regret not spending more on the boots they were kinda dodgy but survived two seasons until they were fucked       you can always try asking around some friends if you can borrow some gear for a few runs just be honest and tell them you wanna try learning to board itll give you a couple of days or if youre lucky a couple of weeks while you learn
   is it too uncool for an old man   letting other peoples opinions affect what youre interested in  i see youre body may have left high school but your mind still hasnt
im damn near 50 learned at 30 and still go every now  then ill never qualify for the olympics but its fun anyway    im more careful than i used to be for sure but if im in co or mt for a weekend renting gear and just spending a day cruising green  blue routes is a great time    also ive done both skiing  snowboarding and found snowboarding to be much easier night  day almost ive heard others say the exact opposite so ymmv
  maybe if you do it every day every winter for 40 years you fucking pussy
  you can always try asking around some friends if you can borrow some gear for a few runs  i dont have any friends
  aint that some shit
     old man 32 you fking bonehead you havent even hit your prime yet /baka
  as someone who has skiied half my life and snowboarded the other      skiing  snowboarding    snowboarding is a good way to injure yourself and have fun unstrapping constantly especially if your tall and being stuck on flats  snowboarding only became popular with the young crowds because it looked cool and is arguably better in parks
  i havent exactly run the stats but ive talked to ski patrol and they say that roughly the same number of both come in bending down to strap in takes all of 5 seconds you only get stuck on flats if you havent properly waxed your board and if you dont make an effort to keep up your speed
  skiing fucks your knees when you crash    snowboarding fucks your knees as a matter of course
  it might be time to turn down your din
  arguably better in parks guys today on skis can do way gnarlier rail tricks than snowboarders
  yeah watching that in the last olympics was a trip
  forgot the link  
  if you live near somewhere where people ski then you already have friends just go to a preseason hype party in a pub or bar and drink beers with random skiiers say youre new and go from there   most friendships in ski towns are as simple as we both drink beer and ski so weve been best friends for 40 years   thing is though like 90 of your conversations will end up being about skiing ski runs conditions ski gear fresh pow and other skirelated shit
   we both drink beer and ski so weve been best friends for 40 years    painfully accurate add smoking a little grass and you have best friends
  this as well as hitting up ski and snowboard sales tonnes of insecure teens and college kids people get a new board every years because of good marketing   youll need a solid day of lessons and then 23 additions days on the hill before you get it  i started at 33 im 55 now love it
what are some cool /out/ ways to volunteer
  volunteer    never do this always get paid for it via currency trade and/or services dont take ious
the local chapter of keep america beautiful here has an annual rivers alive where they go around to local waterways and clean them of litter people bring their waders and shit there are often local river and waterway initiatives that do similar shit just go around to places picking up litter and put up signs that say not all assholes litter but all who litter are assholes sure they will get taken down but they might last a day or more and if you do it semi regularly word will spread it might not make any difference but at least youll be able to call people assholes en masse
check with your local land trust i once got to go burn slash piles at a restoration site for them pretty chill    if youre in oregon theres sone neat citizen sience opportunities with metro or odfw metro also has volunteer naturalist positions    what  said is right though i only did volunteer work to build my resume now im a forestry tech and i get paid to be outside
  check around for a local trail club in your area they always have opportunities for volunteering /out/
search for trail maintenance your area    the nature conservancy sometimes runs volunteer projects      i mean im in the same boat but i cant blame anyone for preferring to stay on the highpaying comfy desk job track and do a little /out/ volunteering on the weekends rather than going fulltime /out/ and getting paid on the gs schedule or production rates
    true out jobs sometimes feel like they dont pay well enough in comparison to the work done     a manager at panda express makes as much as a gs 5 forestry tech kinda bull when the tech requires an associates degree and is responsible for cruising timber and laying out whole timber sales
habitat for humanity if you ever think youd like to build a house youll find the experience invaluable
these are good places to meet girls
so i live in canada    i find myself more and more often thinking of the imminent economic collapse which will force all of us even the normiest of normies /out/ in a bid for survival  what the fuck am i supposed to do when i cant buy gas for my chainsaw to keep from freezing during the first winter   does anyone else have these thoughts are cunucks fucked on account of harsh climate we have a 3 month period to grow most of our food i have 30 thousand seeds of a variety of produce but damn im worried i dont want this to be a political thread but the fed reserve is going to tank soon
people have lived in canada for thousands of years its not fucked    if you have people around you that you trust and handtools you should be fine you dont need a chainsaw to keep your house warm it just makes it much easier    unless youre too far north of course then only a handful could survive
  get the biggest bow saw you can buy a decent felling axe and learn how to use it  also consider restoring old single and double buck saws  if you have a pile of cash tuatahi m tooth saw god tier 
  a fucking leaf  the day of the rake cant come soon enough
  thanks this saw is sexy 
  yeah its pretty sweet you can also put 2 handles on it and can be resharpened giving it a long working life  if you are interested in cutting fire wood with and without chainsaws you might like my channel 
imminent economic collapse which will force all of us    do you have a photo of the current food prices to prove that
    needing a photo to know the price of beef is artificially low and will be mankinds downfall
  sometimes i think /out/ needs flags
  
  move to the maritimes and start homesteading right now cheap land good agricultural regions long growing season by canadian standards low population and relatively isolated from the rest of the continent best place to be during the collapse    keep a small stockpile of fuel but it goes bad after a year or so youre gonna have to use hand tools long term so buy some now and get used to using them most urbanite normies wont make it out of the cities

  last week
    these were always over rated
are these waxed jackets worth it
not good for any activity during which you are likely to sweat thus ruling it out for any /out/ trip other than basic maintenance work on your own property or tailgating at a nearby state park
  incorrect    theyre fine for generalpurpose /out/ and /aroundcamp/ i wouldnt take them on a lightweight backpacking trip or thruhike for sure i rock pic related for cycling and ive never once gotten clammy or overheated in it its pretty waterproof too    it is however lined with merino wool and specifically designed for that one particular activity for general purpose out youre probably going to be happier with a softshell though pretty much any softshell    why because you have to spend a lot of money to get an actually good /out/ rated waxed jacket and you can get a better softshell for the same price
  i wear one because im alergic to whatever coating they spray most modern rain gear with  the move a little better than synthetics when theyre new  theyre less crunchy but theyre not much more breathable than the latex  major /fa/ bonus though
  just buy a canvas shirt you like and then wax it  probably save decent money  i did a whole tent yesterday a shirt should take an hour tops
  stand hunting
  where did yoh get that mate i dont see it on their site
      you cant buy it direct from them though you have to get it from a bike shop or online retailer i got mine by supporting local businesses and going to my local bike shop
  generally tough and durable waterproof if maintained correctly   but heavy bulky stiff most are not particularly great at being flexible to body movements through range of motions  not very insulative good for mild temps in thick brush and rainy country
    im guessing you to be a surly bike owner anon if so i as well with long haul trucker    as for jackets i just use a very lightweight windbreaker shell its purpose is only to break wind under it i use layers for warmth only a tshirt when just a bit chilly a fleece when sorta cold and adding thermal underwear base layer when pretty danged cold the wind breaker is an unremarkable random goodwill find that scrunches down to about softball size and weighs essentially nothing in my pack
  ive had    steamroller sold  karate monkey old version sold  pugsley sold  and now a brand new karate monkey    love em
  also i wore my surly merino wool hoodie to work today it layers so fucking well
  love em    mine is essentially my home carries everything i own including mobile housing i do wish i would have gotten a troll instead but still very much love my lht their bikes have a certain attention to details that no one else matches
  its purpose is only to break wind  break wind  anon you really set yourself up with that one
    i knew and wondered if it would be noticed i almost put ellipses leading to it
if i catch any of you faggot barebooters out there this winter ill stab you in the neck with my ice axe    hitler would gas you first
  blasts past your ass with a wave of snow
  get rolled
  meme for fat lazy fucks who cant handle hiking just stick a motor and butt plug on the seat while youre at it
  at least you make it easy to tell that youve never tried it
anyone around here do gold panning as a hobby
  yep im trying to collect enough to make into a bar itll take years but at least ill have something good to trade for when shtf
  laughed too hard at this
    where would such a hobby even be possible  not that i want your location but europe would be cacled out already right
  implying gold is really worth anything
  germany has a massive gold panning industry mostly based on hobbyist on the rhine river and in the swiss alps spain as well has suddenly seen an upsurge in panning due to recent discoveries at ancient mining sites even england is starting to see it appear as placer gold was rediscovered in the high country of scotland     best way i ve found to figure out if theres gold near your location is to addgold panning infront of your location in google loads of places have prospecting clubs
  if your in north america basically there are 4 major regions known for gold     in the us there are    delonica georgia site of the first us gold rush on little meadow creek   the entire us west coast every major river from washington to new mexico has pannable gold    the entire state of alaska
  in canada its basically just the province of bc that has serious panning the yukon is focused on heavy mining more nowadays
  i have gone panning a few times and there is something about it that is very fun the second time i went i got 2 nuggetts probably 1/10 the size of the smallest nugget in your pic actually probably 1/20th    its disproportionally fun vs what you are ever likely to find doing it     my guess is it depends where you go of course but after talking to some old timers and other people my guess would be that if you are just literally panning with a pan finding a nugget as large as the two bigger ones in that op would be a once in 3 lifetimes event
  no offense anon but you may want to sell that gold bar before shtf and buy things that would actually have value in such a scenario ammunition or components purified water nonperishable food medical supplies drugs and alcohol tobacco etc if the end of the world as we know it really occurs baubles and useless shiny wont be worth anything to the average person
  i am still looking for my big one i find about an ounce a season lately less than i could normally because i ve been working for others instead of digging its all about where your looking and how much time you spend looking my master the guy i apprenticed under finds about 20  30 nuggets like those a season and dozens of ounces of small gold it takes real skill to get as good as him
  holy shit an ounce where are you using a sluicer or just panning i went panning this weekend at the river near yosemite park and this is all i found after 6 goddamn hours of backbreaking panning asshat ranger who was patrolling the area wont even let me use a sluice pans only
  im in australia and you can find a lot of gold here but sad thing is that its all the way in the middle of nowhere so sadly no i dont 
  well you should learn the laws for your area on mining here in bc and in parts of the us you need to either own the claim your working on or get permission from the owner before you can use a sluice without getting in shit     however to go around this i use a rocker box which is basically a sluice that you manually feed water and dirt into on dry land     i mine in the cariboo gold fields theres tons of small scale guys out here lately doing what i do including a crew of 6 homeless guys who camped out at the amaddor pit for the summer and now are leaving at the end of the season with cars and clean cloths     my main source of income from mining though is from sniping bedrock in ultra rich spots and getting paid by idiots to show them where the gold is on their claims i also do the yearly hour work required to keep claims up
  some day i ll get to australia and one day all that gold will be mine
  southern half of british colombia  yukon
  panning for gold  not panning for friends  its like you dont know what has the real value op
  lmao you dont know much do ya fudd
  so youre saying that the real gold is the friendships we make along the way
  how much weight is that anyway might be worth more than six hours working a normie job hmmm
  go away luffy youre drunk
  might be worth more than six hours working a normie job hmmm  lol  only if his job pays 1/hr
i did some with my dad and uncle when i was very young nothing much ever came of it but it was a lot of fun    christ thats disgusting
    you would find gold nuggets and go to move the metal detector to actually get it out of the way because it would make a noise and you couldnt put it down because everywhere you moved it there was gold
massively fun great way to connect with nature spend some fun time /out/ with the added benefit of the feeling of playing a few lottery scratch off tickets     in other words you might just come back 20 richer odds are vastly that its just money down the tubes with a tiny chance of finding something worth the effort but still fun and with more of a lasting impression than buying a a few scratchoff tickets    you can file a claim or buy a claim of 20 acres for pretty cheap if you want to play around panning better than doing it in public parks a claim gives you exclusive mineral rights rangers will pretty much leave you alone unless youre building on the property you cant exclude anyone else from anything but mineral prospecting but you can post claim signs and no trespassing on mineral rights type signs that pretty much make folks go elsewhere and leave you the property to do with as you please just no building and if youre going to seriously tear shit up you have to file a plan and get a permit panning sluicing and digging without heavy equipment are pretty much okay in most blm areas where youve staked a claim keeping it costs about 150/year 212 first year depending on how many claims you own you can get some exemptions to cut that cost down waiver of maintenance fee if you own less than 10 claims for fun my goal is to pay the claim expenses with actual gold found which is easily doable even on piss poor claims and then count the camping as all free  it just is in no way economically viable beyond that for 99 percent of claims
  it is pretty addictive though to get that tenth of an    ounce  a teeny bit in the pan  that pays off your claim for the year makes you keep feeling like the next pan will get you your gas money back and the next couple after that will pay for your camping suppliesand then but just dont count on any of that and enjoy it for what it is
  im either impressed or ready to call bullshit granted while camping on a claim your living expenses are basically close to zero if youre really roughing it but youd have to find at minimum a few ounces to get a car and new clothes probably three ounces if youre going to get an older used very basic vehicle at a good price and a few changes of clothes 30004000 range working even a whole season on a pretty decent claim without heavy equipment mining and a lot of permits that would be difficult
  the issue is most people dont know what there doing when it comes to small scale hand mining i focus on only the richest claims i can find and use techniques that mean i dont have to do as much work to get at the gold either creek crawling can get you a lot of gold quickly if you know how to do it right     the homeless crew was working a bedrock shelf that was exposed by a heavy machine mining crew the previous year they got extremely lucky with the amount they got i think they said they went south with about 89 ounces total it also helps when your not the only guy doing the digging a ground of 4 or 5 can move a lot of material in a day especially if your ground sluicing or sniping bedrock     its not unusual to get some serious gold out here but its also very common for people to go totally broke in their first season on average i see about 5 new groups come into the territory and out of them only 1 might break even     i get gold because i was taught how to find the gold and how to mine it by people who have made fortunes doing it
  the other way you can get a lot of gold quickly is looking around old ore bins at gold mines this pic came from one rock about the size of a foot ball from an old ore bin at the cariboo gold quartz mine i think it was around 18 grams total gold after melt down
  yall be handin us that brick hoe
  yes   love panning      in the grand us of a in the lower commie corner
  holly crap thats a lot of text on a map
  and every single one is or was a mine   i cant even imagine what it was like back then
  theres similar maps of the cariboo region every steam or gulch had workings on them during the original rush
im thinking about bumming around in washington in my van for a while this summer might try this when im out there anyone know any good sites
  go check out liberty washington look on facebook for the local panning and prospecting groups there and ask permission to go check those creeks out massive nuggets have come from there
  oxidized flat scales  obvious placer gold  from quartz ore  lol    what do you use to mill rock i mean besides the river and millions of years which you clearly used for that pan full
  a large steel tube and a piece of drill steel most of that was amalgam gold thats why its flat chunks also blobs of larger gold that got stuck to the bottom of the mortar
i found this last summer i was literally bored and sat on a sandbar in a river cause it was so damn hot    i just dipped my hands in and scooped some sand and started sloshing around water like some loser    i dont really have experience with gold i kept this regardless though
  thats gold youre super rich now
  thats  not probably gold
  then what is it
  well i am not sure i think thats probably mica     easiest way to tell is if it bends easily and is heavy
  this is something ive been meaning to do ive got just about everything figured out except what type of pad to put in a sluice for direct digging best i can figure is high ridges for the first foot and a simple box pad for the rest of the way down am i totally wrong about that
    not him but it looks like its mostly biotite mica though a few pieces look like they could be gold not very likely though
  use this for a guide on building your sluicebox     911 metallurgist has more info as well
  creek crawling   sniping bedrock  im 12 and whats this
  yeah i figured the vast majority of those flakes were mica but i kept them all those flakes are brittle    3 of the bigger rounder pieces arent brittle though which i figured were more likely gold either way i kept it cause i thought it was neat     i kinda want to go panning down here in socal somewhere
  bedrock sniping  looking for solid rock in the creek bed with gravel stuck in it bedrock naturally catches gold in cracks cleaning these cracks reveals gold     creek crawling  swimming in the river removing the surface gravels in the creek bed by waving your hand hard over it than picking up the largest nuggets with your fingers or a small dredge
  check out the san gabriel river theres course gold there but its usually high above the river on bedrock
  if the end of the world as we know it really occurs baubles and useless shiny wont be worth anything to the average person  not him but in the short term youre right long term changes that though people have been trading for goods via precious metals for literally thousands of years in both good times and bad im not saying take all your money out of the stock market and buy gold like some ron paulmeme but having some gold on hand certainly wont hurt you
  if im not mistaken gold can be found pretty much every where and ive read that it lurks in every single river on the planet hell you can even purchase some sand from lowes or whatever and pan it for gold  its actually been found in there by numerous peoplealbeit very small flakes also theres a literal goldmine right before your eyes electronics very time consuming but ive been doing a little at a time almost have a decent sized bag of gold plated shit that ill extract soon
  yes your sort of right gold is basically everywhere in soil and in river gravels however its usually only minute amounts massive rivers like the columbia have more gold in their gravels than say your average stream unless that streams in a known gold belt     the gold showing up in construction sand is from placer deposits we mine the sand out of rivers like the fraser and columbia and it ends up in play grounds without being processed first i know some gravel pit operations in alberta pay for their fuel costs with the gold recovered from their processing setups all they have to do is sluice the sand before it goes to bagging     another dirty secrect about play ground sand is that for a time much of it came at least in california from stamp mill waste piles these stamp sands were usually heavily contaminated with lead and mercury as well as gold and caused a lot of health problems stamp sands from pitcher oklahoma showed up in play grounds and concrete across the central us for a time
    do you have a rough picture when you say high above bedrock    i know what bed rock is but i dont know that river too well    i was thinking of hiking out to bridge to nowhere and maybe camping pasted that area on the east fork to try panning
  look for the highest place on the bedrock where river gravels and large round stones appear look for cracks that are at that height as well if you can find a good depression or crack where the last super high flood was thats where the biggest gold seems to be deposited i am sorry i cant really get into more detail as every rivers different but the same principles apply everywhere
  cool thanks  kinda guessed the first one but the second one i had no clue but for that to yield anything you probably have to be in a very rich area with warm water if i try that in the glacier fed creeks we have here in the alps ill just loose my dick  but i guess i give the first one a try next summer i have some locations where that could be a good idea
  use a dry suit while creek crawling we need them here or you will freeze within minutes
  thanks ive seen people use metal detectors for this do you know of any decent 200400 dollar ones    or would you say its worth just sitting at those low pressure points and scraping up the cracks
  get your self a garret pro pointer     there water resistant and work well for just scanning cracks that you have already scrapped out to check for missed nuggets
  it takes real skill to get as good as him    skill  youre parasites  you produce nothing
  and how may i ask am i a parasite i went to school got my geology degree love spend 90 of my summer /out/ wandering on mountains or rivers people pay me to go find natural resources for them
  lmao bullshit
is buying a mini metal detector like this worth it for finding nuggets which model is the best
  i have one of those as well as a generic copy    they will find nuggets pea size and larger from a distance of 1/2    there are several problems with this  1 nuggets larger than a pea arent common so good luck finding any by random poking  2 you have to be really fucking close meaning you need an actual detector to find the nugget before that thing will do you any good or you have to spend years poking through a single yard of bedrock hoping to get lucky  3 it also finds magnetite which is about a billion times more common than gold nuggets so guess what youre going to be finding all day every day    i use mine to pinpoint an object after ive already found it with my real detector and even then its just to make sure im not hitting a coin with my shovel i couldnt imagine trying to use that for nugget shooting it would be almost completely worthless
  go with a garret pro pointer there the best for finding gold in the bottom of cracks and for general treasure hunting in cramped locations
how do you actually sell the gold you find i know theres pawnshops but wont they just fuck you over and only offer you a small percentage of the real value of the gold
im gonna be panning for gold near yosemite soon ive been there before but only found really tiny flakes this is the area where i found them but i only panned in the side of the river what spot should i be focusing on instead
  look for local online groups on sites like facebook for gold buyers always remember your nuggets are worth more to collectors gold dust is just sold by how ever pure it is
  look for bedrock on the inner curve of the creek the inner curve is where material is deposited also look around on that bedrock for cracks that are filled with river gravel i am sure you will have better luck looking around there
  nah pawn shops generally tell you the spot price current market price but then are pretty open about telling you theyll only pay a percentage of that if theres something unclear about the purity of your gold 22k is the market standard for jewelry investment grade 24k is pure everyone looks for three nines  provable 99999 percent if they can convince you there is some problem proving purity theyll screw you this is why gold in the form of coins or bars is better no one can challenge the purity but believe me  anything other than a marked bar or coin any buyer will always challenge purity to support their lowball offer and if theyre buying flake or dust its even worse theyll complain theres biotite mica pyrite whatever if they dip below 90 of spot fuck them and move elsewhere they will try to tell you current spot is 1300 i gotta make a profit i can give you 1100 which is bullshit first know current spot prices before you go be able to defend the purity of your gold and point out that they dont get to make their profit by paying less than spot  they make their profit because spot consistently goes up and theyre basically using an investment model they buy now at spot price sell at spot price two months from now which will almost certainly be higher  they make their money off the market not the person they buy from but if it helps go down up to 10 percent from spot no lower if they start doubting purity go get someone to convert your dust/flakes into a nugget  of course in the case of jewelry it might be stamped but generally youre going to take a serious hit on anything below 22k in fact at 14k its basically only resalable as jewelry and at 10k good luck finding a buyer even though its still 50 gold its basically considered costume jewelry
can i still make money just panning for gold i hate my job and want to be outdoors all the time instead but at the same time dont want to be around other people im in california and there still seems to be a bunch of gold claims for sale here        at the bare minimum i can survive on 1000 a month since i live with my parents but still have to pay for my car gasoline and other bills if i pan for gold full time for at least 10 hours a day could i realistically still find that amount of gold
  well all i can say is learn about the ground your going to be working on read up on the areas where gold was found in your area in the past it will save you so much effort believe me prospecting is 90 looking and only maybe 5 actually digging gold     you can make a living doing small scale mining if you know what your doing try and find a group of other prospectors to learn from who will get you started     only buy a claim off someone if you have tested the ground your self and know there is actually gold there never buy a claim off someone who wont let you test it
  read up on the areas where gold was found in your area in the past it will save you so much effort believe me  what kind of reading do you mean  eg im in austria and essentially all igneous provinces have had some historic gold mining and/or panning in the rivers  some areas are richer in the stuff than others but for about every area theres a story about some record nugget finds in the hinteruntergumpenbach where everyone else says you cant find shit  so essentially i can just try my luck wherever and leanr more about stuff like   oh and it seems like i missed a huge opportunity stemming from this years record drought  the river that is passing through the city literally 20 meters from my flat is also gold bearing and apparently if you know what you are doing you can get lucky and pull in a few k if you pan it at low water levels  the more you know
  for reading look up a guide to gold panning by bill barlee he also did several guides to simple prospecting     yes prospecting is basically trial and error with a bit of back ground rules thrown in once you understand what kind of gold your dealing with in your area you can both research more about how that type of gold reacts in the environment and where your likely to find more     yes low water in any gold bearing stream is a great opportunity as it exposes bedrock and gravel that you usually cant access
      thanks for the info ive also been looking at the area through google maps and noticed that theres what seems to be some dried up streams from the mountains that converge to the road next to the river is there a chance that could also contain gold        bing maps also has a street view of the area surprisingly enough but its kinda limited
  racism aside this is exactly what will happen in an actual shithitsthefan scenario    i dont understand why goldbugs thing people will be civil in such an extreme doomsday scenario or will be obligated to play by the goldbugs arbitrary rules    if anything they should invest in seeds and/or ammunition and/or reusable water purification    or a useful trade so when someone with even more guns enslaves them they could at least barter their knowledge or skills like cobbling or tailoring for their life
  gold is a useful and efficient way to store excess wealth without relying on a government or perishable goods  gold will pretty much always be valuable every society ever has wanted it and been willing to trade/work for a bit obviously when shtf youd rather have food or guns or equipment etc but if youve already got all that stuff and still have a pile of potentially worthless fiat currency lying around your best bet to guarantee it maintains its value through whatever bullshit happens is convert it into a precious metal or jewel etc and gold has the advantage of being very valuedense so you can store a lot of money in relatively little space stable and easy to trade in current society so if you need to you can recoup your investment and easy to part out by weight if you need to spend some of it post happening      and its not like people are going to stop trading if society collapses or stop wanting gold obviously you dont haul a bar around clipping bits off to trade for stuff but if you start running out of say penicillin and someone else happens to have a nice stockpile but doesnt need anything you have saved they wont want worthless paper money but probably would accept some gold it can be stolen isnt a good argument against it since it applies to pretty much anything youre going to have to be able to defend you and yours regardless
  buying land is a good idea when civilization comes back then that ownership paper will come handy  and as  said having some gold wont hurt either if things stabilize a bit
  my grandpa used to be into itand metal detectinghe found so much it was ridiculous
  gold will pretty much always be valuable  thats about as wrong as it gets my greatgrandparents were doing blackmarket deals back after ww2 selling off military gear and supplies that the allies hadnt yet stolen and burnt and youd be surprised just how little theyd have traded for gold according to their diaries back then a small bottle of whiskey some tobacco or chocolate could get you just about anything gold however was worth almost as little as paper money because nobody really needs it drugs longlasting food and ammo on the other hand are necessary    of course gold regained its value once things stabilized but for shtf scenarios the best trading goods are some bottles of cheap vodka and airforce chocolate they last multiple decades are divisible and will always have value
  risky sinking that much into it if you dont get good roi every day you spend hunting for gold costs money you dont get back its often not feasible to stop a weeks a couple of no gold and your in for shit end of the world or no and its a very rugged lifestyle
anyone got any look with other heavy minerals  where im at theres a lot of garnets in the rocks so naturally they end up in the rivers and thus in my black sand when panning  havent found any good ones so far though  is that because they break down when transported in the stream or do i simply accidentally discard the bigger ones when panning
  look  im retarded  luck
  these kind of guys would be killed within days if not hours
  yea a draw like that might have some gold in it near where it meets the river but not always always check anyway
saved from page 9
  yeah i do mostly in the colorado mountains rivers     its not really profitable but it can be fun ive probably made 3000 dollars over the last decade and its probably cost me at least that much in gas
 here after a weekend of backbreaking panning this is the result of my hard work probably about 20 hours work total this sucks most of the gold is just too tiny to even pick up with a tweezer and i cant use a sluice because of the ranger patrolling the area next time im just gonna bring home the gravel instead i think i might get more gold that way instead of wasting time panning    also i did find these odd grey/whiteish flakes though that seem metallic they had weight however but its easy to bend and really soft what is it
also i noticed on the higher level of the riverbank near the dirt road the rocks were different it was in flakelike chunks and the soil was red someone had also been prospecting here too and cleaned out the gravel underneath the big rock completely when i tried testing the flaky rock/gravel stuff it was like red clayish material
the red clay stuff was really sticky and took more time than usual just to clean it out from sticking on the big rocks however there was a lot of black sand with it and i even saw some tiny floursized gold didnt have time to test it out more is this significant goldbearing material
  id guess the soft white flakes are lead shot or sinkers
  hay dont be depressed keep on looking thats actually good looking gold its small but still semi angular more has to be near by
  i would definitely go back to that and keep looking was there any spots were that course fractured slide rock mixed with larger river stones that red clay is probably acting as a false bedrock stopping the heavy metals from passing deeper into the soil
  under rocks where down flow of river is pushing heavier over rock  check under the front of these rocks dont crush your hand
  those are some mighty fine boipuccis them boys be hidin in them pants
  under rocks where down flow of river is pushing heavier over rock  thats one of the most fascinating things about river gold  trying to imagine or calculate how sediment moves and gets sorted in the bed very autistic pleasure
  its even more interesting watching it happen underwater in person i see flakes slowly traveling along the bedrock all the time when i am creek crawling

that sounds like a fun /out/ activity for when you dont wanna make a lot of miles or the weather is too bad for the mountains though i probably should watch out for flashfloody thunderstorms i think i wanna give it a try  what do i need to get started  seems like a small shovel and a pan ought to be enough anything im missing are there differences between the pans or can i just buy whatever happens to catch my eyes on amazon
  youre really going to want 2 5gallon buckets a small jar and a thing called a snifter and a 1/4 metal screen in a frame that fits over your pan and the lip of a 5g bucket youll probably also want a large magnet of the sort that lets you pick up and release stuff at the press of a button waterproof and perhaps a bottle of dawn dish soap various flathead screwdrivers are useful for scraping out cracks    thats about it unless you get into mercury amalgamation which is quite a bit more complicated
  youll probably also want a large magnet of the sort that lets you pick up and release stuff at the press of a button waterproof  what for  i know those magnet thingies you can use to pic magnetic stuff up from tiny spaces but press of a button electromagnetic    mercury amalgamation  no thanks ill leave that to the pros and even those cause way too much damage with it
  what for  most of what you pan is worthless magnetic black sand you can remove it entirely in about a second
  you have to be careful with those as a lot of the times gold gets caught in the blacksand as its picked up
  yep you have to eyeball the black sand after you lift it
  black sand isnt completely worthless its some incredibly effective fertilizer as well if you plant fruits or veggies i like to keep it for that increases yields a lot
  yeah its just relatively worthless compared to the gold    its usually pretty rich in platinum group metals but youd need thousands of tons of it to make that pay
  the chinese seem to be going nuts over it though this summer there were 8 groups of chinese guys going around the bc gold fields buying up all the black sands they could get their hands on
  yeah in large enough quantities its worth it to recover the metals    what theyre probably after is the rare earths not worth it for you and me to try to recover but they have the processes in place already on an industrial scale    also they dont have to report it as rare earths ores so they avoid whatever trade limits they have on that

  thats a cent
  hows that called  i can just read  magentic separator   on the label
  magnetic pickup tool
  which is exactly why most people dont use it if what youre panning is the gold flour sand separating it this way doesnt help much as it doesnt separate well
  you are supposed to exchange the gold for things that will have much more value before shtf like guns and ammo
went gold panning a few times with a school pal in pacnw find almost nothing in the river itself almost everything we get is in the river banks themselves i would like to build a sluice box to make things more efficient next summer to at least break even but i have no delusions of grandeur about making money people smarter than me have gone broke trying my ultimate goal would be to find enough to make a ring out of
  my ultimate goal would be to find enough to make a ring out of  same here if im going to give some jewelery to the gf its going to be something personal
  theres a post a bit higher up with instructions for a fairly simple to build sluice box
  which is exactly why most people dont use it  like everything in this hobby its a learned technique    sure most people never learn how to use it just like most people never learn how to bump a pan to separate gold its fine theres nothing wrong with never learning how to pan properly those of us that know use a magnet    if you want to learn understand that the secret is how thin you spread the sand gold only gets caught if the sand is stacked too thick to pull even then the gold can be shook loose almost all the time unless its very coarse crystalline or wire stuff

  i personally use speedpanning techniques to work as much dirt as possible    i set one empty 5g bucket on the bank of the river by where im panning    i take my other 5g bucket and put the 1/4 screen on it and then shovel dirt into the bucket through the screen until its full    then i haul my bucket of screened dirt down to the bank i fill my pan about 3/4 full and very quickly pan it out scooping pebbles out by hand once im down to cons i refill the pan and repeat the process i do this 35 times depending on the yield not spending more than a minute or two wetting shaking and panning each load     once the pan is almost half full of good cons i swirl the pan and snifter out the foxtail then i bump the pan and get any leftover colors usually the big stuff that didnt settle well then i dump the remaining cons in the empty bucket to sort again at home and start on my next pan full i can run through a ton or a yard of gravel pretty easily in 2 hours this way    once im home i spoon the cons into a flat plastic cake tray and run the magnet over them a little at a time i toss the black sand and repan the remainder for whatever is left    depending how far my dirt source is from the river i can screen and pan anything from 24 tons of dirt like this in a fairly relaxed and casual day of course thats not enough to make a person rich by any means it doesnt even pay minimum wage but i move a lot more dirt and find a lot more gold than someone thats digging screening panning and sorting one at a time if a person pans long enough theyll work out a similar routine eventually
  should add to this  for speed panning you just want a 12 plastic pan    you can pan out a 12 pan in a minute or two with great accuracy once youve had a bit of practice larger pans take a lot more time to work the same amount of dirt small is the way to go
and how did you cope with it /out/
story time  decide to do marcy on thanksgiving weekend  plan a two day 7 miles in 10 miles out trip via the john brooks trail  make the 6 hour drive up on thanksgiving day  friday morning stop into local outdoor shop to ask about trail conditions  the clerk says i dunno you should bring everything just in case  tells me i have to get a bear canister as well or i will get ticketed  the damn thing weighs 3 pounds and takes up my entire pack end up packing less food and having an unbalanced backpack   first 35 miles in not bad making a pace of 15 miles per hour instead of planned 2 miles per hour because of unbalanced pack  get to john brooks lodge at 12pm  next section of trail requires snowshoes theres weekold tracks there  pace slows to 1 mile per hour  half a mile in they stop and the trail is completely unbroken  its thicc snow too even with 30 snowshoes im sinking a foot in each step  even ask my self if ive lost the trail several times  eventually make it to bushnell falls at 4pm  calculate that my pace is an abysmal 05 miles per hour  normally nighthiking 2 miles to get to the slant rock site would be fine but with my current pace id get there only at 8 or 9pm  turn back and set up camp at the bushnell site  next morning calculate that if i try to make it to marcy ill end up caught in the freezing rain forecast for the night  decide i dont want to die and start heading back down    too bad the adirondacks are so far away i guess ill have to go back in march and daytrip via the van hoevenberg trail when theres more sunlight the trails been broken in and theres no dumbass bear canister regulations in combination with all the heavy winter gear all the bear canister did was weigh me down there were no bear tracks i didnt even see any park rangers    mfw on the way down passed a few people who commented it was nice the trail was already broken in  aat least i helped someone rright  pic rel my route
    boatloads of failures due to weather conditions injuries mine or partners equipment failure    ive reached a point where i just shrug and say well ill try again next time    thats it then i try again and do it
  and pic of my campsite  ggomen nasai rinchan im sorry i failed you
  im surprised that route wasnt broken yet and i thought you were staying in a leanto  i cant believe you brought a shovel methinks you need to go through your pack and figure out whats necessary
  im surprised that route wasnt broken yet and i thought you were staying in a leanto  the original plan was to make it to slant rock lean to but i ended up short at bushnell  also i couldnt find where the second bushnell lean to was so thankfully the shovel came in handy to dig out a campsite      methinks you need to go through your pack and figure out whats necessary  thats probably true  what is your usual winter loadout
  the main problem i think is that you started too late it gets dark at like 4pm as you know and the bear canister is a huge pain in the ass it works best to balance it between your pack and the brain and then just let it bounce off the back of your skull as you hike in you could have probably made it up the mountain the next morning though if you stuck it out your pack would have been 100x lighter with the tent and sleep stuff left at camp was that the day it was like 10 and windy
  most embarrassing one was when i got bit by a sheep so bad i had to turn around
    ive not reached summit in some occasions and others ive gone through all the way wishing i turned back by the end ive also had unexpected emergencies that forced me to rearrange the schedule but i see it all as part of the adventure completionist faggots are just that in my country they usually belong to a specific kind of ultralight / ultrafancy / ultrabald / ottermode / ultramanlet faggot in his early 40s
  if youve never turned around that means youve only hiked on welltrodden paths when its 70 degrees sunny and zero wind
cope  i just lived with it and learned from it because im a grownass man who understands failure is part of life and not a fucking 2 year old who throws a fit at every little set back
  never in my life
by myself ive only modified my route to be shorter and easier and include less summits      sounds like you really should have done a lot more research
  this summer i went on a solo backpacking trip with the idea of completing two trails after finishing the first one 80 miles or so i looked at my legs and had ticks everywhere because i thought it was a smart idea to hike a trail with little traffic wearing shorts i freaked out so bad that i started ripping ticks with my nails and using the tip of my knife to stab deep in my leg to remove a big one that had exploded when i pulled it off it was a shitshow i thought i was going to get tick fever encephalitis or an infection so next day i bought train tickets and went home got a decent scar in my leg to remember me not to be stupid
  i had to turn around this past weekend   i planned a perfect loop using 2 parts of the azt where it splits using some random trail to connect them  i got to my turn off of the azt and someone had carved an x over the trail name i was getting on got about 2 miles in and called it quits the cairns were the size of fucking pebbles     i destroyed hundreds of years of vegetation growth by having to bushwhack on the side of an major incline because the trail was gone    there are plenty of trails in az that just need to be taken off of maps
  hiking a short trail about 11 miles  get about 5 miles in  the trail crosses a clearing filled with thigh high thorn bushes  the trail is not well maintained in this section with the bushes growing onto the trail and covering it  its summer so i have shorts on  try to go through get cut to shit  have to turn back as there wasnt really a way around the clearing  decide to come back later with some heavier pants on
  your pack would have been 100x lighter with the tent and sleep stuff left at camp  yeah i was hoping id be able to keep a pace of 1 mile/hour to get to slant rock shelter by nightfall then the next morning just scramble up but leave everything at camp    was that the day it was like 10 and windy  this was on friday it started 10 but warmed up over the course of the day it was actually not bad besides the trail not being broken in      im surprised that route wasnt broken yet  i think it was because it had snowed a couple days before thanksgiving and no one else had gone up the trail since then as i was heading down on saturday i passed a few people going up the route since i was first on friday i ended up brekaing it in i would have liked to make an attempt on sunday but there was freezing rain forecasted saturday night and i didnt want to get my tent wrecked by that    pic of unbroken trail this was actually when you could see someones previous trail before they stopped a half mile in
  the route from the adirondak loj is much easier practically an expressway theyre both long af though
  yeah either to the weather going to shit or minor injury/illness one time i was hiking out to some alpine lakes in the cascades and slipped and sprained my ankle just before i got to the end of the trail another time i got the squirts halfway through a hike and had to turn around  you just go home get better and then go back and try it again later
  last winter i set out to hike a 20 miles dolly sods loop unfortunately temps go above freezing for a few days before we set out and then dipped down to 10 the night before we set out trail was essentially a creek with an inch or so of ice on top youd break through each step into a couple inches of moving water tried bushwhacking along the trail but only made it a couple miles before setting up camp honestly thats the most worried ive ever been feet were completely soaked and it was about 20 degrees set up a comfy camp and watched the snowfall from under my tarp for pretty much the whole next day hiked out and spent the night at a buddies cabin total failure from a hiking point of view but i still enjoyed myself and im quite a bit more confident in my fire making abilities after getting a fire started with ice covered deadfall
go outside  have asthma  ok
  panther creek trail in north georgia its a point to point trail with a nice waterfall about three quarters of the way from the widely used trailhead to the lesser used trailhead i made it all the way to the waterfall but the trail beyond was very difficult due to a recent storm knocking down a large number of trees since i made it to the waterfall turning back without making it to the end of the trail wasnt that big of a deal still annoyed me a bit since i set out to cover the entire trail
  yes first hike i ever went on was in a national park my parents had a cabin in i heard from a friend that the trail was good for bikes so i got my parents to drive me out with my heavy ass 20lb backpack and mountain bike got maybe half a km in before i realized i wasnt going to make it all the way as it was just getting to be rootier and rootier i turned back and had to bike 3 hours back to town with my heavy ass backpack on shitty experience imo but it taught me that doing homework on the trail is very important
  i was hiking the john muir trail for the second time and i somehow managed to get altitude sickness went about 6 miles the first day and had to stop because i was throwing up and having full body cramps spent the rest of the day drinking water and throwing up any food i tried putting in my body woke up the second day feeling a little better threw up breakfast and decided to keep on trucking made it about another 5 miles before i started getting full body cramps again and had to call it quits spent the next day doing nothing and just drinking water and trying to get a little bit of food in me to see if my body would adjust by the 4th day i realized i wasnt getting any better and i might not make it back over donahue pass if i pushed myself decided to turn tail and head back spent just about the entire day stumbling at a snails pace and made it all 10 miles which took about 9 hours it was probably the longest most mentally and physically challenging thing i have done in my life i was well hydrated but had zero energy and felt like death managed to hitchhike a ride out of yosemite to the gas station where i caught a bus into mammoth and got a hotel room i could hardly walk at this point and needed someone else to take my bags to my room i had to have a family member drive 6 hours one way to pick me up and they wanted to take me to the hospital i looked so bad told them to just get me the fuck off the mountain and it was like a fucking switch i went from feeling like death to feeling almost normal and able to eat again i have never had altitude sickness before this but it made me realize it is no fucking joke and to adjust a few days before you start high altitude hikes
this summer yes drove out to co from ks for a week to finally get /out/ first trail i attempted was lost man on 82 hadnt properly acclimated to the elevation and didnt bring enough water so i only ended up doing 4 or so miles i have never really hiked prior to this went back and did it at the end of the trip and finished the whole thing very pretty
  how did you cope   by doing it again and getting it done that time lol wtf
  yes lol theres no water in cuyamaca
  doubt
if youre pushing yourself properly then there are going to be times where you turn back op was just an idiot though he started too late didnt do his research and then was in too poor of shape to keep pace to make decent time
  i wouldnt really call them failures but ive had to make so many detours and changes of plans that i usually have several just in case x happens plans    lost a trail after crossing a sketchy river during huge rainstorm  after trying to find it for forever i give up cross back to the other side camp and climb back up the mountain id come down in the morning ended up being a day short on food which always sucks    blew out my knee on the first day of a weeklong bicycle trip  spent 8h biking uphill into a blizzard and fell several times on the ice ended up bussing half my route but still had a good time    i think i fail more just getting out the door especially in winter because you know you are going to suffer even if you will enjoy it later
  only time i have was for a hike that i underestimated how much water i would need and i chose to play it safe
not really my personal fail as much as the dogs fail but almost made me quit such a short hike    be me  doing 9 mile hike around a lake  have pupper  she has conquered decent trails despite being a small dog  figure this is longer than what shes used to but terrain isnt as bad  get about 5 miles in  she cant take it anymore  panting heavily give water but shes tired  eventually she just lays down and refuses to get up  have to finish last 35 miles with her on my shoulders    i felt really bad for pushing her that much ended up blasting ac in the car and force feeding her water the entire ride home
  i once showed up at remote trailhead 45 minutes from the edge of my city intending to do a 10 mile or so day hike i turned back after about a mile because there were massive spiderwebs and spiders every 10 feet or so on the trail
  i once showed up at remote trailhead 45 minutes from the edge of my city intending to do a 10 mile or so day hike i turned back after about a mile because there were massive spiderwebs and spiders every 10 feet or so on the trail  dont be such a pussy this just means you have the whole place to yourself
  wed already put off this hike twice before for other reasons so when i dislocated my ankle two days before i wasnt best pleased but resolved to complete it anyway we did between 1520 miles before nightfall and i was awake all night because of the pain the next morning my ankle had swelled up so large i couldnt lace up my boot properly and i could barely stand we were still close to civilisation so we got to a road called a taxi and i went home alone   how do i cope with it  i dont my weakness disgusts me
  need a bear canister
  its a garbage rule but they do require them up to this late in the season  apparently in the summer they go around writing tickets for 250 to all the nyc normies going up that way
  a couple of times along the same route  walk from my town to a small bit of ruins outside a town over  about 10ish miles 12 with allowanes for route not far so want to make a day of it  pass through the gorge a mile or so south of the ruins  by this point starting to fell hungry  realise i left most of my food at home  stop for a break then head back  nothing wrong really but i dont like walking distance with weight whilst hungry    same route new destination  the gorge has this huge ledge big enough to camp on about 40 up the side that is completely hidden from below  start out late thanks to chores  get there its been raining the past few days  side of the gorge is covered in loose leaflitter and soil  signs of a fresh rock fall in one place  its getting dark too  really want to camp on ledge but decide to turn back instead  feel like a right basedboy weakling for doing so    and thats really it for me i usually press on no matter what but somethings just cant be helped
  its a garbage rule but they do require them up to this late in the season  whys it a garbage rule we have a huge problem with bears entering and destroying camps every night and stealing food even with the bear canister requirements pic related was where he was planning on staying just this past summer i saw a man from the bronx get cornered in a leanto by a black bear he was eating in the leanto like youre not supposed to didnt think he needed a bear canister either its late in the season but its no guarantee that bears are denned up by now especially since a lot of low elevation has little snow cover  i will concede that they are incredibly heavy awkward and annoying to carry  old but funny bear from awhile back that was eventually shot 
back in the spring i took a wrong turn during a 3 day trip into a wilderness area it was either backtrack 6 miles uphill now or continue on without a map of the area i had ended up in decided fuck it and went forward on a gravel road ended up putting in 30 miles that day and then hitch hiking another 60 dont really count it as a loss its like fucking a chick and all of the sudden your roommate or the cops bust in and the whole event is called off not complete but you went with the flow and theres always another shot
  nah we should just let the normies get eaten until they learn to stay away  or just open up bear season in the high peaks
  or just open up bear season in the high peaks  you can take bear/big game up there its just a long ass haul out of the woods
  hiking in shorts    though maybe it would prevent me from seeing trails where there are none
  kind of similar story i was hiking bluff country in minnesota and walked through a bunch of fucking stinging nettles i didnt turn back because i was more than most of the way through the trails anyways but still sucked
    yes i was out last week 2day hike up a famous local summit but had to turn around 1k from the summit due to 1 of the exposed scramble routes being compeltely iced over    i had crampons and my climbing axe with me as i anticipated a bit of ice but it was too much to safely negotiate esp since it now gets dark at fucking 430pm    i won the mountain that day i would of lost if i went on and peeled off the side and died
  hey i have that tent how does it hold up in the snow i just got it a few months ago and only used it in the summer or is that one different than the 3 season
  yes a few times even and i hated myself for it now when im in those should i or shouldnt i situations i think to myself push on because you dont want to hate your future self
  nothing like being the first person on the trail and walking face first through spiderwebs every 20 meters
ive had to turn back many times causes include  poorly marked and maintained trail didnt feel up to rummaging around for an extra 4 hours trying to find my way to the summit so i just turned around  running into a momma bear and 2 cubs with no one around for at least 10k in all directions decided to not risk it and just turned around  running out of time to complete the hike before dark this has happened to me many times    such is life you win some you lose some
  its pretty great senpai i was inspired to try it with that tent after seeing this vid  dont know how itll hold up to heavy snowfall though  
  dont bears hibernate in the winter
i have had to turn around 3 times in a fucking row on the same mountain shit sucked so much ass     first attempt way too much snow unfamiliar with the area trail was covered generally unprepared turned around about 90 minutes in  second attempt still way too much snow but parts of the trail were visible postholed to about 5 miles from the summit which was way harder than i thought ended up turning around due to decreasing sunlight increasing cold/snow and delirium from exhaustion/altitude this was the hardest hike ive ever done in my life fuck plodding through snow without snowshoes  third attempt no snow sunny skies lets fucking do this tried a more difficult route we found on alltrails which had 42k feet of elevation gain versus the usual 2k wanted to camp out and summit in the morning we figure out after climbing 3k feet with our 50lb packs in the hot sun that this is not a real trail and some dumb fuck chink legitimately walked up the side of the mountain and decided to log it exhaustion and delirium from altitude made us turn around
  they do but see pic related 
  thanks for the video never thought of the bags full of snow to weigh it down so far i like the tent the few times i used it this summer i got it because it was cheaper and i could fit in it since im tall but i got a 3 season tent 22 degree sleeping bag and an extra tarp and inflatable sleeping pad its about 9lbs all together which isnt perfect but 25 of my bodyweight is still 45 lb so really isnt to bad and unless im in a windstorm or on top of a mountian its perfect for almost everything the main reason was i got all this for 240 after tax and shipping which doesnt get you far in terms of light weight backpacking equipment that doesnt outright suck i want to add a hammock or a bivey eventually into the system to diversify i got a big alice 2 molle bag i can fit it all in with plenty of room left for what it is i think it works out great and covers most of my needs
its seems like todays backpackers want to simply make camp eat sleep and get out ive watched video after video and half of them near the end talk about how they cant wait to get home and take a hot shower all while wearing gear that all weighs about as much as a grown turkey     does anyone else feel this way
what exactly are you butthurt about
  every single video is exactly the same  today were going to be trekking the fill in the blank trail   were doing a fill in the blank loop   we made camp heres dustin eating rice  morning now should take us another 5 hours to reach the end point   insert complaining grunting irritated girlfriend buddy complaining about gear going to upgrade next time     its always the exact same shit these people rarely share any insight on the area theyre in apart for its name and how long the fucking trail is its the same self fulfilling garbage every single time
  so why do you keep watching them better question why did you even start watching them in the first place i like talking to my friends about my trips and their trips but i couldnt give 2 fucks about some rando on the internet
  example
  
  weve gone 7 miles  the wife has had it  sometimes i wonder why we do this to ourselves  this has been brutal  gotta push through the pain  we did 7 miles today  gear is still sparkling    point made these two just like to shop
  ive watched video after video  hiking videos  wtf are you doing with your life
  honestly looking for areas in michigan to camp at but these idiots keep coming up everywhere theres a video i did run into with these young guys going through manistee forrest pointing out and describing every single mushroom in the forest     anyone got any videos that are worse than that
  looking for areas in michigan to camp at  its called a map dingus use your brain and stop looking for videos to spoon feed you
    harbor freight tarp over a double walled tent tied to tree with 1 mile of paracord  its kind of funny like those pack shakedown videos example  
  here friend             
  dont filter your water  dont carry extra lightsource cause it weighs to much  dont hang my food im not scared  every gram counts   dont need a whistle/compass etc  take shit outta your medkit just carry duct tape and ibuprofen  nugget nugget nugget       christ would this guy have just not hiked back in the day with heavy frame packs
  the last generation of frame packs weigh the same as most internal frames today
  just carry duct tape and ibuprofen  i agree with that one and if extra lightsource means carry 2 i agree with that one too though more due to minimizing clutter than weight
  bringing an emergency whistle  filtering water
  i cant be arsed to watch the whole video but if that guy is giving that advice out then the should straight up be fired
can anyone clue me in on what those gay little sticks are supposed to do
    here no complaining no super special gear sorry about the cringe intro and outro
  stability or something id imagine theyre really good for mountains and stuff but cant really see their functionality outside of that
  bruh im looking for places in preferably se to central michigan to backpack too gonna hit pinckney this weekend
  theres nothing se man waterloo is about as good as it gets for us im from livonia maybe kensington would be the closest but its turning into trash

what are the best dogs for /out/ for fishing hiking camping hunting boating anything else
  ive got a shepherd/labrador mix happy to go /out/ loves jumping into bodies of water and generally learns from mistakes also an incredible sense of smell he often runs away from the trail after deer but comes home 10 miles further after dusk without problem luckily no /k/ommandos with a hard on for dogs without a leash in my country
  reteivors   they were bred for it my friend
  labrador but make sure you dont overfeed they are fucking pigs
finnish lapphund i have one he loves walking in the forest thick coat keep him warm during the winter and he can sleep next to me on cold nights /out/ only problem is that he really likes to hunt small animals so i must have him on leash at all times
  any dog if it sticks by your side
  best dog is a good boy
just get a coyote
  this sounds like it would be a hindrance rather than a help in every conceivable situation
    these two    but a rescue dog would be my choice a newfie or st bernard
i like hound dogs great smellers and very loyal
cattle dog
blue heelers are absolute units they drop them in solo by helicopter on cattle runs i kid you not
  and they have toes
coonhounds are pretty good down south
a chihuahua   like most people here it never goes /out/ either
  a mountain dog
  border collie no question
  this  miss you kiddo
  my god what a lovely combination
  nice  id prefer pic related preferably with a little more wolf in her like my first dog
  i must have him on leash at all times  thats the worst kind of /out/ dog
  my st brenard just sits around and makes the most vile noise known to man    my three legged dog loves being /out/ and gets along just fine
labs win they love the outdoors and are awesome hunting dogs
  i have a staffie/lab/collie mix and he is awesome when out
bernese mountain dog
  this if youre in cold climate
ive heard of carolina dogs they were bred by native americans for hunting and being outdoors theyre loyal supposedly intelligent outdoorsy but reserved/shy theyre also called american dingo dixie dingo and yaller dogs wikipedia says theyre a sighthound and pariah dog they may bark at doors a lot
  coonhound
  they may bark at doors a lot  thats oddly specific
  i love my collie fucker has me wrapped around his finger though
  really pushing your luck there those fuckers will eat anything    there lovable retards but no way would i want one theyre a black hole for food that wants nothing else
  what makes them so great      rip to your doggo
  what makes them so great  theyre the asians of dog world smart and hard working
  i want a brittany for birds and critters soon
  huskies look fucking majestic but fuck all the upkeep for keeping a dog like that satisfied
no love for poodles
  not much honestly no theyre usually pretty mean and i had to put up with miniature toy poodles as a kid and it sucked
r8 me     mora is a gsp real good at flushing birds strong swimmer she likes chasing grasshoppers in the back yard for snacks when shes not in the field jumping pheasants    scout is a mutt predominately heeler but a fair amount of coonhound in the mix shes unstoppable on the hiking trail putting 20 miles in a day with no complaints she likes chasing rodents and eating them
  good girls/10
  why does your gsp wear eyeliner
    rural burger here all of my neighbors own guns nobodys dog has been shot only dog that got killed was due to a trap some methfag put on his property expressly to kill someones dog ended up backfiring on him because the resulting outrage got his methshit exposed
we tried some duckhunting  didnt go so well but look at that smile
  nothern
  oddly enough mine does not over eat he has stayed around 110 since he hit adult
  we dont deserve dogs
  sorry you had bad experiences i love poodles
  you got your doggos mixed up friend the gsp is on the left the mutt is the orange one on the right thats a good question one that i dont have the answer to she also has black lips and black spots on her gums contrastingly as far as i can tell shes got fair skin under all her fur
american bulldog unbreakable spirit high drive and ambition loyal to a fault and completely fearless they require tough love to not be total shitbirds though rip good girl
  brainlet dogs
  not in my experience most are highly intelligent and i literally taught her to protect a tortoise from the cat you might be thinking of pit bulls which are vastly different despite the appearance
  they love water so they disturb the fish
  american bulldog  that is a pitbull and you know it    garbage dogs for garbage people
ive got a catahoula loyal energetic loves the outdoors fast as fucking lightning my dude got in a scrap with a pit bull hiking a couple weeks back pit couldnt hang luther was too fast and had the pitbull by the leg
rescued romanian doggo  pretty much anything from a shelter that has a good bonding to you  nonbreeds live way longer and are overall more healthy and have best properties of all breeds
  pic of my doggo
im thinking of getting a bernese mtn dog irish wolfhound or irish setter which one bros
  good dogs that happen to be for garbage people turning them into garbage dogs
  lol spoken like a true faggot if youre this retarded i hope you never get a dog you are clearly too much of an imbecile to sustain a life other than your own
  thats funny because her ckc paperwork along with the ckc registration numbers of her parents say otherwise stay ignorant fuccboi
/bestdog/ for snuggling which is the ultimate outdoor activity
my last one was rotti x lab tried to teach her to hunt rabbits it she just kept on finding echidnas
  rrusty
  you could have just gotten a niggerbull for free cant believe you paid for one
  niggerbull like the one that impregnated your mom and spawned you
  at least my shitbull didnt try to eat luther
  you seemed triggered anon did a big bad pitbull deny you his red rocket you do know that that the pitbull is blanket term for several different combinations of breeds right and my dog american bulldog not a pitbull lacks the terrier genetics that generally makes pitbulls prey drive and unruly or are you too fucking retarded to ascertain new information and reconstruct your opinion
  m a j e s t i c
if youre looking for a dog to bro around with you when youre /out/ i dont think you can beat a golden theres nothing that a golden loves more than to get /out/ with its favorite person and they stick by your side and are super easy to train for recall
  theyre also beautiful animals
my dog is a great hiking partner and confident on boats but hes such a sweetheart he would probably mourn the death of the animal and so food driven he would eat it it before bringing it back
im in this dilemma myself beagle passed away 2 years ago wanted a beagle but theyre way too scent driven leaning towards a border collie because intelligent duh will listen to commands immediately if trained properly energetic isnt prone to hip problems like other based breeds i considered german shep low prey drive and just stares at stuff they are curious of also energetic
  kek

  fpbp    btw im tired of astroturfing on /out/
i live in northern illinois and havent left my house in 3 months other than to buy groceries i desperately need to go out and enjoy nature with my dog spend a week or two in the wild and completely rewire myself and lose some stress    does anyone know any good areas around the northern il area its snowing like a mofo though so i dont know what kind of stuff should i pack i was thinking of going car camping to the shawnee forest but would i have to spend a fuckton of money on a tent or would a normal 25 tent work fine in winter if i have a good blanket and some jackets on top    any other tips literally my first time ever going out and living by myself life this dont even know how to make fire so ill learn that from youtube since im guessing itll come in handy while making food    thanks
i also have like 0 stamina so i prefer camping rather than hiking would hike a bit every day while im there though
dont you go out with your dog
  well yes but thats like around the block 1 mile daily
whatever you do it sounds to me like it might be a good idea to test in your yard its not a good idea to go camping somewhere totally /out/ without a certain base level of knowledge and experience with your gear during winter    its fine to work slowly and pace yourself but keep in mind that the more energy you invest into physical activity the more you will build over time your energy and stamina will increase with investment it might be difficult to find the will to start but the payback is more than worth it after a few months of regular activity youll look back at your starting point with amazement at the difference
  car camping  literally my first time ever going out and living by myself life this    bring lots of money to stop at walmart when you discover you forgot something    tent    doesnt matter except for one thing it needs to keep you dry a more expensive tent wont keep you warmer you can put a footprint tarp under a tent to help keep it dry just make sure it isnt sticking out where rain/melted snow can hit it and run under    dont use an open flame inside the tent co poisoning and death is a thing spend most of your money on sleeping gear for winter weather      that asshole who brings his dog camping
go to starving rock dude
  starved rock there wasnt really a place for car camping there from what i found a campsite where i can park my car and have my tent next to it
   northern illinois    chicago   i would not leave the house either
bump help
    you need more help than you realize or that you can really get here in any efficient manner i already told you to test things in a yard before going truly /out/ because youre going to have to get a sense of some things more directly for instance whether or not your blankets will be enough a 25 tent probably isnt going to hold up under snow when a tent that isnt designed for snow gets weighed down under it it can collapse or some tents it puts so much pressure on them that the zippers bust open    take whatever you have available to you test it determine what you need next typically if one were to use a tent in winter conditions theyd go with a four season of higher quality but if theres no snow one can certainly get away with a shit tent and ample personal warming equipment but you dont want to find out the hard way that your shit isnt adequate in an actual /out/ situation unless the worst consequence you face is having to pack up get back in your vehicle and go home    start by testing what you have and / or can acquire with your resources seeing what it does and finding your need from there i myself would lean more towards tarp sheltering and such but youd also need to develop some basic skills with fire and such it would probably be a good idea for you to seek out some basic camping videos on youtube also specifying winter youve got far more to learn than this format is best for without making a bunch of anons have to type nearly endless books worth of shit its awesome that youre wishing to take these first steps godspeed
  i need to get out of the house but first i will blogpost about it  that state of zoomers
  whats wrong with bringing a dog camping are you scared of them tyrone
  if youre not a fag and willing to cc illegal guns its quite fun riding around the hood at night think of it like an urban safari
    m8 ive brought my camper to starved rock they got sites with electrical hook up and heated showers in walking distance might not be operational this time of year  you must suck at googling shit
i live in northern il too white pines is beautiful this time of year anon and no one will bother you there
  is it free can i park my car next to a campsite never done this before btw
  how does one start  i really want to get into mountaineering but am a prototypical gym bro i am 60 and weigh around 200lbs at decent bodyfat  the thing is although i am somewhat strong my endurance is fucking terrible it seems i went outside today wearing a hoodie where i live there is a bit of snow and its pretty cold i ran up and down a few flights of stairs at a local hill and it fucked me up real good i dream of summiting big mountains but it seems like such a daunting task right now
  you might have to pay 10 bucks for the night but maybe they stop charging in the winter be prepared to pay the ranger when you get there its very inexpensive
  this is exactly what the campsites there are like  t was there doing this exact thing 2 weeks ago  starved rock is where you want to start its the training ground for every amateur /out/ist in the region
  im gonna be there a few times in december so if i see you youre welcome to share some mulled cider with plum brandy to warm up
  any other tips literally my first time ever going out and living by myself life this  go to archive org and download the 7th edition of the boy scout handbook read it the 5th edition is likely the best but its not on archive org  youll learn a lot
      it says 25 per night tho wtf
hi dont usually hang out here but thought you guys would be able to advise me best about my question im an aspiring army ranger not us and would need some good boots when marching with a lot of extra weight thats the 1 criteria along with them needing to be black as a ranger in my country you might need to walk up to 300km190 miles with a 6070kg 130 lbs equipment during a time span of a week have been looking around a bit on the internet but despite looking at quite a lot of various boots and sites i feel non the wiser i was looking at the rocky s2v tactical for a while but some reviews have been off putting mentioning how the soles got worn quickly laces being weak and some other minor things appreciate all suggestions
  a lot of us rangers have recommendations on boot models for rasp even though youre from a different region theyre probably your best bet for real knowledge on the topic just search for rasp boots youll find plenty of suggestions
  cool ill check it out thanks

  lot of the guys on bragg that go to special forces selection get their issue boots gutted at one of the korean sew shops off post sounds like it works pretty well you can find more info about it with a little googling
  dont really understand what you mean bragg i think you mean the base but i dont get what the korean sew shops do
  this is the only correct answer salomon quest 4d close second may be lowa zephyr tf hi
you need to be a ranger in an army that has vehicles  190 miles  1 week  pick one
  you need to be a ranger in an army that has vehicles  190 miles  1 week  pick one  27 miles a day for a week im not saying i could do it with a heavy pack but im also not an aspiring army ranger thruhikers and long distance hikers do 30 mile days backtoback all the time its not like thats unheard of

alright bear with me here since i am fairly new to going /out/ and i know practically nothing about knives in general let alone survival knives i heard from a few friends that the m9 bayonet is a good general survival knife and that it would really suit you anon can anyone here tell me if its good or not for these kind of things
  yes
also forgot to mention that a rating from 1 to 10 would be nice
if we say yes are you going to link us to your online store so we can buy one
  ermm no i am just here wondering if it would be good for a general purpose survival knife
  survival knife    how about you get a knife you can actually use for bushcraft instead of a literal meme knife for larping manchildren      no not at all
  bushcraft  not a total larp
  do you know what bushcraft is it is simple things like making feather sticks tent pegs pot holders up to more complex things like monkey bridges and huts sometimes all you want to do is sit around and carve out a kuksa or a whistle which is difficult using a survival knife all the things you would need for bushcraft happen to be all the same things youd need for a legit survival situation however survival knives are a complete joke and merely riding marketing coattails
  just get a mora if you feel like you need a beefier knife get a bk 16 if you want a survival knife that is more practical get a bk7 and pair it with a folder youll use the folder more
  carve out a kuksa  i have a titanium cup  why would i want a kuksa if it is not for larping
  why would you even need a survival knife if you have a house and everything you need from delivery food im not going out to larp like you homeless people    thats the far end of that logics spectrum
  i am fairly new to going /out/  welcome now lrn2catalog there is always a knife thread here if not multiple 
  actually no a real bayonet is made of cheap steel that isnt meant to be sharpened or hold an edge bayonets usually come with a dull blade of course you can sharpen anything to a razor edge but it will not hold that edge for long a bayonet is meant for stabbing and as a wire cutter not for working wwith it like a proper knife
    as long as its a real one ie ontario made    itll work
    they make it out of 420hc which is perfectly fine for woodwork and its tough enough for some chopping
  incorrect it is made out of 420j2 which is good for nothing
i dont understand the hate behind bushcrafting and how its larping tbqh so people carve wood big whoop look at the faggots at /k/ who literally spend thousands on stupid gear thats issued to troops for free just so they can shoot at paper targets with their 15 pound tacticool ar15s acting like theyre any different from dumb airsofters that is larping
    depends on the maker us has a few makers of them    j2 is fine for woodwork though and its still tough steel you can make feather sticks tent pegs and do some chopping with it the edge will hold enough for that
    o and j2 is easy as hell to sharpen not to mention that its very stainless    id rather a fixed j2 over a fixed s30v not a folder of course
  please no more gun brand knives youll make me cry
if you spend more than 15 on a knife to use for anything more than cutting cord or menial camp chores youre probably a living breathing meme
  or i need a big fuck knife to larp as rambo as i cut down trees with my gun
  if youre new to going /out/ start off with a mora if you like it and want to get fancy after that skys the limit survival knives are a meme
  the main things you want are full tang and a flat back anything thats a multitool is going to suck carbon steel if youre prepared to actually care for it stainless if you prefer lowmaintenance    mora is a good brand ive chopped down 8 thick trees and sparked fires with churt from a carbon mora
  you want full tang  so get a mora  nah mate
  also mora switched to ss no longer carbon
any /out/ anons from east coast canada
cb island my good man
  what are your favorite places in east coast canada we have it all here the atlantic the gulf of saint lawrence pei quebec ns and nfld and maine all within 78 hours or less
  ohh fuck ya bud what is your favorite city in nb
cape breton not new brunswick went to uni in nb for forestry seen a good portion of the maritimes
  any of you fine lads wanna give me the lowdown on east coast /out/ing ive heard lots about your boating and fishing but not much else  t western prairie dog
  im from nb lots of hills and rivers
  decent hiking
  yeah and canoeing lots of deer too
  sounds pretty based are crown land and parks pretty common/easy to access
crown lands are very easy to access keep your mouth shut but the east coast is pretty damn based for outdoor activities amazing fishing and hunting nfld is one hell of an experience moose bear and caribou hunting and all kinds of fishing from deep sea to back woods beaver ponds ive been to every province and territory in canada and in all honesty the east coast is highly underrated
  heres a map no matter where you are youre not far from crown land     
  south shore ns here
shhhh quiet dont let them know about it here on the right coast of canada where at on the south shore anon i worked the 7 mile lake fire back in 2016 just outside of keji
  im close to the south coast of canada
  it really is a hidden gem the immigration hasnt hit us nearly as bad as other places but im beginning to notice it hopefully it stays lowkey and this whole immigration situation gets shut down and we get trudeau out

field recording/acoustic ecology  thread for sharing recordings  techniques articles whatever else    links   great intro to sonic awareness                  
hi all  ive been lurking on these threads for quite a while and figured i might as well finally post something of my own     any criticism or questions are welcome
wasnt there an old pastebin with some beginners info on equipment and stuff
theres been some sort of ip range on me for 3 days    
  this one is so fluid that backdrop of the leaves the rolling sound of the howls then a crescendo of them
  been following you for a while on sc  your recordings are most often very quiet do you not normalise or anything and if so why not
    i appreciate the feedback that track was deliberately left raw except for the fades and export to mp3 i tried eq/spectral repair/normalize but the result sounded worse my soundcloud tracks are downloadable so that listeners can modify to suit their preferences i would hate for my audio to just rot on my harddrive and soundcloud could go tits up anytime the early recordings with my sony were never normalized now i normalize youtube uploads to 6 or 12 but soundcloud tracks are less processed   this month ive been experimenting with power supply options on the mixpre3 at home i got 40 continuous hours of audio using 2 external usb chargers on a ycable with lmount batteries as backup on thanksgiving i took that setup and a turkey to my trailcam it was still rolling the following day after temps fell well below freezing id like to get some more owls before the year is finished
now recording cant upload attachments off my phone    
since june two hikers have been confirmed killed one is missing presumed dead and one has been missing since november 23 in the area near longs peak and mt meeker both near boulder colorado if the missing hikers arent found alive that makes four deaths in that one small stretch of the rockies in the last six months     what do you think is /out/here taking these people
  killed  murdered or sensationalist take on screwed up and died
  the article is about solo hiking in the backcountry so supposedly its people that fucked up and died  but since we cant trust the official explanation i would say they were chased abducted and sacrificed by illuminati satanists its far more plausible to me than 4 fit people dying because they went hike alone
  post sauce on map
    it was put together by the missing 411 investigator pretty spooky stuff
  what do you think is /out/here taking these people  stupidity
    fuck off with your inane shit already and quit spamming
  damn bigfoot is temperamental as fuck
  t skinwalker
          
  discussing hikers disappearing and dying is /out/ related    t 4channel
  pic very related btw some cool threads were had
    no get your thinly veiled /x/ thread the fuck out of here
  why are you so defensive no one is even mentioning /x/ stuff heres the article  
  trying to bump book sales for christmas david
  the elements and/or physics why do bigfootfags think that the backcountry is just some magical place that wont do you any harm so there must be something nefarious in the woods offing these people
  fuck off if you bring in missing 411 its /x/
  what do you think is /out/here taking these people  honestly i think a lot of people are just inept and were raised poorly to where they think nature is just a fun and beautiful time they go out solo without having the knowledge to survive should shit go sour go off the trail to take a piss and then realize theyre lost they then die within 50 feet of the trail or wander off blindly in a random direction and then animals eat their corpses
  granted theres always the possibility of a serial killer there are estimated to be something like 50 serial killers active at any one time in the us but i stand by deathbymisadventure for most
  just forget trying to talk to these people once the reeeing starts there no way to stop it
  inexperience and arrogance
  theres no limit to the depth of peoples ineptitude /out/doors i remember getting a sr alert for a guy who went missing from a trail in the cascades a few years ago the trail was six miles long and had a parking lot at both ends dude got himself so lost off trail it took 36 hours to find him
search and rescue statistics indicate that the most commonly rescued people are amateur backpackers/hikers for the three following reasons lower body injury exhaustion and dehydration factor in high altitude inexperience and cold weather and you have your answer
  i appreciate the insightful answer also it has probably to do that inexperienced hikers are one of the biggest /out/ groups
  why did he wander off the trail like that before anyone starts im not suggesting bigfoot lured him off the trail im genuinely asking why someone would just wander off a clearly marked trail
  exhaustion hunger hypo/hyperthermia and dehydration all make you confused add on a poor sense of direction and lack of exercise and you have a lost hiker
  legitimately he just wasnt paying attention to where he was going and started following a deer path instead of the very clearly marked well maintained trail and when the deer path ran out he panicked and started wandering in a random direction instead of sitting down and waiting for someone to find him
i am friends with a few people people that were/are close with one of the missing hikers from the rockies so i was able to fb stalk him he may have been a casual but it didnt not appear that he was inept or particularly stupid the reason i am point this out to remind people that this can happen to anyone everytime we solo in the snow or take the tough trail we run the risk it so easy to dismiss every lost hiker as a dumbass or inexperianced but thats not always the case ive seen plenty of good outdoors folk mispack underestimate or overstep ive done it twice thankfully both times there were people there to help me dont be dismissive dont get sloppy
  makes sense when i was in the scouts we had a guy do pretty much the same thing he was following a trail that was more like a one lane road when he saw a deer trail he thought was a short cut back to camp one thing lead to another and bam he was lost took about 5 hours to find him
  thats pretty obvious i mean who the fuck here after hiking thousands of miles hasnt had a close call when youre solo a small slip and youre fucked regardless of how experienced you are
  talk to some of the earlier posters in this thread they seem to think the only reason people go missing is stupidity
  the reason i posted that is because as   said it does not appear to be obvious from some of those posts in this thread sometimes the amount of bad information passed on by keyboard warriors on this board freaks me out
  yeah same this would have been a good thread to talk about how people get lost in the woods and what to do if you get lost but no instead we get people calling everyone who gets lost stupid and then reeing about how bigfoot dont real
    it must be my hatred of the fucking californians moving here becoming a tangible force in this plane of reality    gotta finetune it to choose the right people though
you dont need to be a stupid person to make a stupid mistake it happens to even the best of /out/ists confidence adrenaline exhaustion and panic can all make an experienced outdoorsman pull a rookie mistake ive seen it happen as a guide and an /out/fitter to people that i knew personally to be experienced nobody is immune from making mistakes
  i wonder how many of those people disappear voluntarily  sounds like the easiest way to stage your own death since no body is required to be presumed dead
  probably not many because staging ones own death is pretty rare anyway id put it in the possible but pretty unlikely bracket
i hike that route and area all the time there was a recent snow dump that combined with winds created some deep as fuck snow drifts its easy to be walking on 2 of snow and be over 6 of snow that you suddenly punch through in just a few feet they likely fell off the back side on the narrows or off the icy side by chasm lake nothing paranormal needed to explain it its easy for dumb people to fuck up and die out there
  for me its the raped and killed by hobos
should i buy a buck 110 or something else should i not buy a new knife at all i can either get a knife or some books and camera film but not both what do
you should ask in the knife thread asshat 
  whats camera film
  you should ask in the knife thread asshat   also you should get some books and camera film instead you dont need a 75 pocket knife it does exactly the same thing as a 20 pocket knife when you have a job with expendable income then you need a 75 pocket knife or christmas list
    alright
first ask in the knife thread faggot    next do you already have a knife if not it is impossible for there to be a greater priority faggot    lastly if you have no other knife you should definitely get a knife before anything else but ask about it in the fucking knife thread assuming an invasion of other faggots havent made 30 more when theres already one faggot
  i do not known i saw a leaf in my yard with a strange curl to it i think i should make a thread about it and one about the wood lice under it
    now that sounds like a fine idea as there are no existing threads regarding either of those topics then i can come into the one which is dedicated to the wood lice and belittle you for being from some region that does not refer to them as roly poly instead
  roly poly  pill bugs you degenerate
    salbug you ignorant shitheads
gods nation the confederate states of america wins with roly poly at 3307 perhaps gassing the other 7693 would be the solution to most of our ills    
  i have worn a 110 to work every day for 5 years now great knife for its price and sturdy
  wait it was 75 i dont remember that its overpriced then
its winter buy a used book some nice craft beer and a roll of ilford delta 400
  c potato bug 1295  what fucking morons a potato bug is a jerusalem cricket
  i consider the buck 110 to be outdated by modern standards its a sturdy knife and a classic but innovations have come along that have made for better knives
  as for what might be a better option if you want a mitusa buck after having a look im now considering buying a vantage select despite not needing one and having just bought a bantam 285 versus the 110 you get the thumbhole instead of the nail nick you lose a bit of length on the blade but you dodge the issues of having a clip point as your every day carry
  oh crap the vs also has a flipper so yeah if youre spending the money explore the line there are more modern options that wont be as much pita when you need them as the 110
  i thought they were jew crickets thats what ive heard them be called they scream
  outdated    what are you a knife seller with a new gimmick lol
  the buck 110 is a great pocket knife the benchmade 162 is also a great fixed blade knife both knives compliment each other really well both designs are as simple as possible without special gimmicks in their blades which would ultimately weaken them if you can find cheaper knives with the same design and high quality go for them keep in mind the type of steel used for the blade plays a major role in how well the knife will perform beyond its mere design s30v stainless steel should be what you are looking for and that is expensive the buck 110 comes in 2 versions one is c30v steel and costs quite a bit of money while the cheaper one uses 420hc steel the benchmade 162 is also s30v steel     whatever you do stay the fuck away from chinese made knives and their steels there are several types but most are just 7cr17mov 8cr13mov or 9cr18movwhich are often abbreviated to only the first bit like 9cr or 7cr17 when reviewers say it is comparable to ___ which they list a german/usa/whatever steel they are lying through there teeth unless ____  shit because chinese steels are shit    as for your dilemma of what to buy instead of a knife books you can get for pretty cheap unless they are for university classes or even free if you get digital versions camera film is getting more expensive and is a consumable that youll use up soon enough i would go with getting the tool the knife that is it will last your lifetime and you can pass it down to your children or grandchildren so long as your maintain the tool properly and dont abuse it and teach who you hand it down to the same respect for a tool then it may be around for several generations
    110 is fine    just heavy and without a clip youve got the belt pouch though but its perfectly fine and can clean a deer no problems at all
cant go wrong with a buck 110 ive seen no reason to part with mine for the 20 years ive had it dont do stupid shit like baton with it or pry shit with it where a hatchet or bar is the right tool instead but thats lost on most people today who seem to only want some meme knife
    it got worse with those who called them millipedes and centipedes which assuredly were helmet wearing short bus riders but the saddest of all were the 1321 significant number at that who had no idea what it was probably most likely because they do not have them on big city sidewalks or in starbucks
truly fascinating creatures what with being terrestrial crustaceans
  naw man im just saying that personally and for the money involved if it was between the 110 or pic related id take pic related the 110 is a classic woodsman knife but it looks and probably functions as a product of the time it was designed knife design moved away from nail nicks for a reason
  though importantly its 100 personal preference different knives for different lives
  nail nicks    what
  the means by which you open the knife
      they make screw on thumbstuds
    fyi the ones with the thumbstuds or push buttons are illegal in a lot of places due to being able to open with a single hand
  what places have those laws i know that my state has some of the more convoluted in the country in regard to knives and yet a lot of it is only relating to minors
  oh i carry whatever the fuck i want so i never noticed
    it is a cop to cop determined thing and open for their individual interpretation no joke theres also special laws for various agencies and building locations all it takes is one asshole cop
  desu theyd probably have more questions about the glock than the jackknife i have  i do not consent to searches
  this isnt 2000 anymore they will detain you search you and charge you with as much as they can find if they want to if your asshole doesnt relax during that they will charge you with resisting arrest
  worked last year
  in marylandistan of all places
all knifey things said what benefits you more do you need the knife or do you need the books what is more beneficial and necessary to you in the moment is it a knife to have a knife or a knife to have a toy is it a book to have a resource or a book to have a jape
  holy shit i cant belive my mom payed 75 for that piece of shit back in the day wasnt even a good knife not bad but not good
  im hoping those people were just remembering the wrong thing because millipedes do sometimes roll up when you poke them and at least 50 of centipedes i come across are initially coiled when i first see them
    youre a lot more optimistic than i anon even though the pedes roll up only a full blown brainlet would ever confuse them    weirdest fucking thingi read your comment started my reply and got interrupted before finishing the reply i stepped out the back door to have a cig as i was staring off into the horizon of the setting sun i slightly moved my left foot and when setting the toe back down felt something under my shoe it was a curled up dead millipede

  the gouge hook for fishing is always really neat to use and so damn simple to make i dont recommend it for catch and release of course use a barbless circle hook for catch and release you can easily make gouge hooks out of any hardwoods but bone or seashell will be better and longer lasting    the primitive technology guy has been making iron iron prills      one very good use for stuff like that is miniature tools like needles spikes gig tips arrow head blades and metal gouge hooks if pounded flat and a hole made in one end they can be used to make a spoon jig fishing lure the only down side is that corrosion of the iron can destroy them rather quickly if not properly cared for after every use

opener of gun deer season in wi who else is out in their state and what rifle are you carrying 2506 remington savage axis here
  shot two last month one with a 300 blk and the other with a 223 both neck shots both dropped in their tracks
sitting all day waiting for a deer to appear so you can shoot it  niggertier hunting desu
  this    it is better to buy bags of corn cobs apples and a couple salt blocks place the salt blocks put down the other foods stuff 3 times a week at least put up a trail cam so you know what time the deer show up remove the salt block the day before deer season and any food left behind then during deer season you just show up earlier wait maybe 1 hour at most then blow the deer away    since you are not feeding/baiting deer during deer season everything is still legal if your location makes baiting deer illegal
still illegal as i read the regs any and all baiting is illegal in my part of wisconsin as to prevent the spread of cwd certainly works where legal though
  cow elk 308 sako a7 400 yards last week after walking a total of 180 kms before i had a shot
  in my blind right now   regular route traveled to feeding areas i found usually i spot and stalk or stalk in thickets but i am on my last couple days i will even have time to hunt and need to fill the tag   rifle is a m94 wintuff with a williams foolproof peep i can put 5 rounds into 4 off shooting sticks at 125 yards the trail is less than 75 should be good to go
  in my state all bait has to be removed 100 days before it can be hunted furthermore you do not have to be aware of bait in an area to be guilty of hunting over bait and the state definition of a baited area is anywhere with a radius of 500m from any humanplaced food or mineral item    what this means is your neighbor can put a salt block down on his property not tell you and youre still technically breaking the law if youre hunting 500m in on your land
  in wa seriously considered getting into huting this year but i havent taken the safety courses yet plus i couldnt find anyone to take me and show me the dos and donts  maybe next year
  lol thats retarded im glad baiting is allowed where i live
2 hunters have been shot and killed by other hunters in the last few daysreportedly they were both even wearing orange     there is no mistaking a human for a deer thats straight up negligent homicidethose people need to lose their gun privileges permanently    morons like that make all hunters look like trigger happy retards
tldr best way to preserve a foxs tail i cut off the body with the bone intact    got a question guys since i didnt see any threads related specifically to it i went feet hunting today on my dads land saw two does couldnt get a good shot on then cas of how dense the brush was so i let them walk saw a fox about twenty minutes later and shot it since my dad raises chickens first one i shot i cut the tail off how do i preserve it read on some other forums and they said if you cut it off submerge it out something called meths or turps for a few weeks no idea what those are another one mentioned putting it in a bag of borax powder for a while which is the best way since i cut the tail off not skin it off the body
  feet  deer since my phone is dumb
  bag of salt for 3 days then bag of borax for as long as it takes
bama big fat whitetail doe opening day in the first 20 minutes of shooting light then little spike buck about 20 minutes after that    2 deer on the first morning is amazing for me im coming out of a 5 year spell where i never had a shot at a deer and i only get to hunt maybe 4 days a year    308 ruger american rifle with the goofy boyds thumbhole stock
  meths  methylated spirits or denatured alcohol they really just mean in concentrated alcohol  turps  turpentine
  next time cut the skin around the bone and peel it off the bone youtube has loads of vids about it much easier and better resultst    meths are just denatured alcohol soak for about a week or two remove from the mixture wash it with soap or shampoo blowdry and done is your buttplug it will get stiff when it dries but just play a little with it to break te fibres and itll be supple again
  oh be sure to wash your hands they have tapeworms and all sorts of nastyness
  got the 308 version of the same gun love it
    i use a 12 gauge and 00 buckshot  2030 yards    always worked well for me with a kill zone hold    i use slugs on piggies though that works well too
  i carry remington 783 chambered in 308 winchester    its fairly accurate and good in most conditions works well for deer and i can reliably get vital shots at like 100200 yrds but it can go further if i really need to
hunting deer with a rifle is fine but please dont try and act like you know anything about hunting whitetail deer     s bowhunter
  nice kill anon
  kys faggot
  im in the virgin south so its shotguns where im at
  i bowhunt and i found that kinda wanky tbqh      also that you dont tell someone to kill himself because you dont agree with him the devil himself is going to shoot up your boner one day and then youll be in trouble
  feel free to return to reddit faggot
got my first buck for my second year hunting im using a t/c compass in 243 with a vortex diamondback scope got it for a good deal at 289 a while back im in kentucky so deer hunting is big
  savage 99a in 300 savage    mine has 95 years of dropping bucks under its belt
  savage 99a in 300 savage  patrician taste
  300blk ar never see deer in season always see them before cameras and in person most times it is when i am out with my daughter and she starts crying or if i am shooting they come running but i never see them during the season hunting over trails and acorns nothing
  finding an bowhunter that isnt a raging faggot is like finding an albino deer
  a shame they stopped making them
  pretty much this bow hunters are insufferable around here because they act like youre a drooling retard for using a rifle or shotgun meanwhile half of them use a crossbow anyways     first day wasnt too good no doe tags for me and a pretty sizeable one walked right up to me not a buck in sight
  shot earlier this year in central texas with my remington 700 havent had the chance to go out this season but hopefully can soon
whats your secret to removing the gamey taste    i live up north and the deer here live on acorns and pine bark so they dont get that sweet sweet corn diet you fibs get
last day of season wrapping up ive been hunting 3 years have sign tracks trails food gamecam coverage never see them until i put the rifle away have been in the woods every day for 2 weeks in the cold and the rain very discouraged
  this is illegal where i live
  if you want to shoot big deer  you cannot shoot the little deer
photo from last year  strangest deer i have ever seen  thompson center pro hunter 209x50
  i was found
  hehe nice i have had horses rub up against the stand before freaks you the fuck out at 3 am
  personally i cant understand killing foxes such beautiful and clever animals    then the nigger tier over the top firearm to do it at least hunting with a bow or something is worthy of some respect this is just trigger pulling
  just become a vegan already gaylord
  if you think hunting a given animal has anything to do with hating it youre retarded the ar is the most common rifle in america and it is often cheaper to build a hunting upper for your existing ar than to buy a bolt action rifle energy is energy sorry it isnt a wooden musket with silver engraving
  i recognize that image you posted it on /k/ once when you were bored during the hunt  we talked about shooting power line insulators and the availability of sad panda on mobile phones
itt wierd equipment stories with regards to pick related the hooks came like that from the factory all the other hooks in the pack were normal
  i do that with some lures but i us a treble hook on the end
  whats weird about it    that rig is used to rig dead bait/swimbaits and catch big salt fish like dorado
  they came from the factory like that when all the other hooks were not doubledup
  qc at the factory just missed em probably
  its a circle hook anon  
  those are circle hooks you put cut bait or live bait fish on them and use them for shit like trot lines or rod and reel fishing using a rod holder theyre designed so that you do not take any action to set the hook the fish will swallow the entire hook  bait and then when the fish goes to swim away the anchored line pulls the hook out of the fishs stomach without catching on anything until it hits the corner of the fishs mouth and hooks into it there its been popular for a lot of saltwater fishing for decades and has caught on with people fishing for catfish in fresh water in recent years    
      i wonder if it is autism or reading comprehension
  fug i didnt look at the picture close enough to notice that one was hooked in anothers eye
    op here dont sweat it anon we all make mistakes every now and then im just curious as to how they actually got that way since it would be nigh impossible to force the hook point through the other ones eyelet with the bard intact
  weird shit happens in the manufacturing process sometimes when i worked at a true value hardware store in high school i found a doublepunched washer when i was refilling a bin ive had it on my keyring for like 12 years now
dur dur dur look guys da hooky went in da oder hookys hole whaoahha epnic    a thread died for this piece of shit thread fuck you
  cry more
  very interesting indeed
  just report it and move on
  a thread died    use the archive
  t
  you can see in the picture that the barb is bent/got bent when it was indeed forced through the eye
  for a thread to die on /out/ it means that no one has posted in it for at least 4 days nothing of value was lost
  and yet here we are with this brain dead embarrassment of a post
  i did that myself to separate the hooks before that the barb was normal
  clearly its a fishhook fit for doubleking
im in the midst of a quarter life crisis right now im trying to eventually get a permanent position with the nps or forest service im a junior in college getting a degree in public administration and taking a lot of environmental studies courses my gpa is too low to qualify for pathways am i screwed how do i put my foot in the door at the nps or the forest service
  yes
join my band and carve a future in the outback
  second this   i am thinking about doing a nursing qualification such as ain or en to help me get into an /out/ job i am assuming that it would be helpful in some respects if anyone can confirm or deny it would be much appreciated  i was like you anon and took a shitty in degree politics and regret it like hell i would try and do something that has more of a practical application
  at my school public administration is the best degree option outside of maybe history with it im getting a lot of environmental management knowledge under my belt i just have no idea how to start getting involved directly ya know
  my gpa is too lowam i screwed  yes unless you retake courses until your gpa is good enough to quality  how do i put my foot in the door at the nps or the forest service  getting a degree is helpful but youre getting it in the wrong subject the forest service wants people who studied forestry    once you get your gpa up theres a list of schools to apply for      it might help for a paramedic job but theyre really looking for people with degrees in forestry or biology if youre getting a nursing degree thats really cool but youd have a better career in healthcare than in the forest service
  how about the nps would public administration help for the le path
g e o l o g y  most degrees require a month of field camp during the summer after your 3rd/4th year  study rocks its comfy
  ted didnt need any help from civilization to survive
you need tons of volunteer experience with tons of organizations and a ton of luck to have any chance of getting any sort of /out/ job and you will not be payed enough to survive on
  i have a bachelors in environmental science and work for a major counties environmental services department get a good education and pick the office life there is no good or long lasting path being out in the field unless you are a highly experienced researcher at a university or something   you dont need a fancy degree to work maintaining trails or building fences on public land if you want to swing a hammer outside then just join americorp and have fun but know that its a shitty dead end career
  lol  no you dont   just apply to the job you want and dont stop applying till someone hires you  the people i work with at the nps told me the same thing before i got hired there  if you have a specific park in mind go thee and ask a shit ton of questions  one thing about park personal is they love to talk
im a seasonal forest technician work 8 months a year primarily in wildfire management i also do some wildlife and parks work and odd extension/ public relations stuff the other 4 months of the year i do tree removal and operate heavy equipment mainly snow removal and frozen water line repair in fact ive never had nothing but an out job
  in my first year of trekking down the earth science path going balls deep into rock territory what field of geology do you recommend anon im not sure what im gonna do with rocksmarts
      structural geology is the /out/est of the geo fields  you literally study crust deformation
  how difficult is it to pick up a new seasonal job after you finish your last one
seasonal jobs are easy to pick up i could work every day of the year if i wanted i know most of contractors and a good number of business owners in my town they know how i work and most would hire me full time if i wanted i live in an area with a high unemployment rate as well a lot of people are just lazy and dont want to work this seems to be getting worse with the younger generations
anyone here tried hammock camping in winter or below freezing is it easy to stay warm with just a normal hammock sleeping bag and tarp over the top i hear people say extra insulation is needed beneath you any advice would be appreciated
yes you need insulation under you a sleeping bag will not cut it    underquilt or sleeping pad underquilt preferred but a pad works too    i camp every winter but lowest ive been overnight is only 18 hoping this winter to get below 0 ive slept outside for a nap testing at negative 5 and was warm
  i used to use a folding mylar window refletor you put behind the windshield of your car as extra insulation under my bag once i cut it to size it was pretty light and kept me nice and warm but if it was really cold out my breath would condense on the plastic and a little water would pool under my butt i suppose if you put a ground pad on top of it then you might be able to avoid that problem but i havent tested that for myself i think i learned about it from dave canturberrys youtube channel i think he has a series on cold weather hammock camping
  anyone have tips for sleeping better in a hammock  tried sleeping diagonally straight etc  always get leg cramps    maybe i just need to get drunk
  when you are in a camping hammock your back and rear are going to be the lowest point this will compress your sleeping bag disallowing a dead space within the sleeping bag to exist so about 80 of you is going to be fine but your back and rear are likely to be very cold     once that issue is mitigated there will probably not be many issues with staying warm and comfortable
  any advice would be appreciated  ditch the hammock and get a tent which will end up being cheaper lighter easier dryer and warmer in the long run
  get a tent which will end up being cheaper lighter easier dryer  going to have to disagree on all of those   camping hammocks are  the cheapest  the lightest  the easiest to set up  the driest
   what hammock you got what size
  going to have to disagree on all of those   camping hammocks are  the cheapest  for just the hammock sure but once you factor in the nice down underquilt bag/overquilt bug net and tarp to keep you warm and dry the cost is over what a tent pad and bag will run you     the lightest  ul ground system will always beat a ul hammock system    the easiest to set up  definitely not hammocks are limited to areas with trees which then have to be of a certain strength and distance from one another tents can go damn near anywhere      the driest  id actually agree with this a good tarp setup  being off the ground is comfy in the rain     but none of that matters bc you forgot the most important factor comfort a good hammock setup is way comfier than any ground setup not including car camping     t have both prefer hammock
  thanks im thinking about spending 5 days /out/ in a hammock and i dont want to carry too much so do you think if i placed all my spare clothes under the sleeping bag that it would work if not i guess ill just need to carry a sleeping pad too
  not him but anon it doesnt work very well to put insulation under your weight certainly not something like clothes an underpad with a proper rrating maybe but in my experience an underquilt works best you need to put it on the outside of the hammy so your weight doesnt compress it which ruins its insulation properties
  ok thank you
  a sleeping bag will not cut it    stop using cheap 3season sleeping bags in winter and get a subzero rated sleeping bag the coldest ive slept in was 25f and all i had was a tooshort scratchyasfuck wool army blanket fuck that we woke up with 2 feet of snow covering us and no frost bite thankfully      if you have a proper sleeping bag for the temps youll be experiencing then you wont need anything else under you remember no matter what gear you have you never go out and use it in the field until youve thoroughly tested it locally you may find that your 300 subzero sleeping bags stitching lets in too much air along the seams or doesnt retain enough loft under you so work out all flaws and fixes before going out like what  did nap testing if you do find you need padding a wool blanket is excellent for that even if they are a bit heavy they dont compress as much as warmer down does    
  my biggest gripe with hammocks is that sex sucks balls in them
whatever happened to canvas hammocks  whats a good hammy
  drunk helps but just get a small pillow or stuff sack full of clothes and put under your knees it works and youll sleep like a baby at least i do
  not in a hammock insulation under you is essential no sleeping bag will be as good as an under quilt your body compresses the insulation and the air flowing below you just sucks the heat out cold butt syndrome or cbs is what the cool kids call it
pic related is my setup i use a warbonnet superfly tarp which my friend to the left is borrowing a warbonnet blackbird xlc hammock with winter topcover a warbonnet yeti underquilt and an enlightened equipment revelations topquilt night in pic related got down to 20 deg f and i was seriously warm almost too warm i had to take off all my cloths and slept in just my boxers you could replace the uq/oq with a 0 deg one and go below 0 easy imo
if you are using a hammock you could probably just throw some rocks in a fire and pull them out with some sticks and put them below you  you could also manage without it if the tarp was rigged to provide an insulating dome and the hammock hangs no lower then the shelter that way the warm air has to push down and out
  wut
    i would argue that hammocks are easier to set up because although you need two suitable trees thats all you need i hate cleaning a tent spot of rocks and sharp shit i hate finishing that 8 mile climb with a search for level ground for my tent i hate accounting for the path of rain water should a storm come through hammocks let me forget about all that shit just gotta find two trees fifteen or so feet apart and im done
  obvious best option
  i agree definitely depends on where you live but im on the east coast in rocksylvania there is never a spot without trees i camp every winter with a buddy who tent camps whenever we are done with the hike and try to find a spot we have to find a flatish spot for him which sometimes takes a while i just find 2 trees near him and al it good
  youre doing it wrong hammock sex is best sex
  no sleeping bag will be as good as an under quilt    youve never used a good sleeping bag then the expensive ones 300 are fine      the only good positions is standing off it and using it like a sex swing not comfy in the rain or cold spooning and missionary sex are worst sex
  expensive ones typically are even worse in a hammock    the super cheap ones with thick synthetic insulation that doesnt compress well does better    an expensive bag with good down insulation compresses really well so you have even less insulation below you    there is a reason why every serious hammock user has underquilts
seems the right thread to ask  what are the best knots to attach a tarp to trees  what about hammocks
first post on /out/ this is exactly what im working on this winter been sleeping in the backyard on weekends in anticipation of long weekend out at an abandoned fire tower a few miles away i live in northern mn so ive had to learn quick coldest ive got so far is 5 and its gonna get a lot colder    ive got a cheap tarp i string up for rain fly 30 2man hammock from walmart 30 selfinflating sleeping pad from amazon 150 surplus 5piece sleeping bag system from ebay and 4 straps to replace the ropes the hammock came with about as cheap as you can get and im entirely comfortable you dont need to spend much money on any part of your setup as long as you have all the necessary parts the sleeping bag is probably the most critical part and i couldnt recommend the surplus bag more any other 30 bag ive seen is at least 200 second most important is the pad which doesnt need to cost much at all bring a roll of bubble wrap if you dont want to shell out for something that compresses itll work just as well
    light fire  hang hammock over fire  get in hammock  enjoy warm and comfy sleeps
  how about a bivouac    put a tarp above it if weather conditions demand it i spend all my night outings in a bivouac and couldnt be happier
  a warbonnet blackbird xlc hammock     what are your thoughts on the xlc im seriously tempted to buy one
  explain positions
  made a 5days trip in eastcenter finland koli national park about one month ago the lowest was about 2c the water around me was frozen since here im as an exchange student i dont have my usual camping stuff the most important thing is make the humidity escape i had a 15 hammock a pretty good sleeping bag and a self inflated sleeping mat rly important bc the air under your body inside the mat will keep warmness to escape i took the tarp shitty plastic 250 tarp  out bc i noticed it was trapping humidity dressed a lot only a pair of good socks not too tight best option i thermal underwear hat socks and if its really cold you can put a bottle of hot water in your feet i didnt need it have fun
  you would need a shitload of hot rocks to do what using an underquilt would
  youve never used a good sleeping bag then the expensive ones 300 are fine    you literally have no idea what you are talking about in a hammock the bag gets compressed under you when that happens there is no insulation then you get cold    this has been proven time and time again    underquilts or sleeping pads are required for cold weather hammocking its not even up for debate
  this
  best way to get a good nights sleep in a hammock is by laying flat on the ground in a tent
are you opting outside anons
  black friday is consumerism and i would rather pay 5 more for the shit i want any other day of the year than go through the herd of fat fucks on scooters to get a shitty jumper cable set and an xbox
  i dunno i got my mrs xmas present for 60 instead of 120 i honestly dont understand what black friday is apart from some thanksgiving crap which is stupid cos im a britbong and we dont even celebrate thanksgiving but w/e i just saved half a days brass
im poor so i finally got the jacket and quilt id been eyeing for 20 less theyre pretty niche so they dont pop up second hand or id buy them that way    thanks amerilards
  this days shows sums up everything thats wrong with west morally and physically broken people trying to fulfill their shitty lives with junk feels like most people are just waiting for a opportunity to escape their miserable lives and the funny part is all the shit about muh environment muh sustainability when in fact no one gives a shit outside the likes of the internet what really counts and people live for is to consume like the disgusting pigs we truly are  now keep working waste your life behind a computer screen be a good boy and buy that new phone that will be obsulete in 3 years that will give meaning to your life
  well said anon
  my family does thanksgiving on saturday so sadly not also my regular hiking buddy just told me hes been dating my sister for three months so my next trip will likely be solo
  fuckn rei will do anything to keep as much money as it can lmfao
  heres an f bud im sorry  ill take another shot for ya
  (((optoutside)))    what a totally hip and cool way for rei to not discount any of their already overpriced gear
it fucking 32 degrees and raining ice fuck you rei im staying inside
  i have a job so i gotta fucking work rei fags
here in méxico is the jewish at their maximum  the black friday is a weekend before the actual black friday and its calles the good weekend   and this is what most stores do an example  item x costs 60  a week earlier stores rise the price to 90  for the black friday ítem x will have a super awesome discount of the 20 now its only 70  so yeah you basically buy more expensive shit
  stores in the us do the same shit mexibro
  you can run from the (((menace))) (((consume consume consume)))
  hey just like they do in europe mexico you are just like us afterall
  mine too fortunately we do it out in the boondocks in the sierra foothills so we still get to run around innawoods for it
  do you not have some kind of fair trading laws thats illegal where i live
  giving their employees two days off is a bad thing  
theyre anti gun i dont go there anymore anyways fuck rei go to cabelas or a local shop or something
  be a real /out/ and make your own gear
i dont let mcfaggot corp tell me what to do so i spent her with family eating pie i made
  why are you buying anything on location
  im sure they would be happy with that the message just seems to be that you shouldnt mindlessly consume just because something is on sale
  you sound like a real faggot friend dude is probably better off having fun reaming your sister and doin things without your jaded ass
  i mean i bought an ar 15 pistol upper and a bunch of high capacity clipazines online while watching the waltons though all in all a wholesome day
  t sisterfucker who didnt have the courage or respect to tell his supposed friend what he was doing for months
  i used to root my buddies sister and date her for 3 years neither got cut cause they preferred it be a mate of theirs than some random uppity goof like yourself b
  its her life not yours lil nigga be happy for your sister and your friend stop being a coward
  absolute state of gunfags
  when you use the npc meme without using your brain  the people who use that shit meme are the same people it should be used on
  cool reading comprehension
  more like jews are the same all over the world
  employees get two days off  they do a weeks worth of discounts instead of just a day  k
  youre paying out the ass for the warranty
on a slightly different note outdoor related sites have been posting nothing but shilling and products to buy for the last month non stop you go look for articles and all you get is christmas gifts suggestions for hunters for hikers for strong wyman for dogs and so on and so forth   tfw industry keeps talking about muh environment and the same time most fail to acknowledge that consumerism is one of the things that fucks it the most  bunch of hypocrites  /rant
what are /out/ anons look on zippo lighters
  fuel evaporates too fast
  they make cool noises and i like that i dont have to hold a button but     ill use them on overnights but never depend on them for long trips
  yep you have to carry around a refill can on extended trips which isnt worth it even three or four bics would be preferable
  get an imco  the fuel last much longer due to a better sealing cap  the flame is adjustable with a little slide that opens and closes the airflow  same fuel  same flintactually has a little space for an extra one  same wick
  also you can light it and then pull out the fuel cartridge to use like a match when lighting a pipe or a trying to get into a small stove door stove
those lighters are not for going /out/   need too much maintenance and they are not trusty
  problem solved you lose out on the cool guy flicking motion though
  fpbpd
    30ml vape juice bottle  its got a dripper tip for filling and it holds 47 refuelings
oops i dropped my zippo  there goes 20  get a bic lighter and dont evaporate less larp points though  but then i cant do cool fedora tricks and offer a light to mlady
i have both normal ones and ones for pipe smoking where there is a hole in the windguard so you can light you pipe and it works okay but fuel evaporation is a bitch
        most people cut a gasket out of a piece of rubber to keep that from happening evidently it can last for months longer that way    id rather use one of these anyway
  based and barbecue pilled
cant do this with a bic but the fuel evaporation is no joke bics are so cheap and ubiquitous
    i did some testing over the past few months on how long zippo fuel lasts in these lighters    i lit each lighter once a day    plain old zippo filled to full capacity with zippo fluid  lasted 13 days before not lighting anymore    zippo filled to full capacity with zippo fluid and also wrapped with a piece of parafilm  lasted 46 days before not lighting anymore    exotac titanlight filled with exactly 3ml of zippo fluid  lasted 84 days before not lighting anymore
  info noted and saved
  disposable lighter  far cheaper  far lighter  can carry backups easily because cheap and light  more reliable  zippo lighter  makecoo0l m3tal sound  should go well with your fedora trench coat pipe etc
  thank youvery helpful
    it isnt a bad idea to take a zippo type lighter as well as a bic the zippo will light no matter how cold the fuel is and is much more wind resistant
  oh and on a serious note dont trust lighters or stoves with a piezoelectric igniter to work at high altitudes
  more wind resistant yes but napthalighter fluid has a flash point of 22c whereas butane has one of 60c flash point being the minimum temp at which vapors will ignite given an ignition source
        this is pretty common knowledge
piece of bicycle tube seems to help
      you can fix that by just using a higher flow rate for the butane the adjusting thing   there is no getting around the fact that naptha is simply not capable of burning at as low of a temperature as butane although this can be solved by keeping the lighter in your pocket or close to your body so it stays warm
    you can fix that by just using a higher flow rate for the butane the adjusting thing     that wont work  you need to heat the lighter up before it is usable
from a shooter website    the 100 usamade zippo will really be the only lighter which will work after all the pressurized or disposable butane lighters are broken or empty assuming you have enough flint however flints from disposable lighters can be harvested and wicks and cotton packing material can be made the zippo is the only lighter that can run on almost any flammable fuel and will ignite when a spark is applied to it even if you dont have fuel or a wick the cotton stuffing can be removed and used as tinder with the striker to still make a fire yes the old 1933 design does sound like the survival tool that could continue to put a spark in your fire well into an uncertain future    another benefit of the zippo is that the wick can be adjusted for different heights for a little or a lot of fire depending on the need or the fuel used thumb free it can provide a small sustainable nohands fire where other methods would be impractical or inconvenient and when placed on a fireproof surface it can burn from full to emptya feat no other commercial lighter can do without exploding or melting into puddle of plastic key to being handsfree and selfstanding means you can heat a cup of water which i have done or use it as a simple heat source for everything from melting paracord to taking a little chill out of your oneman tent
the zippo lighter has some unique benefits as a survival tool such as a near indestructible case function unaffected by altitude easy maintenance and repair nohands burning signaling/mirror if you have a polished model and simple functioning you should however know what preferred zippo supplies to have on hand to support your zippo long term in an article i found online the author compiled 448 days of zippo use data lighting approximately 3 cigarettes a day which provided interesting information such as flints lasted an average of 44 days refills lasted on average 12 days and wicks average life span was 111 days    based on the compiled data such as this a zippo user would need 12 oonces of zippo lighter fluid two packages of flints and two wicks per year to run in factory spec state if you are a chain smoker it is common practice to stash a couple wicks and extra flints under the felt a 6month supply of one wick and six flints can easily fit under the felt and batting for the time you need it all handy information to know
where almost every other lighter requires a special fuel in a survival situation the zippo can operate on almost any fuel which will ignite when exposed to a flame although not recommended by zippo several users have tested various alternative zippo lighter fuels the list below demonstrates some of the tested alternative fuels for a survival situation and ranks them from the likely best to worst     all wick lighter fuels zippo ronsonol etc   camp fuel naphtha   some paint thinners naphtha   rubbing alcohol isopropyl alcohol   everclear / grain alcohol ethyl alcohol aka moonshine   kerosene   cologne   diesel fuel   jet propellant jp  4   lamp oil   gasoline dangerous but does work    one of the most significant notes of his testing was validation that camp fuel which many of us have already tested in zippos works as well as wick lighter fluids i have noticed camp fuel typically does have a smellier burn than some of the more refined wick lighter fuels from a disaster preparedness perspective you should have a low tech manual pressurized camp stove and at least a gallon of camp fuel on hand anyway however it is good to know that one gallon of fuel could also be used as a nearly infinite supply of zippo lighter refills as well
the flints on the zippo are very good compared to most other disposable lighter flints when using a zippo to start tinder when the fluid is dry simply move the wick over to the inside and loosely place your tender in the wick cage if you have nice dry and light tinder perhaps some of that cotton battening from the lighter itself would start right up  zippo lighter atop gift box    beauty and survival all in one package for under 30 it even comes gift boxed    once the tinder is lit move it to your preprepared tinder birds nest to facilitate more flame and larger tinder tip standard cotton like fluid filler is actually synthetic and does not burn well so i do recommend replacing all or some with cotton that will provide you with extra tinder for longerterm storage your zippo can be filled and then dipped in wax to seal it from evaporating however the wax should be removed prior to use another option is to use an empty contact fluid bottle to carry your spare fluid for extended storage  final thoughts    i always carry a couple disposable butane lighters in all my purposebuilt bug out bags with ferrocerium rods highend windproof microtorches are without a doubt the fastest firemaking tools available however they go through fuel quickly then what in a longterm survival situation the problem occurs when a refill is needed and this is where the zippo becomes the preferable firemaking tool    ferro rods are an indispensable back up option however a lighter will always be quicker and simpler fire making option if a catastrophic event occurs the zippo becomes a barterable item until then you can slip one of the most well recognized and coolest fire making tools in your pocket all for about 20 for the just in case we hope will never happen whether on the streets or in the woods
all this good info with zippos and nobody has said that you can just use petroleum jelly to fix the evap issues or the fact you can just take old empty bic lighters and use their flints for your zippo their the exact same ones and same size
ok  here is an amazon listing for lighters from 5 bucks to over 200 bucks  how the fuck do you dig out the cheapest one  there is like an infinity and i only want to see the five dollar one    
  classic street chrome has 5 shipping
  how the fuck do you break a zippo  ive chucked one at a squirrel on the trunk of a tree and it was fine
  months longer  it buys you an extra week extending the lifespan from 35 days to 10 days    ironically the cheap chinkshit knockoffs keep fuel slightly better because they use less wick
  at high altitude  i had no problem lighting cigarettes with a gas station storebrand butane disposable at 14k ft lit the first time every time i honestly have more issues with lighters at low altitude in extreme cold i hunt in january in nd at all of maybe 200ft above sea level every year and when it hits 40 my lighters need to be warmed up for a few minutes or kept in an inside pocket before they work    so unless youre regularly climbing the tallest mountains in the world in the middle of winter its a total nonissue
  
  near indestructible case  it falling over under only its own weight is enough to bend the hinge to the point it wont close not even the cheapest 79 cent gas station scripto will fucking break itself
  bend the hinge or dent the lid both of which are done with less than 8oz of pressure a zippo that doesnt close is a zippo that will be out of fuel in 4 hours
  it depends on the way it is made and implemented if theres no air holes then theres no evaporation specifically it comes down to air holes and material type some materials are still gas permeable but will slow it down a great deal
  yeah i have a zippo i use zippo brand zippo fuel i fill it to capacity if i get more than 72 hours and 5 lights out of it im extremely lucky    i did the gasket mod it bought me about an extra week but the gasket dryrotted in around 4 months    ive tried petroleum jelly all that did was turn my little zippo into a fireball the first time i tried to light the thing not perfectly upright
  fucking ruined
  did you just click on every one till you found that or do you have a trick
  nah no trick i just know that one is always the cheapest
    if i get more than 72 hours and 5 lights out of it im extremely lucky    you are extremely retarded and dont know how to put fluid in another thing
  my piezoelectrically ignited stove and lighter wouldnt light at around 12000 ft but the regular flint lighter worked just fine also a quick google search will yield similar results so my point stands it might work it might not work but dont trust it to work
  ive had one bic lighter i borrowed from a gf about 10 years ag lol i dont really use hardly at all but everytime i do it just works   still has just as much fuel as it had in it 10 years ago
  cant write a coherent sentence  calls others retarded
  i put my fluids in your mom
  zippo  15   exotac  96   just get a bic
  my piezoelectrically ignited stove and lighter wouldnt light at around 12000 ft     the air must be too thin for it to arc properly youd need to get the two pieces that the spark travels between closer to each other for it to spark properly though it may not ignite the gas easily with a shorter spark
    zippos are about 10  titanlights are about 42
  pea lighters  zippo 100  but why limit yourselves anon when /out/ heat is important i carry a cricket lighter for smoking refillable and replaceable flints i have a pea lighter on my car keys and a turbo butane lighter tied to an inside pocket on my edc bag many options are better than one option
i have been using this day in day out for like year i smoke cigarettes like a chimney i also use it to light my cigars and blunts it is butane completley idiot proof on maintence and more bulletproof than any zippo i have ever owned looks nicer better made and to really say fuck you to zippos is it butane which outlasts any fill under any circumstance you give a zippo also this one has been in use since the sixties no changing wicks here what kind of joke is that   change wick every 111 days   tha fuck you mean
  nice bd light i think i need to upgrade mine since the led is noticeably dimmer and its held together by duct tape but they only have one that has a backofthehead battery pack and its 100
  what are anons /out/look
  i forgot that the word view exist
get a butane insert
  fuckn a
  shit
  what type of ignition
  not him but the ignition is flint  you can see the vertical wheel in the pic where the dimple pattern breaks on the corner right at the non hinged side of the opening  you spin that little bit clockwise
would kerosene lamp be a good idea to heat up the tent a little like if id hang it from the ceeling they seem pretty safe    would covering tent with thermal blanket help i was also thinking about seting up a tarp over tent for wind protection etc     what to use for isolating tent from the ground thermal blanket or something stronger    my iglo tent has a decent ventilation on top i understand it might not be enough  and i sid saw that fin guy cook inside british arctic tent yesterday
dont keep the whole tent warm keep yourself warm
do fire screens really reflect some heat twards the shelter or is it burrushituru meme
i just learned about this thing from helsinkipop looks like a good idea cause is compact yet should burn long thus good for winter as heating feeding the fire consumes a lot of time        will try this soon i hope
  would kerosene lamp be a good idea to heat up the tent a little like if id hang it from the ceeling they seem pretty safe    just no risk of co2 pooling at the bottom of the tentsynthetic materials catching fire is non negligible    would covering tent with thermal blanket help i was also thinking about seting up a tarp over tent for wind protection etc     nope youll be better off using the blankets for yourself  which sleeping bag youre going to use  which temperatures are you expecting  do you have a proper sleeping mat  are you camping near your car    my 2 cents if you are car camping bring 2 2l water bottles before going to sleep heat the water and put it into the bottles again close the cap carefully put them in the sleeping bag and enjoy the warmth
  nope youll be better off using the blankets for yourself  i can take 2 or 3 theyre weightless  cheap  what about the tarp   which sleeping bag youre going to use  some noname mummy bag it served me well in cold summer days  which temperatures are you expecting  not more than 10 most likely less might rain though it always makes it feel colder  do you have a proper sleeping mat  i like my bundeswehr mat i also plan to take rubberized on one side blanket  are you camping near your car  nope plan an onfoot teip    2 2l water bottles  thats a good idea since i always carry lots of water anyway though its probably better to find bottles that will be more resistant to heat normal bottles deform easy from warm water or just take a canteen
  a reflective wall really does work yes      put the thermal blanket shiny side up on the bottom either under the tent floor as a ground sheet or inside the tent on top of the tent floor on top of this put one or two wool blankets then your sleeping pad on top of the blanket/s you in the sleeping bag on top of the pad you need dead air space in the blankets between you and the ground so using just a thermal blanket wont work well   if your pad is simply air filled without insulation of any kind youre going to be a little chilly  do not sleep with your head inside your sleeping bag or you will wet out with condensation a few hours into the night bring a wool balaclava to wear  no lamps or candles inside the tent use chemical hand warmers in your sleeping bag if you must  bring extra socks
  carbon monoxide you dumbfuck the rest of your post is right
    
  are you some kind of retard son keep yourself warm in a sleeping bag dont think youre ready for winter falling     and stick your stove canisters in there if its below 25 or so
  keep yourself warm in a sleeping bag  i want to be able to stay warm before going to sleep to like chill and read a book im not sure fire is enough for that      stove canisters  i dont use gas i think carying that shit is retarded i use multifuel stove
    not to mention using gas below zero always sucked for me maybe i had shitty stoves or shitty gas
    1 insulated airmat/sleeping pad is critical    2 i use one of those folding car windsheild sun reflectors under my sleeping pad as an extra layer and it works amazingly well    3 i stuff my mummy bag with clothes/adventure towel/ectto fill up space and gaps    4 if needed i will crack and emergency thermal blanket and wrap my lower body up to torso the thermal blanket does not breath so i only use it when needed    5 sleep with a beanie on to keep in heat    6multi layer sleep system but always change shirts and baselayers to not sleep in sweaty clothes ive hiked in during the day    7 if needed  crack a few handwarmers to put in your bag    8 boil water and put in a nalgene or a subzero bottle wrapped in a sock/towel to place in bag    the goal is to keep your body warm and dry and the tent fully ventilated and free from condensation
  2 i use one of those folding car windsheild sun reflectors under my sleeping pad as an extra layer and it works amazingly well    thats a good hint anon thanks they are cheap light i can use it to wrap my blankets  shit because its waterproof too     or a subzero bottle wrapped  or some cheap canteen i dont think it will last long though wont it act as a cooler in the morning
    the sunshade i use as a sleeping pad layer is one of the thicker celled reflecting folding ones    i use one of the subzero stainless steel waterbottles and it retains the heat extremely well i place it in a sock and it keeps warm just fine in the mummy bag overnight
  like this
critical equipment especially smaller stuff knives gps etc need to be on a lanyard or paracord or something you drop it in the snow consider it gone at the very least paint that shit neon orange if you havent lost good shit in the snow yet you havent been doing this long enough tent pegs too if you use definitely hit em with the orange paint  2 is 1 1 is none especially in the winter especially with respect to heat and light carry multiple methods of fire starting at least two lights and batteries  limit tent condensation as much as humanely possible stay as dry as possible getting up from or back into a tent with a bunch of frost and ice falling all over you and getting shit damp sucks fat balls  your fire is always too small  bring food that wont get fed up by freezing  you will get damp/wet just assume it and be prepared to deal with it  this ones obvious but bring a friggin shovel ive seen more people than i care to showing up in the winter without one
  would kerosene lamp be a good idea to heat up the tent a little    itll stink up the tent really quick filling it with thin blueish smoke so no    would covering tent with thermal blanket help    probably yes    what to use for isolating tent from the ground thermal blanket or something stronger    thermarest ridgerest works well blue ones are thicker than the olive ones
    gas cans have a mixture of propane and butane iirc when its cold the two separate and only one burns up or something also gas does not like to be gaseous when its cold so the overall performance is lowered in cold environments plus it takes longer to heat stuff up in general so gas is better for warm temperatures
any good insulated sleeping mats that are inflatable or will fit well on bike panniers  also thoughts on layering two cheapo 3 season bags    thermal blanket over or under you sleeping bag i have a thermal bag but have a feeling it will just drench my sleeping bag
    propane boils at lower temps than isobutane and nbutane but carrying pure propane means getting those heavy coleman green tanks    so with fuel canisters they mix propane and isobutane/nbutane if you use upright stove in winter the propane will boil off first and your stove will start suffering after 25 fuel used if you use inverted stove the propane gas will float ontop of the butane but because its inverted it will force liquid butane through the feeder tube maintaining constant high pressure  pic related comfy winter cooking setup
  propane boils at lower temps than isobutane and nbutane  ill remember that for the future if i ever try my luck with gas stoves
    thicker version of that that folds into itself not the lighter roll up kind
    i will wrap the emergency blanket around the outside of the sleeping bag so its the very last layer to keep in heat i only wrap from the mid torso downwards to aid with venting
  just get a white gas stove msr whisperwhatever i have is amazing
hint bring this into the woods
  there really needs to be a test of some kind before people post on here a kerosene lantern in a tent  every one knows a small wood fire properly ringed with stones not river stones though is the proper way to heat up to a 3 person tent
  not enough fat need a chubby one for max comfy
  ill take this defective one anon
how do you boys keep your face warm during the night main problem ive faced is ill wake up at 2 in the morning and my face will be freezing if i wear a balaclava i get condensation forming on my face
  a kerosene lantern in a tent  maybe it would be safe in one of those well ventilated canvas winter tents  but than again in that case one would use mini wood stove no need for a lamp    
  isobutane/nbutane  but in that case wouldnt it be better to just make isobutane/nbutane only stoves    whats whitegas this doesnt sound clear  
op is a fucking idiot
  a person asks questions to verify and extend his knowledge  hes an idiot because of it    you should leave
is 5kg too much for winter camp setup or is it too much    inside is  1 thin but warm wool blanket   2 3m x 3m tarp 12kg 130g thick actually its a tarpaulin im not ready to spend money on tarps yet  3 car windshield sun reflectors as  suggested just bought one they are fragile but cheap as fuck and weightless  4 some noname sleeping bag 10c max it says  5 picnic blanket isolated on one side pretty warm i slept under it in autumn also good isolation  6 all wrapped in czechoslovakian poncho made from thick plastic its cheap as fuck and very light i used it as a bag for all that shit and snapped together with british army load straps     i plan to attach it to some webbing so that the weight doesnt hang on the backpack kinda like helsinkipop did here     apart from that stuff that will go to the backpack   7 bundeswehr sleeping pad  8 2 person cheapass iglo tent 13kg not bad  9 2x thermal blanket    i figured if i manage to stay below 15kg with all the gear ill be fine     temp outside is below 10c but the wind is a motherfucker     not sure if ill need the tarp and the picnic blanket or maybe keep the picnic blanket and ditch the wool one     what say you    pic related 762 for comparison its pretty bulky but doesnt feel too heavy       better to be an idiot who asks stupid questions than a trolling cunt on an anonymous image board
hey i thought it might work guess you could leave the tent open and get around the lamp
  just have a fire winter is my preferred time to camp i just build shelters and use a bivy sack
  less dess  lower boiling point  stays gas in colder temperature  better for winter use    propane is least dense at sea level it will only turn liquid at 40f   isobutane is a lessdense isomer of butane turns liquid at 10f  butane is most dense it turns liquid at 30f  at higher elevations you will need higher vapor pressure in the canister for it to keep working so propane is even more valuable at high elevation/colder temps but because pure propane is less dense you need a stronger container to hold it think coleman green propane cans or those heavy barbecue propane canisters    whereas with white gas naptha stoves you artifically pressurize it so that stuff never matters which is why white gas is best for high altitude cold weather
  cant stress an insulated sleep pad enough back in january here in northern wi i tried to get away with an emergency tarp and wool blankets as insulation woke up at 3am feeling like i was sleeping in ice used that same system in the fall and it worked but the ground wasnt as wet both times i stuffed leaves under the tent not sure if it helped or not
  how do you limit condensing keep tent doors/vents open anything else
  basically yes  also keep a lid on your kettle while smelting snow/cooking
  also brush icing off from the walls roof and throw it out
  very informative thanks ill save this info should i ever decide to switch to gas stoves 
best wet winter pants need suggestions please
  we ware told in some earlier threads those flefjaflivefafen g1000 are v good in that regard
  i like your idea looks like you took a little advice from everyone in the thread  im sure it will serve you just fine in those temps as long as you have protection from the wind
  keep both blankets or better yet just get a coleman fleece sleeping bag liner it zips open into a blanket and zips down into a comfy liner    layer everything like so    sleeping bag with fleece liner  top  wool blanket  sleeping pad  windshield cover  tent floor  tarp  bottom    maybe wrap the wool blanket around your sleeping bag if you need just a little more warmth
  youre missing an insulating sleeping pad layer  a lot of heat loss is actually through conduction just try lying down on the cold ground with only a sleeping bag if you want to poorfag just get a 20 ridge rest foam pad if you want to povertyfag it then use pine boughs to separate your setup from the ground
  7 bundeswehr sleeping pad  9 thermal blanket  5 picnic blanket  3 car windshield   and maybe the plastic poncho    thats not enough

im getting old im trying to tick off as much as i can from my bucket list while i can where is somewhere in the world where you can throw something into a volcano anymore
  well my best guess would be hawaii  the volcanos are always active there  its midnight there now but anyways

this here is your one stop shop for volcanoes anon some really wonderful footage of various volcanoes around the world shouldnt be too hard to decide where you want to go    
  there are easier ways to get rid of your hard drive you sick fuck

  mountanons at what height does a large hill become a mountain
  based cascadeposter      imo its all relative ive climbed many mountains taller than mt washington that i dont remember the names of or feel like are worth bragging about because 67000ft is a pretty modest height for a mountain in the cascades and in the southern parts isnt even above the treeline  meanwhile coloradofags can drive on paved roads to elevations higher than ive ever been
  3500ft
  mfw i live in pa

  katahdin  marcy  washington  emory peak  baldpate  ngauruhoe    maybe a few others i cant remember ngauruhoe was my favorite cause thats where they shot the scenes for mt doom in lotr and its an active volcano it tore my boots up though and the climb was fairly arduous the park its in tongariro is absolutely stunning though id recommend it to anyone who visits nz
  monadnock isnt a mountain

  7000 feet   this will probably trigger the low elevation fags lol
  live in eastern colorado  walk up hill  lol suck it least coasters
a few mountains in glacier near the many glaciers camp ground a bunch in nh mt washburn in yellowstone
  live in santa fe   dont even leave your house   use the treadmill maybe   the only way to climb seven thousanders or whatever low elevation fags call them
live in florida  used to living at sea level entire life  get altitude sickness at fl highest point
  getting elevation sickness from climbing the tallest dump of garbage at the landfill
  kek i dont even think there is an atmospheric pressure difference at 300 ft i live at 3500 ft which is considered pretty low out west here and the air is only 12 thinner than at sea level also water boils at only 205 f and i havent gotten elevation sickness before even at 12k ft
  the trailheads here dont even start until 8200 ft anything less is for children
  and yet most of your hikes are still less elevation gain than hiking in the northeast    why dont you hike western washington like a man
  living in new mexico    id rather not
fujisan   come at me bro

  this isnt a mountain   the mont blanc isnt a mountain  there isnt a single mountain in the entire alps
  exactly the alps and rockies can be decent training for real mountains but theyre not really mountains
  no one will take this statement seriously
  he is right though
  okay so one guy took the statement seriously
itt people fail to understand prominence
  1000m 3300 ft prominence minimum or 2000m 6600 ft total elevation minimum imo anything less is a glorified hill
  mount katahdin  i recognized that pic right away from the catalog before clicking into this thread thats a tough one did that a few months ago with a 30lb pack at 100 humidity at 89f toughest hike ive ever done    protip dont hike in the first week of maines august
  katahdin isnt so bad im  and i gotta say that ngauruhoe was the toughest ive done     though it could have been because i was in a group of a bunch of other backpacker travel kids the companionship was nice but a couple of them were a pain in the ass and had to be handheld the entire way up the volcano ill let you decide who the offenders were

ive been wanting to make one of those wooden cups for a while now but i need to make a new carving knife im actually considering something with a barrel locking system similar to an opinel i prefer round handles for carving anyway theres a lot of american sycamore here that doesnt split or check when drying from green to fully seasoned that might work id blo and paste wax the outside but not the inside
    the fuck is that upper right pick your foot the stump of a hand
  speaking of not splitting i was cutting brush out yesterday and saw a sling shot frame shape in a multiflora rose bush trunk ive never worked rose wood before and figured it would probably split but boy oh boy it really splits lol ive only seem plum wood split that much i guess in the field or at camp youd need to have some wax to dip the ends and hope it wont split until you get back then itd need to be vacuum stabilized with resin then into a toaster oven so i learned that rose wood isnt good carving or whittling wood for around the camp    pic related    sling shot frames are a nice easy whittling project around the campfire if you bring some bands along in your pack you can go stumping pretty quickly if you have kids it is one of the better ways to keep them engaged and not bored

  the one in the op comes with a special device to allow you to hone and sharpen the blades very easily basically you can make a slurry of grit to do what you need just grab a solid hardwood board and cut grooves into it using the various tools so they fit into and slide along the grooves easily and smoothly make the slurry put it in the grooves and start sharpening/honing      it uses 65mn high carbon steel which is pretty much chinese steel incarnate the main problem will be holding the edge as long as other better steels however the first time you get it properly sharp it should be as sharp as better steels you may run into trouble with woods that have high metal contents of course and youll need to hone and sharpen it more often but it will work if you are unable to get the metal sharpened well enough it wont matter which steel it is made of they will all perform terribly sharpening these can be really difficult

anyone else save their whittling/carving shavings for their next fire starting if you do it at home you can use spent candle wax to make little bricks of wax and wood chips or just dip the wood chips in the wax and pack them into a container for later same goes for sawdust and long stick shavings of course    google wax dipped wood chips for all kinds of diy ideas
  wax dipped wood chips    if you boil the wood chips or shavings in wax you can use less wax the wood is much drier it will be 100 waterproof and it will light much faster than simply dipping them in wax the key is to keep heating them in the wax until they stop bubbling that will mean they dont have any moisture left even very dry wood will boil like that until all the remaining moisture is gone    if you carry a tincan and some candle wax with you while innawoods you can make these over a campfire if you are careful if it gets too hot or you spill it into the fire get the fuck away fast lol keep the fire low or on only a few hot coals you can dry out green wood frozen wood and water soaked wood using this technique meaning you can increase your kindling and fire starting materials for later use so long as you can make the 1st fire the hot wax is thin enough to drain off the wood chips and they chips dont even look like they have wax on them a little candle wax can go a very long way    a days work of bushcraft or sitting around the fire whittling  talking usually provides a lot of woodchips  shavings
carving a whistle      the removal of the bark for this blew my mind ill have to see what species where i live can do that
what tool does /out/ recommend for carving
  a full carving knife spoon  gouge set however all you really need is a chip carving knife or cutting knife with a large handle those blades are somewhat similar brandnames are not too important but dont ever buy anything made in china the steels from there normally dont hold an edge very well also get whetstone strop and oil for the blade always stop and check the edge every so often when carving hard dense woods stop the project and sharpen/hone as needed before continuing
i made a whistle wooooo now the skin on my hands and fingers are tender i havent used a hand drill stick like this in years also if you use a hand drill stick know that a thicker stick is much easier on the hands drilling the hole is the hardest part if you can do that easily enough you can make some nice whistles and you dont need to keep the bark like in 
  make whistle  blow whistle  go deaf
  based and redpilled
bump for interest
ive been making a list of items that can be made via whittling/carving in the field at camp which are functional it is mostly common sense stuff heres what i came up with off the top of my head if you know of anything else post it    item use    whistle attention getting reserved for emergencies used because yelling can only be done for so long before vocal cords cant make usable sound keep a storm whistle on you but learn to make a whistle as a backup skill    tableware/food utensils such as fork sharpened stick spreader spoon ladle grill scraper chopsticks cup bowl etc useful for eating food     tent pegs for tents    buttons  tying sticks used for fastening things together and tying knots    needles knitting needles crochet hooks looms repair and fabrication    pot hanger for hanging pots over fires    fire making feather sticks fire bow hand drill    figurines  game pieces pastime entertainment/sentimentality these can be chess pieces checkers shogi go dice shuttlecock etc    tool handles replace broken tool handle or make a new one when packing in only tool heads or saw blades to base camp    3legged camp stool sitting  feet propping    hunting  trapping equipment such as slingshots bows arrows darts atlatls trap triggers  mechanisms etc    camp shovel stick digging trenches foraged roots and latrines    mallet installing tent pegs processing meat    walking stick walking aid
  tfw copy/paste added hard returns to everything  damn it that is as bad as having wordwrap on when copy/pasting
  this makes me want to go out in the woods and make a fully functioning base camp out of local materials
this shrill ear killer whistle is 8mm wide x 57mm long with a 635mm id hole 1/4 drill bit it is uv reactive wood from a japanese barberry bush    japanese barberry berberis thunbergii is invasive in most places and is normally found in landscape you can usually spot it because it has reddish leaves and narrow slender thorns when it isnt in someones landscaping it will be in the woods and shadier areas near the woods where it can get some sun and shade the wood tastes very bitter the wood is not a hardwood you can make some neat small items with it in direct sunlight which has lots of uv the wood practically glows bright yellow most wood workers use it to make inlays    if you use this wood youll need to make sure you season it first do that by cutting the bush off at the ground or digging up the entire plant then letting it dry as is if you try to cut it up into pieces before it has seasoned it will split and check like mad once fully seasoned you can strip the bark off easily using the blade of your knife without cutting the bark just angle the bladed away from the direction you use to stroke down the limb the xylem will be brighter than the wood when the branch is green and unseasoned although the xylem will begin to turn a darker color the rest of the wood remains vibrant yellow and uv reactive there is a tiny pithy center about the diameter of a stickpin to the diameter of a pencil lead branches are never very thick so seasoning times are quite short few days the base of the plant at the root crown will have the thickest diameter wood and longest seasoning time    you can make a powder of the uv reactive sawdust and use it in clear glue/epoxy for various decorative things much like youd add glitter to either for crafts shaping is very easy and so is sanding due to the bitter nature of the wood id not use it for eating utensils like chopsticks unless you seal it properly if you turn it you may need to stabilize it first
        fiskars made a hand drill that can be used with a max of 1/4 wide drill bits they are pretty cheap but fairly solid if you are going to use it on wood i suggest using a brad point drill bit for hard woods bottom pic those cutting spurs on the side of the tip score a circle and make the hole edges really smooth and prevents tear outs just go slow on the exit side the center brad point spike keeps the bit from walking across the work piece when you first start the hole that makes it excellent for round surfaces of things like small tree limbs there are brad point bits fro softwood too but those are not as good for hardwood obviously brad point bits make the cleanest straightest accurate holes in wood of all drill bit styles    a good hand drill or even just augur bits with a twig handle in your bushcraft kit is priceless you can make standard buttons flutes lanyard holes in handles or staves peg holes for pegs to join pieces of wood together who needs nails and a host of other things
  add wooden sculpting tools to that list they are used for shaping pottery or clay figures/art before firing in boy scouts we learned to make pottery bonfires from local river clay and used sticks to work designs into the clay
  there are brad point bits fro softwood too but those are not as good for hardwood obviously    it should be noted that in most locations the local tress are hardwood but in some forests theres more softwood than hardwood in those locations using the dedicated softwood brad point will perform better than the hardwood each bit type is designed to interact with the wood hardness in a specific way helping to prevent rough holes overheating and chips coming out drill bits are so small that it makes sense to have a set of both hardwood and softwood brad point drill bits with you however most bushcraft projects will work better with hardwoods because of the extra strength the wood has if all you have are softwoods in your area oh well
  i damn near broke my right hand once trying to whittle a piece of fence post it was a pipe i later threw away after a day of smoking from it
  what type of wood was it
  pfft just some cheap regular old dogearned fence wood the polished normal shit meant to withstand all weather its all smooth on the front and back and a bit rugged on the edges it was a post though  so i cut a cube end off a whole post and used a kitchen knife a flathead screwdriver and a folding knife to make a dumb pipe an eighth the size of the cube  pic related  the poker  did not look like the poker
  i ask because most posts are made of treated lumber which has some pretty nasty chemicals to be making into a pipe bowl when they are not treated they are usually locust which is toxic though there are many toxic woods you shouldnt make a pipe bowl from which is why it is really important to know the species    i normally use cherry
i usually make wooden fishing lure blanks while around the campfire pic it is super easy to do if you know the type of wood then you can make a lure that fits where it sits/floats in the water and know how much action it will have heavier woods need exaggerated bills and whatnot to make them more livelier while lighter woods will have more action naturally that is why balsa wood is favored for lures bobbers casting eggs and fish traps are easily made custom rod handles are also nice and can be whittled by hand though most are turned on a lathe    to learn more about the local trees woods in your area look them up here        that can give you tons of info and even ideas on what to make with your local woods the search function for the site above is pretty good so you can just type out something like maple and it will give you a species list of more than a dozen maples dead fallen wood that has come down due to a storm breaking a living branch or entire tree is best it will have seasoned and wont split while drying after youve carved it though look out for punky wood thats infected with fungi and starting to rot it had fungal stains and mycelium running through it but isnt punky you can heat it up hot enough that you cant touch it in order to kill the fungi then the wood wont continue to rot    if you are a real pro youll bring along a small can of candle wax you can boil your finished seasoned wood pieces in that will help make them extremely water proof just put them in the melted wax and the moisture in the wood will start boiling out when theres no more bubbles the wood is moisture free for the most part and you can take it out and allow it to cool as it cools it will suck in excess wax if done correctly you wont be able to tell it even has wax on it until water beads up on the outside see  trying this with green unseasoned wood may split it depending on species of wood
  heres some examples of eastern us tree species and their specific gravity that is something to know when making lures and other fishing gear
bump with info does anyone have infograms on the techniques and cuts used with carving/whittling using a knife like how to hold a workpiece and which direction to move the knife blade for the cut to be as safe as possible and such
  seems whoever made that one overlapped too much the amount of length reduced is only like 2 inches but should be a lot more though all that really matters is to be able to take it apart and fit the pot holder into the pot for transport
  that looks like a neat tool but i bet 5 bucks its made im china
  that one is 160 from and is usa made by flexcut the one here  is 20 and made in china with 65mn mediumhigh carbon steel i know flexcut uses high carbon spring steel for their knives hence their flexibility for cutting and the company name but i do not know the actual factory designation code of the steel used i do not know if the cheap chinese one is as flexible or holds an edge as well as the flexcut ones do i highly doubt it though
  kek    be me  make candles  throw pot on stove  take a shit  housefirejpg
  muh tinnitus
  yeah be careful around open flame with melted candle wax you can very easily spill it or overheat it and it will go up like kerosene also dont use water to put out that fire or youll make it far worse just smother it instead
  ahhhhhhhh
  quads  this post is just pure fuckerey
tfw you start whittling and end up just shaving the wood down to a pointy stick and never do anything else
  ye
i gotta ask is it worth it to buy a working knife if im a novice or will my regular pocket knife be good enough to start   ive made tikis once or twice and outdoors utensils with pocket knives before but thats it     i was thinking about buying a mora 120 looks like a good general knife any tips
  the right tool for the job makes work much easier the height and length of the blade will help determine what you can do with it so a small pocket knife will let you do more detail work but will suck for big material removal while a fixed blade survival knife will such at most things that are not big material removal a fixed blade chip carving knife will be perfect for most whittling jobs regardless of needunless you are making spoons    you can do a lot with a mediumsized pocket knife your inexperience only limits your knowledge of what tool is best for various jobs having the right tool will make it much easier for you to get better and you wont be as frustrated
dont have chip carving knife  25 for a good one  sunday  gotta order one  wont get here for days    so i made one instead ill touch up the blade and handle after the epoxy cures tomorrow
  well i finished the edge as much as i want i just used a triangle file to get a bit convex on a single side with an ever so slight back bevel then sandpaper up to 1500 grit theres only a bit of tool marks left on the tight side on the heal but im for function so that doesnt bother me    heres the first item i did as a quick test on some softer black cherry this thing is scary sharp and is doing chip detail pretty well it is really nice having this much control over a blade it beats trying to do this with a pocket knife by a mile    now i just need to go camping again im hoping for snow and ice soon but theres been almost nothing except rain for a week now everything is currently mud
i got a gore windstopper jacket instead of gore tex will it still be fine in the rain
    idk boy google it 
goretex
  ill take what is scotchgard for 850
   no will be good in the wind
axe saw or both and why    pic of meme combo for giggles
  this actually works much better as a saw than as a machete
i use an axe but its mostly because its more manly to chop then to saw    but in all honesty if you want to pack light use a saw and a good knife    it seems more sensible howevery not nearly as cool    or why not both
  i take both whenever possible i like axes better just cause its clearly the sexier tool but honestly the saw is much more useful to me where i go out theres no shortage of small enough deadwood so i dont really need to split anything big and my saw is lightweight and easy to pack a well maintained axe with a polished edge and oiled handle just gives me all sorts of nice feels though
  always been curious about these  what makes it suck as a machete
  got any saw recommendations
  overly thick blade bad balance and the handle is tapered so it wants to slip out of your hand    id also say shit steel but 999 of machetes have shit steel but still perform
i just really dont like sawing every thrust makes it feel like a little piece of my soul has died and will never come back i like chopping though
  not so the problem is of course the steel quality and geometry since the steel is only adequate to cut grass it would be better with a sharp edge but it has a concave edge on a convex the other thing with the handle is the gator actually sticks to your hand it was designed to stick even when slippery wet what happens as a result is if you try to use proper machete technique you get burns in two swings you dont normally grip a machete with a death grip watch on youtube there are intros how to use one the handle sucks ass for the reason it doesnt slide its geometry also sucks of course the dude that designed it never used a machete in his life    i keep it in my car in case i get some bushes that want to scratch up the paint or get stuck and need to cut some branches under the wheels but really its almost better to have nothing than this one but like i said the saw part actually works unlike other sawmachetes whoever designed it at least understands how saws work the grip doesnt help of course use the lanyard to be safe tho
  also i would say gerber actually managed to accomplish everything they wanted with the gator machetes it was just a retarded idea the way this machete is made is to survive abuse and be as safe in the hands of retards as possible overly thick low quality blade with convex edge and a grip that rips the skin off there is one mistake they made tho when it comes to retards they will surely try to shop wood with it the blade should be okay for the above reasons the handle is meh maybe okay with gloves but the tang the tang is like 1 inch long and mostly just two tails so once a retard whacks some hard wood with it and tries to push through like a fucking retard it will snap and the blade may actually bounce back into his gut or face so maybe they didnt do such a good job after all
  both have their advantages and disadvantages axe is more versatile and can pretty much do every task in the outdoors though is more dangerous if you dont know what you are doing and is much heavier saw is light cuts well but cant split or carve and the blades are easy to damage ideally id say a hatchet and big saw are the best combo 
  the gator actually sticks to your hand  how mine is abs plastic theres no grip to it at all
saw
  a small saw and a tough knife  got a little stove thing that uses dead branch size logs  have to cut all my pieces to 10 inches to fit so the saw is a must but i only really need to split one or two rounds of maybe 4inch in width for kindling so an axe would be overkill
  y tho when the battery runs out do you plug it into a tree
  no dumbass you hold the plug up towards the sun duh
  real nigga bushcraft
  thats a 50 battery they dont run out
  the way this machete is made is to survive abuse   the handles break some what easily
  naginta naginta love my naginta
  its a machete i attached to a soul pole
  nice idea looks like a good way to accidentally murder yourself
  if that folding saw has a lock on it its actually a great idea
can you cook rice in seawater probably going to be a hobo soon and being able to just carry rice would be great and get your salts and minerals from the ocean maybe add some kelp
  can you  yes you can do anything you want
  it is a ton of salt fyi like 828 grams per cup a cup of ramen noodles only has like 18 grams for comparison
  shits deadly son
    what happened to that cat looks like another one took a chunk out of its head and left the rest
  it probably had a twin conjoined from birth
  anything at all the only limit is yourself welcome to zombo com
  shit thread
  considering you can drink sea water temporarily to stave off dehydration im sure you can however youre kidneys cant keep up and youll eventually die of dehydration  you can cook the rice in sea water but you most likely will have to drink a shot ton of water because its salty as fuck and your kidneys need to maintain your salt water ratio and the only way to do that is by pissing a ton
  nigger are you retarded
  you can drink seawater too full of essential minerals its great to make coffee with too
on the topic of saltwater has anyone tried a saltwater enema     supposedly your colon will extract the water and youll shit out the salt
well thanks for being retard niggers except for        i will just use 3 parts fresh to 1 part salt thanks for nothing losers
  seawater also contains vibrio cholorae the causative agent of cholera
i live in the small town that this cat was discovered in haha had no idea that anybody out of town knew about it
  story
  i dont remember much about it just seeing articles about it in the newspaper i looked a bit more into the story and apparently the mountain lion was found about an hour away from my town not quite in it
  mixing water with saltwater  thats not saltwater then it is a mixture of water and salt water
  i can see why you are soon to be a hobbo no interpersonal skills
  hello and welcome to you have come to zombo com
  good one anon
  just use the water why are you even including the saltwater moron  if you want free salt and minerals evaporate the seawater and sprinkle what remains on your rice
  stupid retard wants to cook rice in seawater  somehow anonymous posters on his cantonese basket weaving forum are wrong for preventing his inevitable death  you are going to fucking die if you are this stupid son
  stupididy is a curse anon    did you know that when cooking pasta a grain like rice the proper way to do it is to boil it in water with an equivalent salinity to sea water    did you know that for millions of years 90 of people lived on the coastlines and used saltwater cooking    a curse anon
what is the best knife for camping
  delete this
    anything with lots of holes in it     pic related
  thats really smart for the weight
  this is pretty much the best camping knife
  see 
this
  never failed me once
mora and nothing over 4 inches is worth a damn  
  also op said camp knife not survival knife survival knives are toys not tools      and well rated folding lockback knife will do for camp use if you need to do other jobs youll need individualized knives for those jobs theres no onesizefitsall jobs knife normally youd have a small multiblade folding pocket knife a medium folding lockback knife and a large fixed blade knife that takes care of all jobs this side of an axe or hatchet    the best of the folding lockback knives is the original folding lockback knife the buck 110 knife the blade is 3 3/4 long on those they usually range from 80120 i wouldnt buy them second hand or from a 3rd party dealer the price difference is for the steel used in the blade the cheaper ones are 420hc steel and the more expensive ones are s30v steel the s30v steel is more difficult to sharpen so use a good stone/diamond and learn how to sharpen properly on a cheap knife before attempting there are many counterfeit buck 110 knives out there so if you decide on a buck knife get it directly from the company buckknivescom    if you think they are pricey they really are not they are very well made      muh nigga
  obviously there is no other option other than grenade knife ie the chode     and yes i saged you buttsluts
  is there really a difference between the needs of a camp and survival knife arent they the same thing lol
a mora stainless is hard to beat for the money and can do everything for normal camping i would also carry my usual 20 gerber folder knife for basic tasks
  a camp knife is for everything from making feather sticks to whittling to gutting kills a survival knife is a complete misnomer for larpers and companies preying on manchildren survival knives are usually pretty terrible at most jobs due to their unique design    a real survival knife is any knife that you have during a legit survival situation where your life is at stake however if that knife is poorly designed and snaps because theres a serration section gut hook jimping or other contourinterrupting part you may very well end up dead because of it
  so faggy that they even include a torx screw    wow
  i know i was impressed i did not even know chinesium torx screws of this high dollar existed
  grenade knives are the best for survival situations i like the ones with lighters so i can set things on fire when cutting them
  good to see you actually watched the video before trying to argue against my points anon glad we agree
  someone got me one of those years ago wish i knew what i did with it
lol what are you even cutting while camping
  bitches
  opinel for folding kabar for fixing tramontina for macheting
  i didnt watch the video though i will now though
this is the best knife for the job
  i have a survival knife with a hollow handle and the fucking nut that screws down on the blade is made of fucking plastic
  back in the 1980s when the rambo movies came out every one and i mean everyone bought one of those hollow handle knives with the compass on the end or just the first blood or rambo 2 knives that was back when you could bring weapons to school everyone had a pocket knife and there was a gun club in effing elementary school and wed plink with the teacher during recess anyway like 10 of us had parents that bought us one of the rambo knives for xmas most of us had the rambo 2 knife even then there were knock offs but we didnt realize what was fake and what was legit from the company lol the fake one was mostly a plastic handle that shattered easily because kids throw knives everywhere god we were such dumbshits
  did you ever play essentially laser tag with bb guns we had a 1 pump rule but lol im just thinking about digging bbs out of retards     man the 80s were fun
  no we had actual laser tag i even had that pyramid looking thing that was like a bomb or sentry gun depending on how it was set i never owned a bb gun and no one i knew did we all had 22lr rifles and could only use the centerfire calibers during hunting seasons wed get a coffee can of 22lr ammo and plink all damn day long you could fry bacon on the barrels
  wed play king of the hill but the hill was a rocky slope and the person at the top threw rocks at the people below
  sudden nostalgia of the gravel pit quarry  tfw i always won because i was the one throwing rocks
  misses the 80s  watch rad over and over  go bmxing with friends  watch conan on beta  friends watch the shit out of each other with wooden swords  poor fucks who didnt get watch a plan come together
  you dont need a knife to camp    you dont need a knife to set up a tent or hammock system    you dont need a knife to use a gas stove a pot and heating a camp meal
  dont listen to this shill buy the knife from wherever you want
since i grew up i have/had a buck 110 nonfolding for awhile its pretty ok for whatever general purpose it does feel a little flimsy so i havent hacked at anything with it  i have a bear grylls paracord knife that i bought 5 years ago i liked that it had a pretty stubby tip comparatively i like the ability to wrap the handle to fit my grip and the knife is the only good thing about the line from bg so i wouldnt buy any other of the shit he sells  i just bought a brothers of bushcraft knife this fall i hacked off a branch and made a walking stick so far something i couldnt do with the other 2 knives very easily or would have taken a while longer i like its thickness but its a lot of knife i buy knifes for different purposes and intents when i expect to be using them for though  so i tried/try to buy variants in size and such instead of 5 knives of the same type/style
  yes you can camp without a knife if you carry all that modern facilities  but bringing a cutting tool is also convenient especially if you are not a gearfag  and im not saying a expensive knife is needed i think any knife with a good edge is more than enough
  i usually go with my bk7 but i must say that may be overthetop i just like the look of it and the size also some would say im compensating for a small penis  this board loves mora and usually it is a good first choice
  i know right and if you do find something you need to cut its only a few meters walk from the garden to the kitchen where you can ask mum for the safety scissors
  for camping just about anything with a blade will do as long as you have an axe or hatchet for firewood mora 10 and opinel 15 are about the best you can get unless youre willing to pay hundreds of  for some multilayered differentially hardened custom knife but a cheap 1 folder from the hardware store works just fine  if you do not want to bring an axe a glock 79 or a short machete cold steel is good tramontina has a good rep as well since those are almost impossible to break theyll never be as sharp as a mora because of their thicker blades though
  in my opinion   any knife you use should be something you dont mind having to abuse and break or potentially lose it while /out/ so its a bit of a compromise between getting a quality product but something still economical enough that you can really put it to use without worrying about it
  milspec so you now its good
for cutting fireword and so forth a silky saw will do you much better than any knife and most axes/hatchets     you wont actually use a knife very much in camp unless youre building your own shelter
  pity the fools
  what do you need a knife for  if you are going fishing/hunting its another thing but thats more than just camping    when you go camping you dont really need a knife sure you can have one just in case but a small folding knife is more than enough to cover your needs in that instance    camping is not meme bushcrafting hunting or fishing its just camping aka setting up your sleep system using your gas stove to heat a meal/coffee and sleeping
i need a knife that mainly for cutting smoked cheddar but also expect to have to baton logs on occasion whats the best knife for that
  based
  i need a knife that mainly for cutting smoked cheddar  i was gonna recommend an opinel but then  but also expect to have to baton logs on occasion  then i would recommend an esee 5 with the molle sheath zombie green powder coating and safety orange handle scales
  going outdoors without a knife is foolhardy yes you can go camping without but it makes life a lot easier the trade off in weight is far outweighed by the utility take a sak at least there no reason not to    uses ive found for camping include food prep making shavings for fire lighting carving extra tent pegs cutting the end off cigars as well as any cordage cutting
  you dont need it    weighs fuck all and might have a use for it why you get all upset about people having them youre not a bong are you
  had a few of those 80s survival knives and even the best fully metal ones blade broke off due to the tiny tang into the handle friend and i started sawing down a small tree out in a field with the wire saw and about 3/4 into it i looked up and noticed it had some kind of electrical lines running through it and the fall angle was going to be directly across them field was wet and full of puddles we took turns holding the tree up and sawing to correct it so it would fall parallel instead    and indeed the two of us from 4th grade onward roamed the hills with multiple guns unsupervised the 80s were the pinnacle of human culture
  mora brand mora
  i warn against that too when it comes to buying buck brand stuff theres a shit load of knockoffs out there even the local sporting goods store got a shipment of knockoffs a few years ago people called them on it but no one got in trouble now theres like 200 of the things all over the place in yard sales and shit    at the very least youtube some videos on how to tell the counterfeits from the real buck brand knives though you can usually tell right off if youve never held a real quality knife before
  kek thats pretty good    when i was about 45yo i was with my cousins and we were all in the woods swinging on grape vines on the side of a hill only later did we discover one of the vines was in fact a massive poison ivy vine we all had poison ivy rashes from head to toe i remember my fingers were like fat swollen sausages and my parents had my soak them in comfrey tea
    whatever works for the tasks you desire
  i started bringing my batleth on longer excursions game changer
i think this one would be the best camp knife
  best if you use two
my sog seal pup has been a kickass fixed blade for camping it does have a corrosion resistant blade so a little more forgiving if you are getting messy with it     otherwise my buck 110 has been a real champ     also my victorinox swiss army knife hasnt been bad cutting cord can opener bottle opener shaving wood for kindling i dont think that itll last super long doing that as its a weak folding point its not an awesome knife at anything but its decent at the number of things that you can actually do with it
  ahem
  what are some fix blade knives that you would recommend
  camp knife  no compass
  azor ahai
  no bipod  cmon man youre not even trying
  i will never stop shilling my helle its easily the best knife ive ever used use it for hunting and it breaks down deer to the butcher cuts easy   inb4 muh full tang  batonning is a meme and you know it the rat tang is perfectly suitable for any general outdoor uses if you really want that thicc tang though they also have some other knives that have it
  qtddiot  /out/ noob here looking for a general purpose hunting knife looking at mostly deer good skinning capabilities would be a bonus  can i get away with no drop point and a bushcraft knife i can choose between the brands  opinel  buck  mora  winchester  mueller  gerber  i have gift cards no refunds hence why i have a limited number of options full tang fixed blades would be nice but if you have a more experienced opinion please divulge
  bumpo
  buck 119 would be best for hunting then bushcraft get the mora
  i was looking at that are the paklite models a gimmick at all they look just as functional at a considerable drop in price and i am considering opting for one of those instead also i live in australia where there is a lot of hardwood do you think the construction of the mora knives may not full tang be a problem as i have heard you need a very strong knife for bushcraft here we use a small saw for the heavier stuff i was looking at the selkirk for that as it has full tang construction
  i havent used a pak lite but if you dress any large game youd probably want a more comfortable folder  full tang doesnt matter unless you baton a partial tang or stick tang will be enough for any carving if you are covered about that the mrka garberg is full tang
  what mora is this

        gods im a 90s kid but in the late 90s and early 2000s we still did lots of outdoor stuff i remember building dens in the woods with friends fighting with sticks making bows cooking sausages over fires and swimming in the lakes we only had an old tv set and we didnt get a pc until about 2008 so i spent most of my youth outdoors good times and ones i miss  its kind of sad to see todays children just staying indoors glued to screens or wandering around messing with smart phones they dont know what they are missing  also thanks for making me nostalgic        you dont need a knife  sure if you dont intend on cooking and your going to a nice safe glampcamp some of us like going innawoods and for that you do need a knife a good hatchet is also useful      not him but im a bong and i carry a knife everywhere usually its just my small folding law compliant pocket multitool but if im going innawoods then its my type 2 serbian akm bayonet
im looking for a cheap full tang high carbon knife  these are the two im looking at right now            ill go expensive if i have to but would really rather not as ive got more pressing stuff to buy and im not sure whether ill keep on camping in the future just sort of trying out for now only been /out/ before twice but the stainless steel fishing knife ive been using is shit hence the need to replace it
  i have kansbol and bushcraft black in carbon  i love them both
the mora batonny
get the double bladed one twice the battoning efficiency
  full tang  those are not full tang you probably wont notice though
  yeah i know but theyre cheap
  get the garberg  its full tang and still only like 6575 which is ok for a good knife
  is this a joke
  the robust
  full tang is a fucking meme you nigger
  yes just get a classic 2
  buy a kabar you under developed fetus
  not well suited for outdoor use stabbing sure anything else not really
  not good for outdoor use    have you found an extra chromosome on the ground they where designed to be a mixture of combat and outdoor uses
  the only feature on it designed for outdoor use is that it is sharp the rest is for fighting fuller cross guard bowie shape swedge agressive fluid absorbing handle flared pommel etc
  friend just bought me this looking forward to using it
  is that the 110 slim i am thinking about getting this one too i bought the 100 lt last year and am happy to see that they are upgrading and modernizing the 110
  you do realize kabar makes more than the just the usmc right
  yeah but its one of the most classic and possibly the most versatile knife they currently make
  becker bk7 they make is superior desu
  overly large  a big ole meh on the grip  sharp but not really good for anything more than batoning
  i will say the grip is pretty slick but if you give it a wrap or two in electrical tape its fine i can get mine super hair popping sharp
  hair popping sharp  yes but can it hold that for a while  a hair popping sharpness is only good if it can hold it for a while you cant pull out your smith sharpener and sharpen it in the field every five minutes
  just put it on a strop after the campfire is good to go and youre alright
  its the kabar 3189 folding hunter modeled after the buck 110s
  hows the ka bar short holding up been thinking of picking one up cant decide on the leather or plastic sheath
  
  holds up good i suppose id go leather the steel doesnt like the plastic sheath but go with the mark 1 it has the bigger handle and itll slide better edge is too thick on this one
ive heard pretty good stuff about the gerber strong arm opinions
  gerber  cheap crap chink steel with a price premium  i really like the thought and design they put into their products but the production quality is utter crap for 99 of their products and their qc is abysmal
  gerber  i smell a poor faggot
i will get myself a bk2
  enjoy your retardedly hueg batonning knife
    its all ive used when /out/ and ive done basically everything with it    i replaced my older one simply because its been used and sharpened so much that it looks like a boning knife
  get the exact same capability as a companion for 10 times the price  genius
  full tang  blade obscured by scales
  yeah some people call the kabar full tang too
  dont listen to these faggots       gerbers low end is absolute trash but their higher end stuff is pretty decent the strong arm is a great knife
  so is the strongarm really made in the us you can never tell with these slant eyed fuckers
  ive batoned for years with my mora and its perfectly fine batoning oak walnut osage cherry ash it works fine
  yeah moras are suprisingly big and sturdy when you actually bother to get one pics often make them see like little pocket knives with no substance of course they are not trench knives or bayonets
  ive heard theyre moving production but ive got a made in portland one
  kabar more like rebar
    it is    a bk2 will break all the same its nothing to do with thickness for impacts rather harmonics thickness helps with low but sustained stresses
    the strongarm is fine    a little short in the blade but its tough enough
  no its more like heat treat and careless manufacture issue the kabar is mass produced crap the angles at the neck are not rounded and this results in stress fatigue to build up there  not all kabars are equally bad but until you take one apart you cant be sure if you got a shit one or a decent one
  this is how knife makers should test their product line do this to every thousandth knife you make especially for combat and sruvival models
  combat and sruvival  lel knives that see no usage then gotcha    but muh seals and muh made up story of some rando prying through a planes fuselage to escape from the bottom of a lake
  im just saying what i would expect them to endure btw combat knives do get used every soldier tells stories about how they had to dig with theirs
tired of working low effort wageslave jobs im a young /fit/ man and i want to use my body more productively and make a hell of a lot more money what are some heavy labor jobs where i can make a lot of money in a season
  new england scallop fishers make a shitton during their season and then blow it all on heroine every year
  bumping for this
  you would thrive doing the good ol digg sugging you homo
hey anon ive been working in the rope access industry for last 7 years since i dropped out of uni its taken me from the gold mines of australia to where i currently am chilling in a cabin in stormy weather in norway hopefully i can help with any questions
  tell me exactly what you do and how you do it please not op but very interested
  well the first thing to look into is irata level 1 its a five day course and can get you working immediately where do you live google companies join facebook groups and start calling once you get working keep asking around and making contacts best thing i have ever been told is the career is a marathon not a sprint keep going make contacts find our where the heavy industry is as thats where the big money is dont be a dick make friends and they will pass the work around
  to answer your question though i use ropes to access difficult sites to complete work at height i have worked on cliffs skyscrapers oil rigs mines and wind turbines i have picked up other skills and courses as time has gone on for different jobs
  just remember that you wont be young and fit forever and getting back into a job later will be difficult when youre older and out of the loop
  not the guy but this seems cool ill look into it anon thanks for the info
  sure im really just looking for seasonal work for the summer im in school right now so im kind of stuck working low wage part time jobs and im looking for something more demanding and rewarding for the spring/summer
  what do you mean by rewarding you could get a job with a construction crew with no experience youd be doing lots of grunt work but you could pick up a lot of useful information and you will have had a hand in building something
  what was the most dangerous job you did  can it get dangerous  is it ever scary  or is it breathtaking  whats the paycheck like
  so is getting a job on a fishing boat in alaska a meme or can someone with no experience really get one easily and potentially make okay money ive heard crab fishing is more difficult to get into these days but more generally
  do fishing in alaska   you work all summer and the money you earn lasts you through the cold months   i know a few guys who do this and live in camper vans when fishing season is done they drive down south and spend their 8 months off on a beach down south or skiing in canada or something
im at a gear store pro deals are awesome i get to chat with some cool customers and i get lots of time off and a flexible schedule
wildland firefighting worked out great for me its an amazing job so long as you are comfortable doing wilderness tasks if you know nothing about the woods it isnt for you
  im wondering about this   its definitely something im interested in though ill look into it more myself and see how one actually gets into it    simply more money is construction something i can hop into with no experience ive only got 5 months to work before i start up at university next fall
  i used to work in a railway gang out of glasgow in scotland they were some rough lads had a few convicted murderers on the squad they were really rough with safety and one time i accidentally cut someones ropes with my chainsaw when they put them round a tree i was cutting at night without telling me fortunately he wasnt over a cliff at the time but it scared the shite out of me so i quit that job its not dangerous if you do it correctly however when you are with a company trying to save money it can get sketchy you have to have balls/money put aside to be able to walk away if you disagree on a safety point yeah i do find the work regularly breathtaking for example hanging above the waves off an oil rig watching divers working below the surface as the sun rises on a night shift money is goooooood once made 12 grand uk in a 28 day stint in singapore the gold mines were good coin too 50bucks an hour
  god bless you anon thank you very much    do i need to go to college/dip money into getting into a job like this
surveyor in northern canada here im flown out by helicopter from a camp every morning to set up a gps station and then stake out mine claims its as /out/ as it can get most of these places have only ever been seen by natives and the odd geologist tons of bear caribou wolves and muskox up there you need a few years of community college to become a surveyor and like 8 years to become get a legal canada land surveyor ticket who has time for that but ive got two guys on my team who just carry my shit and pound stakes i make around 90k leafbux and the other two are probably around 60k but i know of guys who do the same thing in alaska and make over 100
  not my pic but you get the idea
    bumping for more information here    ive heard of this but cant seem to get a grip on any solid information from anyone thats ever done it
  how does one get the job of carrying things and pounding stakes asking for a friend
  does anyone has any info about this kind of job in south america i am finishing high school and im not into an office job i live in brazil btw
  tfw wrong people get fuckton of money
      just apply to every survey assistant job listing you can see new listings come posted almost weekly on the various job search sites most of them list some ridiculous qualifications like diploma from a geotechnical college or experience requirements just ignore those maybe write a cover letter explaining why you think youre qualified mind you this is a tough job and you should be in really good shape if youve never done any serious physical labour or worked in the woods its not for you
  go for the army mate
  how well does it pay how do you think a nonwhite guy is going to be treated
how well does conservation officer stack up as an /out/ job
made 80k my first year on pipeline
treeplanting is fun but its basically transplanting your wageslaving to the woods
how is general farm labor something just above minimum wage outside a major city
currently working on the railway here in canada its kinda both worlds honestly might be in the middle of the mountains or next to a big city you get to travel around the country but you work 1016h a day then go back to a shitty hotel room big money though and you get laid off in the winter
  it depends on what you do if youre picking cherries youre going to be the only english speaker and youre going to make less than everyone else there because theyve all been doing since they were a child it also fucking sucks    however if you get into something like irrigation maintenance youre still probably going to be the only white guy but at least a few of the guys in your crew will know some english i op did this for a summer for a summer and it was a good time it was a larger family farm and they gave me a place to stay and the mexican wives cooked dinner everyday the following season i came back and did tractor work through harvest and made a lot more money that year but it was also a lot less /out/
  do you have to camp when you work
take up a power lineman apprenticeship and try to work transmission jobs up north youll be in the middle of nowhere doing some man shit all day for good money one thing to note is that a lot of transmission guys are extremely rough like they wouldnt think much about killing someone and some of them have still its a great job and you will make a shit load of money as long as you dont fall into the trap of blowing your paychecks on women drugs and booze blue collar men have blue collar vices i suppose
  that doesnt sound bad at all any information about how to enter an apprenticeship program
  never heard anyone outside of charters doing any of that and commercial fishing does not end with the summer it picks up twice as much in winter months from october up through february and seafood plants actually have mass temp hire events where you can make around 610k in 4 months just to cut fish on a bandsaw or fillet them        depends    some captains will hire you on a 1099 some will hire you legally plan on showing up every day or losing your job over one absence    you can find job postings on bulletin boards in the fish markets and all over the docks call that captain to beg for work or just stand on the dock or in the market/processing area with a sign saying willing to work hard with hard in all capital letters best place to begin is in a cannery or processing place or go beg for a job in the docks like a dog    prepare to be cold and wet all the time constantly  prepare to fist fight asians and other crews at the docks constantly  prepare to be on a boat standing up for 1214 hours per day with no breaks constantly  prepare to be screamed at by the captain constantly  prepare to be out at night and not come back until the well is full constantly  prepare to have sore hands and elbows constantly  prepare to spend all your copious amounts of cash on hot asian hookers constantly    the bright side is youll make varying amounts of high profit depending on crew size wont have to workout after a month because lifting 20100lb tunas halibut and nets full of mackerel will beef you up quick and if you keep up or are better than the rest of the crew youll have job security    ill tell you the scenery is payment enough for any true outdoorsmen though these images will stick in your head until you die even if you wash out    learn your knots and how to swim knowledge of nets and deep sea fishing tackle a plus    good luck anons
  a forester   shit to ne of walking well paid  cant do better than that
  how old were you and how long did it take you to get there
has anyone here managed to combine an it/dev ops/programming career with /out/ like doing some tech shit that requires remote outdoor locations not talking about stuff like surveying that requires its own certs
  no but ive been trying to sometimes theres a similar job for weather equipment
    do shutdowns for factories/mills     sleep in your car in the parking lot
  whats the daily workload of a forester like
  prepare to fist fight asians and other crews at the docks constantly    why
anyone done forest fire fighting how is it
    oil and gas isnt /out/ you rape the environment for a living
  escort
  worked a career and retired at 54 hard work awesome fun job
  ive heard lumberjacks in canada make good money      thanks for the info      conservation jobs are quite selective because thyre rare and specialized lumber production is easier to get into and pays just as well so forestry management is the way to go
  army  t pussy faggot  marines or bust oorah
  what level of physical fitness would you reccomend for a new guy and how likely am i to get fried
  yo    there are some lame duty stations but when its fun its fun    t last year on a district engine innamiddleofnowhere with a fat female captain  t applying for shot crews this year  t peppering angus
  cry more hippie
i have a bach degree and roughly two years of gis experience currently dying behind a desk anyone have any ideas on where to go from here it has to be somewhere with mountains if im going to move
  dont be retarded anon  take a good look at how you support the industry  dont try come off as some superior faggot
  nothing more hypocritical than an envirotard
    join the marine corps as a combat engineer if youre lucky youll end up in a line/infantry unit or a constructionlogistics company
    in tougher jobs the mutually experienced hardship bonds more youre less likely to encounter racism in bluecollar jobs
  depends on what type of module engine or handcrew and how dedicated the overhead on that particular resource is to pting   im assuming as a rookie youll either get on an engine or type 2 crew crews are usually more physically demanding than engines
  this  
  that entirely depends what you are doing    also good luck even getting a technician position without at least a 2 year degree  and a real forester position requires a 4year degree and may require a standardized test for your state of practice
  good luck man even my short detail with a shotcrew fucked me up good
  i was 27 and that was the first time i set foot on pipeline youll be surrounded by retards so advancement is stupid easy like i said i made 83k my first year and for 6 months of that i was at 17/hr
  where do i apply
  which employer
want /fit/ job  dont want to talk to people beyond work related stuff    is there even anything like this
  a little mom and pop outfit but strike construction is a decent place to work for also you can look for gas companies spectra transcanada texas eastern transmission anadarko eog hiring for compressor station work youll be assigned to a station but you will have options to travel and do main line work
  ayylmao i remember talking to you in that thread yeah man i think about your poasts and the sawtooth fitness averages a lot when im training  was actually gonna go visit eldorado ihc this week but they got real busy all of a sudden       marking timber setting choke chains on a logging operation somewhere hilly maybe a hydrology tech wander around taking snow samples
if you do this anon a year from now youll be whinging about how sore your back is and you dont get paid enough    study and get a carrier bro not a job
  shit tonne of walking around the woods one a week gotta do some paperwork selling woodand you can be called if you are after work
forest service seasonal tech waiting for a flight ama before i have to put the phone in airplane mode
  can confirm     youll be paid a comfortable wage but its usually seasonal 6 months out of the year youre free to travel or just dick around for the other 6 months     i disagree with  you dont need to know fuckall about the forest just get your basic courses certified and youll learn as you go wildfire guys are the grunts of the forest you dont need to have a phd in forest management to swing a hand tool at dirt or run a chainsaw for 16 hours that being said the more relevant education you have in the area the more hireable you are
  pull your fucking weight and no one will care if you can save everybody time by thinking ahead then everyone will love you regardless of your racial handicap just dont be the lazy guy and especially dont be the lazy brown guy  t did manual labor for years at a place where 75 of the spooks were the laziest hinderances in the world and 25 id work to hell and back with
    brickmason
i have 3 more years before i get my trust fund so in the meantime im working as a scuba instructor and its kino
  why the fuck would you still be working when youre old as shit this isnt mexico retirement is a thing
  whats wrong with layin brick thats somebodys house im building theres honor in that
    just got the confirm your interest email from sawtooth
  sheeeeeiiitt tells us how it be going anon
conservation corps are a good way to go here in the states western colorado conservation corps pays pretty well their season is february through november texas conservation corps is one of the few programs that run year round
  not op but someone whos about to finish community college and going into university this sounds really neat  thanks for bringing this to my attention
  go dig ditches you goon imagine being so retarded you romanticize manual labor lol
  meanwhile the california conservation corps pays minimum wage and is pretty much designed for dropouts that cant get hired anywhere else
  heroine  whole different box of frogs
  their fire crews get fire wages or so ive heard and the backcountry trails program is extremely cool but youre not wrong    meanwhile this flyer from 2012 puts wccc pay at 310 a week which is pretty dropouttier     not to rubbish them as an organization nobody joins conservation corps for money
  for comparison ccc is 1900 a month     but cost of living is probably lower in western co    but they pay for room and board what else is there to cost of living
  i am in southern ontario taking civil engineering   how far up north are you my grandparents live nearish to elliot lake and i love it up there  was it hard to make the connections to get the job  how long after school did you get the job   what type of surverying specifically are you doing
  is being a geologist /out/ /sci/ fag here and being out of doors was a big draw to the field
  desu i got like a dozen confirm your interest emails no idea what to make of them thought any advice on what to do next in this process
  look up the ibew local for your area and apply with them just so you know you need at least a class b commercial drivers license class a is better to have youll be an apprentice for about 34 years going and doing where and what youre told but after that you top out as a lineman and can go wherever youd like ne is a good spot for transmission jobs and youll probably do a lot of it anyway if you live around there as an apprentice especially before you go hot as a 4th step the money is very good but dont get into the trap of only doing it for a good check you have to truly enjoy linework if you expect to do it for more than just a few years
  a buddy of mine is starting a season in wccc base pay for crew members is 800 a paycheck
  how do you get work in strayan mines im from canada im a pipe fitter
  ive worked my whole career in corps and can confirm nobody joins for the money this means that on a crew you get an interesting combination of retarded high school dropouts and college students who just want to do something useful for the environment    that being said you wont have to pay for food rent car insurance etc for however long your crew is in the field which balances it out a bit
  fuckin cracker of a post mate
  geology is very /out/ camping mapping hiking and beer thats all geologists do its awesome
  ive only been through fed hiring once before    what im doing  say yes if im still interested  contact the contact person to ask about housing pt project work time offforest vs on typical onforest ia load and disposition hike in scratch line and camp hose lay from the road etc
  that looks like a good opportunity id go for it if i was american        doesnt seem like something youre meant to do forever its a stepping stone so long as you make the most of it
  i think its assumed one will blow all the money on drugs and hookers in the offseason
  you make just enough money to get drunk a couple times and buy a new pair of boots  as norman maclean says somewhere about either logging or the forest service i forget which
  flip houses
  some advice give up all hope in something being permanent with the federal government until you have signed papers and you are en route to the job
  you only get fire wages if youre on the line and you bet your ass everyone else gets preference first and even if you are they stick you on standby or a support role
  retirement is a thing  spotted the boomer
west coast  alaska fishing/fisheries   east coast  maine fishing/fisheries     or something in the lumber industry     those will effectively destroy your body while leaving you outside to the elements
trying to learn to use a chainsaw but im shit at it currently my felling cuts always go wrong
  i want to as well but im afraid of hurting myself its embarassing not knowing how to run one
  im on a course but im pretty sure im not going to be ready for my assessment next week    its not as scary as you think once you get familiar with them but there are a fair few safety things its probably worth being taught mostly around minimising the chance and potential harm of kickback
  oh i know none of these are offers      tfw applying to gs4s and still cant cut worth a fuck  wish i could learn in the offseason but im not sure how without paying a lot of 
  make high stumps and practice cutting your faces in them
  what about stockman just ruining sheep till they submit to your every whims
    what are the general requirements for being a rock wrangler and what is the work generally like i am thinking there are some good ideas in this thread for my spoilergf/spoiler shes very /out/ and has a statistics degree which she now hates making it even more useless i think shed like a comfy /out/ job but also desu i wouldnt want to suggest her things where she would be gone for extended periods of time frequently like the fishing boat type recommendations in this thread
  commercial fishing  wildland firefighting
  gas  oil offshore or onshore    hard stressful dangerous work best suited for the young the strong and the brave  big money to be had if your smart and responsible about everything
currently third year in school with cs degree and i fucking hate it and im struggling bad been flirting with the idea of dropping out for about a year and im on the brink now     i would love to do geology but im too far past that point now and i cant put all of that money into school again     should i just do oil work where do i start with that
  oil work where do i start with that  look up the big international oil field services outfits yes they have a big on shore presence in the us oilfields  dont mess with small companies    if you want to start with us onshore oil  gas look at ak co mt nd sd wy tx  start your search with state employment services if your really brave overseas oilfield work is there too but probably more for experienced people    do not fuck around with small companies only talk to big outfits negotiate a reasonable and fair employment agreement dont take automatically first offer or bottom dollar consider the hardships you will have to live with as far as remote work locations and remotes potentially rough living conditions  long grueling hours lots of overtime    make sure you get a good employment agreement so youre well compensated for these hardships or you will regret your decision and hate it but if your making fat stacks of cash its all fuckin good
  75k/year is more or less a guarantee  youll be close to 6 figures before you know it
  become a laborer mason tree topper oil field hand or commercial fisherman all pay well and are hard jobs was a mason for a long time was never more fit
  i know a surveyor who did some similar stuff out innawoods and had to bludgeon a mountain lion with an axe because it was trying to kill his friend have any crazy stories about seeing some wild shit
  spectra just did a power plant in my state i was part of the big dig prepping the site
  thanks for the info man any keywords or websites i should be using to find jobs
  keywords or websites    alot depends on what positions your interested in or qualified to start at    state govt employment services websites for starters          any other state you want to look at    avoid things like oilfieldjobscom those are likely scam bullshit time wasters    register yourself on the state employment service websites for the oil field states you would consider working in then do a search post a resume etc  protip if you dont put your phone number on your resume chances are some recruiters / hr people might ignore your resume at the first pass  its always a risk putting your phone number out there but some companies wont want to wait with email messaging on initial contact they want to be able to call you and talk to you right away to see if its worth setting up an interview or move on theyre busy  ive never had any trouble from putting my number on a resume with a state employment service site  after some job searching and industry research you learn the names of the main companies you can easily just search their online job postings directly on the company websites    keywords/phrases for beginning searchs oil field services oil  gas energy services  roustabout workover rig laborer wireline operators swamper     halliburton  ksi  hess  wood group psn  whiting  shell  conoco  bakerhughes  cj energy services  nabors  strata      very important  consider the work/living/housing environment local amenities may be less than ideal so you need to be compensated for that hardship or you will regret everything you wont have the ability to renegotiate your employment agreement once you start  you get a review down the road and an adjustment to compensation after a period but you cant be there two months and suddenly say this isnt enough money i need more negotiate that shit right upfront in the beginning before you accept
  very important  consider the work/living/housing environment local amenities may be less than ideal so you need to be compensated for that hardship or you will regret everything    desired wage formula  whatever you think its normally worth per hour rate then add 750/hr
first off id just like to say i dont know where to post this thread i know /o/ is technically where this thread belongs but im looking for an answer other than meme posts  im becoming a fat lazy piece of shit so i bought a road bike to work out and get me outside more often long story short i keep rolling and squishing my balls riding this fucking thing i cant ride for more than 10 minutes without just absolutely aching and /out/ bros cycle have you had this issue whats the fix
balls out front
youll be saddle sore for a while takes some getting used to after 34 rides you should be much better or if youre a faggot buy a woman esque soft saddle
  get a wider seat
/n/ is the designated cycling board  theres also trains  dont tell them you thought bicycles belonged on /o/
  this  is the goto place for cycling related things just prepare your pooper for cycling autism      there are many crotchless seat designs you can google up also look into recumbent bicycles
    /n/ was able to help thanks guys    been riding for a week i got used to the feeling that my ass has been kicked 100 times in a row
  banana bikes are reserved for hight individuals only
    was the fix adjusting your seat to proper height and angle thats what i was going to suggest
  one of the fixes yeah another one is tighter undees
eh dont listen to those speedo wearing faggots i wear normal underwear proper height and angle is your solution
anyone else living in asia here    expat in hk here hk is weirdly great for hiking because theres so many hills around but im getting a bit bored of hiking here at this point    thinking of doing sapa in vietnam anyone gone up there for trekking the cameron highlands in malaysia are supposed to be great too
  living in asia  gotta be more specific there chief
all of southern china looks ripe for hiking and the himalayas are not far away     sichuan province is amazing fly into chengdu and hit the hills
  vietnam   lol watch where you step bud   mongolia is supposed to be pretty based except for in winter
  what do you mean snakes
  im in indonesia its rainy season now so im staying in the capital until next year     lots of places to explore and i had done 2 out of the 7 highest summits in here    never been to vietnam but i heard good things about the cameron highlands although the pictures in google are eerily similar to tea plantation in bandung java
did some /out/ type shit in japan while i lived there     there are some surprisingly beautiful areas hidden in japan unfortunately it takes a good chunk of money and time to get to them bullet trains to leave cities to rural areas can cost a few hundred     singapore is awful for /out/ unless you like botanical gardens in that case 10/10 gardens also expensive     the philippines is nice cheap and the girls like foreigners while i was there traffic was awful in manila but outside of that no issues many mountains and islands to explore     thailand youd want to get something charter since the presence of landmines in certain areas is a real danger much to do but i suggest going north     i can try to go more in depth if your interested
ive been to both sapa is fun its not difficult if you have any experience see if you can do a home stay in a village its also very beautiful     cameron highlands didnt seem all that great from what i remember of it but i wasnt there specifically for hiking so i may have been in a shitty area for it
  they may have meant mines/traps from the war
    from malaysia here op is probably talking about the moss forest in cameron
  japan here  where the hell did you camp all the land is private here andit seems to be almost all faux glamping shitholes nowhere to hike up and set up a tent without being on someones property
    thats basically it my guy   i was lucky enough to be dating a girl whose parents had land in niigata in a small town so there was forests for days     however i have heard stories of people going into aokigahara and walking out and setting up camp for a few days before killing themselves and the body being well decomposed before the suicide hunters found them     most of my outings were aight seeing of natural wonders or buildings built into the scenery
  im a big fan of hiking in hk and im nowhere close to running out of new places what were your favorite trails
anywhere in the himalayas is godtier as far as im concerned

  sunset peak was probably my favourite because it feel remote plus the views but it takes an age to do i lost the light and had to walk back to tung chung in pitch black last time wouldnt try it again until summer    look up hongkonghikes hes a french dude that explains how to do certain trails with photos so yo dont get lost theres tons of ideas there    i want to do more in sai kung actually havent done much up there    any recommendations
  sunset peak is definitely one of the best the abandoned huts along the way really add to the scene making it a bit more interesting than lantau peak / phoenix mountain which is great too btw even though the big buddha monastery area there is really played out its kind of awesome to descend from the top of the mountain towards the monastery area in the fog and be greeted with those big wooden sutra columns emerging from the mist    lantau island is pretty great in general in particular i really like the trail from shek pik dam west to the fan lau fortress ruins and then north to tai o through the yi o village ruins and farming area the terrain is fairly diverse as far as hk goes    the hikehongkong guy is my main resource for finding trails but hes screwed me a few times with his difficulty ratings ive brought my gf along on some of his hikes and ended up having to listen to her justifiably complain the whole way through when it turned out substantially tougher than he implied still a really useful site    i actually havent been to sai kung much or the northeastern parks in general besides the place with the columnar rock formations probably because it takes a bit longer to get there so it keeps getting downselected out of the options

    being a satanist faggot murderer no
  it made me realise how much i value being left the fuck alone to get on with my own thing it also made me realise how my own thing is to impact my surroundings as little as possible
  satanist   hahaha      its made me very vitalistic everything in nature is engaged in a desperate colourful bloody and exciting struggle their prerogative is their family not some jerkoff about christian morality to see bucks fighting over a doe and to see the decaying corpses that litter the outdoors is to be reminded of what it is to be alive with the infinite sublimity and constant change the balance that rules the turmoil its bery cool   i am both far more at peace far lighter in heart and far more serious about my pursuits thanks to the outdoors
  read some walt whitman its pretty chill
  im an anarchoprimitivist as a result im fond of ted k but i dont like the fact hes been appropriated by lessthanreputable people here
its connected me a lot to the german romantics of the 19th century and that tradition that went through the third reich how they understood nature as having a strengthening and straightening effect on mans nature     in a similar vein its simplified my political/social beliefs i see the importance of social cohesion family etc more clearly than ever because you realize how much you need other people after youve spent a week in the backcountry by yourself

  these posts are recent where are they from this is a fascinating take on genesis
i became disillusioned with civilization every time the weekend ends and i have to go back into town to work my dead end job it absolutely breaks my soul when im in nature i feel peace and a sense of belonging that i dont experience anywhere else    i deeply envy uncontacted tribes who live the way their ancestors did for hundreds of thousands of years while im a slave to civilization with no tribe to call my home it breaks my heart to think about it its almost unbearable
    it made me from an atheist to a naturalistic pantheist for the same reason a single celled organism inside you would not recognize your existence except as its environment even were it intelligent enough to have such thoughts i believe we also exist inside of an unfathomably large living thing we identify as nature a god which is too big to see
  cant find it sorry i think it was on either his or lit
the more i go /out/ the more i find myself liking knut hamsun his writing really resonates with me and makes me feel more connected with nature not in the bullshit hippie/wicca way but in a way i cant really describe with words the last couple of years ive been camping a lot more ive started learning more about gardening and am trying to grow my own food ive spent weekends collecting nuts and to help my food supply last me through the winter as well as learning to preserve meats can vegetables and dry fruit mostly apples i found myself becoming happier and more fulfilled as a person i also feel more disconnected from a lot of aspects of modern society
  knut hamsun  seems like an interesting chap any recommendations on where to start with his work
  i started with under the autumn star but i would recommend growth of the soil
i definitely understood treehuggers after visiting the redwood forest seeing the stars can also induce a religious experience
  i feel closer to god sitting by a creekside off trail than i do in church
  this is also very similar to the take on genesis in ishmael by daniel quinn
  anarchism and primitivism are both shitbrain tier this is coming from a guy who grows/raises most of his own food on principal
  have a few kids and bury them young and then die from an easily curable parasite or a spongiform encephalopathy in order to be more like your uncontacted tribes
  what readings do you recommend
  none of that shit happens stop making stuff up
once you stop thinking and start experiencing life you will know
  im gay as fuck now
/bullmooseparty/
  im an anarchoprimitivist as a result im fond of ted k  brainlet who didnt understand ted at all
while /out/ i realized that my patriotism comes more from a love of the actual physical land that makes up this country than it does from any particular attachment to our government or people
  hundreds of thousands of years  the only uncontacted tribes remaining are in south and central america meaning that at the absolute oldest they cannot possibly have existed more than about 115 thousand years ago
  
  what are your main outdoor activities out of curiosity i dig the spirit
  wasnt that the whole point though at least for early americana propaganda manifest destiny was all about expanding the land that we occupied not just for government but to be able to fully access the new world that nobody at the time had any understanding about even when we finished expanding most states still told each other to fuck off and treated their land as their land so to speak progovernment/nationalism wasnt much of a thing until we became a superpower at least i think so given how isolationist we were before then

post trees that you personally chopped
cutting down a christmas tree is impressive  im literally taking my 9 year old niece to do that tomorrow
  this top kek
  ya call that a tree
  not op but i didnt get the idea this was supposed to be impressive i just thought chopping your own tree must be comfy
  chopping down a live tree for your unnaturaljewish religions commercial holiday  well done
  christmas was literally a pagan holiday between christians and larpagans neither of them should have any objection to it and i dont see how chopping down your own tree contributes to commercialism at all
  its usually comfy but the usedtobequiet place i go has apparently been discovered and was a shitshow today there were more people there today than ive seen the last 5 years combined    complaining about cutting down christmas trees is equivalent to complaining about eating corn thats what they were grown to do

whats /out/s opinion on bear grylls
  textbook definition of a larper and figured out a way to get paid to do it genius desu
  retarded
  sensationalist larper/poser
a legit badass who faked a few things for the tv show format flooded the market with some pretty good gear at pretty good prices especially the ultimate pro knife its very uncool to say any of this
the guys making od cash while my broke ass is sitting here talking about him on cuckchan i respect him for that
  legit threat to society    his tv series objectively gives people bad advice that will get other people in danger or outright killed
  not to mention that the gerber gear with his name on it is nothing more than overpriced low quality shit
  chink shit
  its okay people who watch bear grylls arent the same people who go do stuff innawoods his bad info is poisoning people who cant do anything with it to begin with
i love almost all the survival shows because everyone knows they are scripted and set up but almost every goofy show with the goofy people on them i almost always pick up something if i am ever riding a bike with hydro brakes carrying a bouquet of flowers with the stay fresh pack i know i will be able to make a fire with the chemical reaction why the fuck do i know something this retarded but you never know  also i go into the woods alot so dont go there
  absolute wuss compared to the guy next to him doing all the same shit while holding a camera
    hes no les stroud
man vs wild was never as good as survivorman anyway
  makes les stroud look like a bitch ass homo
  i like your mindset
  this
pretty much this    i take it as entertainment and might pick up some useful stuff here and there  its far more entertaining watching some dude light a fire with a wet sponge and a nail when it is set up as the real deal than if he was safe and sound in his moms back yard  suspension of disbelief if you will  most survival situations are risky at best and deadly at worst if you think they would do that for real for a tv show you are delusional
  a paid presenter the same as any other personality that does it for views    they dont matter and anyone that gets upset over one being more authentic than the other doesnt matter either
hes a beauty unfortunately he has to do larp stunts to get people to watch his show i read his book and hes been through some shit desu
he is to outdoorsmanship as black science man is to science just glorified presenters and larpers watching him for anything other for entertainment is sin
  hes a pissdrinking poser shill    promoted the fuckoutof by corporate  media rats to make money out of gullible geardos and grandmas who buy his shit for their grandchildren because theyre pushed down our throat so hard i can even find this shit on every corner in poland    i probably wouldnt mind that much if crap branded with his name was actually good but its not this being one example   also fuck gerber for going chinkcheap on a very good knife design like lmf  even survival shilly is better than him      4chan had a good piss at him a while ago     lol i forgot lot of these    dont ever mention that cunt in here again
                for once ans of nouns known as anons agree on something
not the best survival expert but definitely makes the best survival expert tv show
made drinking your piss an everyday thing
hes an entertainer and pretty damn good at it besides i have no doubt that off camera hes very competent on the all outdoorsy stuff plus i very much enjoy the physical element he adds to the scene hes a fit chap that does various cool stunts like helicopter jumping or mountain climbing bear is cool in my book you need to take the tv shows with a grain of salt same goes to the gear he rents his face to its just a way to make money and it works great in both ways hes a cash cow that banked on retards that live intensely through tv if any of the advice in the show gets you hurt youre probably dumb as fuck and deserved it to begin with
  avid piss drinker also eats all sorts of nasty bugs  hes an entertainer    maybe he should try doing german porn
im going to put myself in the situation of a stranded tourist and show you how to survive  goes running and jumping around in the wild when hurting your foot can be life threatening in the wild  always gets wet when he doesnt need to   drink your piss anon lol  squeezing water out of an elephant dung  his show is fake as shit and his brand is shit too if you watch his stuff and like it just watch it for the sake of entertainment and nothing else

  what does /out/ suggest    suicide
posting shit collection    some for sale in the eu
  i upgraded from a mora but now that im using something 10x the price im wary of sharpening it the same way with a puck do i need a system i live in an apartment so i dont really have a shop space
  what knife is that in my opinion no more than this is needed maybe a serration on the mora
  if its already properly sharp just strop it a bit after each use and it probably wont get dull enough to need sharpening
  tops brakimo    its got an edge it just isnt sharp maybe a few passes with a honing stone
any anons with the mora garberg here opinions
    a little too chunky for me its not bad by any stretch of imagination although the condor terasaurus assuming its come out yet i havent been keeping track is better imo    either way  a fine sturdy knife and although id prefer the kansbol thinner flat grind on the tip 32 mm thick is on par for scandi knives    and really  dont worry about that full tang in the midle ages when knives were a lot more used than today people used partial tang with glued on handles al the time heck  wwi gurkha kukris were made with partial tangs and glued on handles
  heck  wwi gurkha kukris
  yeah m8 i asked about the mora garberg not all that shit you listed
  anon gives him a valid response  acts like a cunt  go back to whatever shitboard you came from
  i would not use a puck but considering its a scandi grind dont worry its supper easy on a bench stone and you can always practice on a mora first basically the most simple quality and cost effective way to sharpen a scandi imo is just a classic whet or water benchstone a double sided will do fine more on that later though    this is a norton india stone       one side is 100grit which is very aggressive you would use it if the knife is very dull wet the stone with slightly soapy water or honing oil or mineral oil just keep the bevel flat on the stone and slide the blade diagonally heel to tip from the bottom to the top of the stone once the scratches look uniform you can change the direction to tip to heel changing the scratch pattern like this helps take of material faster keep going until you have gotten a burr across both sides of the edge and the full length this means you have actually gotten both sides of the bevel to meat at the edge apex     now move to the other side 320 grit and repeat until you no longer see the scratches from the 100 grit if you do not plan to go to higher grits alternate the side every pass for 10 or so passes putting less and less pressure on the edge with each this will mostly remove the burr you may find sliding the knife vertically instead of diagonally near the end to leave a more aesthetically pleasing look but thats up to you     after 320 grit you knife should be working sharp good enough for normal use however you may consider getting higher grit stones for a better polish for a few reasons higher polishes leave a more keen edge slightly improve rust resistance can be more durable and are more aesthetic     count
  count     for a finer polish on a budget i would use this 600/1000 grit water stone just put it in a sink under water for a few minutes as you use the india stone rinse the blade of any oil or soap from the india stone and start at the 600 the same way you did the 320 and then again with the 1000 just splash some water on it if it seem to be getting dry          this may seem like a lot but really this is like 40 2 stones and no more than 30 minutes of work if its really dull and 15 minutes for touch ups and once you get used to it
  go back to whatever shitboard you came from  you mean /out/ kek
  dont hate me bro but its true gurkhas in wwi used glued partial tang kukris in combat
  get this in fine and extra fine you probably dont need the medium unless you have a shit edge  small enough to use anywhere or in the field quality stone

  shit collection  god damn you werent kidding
squealniggers i come 4 u
  should i buy the new version if leatherman crater c33 just because it is legal with a stud for opening now i love the knife and history of the change is kinda interesting but its the same knife never had one does an opening stud help that much

kukris are fun
for everyday its an opinel n 10  special occasions its a leatherman wave    sorry no pix
ive been looking at upgrading to a nicer camp/bushcrafting knife over the usual mora ive looked over several types but i keep circling back to the tbs boar because damn that turkish walnut is sexy can you chaps give me any reason why i shouldnt pull the trigger on it perhaps a similar alternative
so my dad got this from the local swap meet for me for a dollar from what ive read most hand made 440 pakistani knives are shit but can anyone identify the make of this or any info on it is it worth cleaning up and sharpening
  fuck forgot pic related
  there is no make its pakistan lower than china
  is the steel at least worth working with im interested in knife making and i think restoring a knife would be a good starting project
are benchmades an overpriced fad or is the 162 actually a good knife im taking a few friends camping with me and i wanna give them my mora as a beater so id need another knife
    both theyre nice but still over priced why not get another mora
  looks neat if you need a new knoife i cant see why you shouldnt buy it      knife is just fine clean it thoroughly and maybe apply some sandpaper to it and it will work fine if you use it      most knives are overpriced its just a piece of sharpened steel stock its obviously not worth 200 but then youre paying for brand name craftsmanship warranty customer service and all that mumbojumbo
  because its hard to virtue signal what a master /out/ist you are with a 12 plastic knife
    only to those fools that think simply having a shiny thing mattersha forgot where i was for a second
  its fine for practice in restoring a knife looks like high chromium in line with the 440 steel label you may also want to try a rusty low chromium high carbon knife too for restoration practice it can be more interesting with corrosion patinaetc
  ha shit i have one of those in my car as a utility blade i got it for 5 from a bud k catalogue in 2002 it came in a 3 pack and all the edges came bent and the cast bronze was unfinished and had to be filed down you wont be destroying anything if you mess with it
  tops usually makes big beefy knives with thick blade stock this means the geometry is such that it will never be a very slicy blade it probably wont ever become razor sharp
this morning
  hows the steel anon any rolls or chips
  
should i get pic related for field dressing deer  or are there better drop points i should be looking at
  not pleased ive spent far more time sharpening than cutting it goes dull just sitting in its sheath i love the shape and size of a kephart but that steel is garbage ponied up for the bark river kephart cpm 154 its in the mail
  why would you not have a knife with a gut hook makes the skinning part much easier
  thanks for the write up anon been looking at stones for awhile might pick this up eventually    i keep ceramic rods in my hunting pack in case i need a field touch up im not a hard knife user though just broke in the mora gutting a deer this weekend
  id rather have a separate knife/hook for just that purpose and not have a hook in my way when i dont need it
  now thats a knoife
  jesus christ i want to choke that guy
  what is that and where do i get one

  what does /out/ suggest  carry a lighter carry a pack of lighters
  nice picture anon it looks beautiful there do you mind saying where it is and were you camping or is that how you start every day
    shameless samefagging anyone else want you weigh in on this one im always very cautious about spending this kind of cash on a knoife
  holy crap what is this
kabar kukri need something cheap and work able dont like cs
  its a kauhava pukko made in the early 50s buy a guy called kusko lahmi i believe is how you spell his name
is this one pretty good i need to simultaneously chop down two trees while batoning
i dont have any gay aesthetic photos of it stabbed into a tree but ive been using the morakniv bushcraft knife with the fire striker for a year now and cant recommend it enough
  i found it for 200 for a 10cm model damn thats tempting do you know what steel this is
  it is a trade secret but it is a carbon steel that is very very rust resistandt but it is a carbon steel of some kind
  the rubber gets very sticky with pine resin and can be hard to clean it is prone to come apart at the apex of the rise near the balde where you keep your finger
  cool thanks
  most common point of failure isnt the same as being prone to something
  thanks sunshine coast bc just out for the day
  my nigga i love these things plus their like ten bucks
  just saying its something to be aware of mines coming apart there
am i the only one who thinks opinels are really poor knives i have one and its my least favorite of all the knives i own i prefer a 10 ozark trail knife i got as a christmas gift over the opinel its really hard to get it to keep an edge and it just overall feels flimsy my favorite knife is a kershaw i got in the cabelas bargin cave for 30 when it was 70 percent off i carry it every day and its aside from the tip its still sharp enough to shave with
  its absolutely not a hard worker its great for cutting cheese and mushrooms and fruits but itll struggle with some woods    heres my scratched piece of shit gonna be buying another helle that suits my small hands this thing is a real beef boy
  eggen same one i use good shit friend fits my hands perfectly and mine are pretty average size you must be pretty cursed
  puukko  t finn
  it holds a great edge for most people gets razor sharp in a few strokes also i will say though that i think they get memed way too much they arent an ideal carry for most things by any means compared to many modern options

i want to start bringing a knife with me when im biking innawoods what do you guys normally recommend
  mora companion        bolster

  california  high income tax  high sales tax  unbelievably high cost of living  fines fees and taxes on every literally every imaginable action  shit public schools  shit infrastructure    thinking the state is going to pass up an opportunity to fuck its residents out of even more cash  thinking the great cuckold state would have it any other way  we just voted down a ballot measure to repeal a gas tax in a time where we pay upwards of four fucking dollars per gallon the real tragedy of the fires is they werent big enough to cleanse us of la and sf
  15  huh i expected to pay more for even an entry level knife ill give it a go thanks anon
  no problem bro its a very decent knife for the price and will help you to understand what your needs are in the future you can always upgrade to something higher end if you feel like just remember that its not a full tang knife so if you decide to batoning chop chop pls be smart about and dont go around splitting thigh thick logs
how much will 1075 steel want to rust on me if i got pic related for wilderness edc
  1075 would likely rust if you left it damp really depends on some things like the environment blade coatings/patina and so on
  was going to say some kinda imp or bumblebee but neither seem to quite match   is it a bark river
redpill me on a jp peltonen sissipuukko please is a mora the better choice
is there a reason why people dont use wharncliffe shaped blades often im interested because it looks easier to sharpen
  fragile tip
  i really like the sissipuukko the 15cm blade is a bit too ling in my opinion so i suggest you look at the m/07 instead of the m/95   compared to a mora it is absolutely more durable more ergonomic and has a better blade mora is cheaper tho  there is also varustelekas sissipuukko which is slightly cheaper and very similar
which fixed knife to get was thinking kabar usmc or bk9 need something normal not overpriced with performance same as opinel
i can never make my mind up on what profile i like but ive learned a do not care for scandi
  what arrangements of atoms do you often split with that hardened solid state splitting tool
  mora or condor kephart
  secondd
pic related is getting lots of shilling and being hailed the best knife for the price range  what are your views /out/
    mora   the kephart steel is really too soft for any /out/ing according to this one guy that i know but he goes to another school so you wouldnt know him
  condor steel does tend to be softer but that makes field sharpening easier
  i have it its fine what you see is what you get it may be the best 3v puukkoish knife in the pricerange  what are the shills saying
  what are the shills saying  thats an excellent knife basically is it skeletonized underneath the handle
  not sure i dont really want to try and find out given the nature of the handle unless you know a nondestructive approach id assume there are some holes in the tang besides the lanyard hole
    neato id love to see it in a curly birch handle
  im this guy anyone wanna buy this knife decided to sell it even though im going to miss it dearly any english bros it will be 40 for americans its 60 postage included    sorry if this is like frowned upon in knife threads its just this one knife i own dunno how else i can sell it in the uk
  why do you not like a scandi not criticizing just curious
  that garbage knife  mid blade striking  my eyes
  hi newfag
so i found a guy selling handmade knives on side of the road yesterday   picked up these 2 he was asking 75 per but gave him 100 for both  havent had a chance to use them yet but i was jw what /out/ thought also what would yall recommend to test them out and see if theyre decent
  handmade by 7 year olds in china
  i think you got gypped you even ask him what theyre made out of
  yeah he told me what grade but i forgot he had some higher carbon blades and a few damascus lot of them he knew the makers but these are the two i liked since i prefer stainless and he said he got them at an estate sale in phoenix dude seemed pretty solid    i probably did but im pretty satisfied so far theyve got a good weight and seem to be well made gonna have to see how they hold up
just bought a helle arv what a beautiful knife very functional too i think ill get some good use out of this
  you have armillaria mellea honey mushrooms   an underestimated edible imo enokitake are orange real name is flammulinavelutipes
  oh yeah thats right anon i only found enokitake as the closest on google but we eat these here all year round because theres a fuckton of them well yeah maybe theyre not as tasty as enoki but theyre definitely not bad at all especially pickled like i like them thanks for the info
  helle  the only way anon
is this thing any good i really like the aesthetic and i like esee
  lightmyfire army 2 firesteel
  blade looks great handle scales not so much if you like it buy it
anyone owned a lionsteel m1 im fairly tempted but for some reason i keep putting off hitting the buy button
gerber strongarm schrade 42 or kabar marine
been using this helle for a couple years now loving it so far
  do you want to be a walking meme get a bowie if you want a fighting knife theres a reason why those knives are cheap as fug
  i still prefer the mora garberg desu but this is my close second for 100 both are top shit
  so kabar it is
  strongarm if you can find one made in the us
  we just voted down a ballot measure to repeal a gas tax in a time where we pay upwards of four fucking dollars per gallon the real tragedy of the fires is they werent big enough to cleanse us of la and sf  and on top of that it was a repeal of them being able to raise the tax on it forever with no votes on it by the public
  im also thinking becker or bk9
  i have thought about the same too but besides me being a poorfag that is not comfortable spending 100 on a knife it being made of m390 also makes me wonder if its a good choice for /out/ considering that the steel is not very tough by definition specially when they run it at 60rc i mean of you arent abusing it it will do just fine but i would sweat my balls off every time i decided to fuck around doing stupid shit   regardless of that i personally find the design a 10/10 and if the warranty is there to back you up you should go for it    have it in account that i base my opinions on what i read online since again im a poorfag and i rock a stainless mora or a sak most of the time there are plenty anons here with big collections maybe one will share first hand experience or if you see namefag ask him
  just get a bk2 bk7 if you want something bigger
  thanks thats not a bad little insight i think ill hold off for a little while yet
  m390 would be fine on a knife with those specs lionsteels are generally fine i dont love them personally just from the way they tend to fit my hand but i never get a lemon from them
  i guess its not a big knife so op will probably not go around batoning thigh thick logs or using rocks against the spine of the knife then again i dont know anon maybe hes half retarded like myself and will do that and use his knife as throwing knoife for shits and giggles  as for lionsteel i read mostly very high of them dont know if its shills since they often win awards at the bladeshow or people who actually use them tho   this one is also a beauty 
  stick to the mora and the sak if you arent ready to spend a lot to get a lot you wont do it no matter what /out/ tells ya that being said dont fall for the fancy stainless memes theres plenty of aus8 or n690/695 bohler/sandvik blades for around 80
  sak  waste of money
  not rlly fampai
  do you use it  looks like it has a lot of character
  using for a couple years  still in pristine condition  /out/ ladies and gentlemen
  beautiful handle whats the model
  copypasta once again  /out/ noob here looking for a general purpose hunting knife looking at mostly deer good skinning capabilities would be a bonus  can i get away with no drop point and a bushcraft knife i can choose between the brands  opinel  buck  mora  winchester  mueller  gerber  i have gift cards no refunds hence why i have a limited number of options full tang fixed blades would be nice but if you have a more experienced opinion please divulge
  i have a buck 110 for hunting fishing and whittling i dont know if it fits your demands but i rarely need another blade and the fit and finish still make me smile when i pull it out of the pocket although i ve been using it for 1 year regularly now
  what mora is this
does anyone know of any cheap spoon carving knives that you can cut out the concave part of the spoon with    i dont want to dish out 25 dollars for such a niche tool
  deep bevel from sharpening  pristine    just because its not covered in deer shit doesnt mean it hasnt been used
  worth it
terava skrama in the mail did i fuck up /k/ a knife this fugly has to be functional
  looks like an ideal bushcraft knife whats not to like      mora companion will do most everything get stainless    what i run is this  1 tyto replaceable blade knife for most everything havilons are also just fine replace the blade when it gets dull super easy and always have a razor sharp knife    2 silky pocketboy130 for cutting through pelvis skullcap to take the horns and sternum plus i can use it to cut branches and stuff in the treestand and to clear shooting lanes this thing is just awesome

  havent taken it /out/ yet but its fit and finish are top tier my left arm is missing a bunch of hair and no paper is currently safe in this house sheath is very well made and hangs at a good height i think this knife might be the one and thats taking into account the helle i already have also you dont want this condor anon
  listen id gladly buy the condor for like 3040 bucks  basic shipping cost just to try out the geometry and size to maybe one day buy something like the bark river or lt wright if you wanna sell it anyway reply if not its ok
been looking at some crkt knives mainly the spew im concerned about the steel is it gonna give me serious edgeholding problems or am i just gonna have to sharpen it a little more often steel is 5cr15mov
   norton india oilstone can be had on amazon pretty cheap and will last you the rest of your life then your great grandkids will find it in a drawer and use it all of their lives
  its above pot steel but still meh
  i have a spew great shape for edc and general carry but if you are gonna cut anything besides tape and envelopes the steel leaves one wanting
here a cudeman mini boina verde
  thank you brotherrr
  this wood is obviously bad the good stuff doesnt catch knives like this    i love it
  weird steel that doesnt have a ton of information on it so sharpening or edge retention may be eh they tout the hardness so im expecting itll be the sharpening thats a pain
  honestly i prefer using a very small pocket knife and a hatchet for deer i find big knives a little bulky for the work especially if youre gonna want to tan the hide
  thats the bk9 in your picture
  noice anon itll serve you well

  bark river rapes condor on xmas eve  enjoy you high grade stabber
  i was thinking about getting this any thoughts
  yeah get the cold steel one if this was some kind of bait attempt you can forget it some /out/ists have these for fun and they say these spear thingies are great i wouldnt buy one tho i dont like the design
  get the coldsteel one my bro hunts hog with his killed at least two dozen with it dogs chase down he stabs biggest one was over 250lbs
  not really bait i just saw it and thought it was funny it looks pretty good for starting fires though the sparks are shooting out of the end of the firesteel ive never had a knife that could do that
thoughts 
  the ad is pretty funny    300400    check the reviews on amazon one of his schrades got messed up they changed the grind on it or something not sure if thats the one
  check the reviews on amazon one of his schrades got messed up they changed the grind on it or something not sure if thats the one  apparently they may be a 4th run of the machetes made after that fiasco where they went back to the saber grind but then cut their losses and tossed them in a lot which was bought by a bulk buyer/seller outlet and tossed up on clearance for 28
got a muela bowie 16 on the way what am i in for boys lifetime warranty always makes me interested in products
  am i retarded for wanting to hog hunt with a gladiolus
  no youre heroic    we should meat up sometime and do it
  r8 this bar stockplastic handle combo
i was thinking about grabbing one of these
how do you define working sharp on your knife
  armilarria
  im in finland where can i buy one without having to sell some organs
  if they had a full instead of a partial tang i swear /out/ and /k/ threads would be glockified as fuck also i dont get the rarity of the black version its just shitty colored plastic i can get the muh operator factor but still
    isnt there a series of videos where someone is trying to completely destroy the glock 81 knife through a series of tests and it pretty much passes them all it is the more brutal and systematic metal testing ive seen for a knife evidently they are made of 1095 spring steel and theres a difference between the military and civilian models with the civilian model being welded at the hilt and softer on the rc scale    i dont see their form factor as all that useful outside of specific military uses
  it will very likely be the next knife i purchase if not one of the next it seems like a very good allrounder however it is a bit different fro ma traditional puukko if you want to use it primarily as a woodworking / whittling tool i would go for a strictly traditional puukko     however the guys over at bladeforums are very positive about this knife and they know their shit
    there is a video on youtube looking at the inside of the handle its a full tang with some holes cut out for the rubber handle
  it looks well built and it is a good company i prefer full tang with wood scales myself thats my only gripe for woodworking and whittling and such i recommend something from flexcut
  lionsteel makes great knives all the lionsteel knives i handled have been really highquality however the rounded spine is kind of a bummer if you dont plan to strike any fire steels with it it would be a great small hiking buddy though
  thanks anon
  thinks batoning is a legit method of splitting  can i have a version with sound i sent to hear the snideness in his voice i legit a mental woody for people literally anyone who gets their shit pushed in through experience
anybody ever make i knife out of an old file i started today just for something to do used a 4 grinder to cut the file then the same grinder to bevel the blade when i got closer to where i wanted it i moved to a belt sander i clamped down to a bench then a palm sander then finally by hand the whole time dipping in water often so as not to wreck the temper after all of this i took it to the kitchen table and on to the wet stones i can cut newspaper and shave my arm with it handle is next im into this for 0 all said and done
  did you dip when using the grinder
  yup i didnt wear gloves anytime it started to get hot to the touch i dipped it worked really well didnt lose the temper anywhere
  i had one pos could not hold an edge for shits skip it complete waste of money if youre cutting anything harder than packaging tape and i dont know if mien was extra soft or what but the edge kept rolling all over the place instead of staying sharp
  batonny chop chop is an /out/ meme fyi theres a ton of webms but that one and this one are golden
  uses an axe to hammer a knife into a block of wood    i think there might have been a better tool to split wood
benchmade hidden canyon yay or nay i love the design but hate jimping
  youd be surprised the stupidity of people
  i think these two in s30v steel are the best all around designs you can possible own they are not cheap but lack all those bells and whistles that can compromise the tool
  i appreciate the suggestion but im more looking for something extremely short and wide with a long belly like the hidden canyon ive yet to see anything like it but the hidden canyon
  you may need to make it yourself what jobs will it need to perform
  carving 99 of the time skinning scraping general outdoors tasks i neither use or like blades over 4 and honestly dont even use more than 2 of my mora i use the tip of my more and its belly more than anything else when i carve hardly the flat section
  a tall blade is more difficult to use for wood carving a blade that isnt very tall can more easily roll to scoop out sections of wood in tighter areas of the workpiece the benchmade hidden canyon wouldnt be very good for carving but since the blade is pretty tall you can more easily scrape flesh from hides with it since you can hold the blade with your fingers a full sized ulu would be perfect for skinning scraping and butchering but terrible for carving    the style of wood carving you do also determines the best knife for the job if all you do are spoons then a spoon/hook knife will be well worth the money if you are merely doing bushcraft things that normally dont have much detail nor bowls/scoops then just about any normal blade or hatchet will work if you are doing things that require details mortise  tenon scoops etc then a short blade detail carving knife or chip carving knife will be best though a simple folding pocket knife under 4 will do very well in place of the dedicated carving knife the main problem is that unless you have a well designed multiblade folding knife with all the tools needed a singleblade knife of any type wont fit all the jobs    hence the styles i recommended in     you may also want to check out these threads   
  i already own and carry a small pocketknife for detail work and im aware of the styles limitations but as i said i hardly use the flat section of my mora because personally i find it far more difficult perhaps its due to the woods i carve usually being traditionally uncarveable woods such as osage orange hickory and black locust but the flat section of most blades i use goes nigh neglected for months at a time i dont mean to be rude as im entirely aware youre trying to be nice and giving solid advice that i agree with completely but im not really new to knives and was more looking for alternative brands in a similar style to the hidden canyon    however since you do seem to know a bit about knives are you aware of any thin stock knives less than 1/8th of a 34 length with a thin grind on them big knives are in fashion these days but i hardly care for them and carry a hatchet with me at all times outside
  it is more questioning what youll be doing with it and making sure we are on the same page than actual advice the more info known the better a recommendation can be    those hardwoods are the only thing i carve on around here the harder the wood the faster it will dull the blade which is why people love balsa wood carving since you already have a knife for detail carving dislike jimping need something with a fixed blade under 4 i recommend searching for a fat knife those are all the design you are looking for but keep in mind that getting the specific style and thickness you want may be difficult you may need to buy a custom made one if you cant find a commercial one or are unable to make your own heres some examples    3175mm  0125  1/8 thick fyi    boker plus bob a bit thick at 028  ad fat fish1 custom only at 0140 thick   various   5mm/0196 thick    there are many others but most have jimping or a retarded hole in the blade thoug tht hole in the blade is meant to be a grip    pic of boker plus bob
recent kizlyar cop  machete is 65g 5960 hrc  knife is aus8 5557 hrc  did i fuck up with tanto 
  i got a cheap cold steel tanto and use that weird little point near the top a lot
  phooey looks like ill need to make my own ill probably elect to use s30v or something and send it out for third party heat treatment but thanks for the help anon i realize what im asking for is somewhat of an oddity i found something a bit better from lt wright but its still 1/8th thick might compromise on this if i have to but hopefully ill find a 100 thick knife or something soon
  did it originate from /out/
  the meme did but the videos the images and the method didnt
  i use old crosscut saw blades for material removal knife blanks the current one im sourcing is about 0046 3/64 thick when cutting it i use water to keep the metal cool so it doesnt lose its temper the same goes for grinding the edge thus no heat treating needed    you can usually find old antique saws at thrift second hand and antique stores for fairly cheap the carpentry ones like this one that are dull are usually the most common and thinnest antique circular saw blades that do not have special tips will be completely made of tool steel and are really nice for thicker knives the ones with the special tips will only have the good steal in those tips and the rest will have lower quality steel those are usually more modern
  mora eldris
  you sure as hell wouldnt be able to do that with the new sk5 model although why anyone would try to do that in the first place is a mystery to me
  gets an axe    ahhahahahha trollin
  i got tons of those lying around so i might give it a try thanks anon    eh was hoping for something in a bit fancier steel since i already got a mora
how do i be brave at night innawoods
i was always scared of the dark as a kiddie and /x/ and hollywood and a little bit of a belief in the supernatural leaves me absolutely crippled at night by the slightest noise i wish i wasnt such a pussy but it always gets me really down and raises my stress levels how can i conquer this     yuropean here so no gat or samurai sword allowed
  what are you afraid of
  alcohol
   and a 19inch axefor firewood of course
  this is it just irrational spooks best way to get over that is unironically to spook yourself silly by walking out into the woods at night without a flashlight and just sitting there for a while i honestly miss getting spooked as a kid these days the woods at night is very peaceful and pleasant
  whiskey the first few times after that man up im assuming you mean solo
  whiskey the first few times  that will work great until anon falls to a pound and has sar looking for him like the other anon alcohol doesnt make you brave makes you stupid
  pack a gun and shoot at every little sound you hear
  youll be fine anon  all the scary skinwalker and wendigos and shit are over here in america anyway  i wouldnt worry about it
  he cute
  but anon europe is packed to the brim with ghosts and vampires and trolls and cruel fae and werewolves and witches
  i wouldnt worry about it
  just a few ounces take the edge off
  srs a couple shots of vodka/whiskey in a flask a knife or hatchet and turning off your flashlight and letting your eyes adjust there is no way to get over your fear without just getting out and living through it a few times i used to have the same problem
    the scariest thing here in the us are psychos in the woods second to that are brown bears and theyre not everywhere here only in certain geographical locations
  best way to get over that is unironically to spook yourself silly by walking out into the woods at night without a flashlight    skinwalker detected  do not do this      paranormal creatures are in the states dont worry   nigga this is only the stuff germany has to offer 
  that wiki list  holy shit the germans are incredible
  frogposters post on 
  skinwalker detected  do not do this    op memes aside im trying to give you practical advice on how to overcome your fears skinwalkers arent real and besides if they were we wouldnt know how to use the internet
  get out of here skinwalker
dont bring booze just carry a knife and take reasonable precautions depending on the area i felt similarly this summer and did my first solo backpacking trip and it was amazing
  meth addicts
  take the pink pill
is the crazy meth head in the woods just a meme or does it actually happen with some frequency
  crazy people intent on harming you innawoods can happen but its not very frequent
  when i am feeling afraid alone at night i just put on my bear armor it is comfy and makes u feel brave
  this
  no way around it besides living through it i still get jumpy alone in the woods but ive learned to enjoy the adrenaline
  bring a firearm
  mom remember what i told you about those irrational fears of yours whenever i go innawoods at night    be crazy methhead / serial killer / skinwalker looking for your next victim    option a  lurk innawoods in the middle of fucking nowhere at ass o clock    option b  go some place where potential victims are easily found eg a dark back alley innacity    its a simple question of return on investment    also there is absofuckinglutely nothing innawoods at night that wasnt already there during the day    now get off 4chan mom
  ive had an encounter with one    went to visit some friends in knoxville and 3 of us decided to go car camping and drink a ton of booze in the smokeys  set up in an empty camp ground forecast said its gonna be freezing    around 9pm some nasty looking lady walks over to our campground saying she smelt some weed and wanted a hit my friend is annoyingly nice and optimistic with people so he invited her to sit with us and shared his weed  she sits down and literally says so are yall all addicted to drugs also her name is misty goes on to explain her boyfriend is in their truck somewhere that ran out of gas he spent the gas money on booze    she saw i had cigarettes and asked me to give her 4 cigarettes i gave her 2 instead we asked her to leave after a while and she did  we went to bed joking that misty and her boyfriend were going to come rob us tonight    all three of us asleep in a big tent wake up to misty inside our fucking tent feeling around for my cigarettes we all scream at her to get the fuck out and she yells back that she just needs more cigarettes i throw a couple at here and then she runs off    fuck campgrounds man
  knoxville  hey i live there east tn is overflowing with methaddled retards
  do not do this   dont listen to this anon theres no such thing as monster ghosts skinwalkers or whatever wild animals maybe but no spoopy creatures its not like we have a way to access this korean pumpkin image board to lure a fleshsnack i mean human to a grizzly death
  make sure you are tired as fuck  be me   afraid of going out because of blairwitch vids i saw when young   go stealth camping across europe because life is boring   all day on the move   set up camp in the middle of nowhere   make comfy fire   midnightish go in tent to sleep   hear spoopy forrest sounds   tired as fuck couldnt care less   sleep   wake up repeat
  caring if someone frog posts  caring   that was your first mistake
  i always liked visiting gatlinburg when i go down to tennessee seemed like a cozy town
theres nothing to be scared of in the woods anon come join u  i mean enjoy the great outdoors 
    practice like all negative experiences habituation is the king    also accustoming yourself to the dark and listening quietly to the sounds while in the dark helps you can face your anxiety better this way
im a monster thats right monsters are real im gonna creep up on you and chomp on your itty bitty tosies oogedy boogedy boo
  
put down your purse and man up son
  last year i was in scouts we had this kid who would fucking break down crying on every single outing begging to go home summer camp every night for a whole fucking week mr anooooooon weeping i was an assistant scoutmaster shouldve packed him with laxatives and ditched him on a hike leave him for the coyotes
  oh hell yeah confirm suspisions
  youre the scariest thing in the woods anon i wouldnt worry about it
  not him but my issue is that i whizz at least once a night so i have to worry about goblins in my boots and shit
  piss jugs anon
  also there is absofuckinglutely nothing innawoods at night that wasnt already there during the day  skinwalkers are watching you during the day
  unironically this specially if youre in a tent    piss jug will radiate heat that youd otherwise loose if you left the tent
    i also believe in the supernatural but it has never gotten in the way of me enjoying being /out/ at night in fact i love night time forest walks i am infinitely more concerned about getting attacked by darkies than getting attacked in the dark  you simply have to realise that the dark wilderness is a perfectly natural place for you to be your ancestors have been roaming the darkness of your lands for thousands of years with little trouble where are all these creatures weve been hearing about for millenia we are here yet where are the vampires either they werent there to begin with or we killed them     your ancestors made the land their own we are meant to be there it is as natural for the human to wander the woods as it is for the wolf and the tiger  make peace with the land around you and realise that it is you that stalks the darkness
  bears
sleep out more youll either get used to it or killed both stop you worrying about scary things in the woods
  big facts
  your ancestors have been roaming the darkness of your lands for thousands of years with little trouble   they also had spectacular death rates though
  yup thats a valid fear in the woods i hunt i mean im armed as im hunting but if they got the drop on me that could be bad luckily they dont pop up as much in the winter
  lol that misty still up to her old hijinks eh
  olmisty just wanted some cigs
  remind yourself that theres nothing there at nite that isnt there in the day time its sort of true
    t burger
    
    the scariest of them all
  ching chong ching yellow fever kun
  kek thats not even true though
  were many ghost related
  i walk my dog in a state forest after dark every day in the winter i just kept doing it until i stopped being spooked anymore
  go camping in australia we dont have bears or anything dangerous
  a take a spear  ax with me if i go reenactment camping and a machete if regular no gun cuz yurop  whisky helps a lot but the strongest drug there is is to spend a night innawoods with you gf protective instincts kick in you approach everything in a cold rational way nothing is scary anymore after that you learn thats its just your head and you can control your fear   if you dont get that id say youre a bitch beyond saving
  get a speaker then blast some music or some shit really helps dude or simply get some lads with you
  we
  thats the closest to invincibility that were gonna get as a species
  redirected from thot
  think of the fish you could catch with that worm on a hook
  rather have one of these they grow to 9 feet
    bigger is better  n00bs
    girth  length
    dont think about skinwalkers  wear earplugs and keep eyes shut tight
  i think its on a town drunk level of frequency found a lot of places in the woods that have definitely not been camped in for a week i mean where a dirty person has been squatting a lot but it was most likely all the same one or two people moving around
  whiskey
  this meeting a junkie in the woods at night is a big fear when i go
  seen squaters in the woods in every part of us ive lived in
  340 grain 44 magnum from 16 inch carbine
  go to sleep quickly and with every morning you wake up alive youll be a little less scared next time headphones and nice music helps
  as a kid i was scared of a lot of things i guess what worked for me was a mix between getting stronger lifting and bit of martial arts alongside not giving a fuck i mean i am not so attached to my life anymore i realise it is ultimately pointless anyway might as well die doing something you love yknow 
  been backpacking all throughout az for 20 some years and ive seen just about everything except crack head squatters kinda disappointing honestly
  nu uh  it makes me good at basketball
  vermont amd new hampshire have disgusting jungles near all the good fishing spots fuck you junkie im here to watch bald eagles but since you keep trying to sell me heroin i have to bring a handgun  i find nice gear in their abandoned camps though
  millions of years of genetic memory and instinct screaming at you not to be alone in the forest in the dark coupled with scary stories and other such frightening media which have become prevalent in our culture after tens of thousands of years of selection for staying the fuck out of the woods at night are probably why youre so scared if you want to overcome this id start by not being such a pussy
op i feel your pain i have the same desire to go inna woods but im spooked more of rabid animals and shit like that but in my state its illegal to carry a firearm in state parks and shit it fucking sucks we have bears and shit all the fuck over and rabid animals
  bring a friend or two oh right this is 4chan nobody here has friends
ear plugs work well i like to watch comfy youtube videos with my headphones in keeps me from worrying about whats outside the tent
      for me earplugs make me a lot more paranoid because they make me feel far less aware of my surroundings that being said im not very scared/paranoid of being innawoods without them at night to start
camping without a tent helps not being enclosed helps you rationalize more of the sounds you hear of course i once woke up to a coyote just about sniffing my head from above me but you win some you lose some
  go camping on a night with a full moon or at least within 12 days of the full moon the moon comes up right around sunset and is so bright that with nightadjusted eyes you can see for 200 yards without a flashlight
  what a pussi
  i woke up to a deer licking my back last time i did that think it was for minerals or something
never been camping in michigan before started reading up on some of the rules and pretty much everywhere says no fires outside of the designated zones can someone please give me the rundown on going out and setting up a small fire workout getting a fine the areas i have in mind are manistee national forest and the au sable river
remember to choose your kindling with smoke in mind  too green  too much white smoke  burning shit you shouldnt  black smoke
i camp off site at mi state parks all the time the dnr doesnt like people camping off trails and away from sites but as long as youre not a dumbass youll avoid trouble    basic rules apply  get familiar with the park youre going to how busy it is what areas are the most remote etc  check google earth and trail maps to find an area deep away from where people will be  pack a lightweight bag that looks like its just for a small day hike  park outside of the park and hike into it to avoid anybody raising suspicions of a car thats been sitting in their lot all day  take firewood from a wide area away from camp so it cant be tracked back to you directly  dakota fire hole so you can bury it quick if dnr comes by  keep camp size as small as possible using a hammock and rain fly hidden by brush is optimal imo  keep light usage to a minimum avoid flashlights unless necessary and keep your fire small 23 logs at a time will be more than enough  whatever isnt being used keep it packed away so you can bail and hide if people are around    its easiest to hike in closer to sundown and set up camp when its getting darker less people will be on trails you might take and itll be harder to see you deep past the treeline    dnr doesnt like damaging the area so if you can front that youre just a wandering day hiker youre more likely to be let off with a warning    if you get caught you better have a silver tongue or be ready to pay a small tresspassing fee    but to be honest their are usually few rangers out on trails actively youre more likely to get snitched out by somebody else on a hike if they catch you play your cards right and you should be fine    hope it works out op
im a michigan guy too id say as long as youre in a national forest and not right off a main road you should be fine im usually doing my camping by atlanta
  michigan guy here dont go camping right now unless you want bubba to shoot you     avoid the lp if possible huron is the best park in the lp tho   in the up the porcupines are fun as well as hiawatha and pictured rocks     if you have a snowmobile though there are fantastic winter trails and camping experiences for you i take a two week vacation riding my sled from saginaw to mackinaw every christmas great time
this board really is dying
  hey im from rural illinois and ive been seripusly thinking about moving to marquette i work remote so no worries on employment my two concerns are thr summer bugs which ive heard can ruin any outing even if you prepare for them and dating/socializing i know its a college town but im still curious how easy it would be to make friends and such
  july and august is black fly hell i dont know about the friends situation but i have a buddy that lives there
  i usually camp and hunt in the huron national forest au sable area its perfectly legal to have a fire there for recreational use cooking/warmth if you plan on burning trash or debris though then its illegal if youre still unsure you can always call the dnr
i used to camp a lot in michigan and it was amazing when i was on public land never figured out the public stuff but now im in ohio and need to figure it out
  private when i was on private land
is there a more pussy activity than ice climbing i tried it for the first time and was surprised at just how easy and underwhelming it is its way easier than regular climbing why do people do it
  beginner intro babbys first ice climb  well no shit you thought it was easy
  is there a more pussy activity than ice climbing  shitposting on 4channel
  i tried it for the first time   no you didnt
the only hard thing about ice climbing is the logistical aspect of it cold sometimes there is no ice hands hurt shitty conditions etc    the actual climbing itself is easy as piss compared to proper climbing you got two precision tools to hang off of and crampons are just a completely different ballgame which let you traverse virtually any grade and allow for much more sloppy footwork    ice climbers dont fall for a reason lol shit is a pussy activity
    you know nothing about fear until youve fallen during a serious ice climb and you have to pray the gods that the ice screws actually dont break the ice and let you fall to your death
  i had a bradley that was infront of me get launched about 50 feet into the air by an ied followed by rocket and small arms attack on the rest of us
the styrofoam ice wall at the indoor gym you went to is not ice climbing  true ice climbing involves 10f or colder temps an approach of at least a mile in 18 of snow winds strong enough to not hear your partner after the first screw and continually getting hit by ice or soaked by water   in other words every ice climb in vermont
  i would like to go down on her crevasse if you know what im saying
  were you on the ice at the time if so holy shit dude glad you made it out alive that is insane if you werent on ice then nobody gives a shit welfare queen fuck off
not exactly related to this thread but i didnt want to start a new one for something yall could quickly answer     would an ice axe be a good choice for breaking up blocks of frozen ice in specific spots i work in north dakota in the oil feild and we are constantly running into blocks of ice in spots we need to get to like small bolt holes in compressor skids there is a ton of ice in the way and hammers arent doing the job quickly enough it doesnt have to break up the whole block but just a smaller section of it
  probably not theyre designed to be light and have long handles id look at a rock hammer pic related
  hearty kek
terrorism aside do you guys respect ted kaczynski for living as he did for so long    25 years in a cabin he built in rural montana  little experience in the outdoors  no electricity  no running water  lived on under 500 a year  produced a lot of different foods on just over 14 acres of land
just want to get this out of the way before the inevitable ensuing shitflinging  ted sent mail bombs to random people because he knew it would allow him to put pressure on the press to publish his manifesto thats all he didnt do it because hes a homicidal maniac he did it because he wanted to get his word out with a bang
  he didnt target random people although his bombs did injure random people quite often     
  shutup it was random in the sense that there was no distinction between any of the people the mail was directed to which he did purposely
  a timber industry executive a college professor praising technology etc these werent random
  it was random in the sense that there was no distinction between any of the people the mail was directed to  why do you think nobody in the entire fucking government could figure out any semblance of an identity to him
  because hed dropped out of society at the age of 27 and had barely talked to a single person during his academic years preceding that plus he invested a hell of a lot of time in purchasing various disguises consciously misled investigators by using fake initials on the bombs etc i mean this was the 70s/80s the zodiac killer and plenty of other people got away with a lot
i sincerely suggest reading his manifesto to those who havent yet it is probably the single most /out/ piece of writing composed in modern times
  its an interesting read but   the single most /out/ piece of writing composed in modern times  lol no
    great survivalist his mind got fucked up by government experimentations sad thing
  his mind got fucked up by government experimentations  no it wasnt and by claiming otherwise youre discrediting his ideas as the ramblings of a brainwashed mad man
    this blaming mk ultra is lazy and dishonest he acknowledged the theory in one of his letters and said it is almost wholly without merit and that he held his core ideas on society even before he entered harvard
  hes a lunatic and a coward who blew up people in anonymity he disagreed with and his work wasnt good enough to get published on its own merits
  his work wasnt good enough to get published on its own merits    whats your address
  best piece of political writing in general    i see more and more people waking up to the ted pill these days  after a while you begin to seriously question the root cause of the problems in society thats basically what isaif is in long form
  they werent random you dont konw what youre talking about  op question  yes
we need to kill all the niggers first  then we can give up technology
  yes but his cabin was shit
  ted is a lot of things but comfy is not one of them
  how does a prodigy mathematician not realize that a series of several bombings in the span of 20 years would generate nearly an enough of a deterrent for society to abandon technology and nature exploitation as a whole was it autism literally any other better way to fight this even starting a cult if you have to if he wasnt a delusional maniac then he was just waste of good genes
      im not saying that it was the sole influence of the mkultra experience which caused him to go ballistic but it was surely a factor    the thing with psychological manipulation is that you cant retroactively distinguish external thoughts from your own is a very perverse mechanism    his ideas were nothing new by the way still was a good minimalist
  terrorism aside  where do you think we are the terrorism makes him extra based
    during his trial his prosecutors attacked his cabin as being evidence of his mental illness due to how dark it was and the fact that it was offgrid they said it was more like a kid building a treehouse iirc
he was right every day i fantasize about living far away from this shit hole and being free of civilization rotting my mind
    learned about the experiments he was subjected to  sent him over the deep end
  ted shitsinabucket kazinsky
  did read that and i agree  technology along with agriculture is the source of our problems  it wouldnt be that bad if governments were serious with space programs so we could send people to live on other planets but no welfare is more important
  gotta admit a shelter made out of sticks would look better but ted wasnt a builder
  his mind got fucked by an sm freak with a degree in psychology and good funding to do what he wanted to do it is pretty sad actually      he acknowledged the theory in one of his letters and said it is almost wholly without merit    hes still not healed from that shit it certainly sent him down the dark road it has nothing to do with his preestablished core beliefs in regard to what he ended up doing he may still have wrote his manifesto but it would be in a different manner and hed most likely never had done the bombings
  technology along with agriculture is the source of our problems    it is how it is used that is the problem people are just as always
  he directly states that the bombings were only a means to get his manifesto published
  it is probably the single most /out/ piece of writing composed in modern times  confirmed to have never read linkolas could life prevail
  i respect him his writings his doctorate and all his visions
  by decimating its woodlands finland has created the grounds for prosperity we can now thank prosperity for bringing us  among other things  two million cars millions of glaring greyblack electronic entertainment boxes and many unnecessary buildings to cover the green earth wealth and surplus money have led to financial gambling and rampant social injustice whereby the common people end up contributing to the construction of golf courses classy hotels and holiday resorts while fattening swiss bank accounts besides the people of wealthy countries are the most frustrated unemployed unhappy suicidal sedentary worthless and aimless people in history what a miserable exchange  rampant social injustice  common people end up contributing to the construction of golf courses classy hotels and holiday resorts while fattening swiss bank accounts  im curious about this book anon but give it to me straight is this guy a faggot communist at least with uncle ted there are none of those concerns
  true environmentalism is inherently anticapitalist in nature but that doesnt necessitate some kind of socialist worldview in response especially considering communist/socialist nations have been extremely environmentally destructive in their quest for industrialization and full employment
  his ideas were nothing new by the way  got any recommendations in terms of literature
  jacques ellul the technological society  edward abbey the monkeywrench gang  christopher lasch the culture of narcissism and the true and only heaven progress and its critics  most of wendell berrys nonfiction writings    thats just off the top of my head all writing before teds manifesto was published
  capitalism doesnt have to be industrial
  is this guy a faggot communist  no he is the most redpilled man on earth
  ive read ellul theres certainly some overlap but ellul was a rabid christcuck pacifist who abhored violence while kaczynski in his theory of selfpropagating systems explicitly describes how and why the system suppresses violence if you oppose all kinds of violence on an ideological level and think you can change society through voting and protesting you have been mindfucked by the system nonviolence is never a real rebellion       the biggest difference between linkola and kaczynski is in the reason why they oppose technology linkola doesnt give much of a shit about humans he just wants to preserve trees and bears and shit and keep humans on a tight leash or outright kill them all if needed hes also a hardliner malthusian  kaczynski meanwhile is humancentric he wants to save and preserve humanity kaczynski postulates that technology turned us into drones slaves npcs destroyed our entire psychology and robbed us of our free will and mental autonomy the only way to save ourselves therefore is to ditch industrial technology forever      what do you mean by this capitalism is simply a system built on wage labor private profit and trade you dont need general motors and google in order to create a capitalist society
  no i dont because he was never selfsufficient he relied on money from his parents to survive out in the woods
  lol no he constantly complains about bolsheviks and social democrats destroying the old gentry and giving political power to uncivilized riff raff who have no idea what to do with it
you do know he is related to kaczyński brothers right  two anticommunist  antiliberal politicans who dedicated their entire lives to fighting the system  the mainstream media masonery leftists hate them with a passion  well him  russians managed to kill one
  capitalism is simply a system built on wage labor private profit and trade you dont need general motors and google in order to create a capitalist society  industrialization is the natural progression of capitalism when big companies are competing its their incentive to industrialize in order to meet increasing demand   if you try to counteract this with regulation it isnt really capitalism anymore
  no
  no  t an argument
  communism is dumb but the only thing marx was right about is that socioeconomic superstructure mirrors the material base so capitalism exists because of industrialization not the other way around
  capitalism didnt exist before industrialization  wrong
i guess that really takes some tedication
  hes probably right if you consider the production of trade goods as industry and the ownership of other peoples goods and labor as finance and the practice of investing owned trade goods in the venture of another with expectations of profit as capitalism    money itself is a concept that lends itself to capitalism wherever money existed there had to first be industry and it likely immediately resulted in the development of capitalism    yes this predates modern industrialization but thats an arbitrary distinction ancient babylonians and chinese and native americans that invented money did so because they first developed industries that produced goods and labor for trade this is industry just not what we think of as modern industry
  real talk how did he afford the land/cabin  did he have a job
  technology along with agriculture is the source of our problems  and if we were hunter/gatherers wed have different problems and if we were space faring wed have a third different set of problems  life is problems solving one set creates a different set there is no utopia
  yeah even the terrorism
  he was an accomplished mathematician and was a professor of maths until he went innawoods
  so he took a bunch of money he saved up and bought the cheapest land he could find  using as little money as possible for the rest
    capitalism is more than industry though it implies free job market and spending stuff that did not exist in many countries where family tradition castes and guilds were restricting the job market severely also a lot of manipulation of the market was taking place with monarchy and influential aristocracy meddling in economic matters just because there was money and a certain degree of industry i wouldnt equate it with modern capitalism
more than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas  
  i was just talking to my aunt and grandmother about this they had a friend who recently passed away he spent most his free time making detailed notes on the flora and fauna around him and had noticed a marked decline in the general insect life
  nope this past year has had more insects than ever before in my entire life time it was quite amazing actually and everyone was talking about it we blame it on the mild winters weve had the past few years we even have insects that are not here normally from warmer climates to the south winter normally keeps them in check
  do you live in an area with very little agriculture by any chance asking since pesticides are topping the list of possible causes
  ive noticed a mild decrease in mosquitos and increase in burrowing hate wasps  also not nearly as many yellow jackets but i dont really try to seek those out either
  nope  japanese beetles in literal record numbers despite the state and county spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to kill them  more ants bees and hornets than any other point in my memory  fire ants have expanded into my area for the first time in history and are so far coexisting with native species  clouds of mosquitoes so dense they actually cast shadows  mayfly hatch set a 100 year record  first time in recorded history all 3 variants of cicada hatched in the same year 7years a year early  emerald ash borer at epidemic levels  corn borers at pandemic levels  jap beetles were so bad this year the county was having to use their snowplows a couple times a week to get enough of the dead ones off the highway you could see the lines snowplows to remove all the dead insects    heart of the midwestern cropland too
germany here can confirm wildlife birds already suffers noticeably
  interesting got a source on that
  beetles  snow plow  bullshit its probably all bullshit but i dont know who you though youd get with that
  confirmation bias
  if by insects you mean the quality of this board then yes  i have never seen so many threads getting deleted for no good reason
  i hope so arthropods need to go
  this is just another  its cold out so climate change isnt real  type argument the fact that these types of bugs are becoming more present indicates that other species of insects are being pushed out by competition try to think a lil deeper sweetie
  have you noticed  total biomass not unique species  are you being a patronizing dickish retard on purpose or does it just come naturally
  finland here different people noticed a dramatic decline of bugs number in their opinion due to super hot summer birds reported suffering lack of food
  correct except that im farming though i only use water and compost on my crops and fields everyone else uses lime on hay fields but nothing else it seems theres actually more farming now in this area in the past 10 years than in the past 100 years
  i havent seen a butterfly or a ladybird in years
    not really    ive noticed less bees but the rest are around as much as ever
i cant fucking wait for all the blackflies to die
i remember distinctively as a kid seeing mosquitos butterflies dragonflies bumblebees wasps etc fucking everywhere now i very seldom see them     but i chock that up to me growing up in alaska and florida and now living in a desert alaskas state bird is the mosquito after all
  im from pic related and still too many of the cunts   i remember in highschool every classroom would have 200400 flies orbiting in a swarm in every room was pretty normal
nope theyre everywhere
  everyone in my hiking group uses pic related to deal with bugs from yosemite to the white mountainsi spray every insect colony/nest/hill with this shit and it makes sure none of them fuck with me ever again
  since this is anecdotal evidence the thread i guess i should mention that i drive 1hr to and from work daily countryside i dont even bother washing my car as frequently anymore because i hit so many of the fuckers    this fall has been particularly beautiful though lots of butterflies around lots made me pretty sad having to plow through clouds of them every day

  im terrible at remembering to add the pic
  to my best knowledge that would be a ground mat either regualar closedcell foam or inflatable but insulated combined with a down sleeping bag and a tarp a good idea is to look at what the ultralight heads are using since theyre autistic about this    learn to set the tarp right and in different conditions like using trees and with poles for when in the open also learn to set it very snug so you keep the wind out buy a light tarp and maybe consider a small ground tarp as well

    you dont deserve to be on /out/
  i own multiple wool jackets an shirts  worn them alot over the many years for work play adventuring etc  i still appreciate wool clothing for what it is and what it was but today modern blend fabrics far outperform in any active outdoor physical activity  wool is fashion wear or fudd meme larping
      assuming all /out/ is hiking    i use swanndri wool jackets for forestry work because no modern fabric does the job as well polyester fleece melts when working near fires burning brush goretex rips and abrades easily and doesnt breath as well as well as wool wore my swanndri 2 years now in scotland west coast and never been soaked once they have a special water resistant treatment   wool is also noiseless when moving making it good for hunters  i have goretex  synthetics for hiking much lighter and insulating but for real hard wear wool is supreme  larpers do ruin everything they touch though
  ok yes in some situations wool has some superiority   i guess for my types of outdoor activity my wool clothing is not as good as modern synthetics but for me alot of that is because the classic styling of wool garments generally is more restrictive to range of motion than modern clothing made of modern blended fabrics and always way heavier bulkier
  wear an undershirt like everyone else you know how in old black and white movies all the guys have those white undershirts thats because all their outerwear was itchy in some way and the proliferation of softer fabrics for outer wear wasnt much of a thing yet
  the pants that go with these are amazing /out/ pants cleaned out one retailer of his 3 pairs a few years ago best 70 dollars spent in a while

  if they had done a nz mosgiel i definitely would have copped

  post outrelated stuff  posts diy home stuff instead    /out/  outdoors
  what would the control box do is that a real device seems like it would be the most essential part since its tapping the grid as well as the alternative energy sources and somehow making it all available presumably as a normal stream to the rest of the house

  this is pure fantasy not 1 in 10000 could make this happen the amount of knowledge and firsthand experience necessary already excludes 99 of the population even if you have the experience having the available land equipment etc is even less likely again its fantasy    when someone actually does make this happen feel free to post the example i wont hold my breath though
      where are these from

  i thought you should carry heavy things at the bottom and lighter things at the top so you dont get a hunch in your back   nice list of stuff to bring though

  that pretty good everybody wont go to the countryside
  thanks i couldnt find the book
    skinning a salmon
  dunno ask the chinese or germans or japanese or pretty much anyone who isnt clappistani
  what is this shit  the agriculture part feels like written by someone who never in their life ws doing any farm work at all winnowing with wind is this guy insane a fucking frame winnowing machine can be build by anyone who knows how to use nails and planks cuts the workload from hours to minutes and has absurd efficiency  if rest of this book is so bad then it was written by complete moron
  its not that hard plants are pretty easy to maintain you are being bitter for no good reason
  how to fish for sharks
  the guy who wrote it was a part hippy part dreamer and part weirdo he was obsessed with no machines concept to truly bizzare extent while in the same time proposing highmaintenance solutions to running your stead not even amish go full retarded like his ideal farm      living from a single acre of land  not that hard  anon word hard doesnt even cut it this is one of those times when metric wins ironically you are unlikely to own less than one hectare which is still absurdly small for farmland as this is considered basic unit for land that is used for agriculture which is 25 acres  and while living off a single hectare is something anyone with right tools and bit of training can pull regardless of circumstances the one acre will fuck you sideways just by having poor soil regardless of your effort  selfsustainability below 4 hectares or 10 acres is a fucking gamble that can easily blow in your face even with best intentions and management practices plus you will never be truly selfsustained anyway as you still need tools replacement parts and all the stuff that wont magically show in your tiny piece of land
  lets make a rundown of that picture shall we  page 13  1/10th of an acre is the size of a fucking allotment garden you are not going to feed anyone from such small piece of land especially when tun in such absurd way  half an acre  godawful land usage along with retarded pasture 1/8th of acre good luck feeding cows from it for highmaintenance animal pretty picture by someone who buys all the food in the shop and keeps a garden to have fresh groceries to a sunday soup  the infamout one acre holding  everyone knows saymour was a retard living off the money he earned on his book for armchair gardeners dreaming about escaping to the pure pristine rural area rather than actual farming and his crown project is epitome of poor management and daydreaming cows pigs chickens without any good fodder planted all that fed from singe acre but no goats no rabbits no realistic orchard  yeah how about no    the sad part about most of those make your own selfreliable homestead guidebooks is that they are sold to people who will never move to such place anyway but in the same time have no clue about any of the subjects so they eagerly buy all that shit and daydreaming  realistically you should divide your land into four parts keep a single goat female plant one part with potatoes one with corn and beans and one for vegetables the remaining part along with outlines of remaining ones should have fruit trees and/or shrubs as many as only feasible just remember to protect the bark from your goat every other solution will starve you but thats not romantic nor nice looking so why bother right    tldr im sick of faggots who think farming is some romantic adventure rather than hard labour
  tldr im sick of faggots who think farming is some romantic adventure rather than hard labour  what if i think its both because its working for yourself    t landscaper
  there is nothing romantic in sweating like a pig from labour for entire day long every day just to get by and the less land you have ironically the more work you need to put into it because any inefficiency will lead to massive drop of productivity
  just like im currently doing  except a farm would be working for myself
    thank you anon
    what am i looking at here seems like a bunch of stuff mixed together
      youre nothing but a weak defeatist honestly people like you need to shut their traps and let people who want to put the work in without having to listen to your constant bitching neck yourself you pathetic worm
bump for interest
  iam german
  not that anon but theres a big difference between being defeatist and realist no amount of well wishing is going to tide you over with such tight constraints and if you follow that plan to the letter youll be as successful as someone trying to treat hydrocephaly with bob becks brain tuner
  i mean collecting your own solar power solar hot water and your own rainwater is fucking common as fuck here everybody does it   maybe you should just git gud
    home farm is the name of the book super fucking comfy
    everyone knows saymour was a retard living off the money he earned on his book for armchair gardeners dreaming about escaping to the pure pristine rural area rather than actual farming   that last picture was also published in pic related it contains knowledge ranging from drilling wells assessing soil quality maintaining herd animals dressing down pigs building log cabins etc on minimal resources it literally contains everything you need to know before starting a small farm minus legal kerfuffle like water rights
  having poor soil  lol you know you can make the soil better
  chickens maybe
i like this kind of threads
wife is using laptop will add to thread when she gets off
good enough for now lets see if anyone has anything to contribute
  my dad always says that this doesnt work he grows more stuff than me so i never questioned it i would love to see an actual grow with measured results
  dope content
    yeah i am skeptical as well about it if i ever get around to trying it i will post results
    for you sir  
  nice
  what book is this
  john seymour  the selfsufficient life and how to live it
  sounds nice but not so nice in reality  in finland there is less than 5 primeval forest left forest industry is massive and the past few years cutting has only been accelerating  also draining the swamps
  i just want a small shed/cabin in the woods even a tent would be fine til winter then itd have to get thick tarps around the tent kind of like the hermit that got arrested a few years back id just setup in a place where no one goes i could sneakily setup on my relatives land if i flat out asked them theyd say i should just get a better job yada yada but if they stumbled on it they would be like okay fine
  hey i listened to that interview some years ago while my electricity was out  interesting stuff
  the industry  oh yeah the one that designed manufactured all of the technology you have to buy to do this not sure why you think businesses would not want you to do this and allow you to do this what do they have some sort of power over you christ commies are retarded
   and minus mentioning the realistic amount of land you need to live off your own property using those techniques as described  my personal favourite is seymours disdain for motordriven farming equipment when listing flaws of them he loves to point out they can be good for 10 years if you are lucky while praising farm animals and listing their lifespan as half of that this not only is stupid assesment that is simply selling agenda rather than facts but it also speaks volumes about british engineering once more with a tractor surviving 10 years if you are lucky      turkeys if you dont have water nearby/on spot geese if you do      not that anon but there is only this much you can do with having a sandy soil regardless if using all natural or anything goes techniques it would take literal centuries to change that unless you simply plan to steal the soil from somewhere else and it also takes money regardless of technique used and you cant exactly farm on that land it just collects compost and organic material at best working as pasture which in case of tinyass land holding means you are fucked  but how could you know or care if your experience with farming boils down to reading makebelieve bullshit
    whats really upsetting is theres like 4 or 5 groups that are trying to buy land just for the purpose of doing exactly that you want to do     i wish at least one of them would pull through and actually do it im in a group thats trying to buy this land  but so far its going about as well as the other operations
    im quite tempted by the very far southern alaskan land its a similar climate to coastal bc which rarely freezes you can get land there that you dont even have to pay property taxes on    
  the land were looking at is 38 acres for 41 k and its lakeside with a small creek nearby also ins about 50 or 60 miles from anchorage   what we want to do is get about 10 people we already have 4 to pitch in and buy the property in june 2019 i and the other main person are going to inspect the property in march we really want to build a small community theyre but were only in the starting stages but we hope to move quickly forward in getting and improving the property
  does this work with other kinds of beer can
  any soda can will work
    theyre all basically the same i remember somebody told me pepsi ones were better than coke ones but i honestly doubt it
what happened to that guy that had the file with thousands of well organized infographics on it    he used to post the link here
  you can make a methane generator out of the septic tank
          tfw cant find downloads for any of these 3 books          that infographic leaves out the fact that you need to use indeterminate cultivars of potatoes most people grow determinate cultivars of potatoes which will not work with that system indeterminate cultivars will keep growing into really long vines and have potatoes all along them similar to indeterminate tomato vines the determinate cultivars stop growing and remain only about lowshrub height if you use indeterminate cultivars the infographic method will work to a certain degree    keep in mind that indeterminate cultivars have a much longer growing season than determinate cultivars which is why most people grow determinate cultivars instead i can get two crops of determinate cultivar potatoes in 1 growing season but cant even get 1 full crop of indeterminates if you live someplace in the south where it is warm and you have 170 days growing season then give that method a try there are short season indeterminates but they dont work well for that method of tower gardening it is both a long growing season and longseason indeterminate cultivar that make it work
  this infographic leaves out things like the fact that the temperature of the digester needs to be maintained around 37c55c for best microbial action and biogas methane production a properly designed system will have 2 heating fuel sources 1 will be from a 3rd party and used only as the beginning heat and later for backup after the biogas methane is up and running you switch the fuel for heating it over to the methane it is producing the nice part is that these systems are so efficient in producing methane that you can divert some for heating the system and have plenty left over for you own heating/cooking/energy generation needs    the biggest downside is the hydrogen sulfide h2s in the biogas methane it corrodes everything rather quickly and needs to be scrubbed out of the system before the gas is used the desulfurizer unit shown in that image will need to have material changed out all the time biogas methane is also high in co2 and water vapor that uses 2 more filters heres the basic materials used for diy filtering of the 3 things that need removed if you wish to keep your system from corroding and clogging    contaminant filter material general price/lbs    h2s iron powder 12/lbs  co2 calcium hydroxide 100/50lbs   h20 calcium chloride 10/40lbs winter ice melt    i also must say that intank pumps to pump the sewage out of the septic tank are mostly terrible and expensive the switches on mine last only about 1 year before needing to pull the pump and replace the switch or they will stay turned on and burn out i had to replace 6 switches and 2 pumps in 8 years if you can design your system so everything flows downhill on via gravity if you house is on an incline/hill then it is perfect for that
  there was once an entire website someone on here was maintaining many years ago it had tons of infographics on it too bad 90 of infographics have terrible or incomplete information
  as long as it is aluminium and not steel you are fine
      just make another pan holder the one in that image is fucking terrible lol it slow shouldnt be so far away from the flame the pan can be as close as possible so long as theres enough air flow to the fuel

  thats not butchering a deer   thats how to properly cape it out so the taxidermist can make a shoulder mount
   and minus mentioning the realistic amount of land you need to live off your own property using those techniques as described  it does though many of the examples given in the book have accompanying maps which detail proper use of land management and how to organize space on small farm plots which is where that illustration was used
  i always find it kind of bad when people refer to pests i just want to say that everything has its place and the best way to control pest in a garden is wait and let nature take care of it everythingmostly has a predator or if its weed they do have uses fix nitrates on soil etc

  what is this van used for
  whats the deal with north dakota montana and the nebraska/wyoming/colorado border are they oil or something
  absolute brainelt here can someone redpill me on those solar pannels  realistically how much energy can i get from them and only them can i use my energi like in a regular homemeaning have my computer/tv turneed on almsot whole day have all the lights on whole evening cook or at least use microweave and other electric kitchen machines maybe even have an electric boiler to heat water etc or do i have to micromanage all my electricity use and be always worried when if my batteries will die out if i plug my phone to charge
  you hook them up to a battery the panels recharge the battery whenever theres sun out and you hook up electronics to the battery   the only real thing it should be used for is electronics for internet connection or entertainment purposes like tv or whatever   lights should be replaced with candles and oil lamps   cooking should be done on a wood stove   but yeah if you drop a couple thousand on some solar panels and a nice rechargeable battery system you can run quite a bit on nothing but solar panels   building a well placed water wheel shed over a creek with some gear cogs and a dynamo will generate decent electricity as well   you just need to set up the gear cogs so the big wheel turns a tiny wheel really fast like the same principle on a bike with multiple gears   it will eventually charge the whole battery and your battery size will determine how much you can use   but the point is to use as little as possible
  nuke silos
  lights should be replaced with candles and oil lamps   cooking should be done on a wood stove  wrong

  this is how most of america lived prior to wwll my grandparents lived like this until they got too old to do the work they lived the great depression and stayed on the farm til the mid 1970s tho that 5 acre plot might have taken most of a lifetime to pull together dreams are easy to dream but hard to put together in real life
  angry conservative here its more that we think that its not practical for large scale industry due to sheer size costs and consistency of power output than it doesnt work it only provides power half the day so we need something to store power thats not practical for powering something like a city whereas a van that youre not constantly running everything in should be fine nuclear power would be a much better option for low carbon output energy sources but the public is terrified of it due to bad education on the matter much like they are of genetic engineering

so /out/ redpill me on skiing / snowboarding is it actually a fun/ worthwhile activity to invest in i typically hate the cold michigan so 1030 degree f winter i have maybe one or two sets of friends who ski but they dont talk much about it lately most of our winters have sucked in regards to actual snowfall / snow accumulation exactly why im one of the only of my group who doesnt own / never driven a snowmobile but i want to get into more outdoor activities and hopefully dont want to invest a shitload of money    i have yet to be invited but if its anything like rollerblading or skateboarding i know ill suck as im a bigger person and have never ever felt comfortable on them over a few years of trying
  im one of the only of my group who doesnt own / never driven a snowmobile  you should do something about that
  in my neck of the woods thumb area i get very little actual accumulation and from what ive heard you usually need to have several inches down for a snowmobile to properly function / not tear it up also i work all the time and all of my money goes to keeping a roof over my head / taking care of my parents so i have extremely little play money
  its ironic that the pollution byproduct from manufacturing solar panels would negate any positive benefit they might have in terms of energy output and environmental conservation

there is nothing out there /out/ i started hiking and exploring in the early 2000s because i wanted to find cryptids i have been too every famously paranormal forest or in america and have never seen anything that i couldnt identify as a known species i have started to lose my interest in hiking as my motivation for going on all my hikes was trying to find cryptids   is there nothing left to find /out/ how do you guys keep up your motivation
welcome to being an adult quit your fag shit and enjoy the actual animals all of which are fascinating or the beautiful scenery thats different every day nature is always changing its different every time you step out the door and take the time to notice it theres endless things to see and do youve got x amount of days do you want to spend them indoors looking at a screen or outdoors actually living
  /thread    theres a ton of reasons to go /out/ but mainly for me  experiencing and living in nature before its destroyed  living the timeless struggle between man and nature and testing yourself to better withstand any condition  having some quiet from society and fucking off for a while  having the chance to feel accomplished from what you make and do  not wasting your life working towards/in a dead end job and retiring when youre past your prime  if you go deep enough its basically an anarchists paradise and you can do just about whatever you want    cryptids are a childish fantasy thats fun to dream about when youre /out/ at night but chasing things that dont exist is a waste of a life

hi    this winter ive decided to break from my snowmobile suit to something a bit more suited for mobility ive got myself a picrelated anorak a sweet traditional pair of mukluks and im busting out my old snowshoes  and i have no idea what to wear for pants    ive been in a snowmobile suit or a bib for so long i honestly dont even know what kind of winter outerwear you wear under mukluks or an anorak are thin shell pants really enough to stay warm any other snowshoers have any suggestions
youre going to die and with your plain white anorak nobodys going to find your corpse until the snow melts
  just get some surplus wool pants
  seconding this i wear swedish m3958 pants with two sets of long johns under in 30c you can brush snow off them easily and they dry fairly quick if you cant get swedish ones ive heard good things about the swiss pants
no tent thread    im running out of time for these sales looking for my first backpacking tent is the kelty tn2 really a great light durable tent for 150 40 off right now from 250     heres some specs   sil nylon stargazing fly with pu coating  nylon floor with pu coating  noseeum mesh walls  taped seams on floor and fly  dac pressfit poles with clips and jakes foot attachment  two doors two vestibules  2person capacity  4 lb trail weight  manufacturer warranty lifetime
  only 124 at ruggedoutdoorscom either way seems pretty fucking good around that pricepoint
  i bought this on amazon for like 70 im 6 feet tall and i barely fit in it wouldnt fit with any bags inside unless a small pack i flew it to north west territories it weighs nothing it remained pretty dry during a heavy rainstorm one night but when it got a bit chilly and windy i was cold but probably a shit sleeping bag
ive heard the hubba hubba 2 nx or whatever is supposed to be the best 3 season tent 4 season is hilleberg because reasons i just got an old rei half dome that tries to take my goddamn eye out every time i assemble it
  im looking at this thing now and the only problem people have with it is the thin floor in rain obviously if i had the money i would
  kelty salida 2 is better than tn2 if youre going solo you lose a door but save half a pound in weight  its also 100 cheaper than tn2 msrp
  op pic  are you a time traveler from 1995
  the versatility of a second door is worth a half a pound imo and worth a hundred bucks desu
im looking for the lightest 2 person freestanding 2 door tent with a minimum of a 30d floor preferably a 40d floor so far i have  msr hubba hubba nx  marmot tungsten ul  nemo dagger  anyone here know of any contenders im missing
  big agnes fly creek      lunar solo  184  16 lbs        the fuck do you need a second door for you can only use one at a time
  big agnes fly creek  not completely freestanding only 1 door and 15d floor  the fuck do you need a second door for you can only use one at a time  because im not a 4ever alone and i often go backpacking with other people
  it is not possible for multiple people to pass through a single door  giving a shit about the floor denier  ah ok nm then
  its possible but its not convenient and if i did all my camping on grass i wouldnt but i spend most of my time /out/ on coarse granite gravel so i do you can buy whatever you want but those are the things im looking for
  15d floor  youll want to be bringing a light ground cloth with you if its a nice tent tyvek or polycryo    anyone interested in tarps
  read the whole post chain thats exactly why i want a 30 floor i dont want to carry a groundsheet
  youll genuinely be struggling manufacturers know how important weight is to customers and the easiest way to save weight is to use thinner floor materials and force the consumer to carry a ground cloth but it all works out the same why are you so adverse to carrying a ground cloth they are cheap light and pack small also way easier and cheaper to replace than the floor of your tent
  like you said the weight will end up the same its less shit overall to carry and anything thats going to ruin a groundsheet is going to ruin the floor too anyways so why bother
  not that anon but it seems like a forced commodity just to be the lightest tent while forcing the customer to purchase a foot print this is why i bought a marmot tungston 2
  anything thats going to ruin a groundsheet is going to ruin the floor too anyways so why bother  not necessarily plus its more about protecting the tent for from the accumulated abrasion even just using a thin sheet of window insulation film will make your tent for last longer plus it keeps everything clean tbh even if my shelters had a thicker floor id still use a ground cloth    purchase a foot print  you can tyvek free from construction sites or you can buy a massive roll of painters drop cloth from home depot for next to nothing
  i know i have a piece of tyvek i use when i bring just my inflatable pad and my sleeping bag but thats immaterial in this context i dont want to carry a groundsheet for a tent period i dont care if other people do but thats a deal breaker for me
  what if i nix the floor requirement and look for the best/cheapest option
  how is it not freestanding
  you can do what you want and if you find something great ill be appreciative but im not going to even consider a tent with a 20 or 15d floor    it stands up on its own but you have to stake out the corners by the feet to get the full volume
  tarps  this ideal for a budget lighter more space and normally more dry because of ventilation    tarp bivvy foam roll no ground cloth   put the 100 you save into a better bag
  nothing wrong with a half dome love mine
can anyone fill me in on swags living in aus now was told to just buy a swag instead of a canvas teepee type deal and save cash
  true that its my set up in the picture dont forget you can bling your tarp set up by buying snazzy cuben gear
  the best floor is no floor at all consider seek outsixe or kifaru
  car camping is the norm for piss head aussies a swag means theres not set up time involved if its pissing with rain youll still need a tarp or tent nothing worse than a soaking wet swag where in orstralia are you anon
just ordered an mld duomid a lot of setups show it being lifted slightly off the ground which looks great for airflow but does anybody know how it would be in cold/windy environments
  i use the solomid a lot and always pitch the corners right down to the ground the back has a slight eyebrow in which can be pitched closer or further to/from ground depending on the conditions the mld mids are fantastic in the wind my solomid is my high wind shelter rather than pitching the shelter higher off the ground when its hot just open the doors you can even half roll them up for increased ventilation but keeping rain protection    i cut all the line locks off mine seeing as i always pitch the corners low
  heres the door half open for ventilation and rain protection
  hold the phone wheres the pole in that image
  tarp anons get by just fine with much more ground clearance you just use your pack to block the wind perhaps consider a light bivvy if thats not enough    dont camp in a dip in the ground
  skyhook nigga
can recommend this one pretty solid even handles a bit of snow
2 lb 11 oz  55  seriously considering giving it a try at that price  
  nice find their return policy probably makes that a nolose situation come back and give a review when you get it
  if they had a 2 person version around 375 lbs and 70 i would in a heartbeat but i dont have much use for a 1 person tent which is why im hesitant
free standing tents suck too much weight six moon designs lunar solo or bust would get a mld but their shit is so fucking ridiculously overpriced fuck em
    i have the tn2well at least its become a backup tent too heavy for backpacking but great for car camping my main tent is now a nemo hornet 2p the tn2 is a good tent i wish it didnt have those little plastic windows though thats really the only thing i didnt like about it
  oh
  t never camps on anything but soft forest floor  come on up to above the treeline in the high sierra and ill show you why i only buy freestanding tents
  t someone who cant pitch a shelter right
sorry to ask a question im sure comes up heaps but can someone point me in the direction of a cheap camping hammock that doesnt suck ass im not going to use a tent over layer or a sleeping bag because where i live its hot at night and never rains just want to stay off the ground please  thank you
buy a marmot 2p for dirt cheap of backcountry edge lords   413oz   just too large to solo  return it  ask them to price match moose jaw for a msr huba nx   no problem   great custo services   keep an eye out for the asshole in the huba nx this year boys and girls
  413oz
13  brand somechinkshit  bought in a hurry few years back cause i had a sudden trip used 5 times  i expected it to be a singleuse item but its actually pretty decent  survived rains and a strong storm light easy to set up and dismantle fabric is reinforced  waterproof    downsides the rubber strings holding the little roof over ventilation top got rotten with time had to saw in two extra tention loops pn the back because in the heavy rain it would get floppy and let the water in through the seam the zipper dick broke off thats it  is that the propper word i mean when rubber turns to plastic and breaks of
whats a good poorfag tent i was looking at a coleman sundome never camped but i was thinking of taking the kayak and fucking off to an island in the pond at the state park or wherever to try and avoid normalfags  would prefer solid dark colors for larp but fires arent really subtle though
  this or the kelty 1p for 100
  i just fucking posted one above your comment  maybe you should have asked whats a good retard tent the answer would be  coffin
  have you seen the polish military ponchos  they arent fancy and theyre kinda heavy but it will last you decades if you care for it well and itll cost you like 40 plus a small tarp to be your floor
  you need two to make a tent and the common sizes 1  2 are kinda small nr3 is harder to find and more expensive also this guy is obviously retarded
  40 is the price of two  im not sure what size i have but im 62 and i fit fine  can even get my desert walker cot in it
i know true /out/ists only start fires using flaming farts  blazing spits but hey not everyone can be hardcore    as we all know most of those lifehack  tricks vids are retarded but i wanted to try out this thing i saw in one of them     its a wd40 soaked wool locked in a kinder surprise container are those really banned in usa    i started a fire using one on the weekend it worked surprisingly well   but i wanted to make sure the liquid doesnt evaporate overtime wasnt sure about how well the seal holds so i tested it again today 3 days after making one    again the flame was yellow very strong too lasted for 6 minutes despite bad environment windage 28km/h temp 6c     the thing burned completely leaving almost no trace like esbit tablets  i will definitely use them again   they do take some space but are very light also i think it burned for so long because its not 100 cotton wool but a viscosecotton mix synthetic fabric probably burns longer than natural      my mum wont let me
so em yea i thought it might be useful for some anons   yall have a noice day
are those really banned in usa  no
  damn you massmedia you lied to me again
i would imagine the only thing that burned here really was the plastic do a test of the kinderegg thiing and wool with no wd40
heres the true survival protip if youre going out take a lighter its instant fire they tend to be waterproof theyre good until you run out of fuel when you run out of fuel theyre still a spark device
  adding if youre going out and theres even the potential of ending up stuck in the woods pack redundantly bring 3 lighters whatever firestarty toys you have whatever doped tinder you want etc fire is life fire is your ability to see to ward off predators to signal to make inedible food edible to crudely purify water and to keep yourself warm redundancy will save your life
  i always have 2 lighters anonn and matches  all this survival and bushcraft is a meme to me i go out to enjoy nature not to fuck with ferro rods and whatnot the faster i can start a fire after a long tyring day the better hell i used to carry pencil torch but those break too fast
when spring starts walmart discounts these down to about 25 per pack i buy a bunch and cut each stick into 3 pieces put a few in a ziploc bag seal it up then wrap around a bic lighter and rubber band to hold together i get a fast flame that stays long enough to dry out and start wet kindling
i pack dryer lint into empty toilet paper tubes and spray a little vegetable oil on it works breddy gud
  and neither is vegemite while were on it  also a fantastic /out/ food
  how did you ignite the thing  throw it in a fire or something
  hey op i like youre idea but im not sold can you do a comparison on times with wd40 vs vaseline
  hm buttsex lube will be harder to mix with wool but ok ill give it a try im curious myself
old bicycle inner tube is best and free and works in the wet better than a fucking cotton ball
  look mom i used word fuck again i cant wait till my balls drop like 10 years from now
  hey op i like youre idea but im not sold can you do a comparison on times with wd40 vs vaseline      well what do you know the vaseline is actually better  off course it all depends on how much of it you put on the wool since its solid and not liquid    one with wd40 lasted for 9 minutes but the flame was already small 7 minutes in while vaseline one burned for 11 minutes and the flame stayed strong for over 9 minutes     temp 5c   wind 30km/h        yea and so are plastic shards i use all that too  i saw something and wanted to test it dont be a butthurt little bitch also this thing gives a much better flame and is hard to put out unlike plastic or rubber   i think ill keep using it when going into harsh environment
  sup faggot did you forget your on 4channal now cuntlapper    fuck
  yes they are sorta its illegal to have inedible things inside a food product so the original kinder eggs that had the yellow toy containers are illegal but kinder did make a bastardized version that separated the toy and chocolate
  one of those statements is a lie
  most people use vaseline i think theres this thing too these burn fairly quickly but get points for being ultra easy to light in any weather some people make sawdust blocks with wax that last longer but are only slightly more difficult to light if you make the sawdust blocks with wax just shave off some as you needed it for your fire starting    also there are these things if you cant find a kinder egg    
  inner tube    ah that burnt rubber smell
  eww    interesting ill experiment with it someday i have a feeling thwy wont burn for so long but i might be wrong   hm one could boil wool in wax instead of wood too make little balls out of it      rather like fairy land isnt it  except for the smell of gasoline and burning flesh
  wiped the grease and oil off the bottom of my truck with a dirty rag got a fire started after it had rained for weeks hey whatever works but vasiline works good too
  did you cut it to peaces and held it in tactical bushcraft survival operator containers    just kidding tried to start a fire with diesel fuel not as easy as it seems especially below zero once it catches fire its much better than gasoline though
  i wish i was that tactical but nah lol and yeah diesel turns to jelly in the cold gasoline mixed with diesel will let you make a fire anywhere though
  gasoline mixed with diesel  hmm that reminds me of those yt recipes for homemade napalm where they add styrofoam to gasoline wonder what would adding diesel later on do     more science must be done
  yeah the wax stuff wont burn as long but that isnt the point it is more about waterproofing and super fast lighting you can chuck a handful of it into a wood stove or campfire pile on kindling light it and away it goes
  something we did all the time in scouts was dryer lint it works great on its own but it also works well and preserves better if you mix it with molten paraffin wax use a cardboard egg carton as a mold and cut out the individual egg compartments
i have been hives and lots of old ugly honeycomb i usually tear off a wee bit and toss it on the top of the kindling in my rocket stove it really gets things going as it melts and catches on fire it is a big difference between using it and not using while only need to use a tiny amount i have enough to start like 5000 fires essential a life time of camping or 45 years of 3 meals a day but i get more every year so theres that too
please feast on this shameless display of raging autism    
  get a load of this fucking cunt
  thanks for that it is better seeing than simply describing fyi outdoor temps dont matter all that much with stuff like this the extreme ends of the spectrum would to a point but im sure youll not be in 100 to 150 temps trying to light materials on fire the plastic in those containers certainly is a huge factor in how long they last while on fire youd need a pretty nasty wet storming weather to compromise them enough to be a problem with starting a fire i think the fuel inside the cotton balls helps with the initial starting being super fast but it is the plastic shell that gives them candle like action to last longer    i made some waxboilded wood chips like in  and just did a short test with them i tried the worst test i could think of dunking them in a container of water symbolizing the worst thing that happens you get dunked in a river for a while and all your water proof containers crack/tear open  get water inside the vid is much longer but i doused them out with water and relit them a few times the sections that were burned doused with water then burned again were harder to start the second time that is due to the charcoal being wet and not having wax in it to protect it like the wood has the water droplets bead up on the surface of the wood and can put out the fire once the fire reaches it if the droplet is large enough though most of them just sputter loudly sizzle and continue to burn if you simply knock off the beaded water everything goes very smoothly i think these would only have a problem in some serious stormy rainy weather where rain was directly hitting them the neat thing is that you can keep unlit pieces in water indefinitely and they will light right up if you shake the water off first    other than really high winds rain directly on the fire and wet kindling i dont think either of these methods would be any problem to use
    and a vid from  directly this used rainsoaked kindling damp tinder and green kindling as a wet fuel scenario there only like 56 chips under the damp tinder
    i understand why boiling is important now its not just about creating waterproof layer its about wax getting deep inside the wood grandpa told me when i was little this is how they used to make railway logs  the wood was placed in giant containers sealed and boiled under preassure in special liquid thats why they can be 100 years old and still free from fungus and rooting
  exactly the logs you are thinking of were boiled in creosote which is particularity nasty stuff those railway ties can only be destroyed with enough rainfall over a very long amount of time it is a rather slow process to wash off the creosote    if you try the wax thing boil them until theres no bubbles at all coming out of the wood also be careful since melted wax is rather flammable if something catches on fire or you spill it and it flames up just smother it dont put water on it or it will make things far worse pic
  shiiite i didnt knew its cancerous though and to think people buy those logs to decorate their houses to make them look vintage pay good money for them too
  according to the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr eating food or drinking water contaminated with high levels of coal tar creosote may cause a burning in the mouth and throat and stomach pains atsdr also states that brief direct contact with large amounts of coal tar creosote may result in a rash or severe irritation of the skin chemical burns of the surfaces of the eyes convulsions and mental confusion kidney or liver problems unconsciousness and even death longer direct skin contact with low levels of creosote mixtures or their vapours can result in increased light sensitivity damage to the cornea and skin damage longer exposure to creosote vapours can cause irritation of the respiratory tract     yeah it isnt very nice stuff to play with ive had skin burns from wrestling with railroad ties it doesnt last too long but damn it burns like tires and lead i dont allow it on the property anymore
  vegemite might not be banned but good luck finding some in stores
anyone else use this formula im tanning a deer hide for the first time and unfortunatly it got rained on for a couple hours during the night im drying it out now what should i expect any signs i should look out for if things have gone wrong
      theres a lot of people over that that may know as well
  thanks anon ill ask there
hello its my first time here in /out/ and thought i would share my plans for this week i plan going on a solo camping trip instead of using modern equipment i thought i would use 10 to the 16thcentury methods and equipment to get in touch with my ancestors have you heard of anybody camping like this also what types of gear did they use
  gay and larp tier enjoy being cold and miserable
  they worked their farms
  in the winter      wool keeps you warm
  in the winter they stayed huddled up in their huts trying to keep warm and dry while eating food they stored from the harvest people didnt really camp for fun back then
  checking a shit thread  ive heard of 18th century methods but not 10th to 16th  anyway the answer is to just look up the kits of armies during the 10th16th centuries and see what sort of equipment they brought along for survival if youre lucky you may be able to find some details on how they set up camp ive seen some information on roman camp setups so id figure its probably out there for the later civs
  a kilt for sleeping in  a knife for literally everything else    farewell
thread about tiny house outdoor living   where to live   how much would it cost  how much would it cost for overtime  how large of a trailer  please share other kinds of simple living such as cabins or shacks
  these little underground buildings from the cold war come on the market now and again i think id like to get one
go as big as you can get to store extra fuel and foodstores also get insurance
  tiny houses are for loser liberal hippie vegans in california do not buy a tiny house unless you get a vasectomy first  get a comfy cabin in oregon by mount hood 15 minutes away from a town and an hour away from portland and vote republican
  oregon  vote republican  you retarded
  isnt most of oregons population in portland which most people there vote dem
      
  outdoor living  house    this is not /in/  trailers and houses
  obviously im talking where am i most capable of living off the land in the outdoors even those fucking nomadic mongolians still live in their fucking yurts same concept on wheels
  same concept on wheels    not at all
  got any pics of one not sure ive ever seen one of those
i have this container in my moms backyard to live in now 77x194 about to cut a part of the roof out to make the sleeping loft still trying to figure out how to attach a facade around it my mom wants it to be nice so the neighbors dont say anything shes going to pay for it so im thinking t111 on some type of framing     what exactly constitutes a tiny house
  as of 2018 there is no set definition as to what constitutes a tiny house however a residential structure under 500 square feet 46 m2 is generally consideredby whom a tiny home2     you are building the loft on top  hot or cold climate  insulated container
  live somewhere that you have permission to be
fishing shack    you can be in while you are out    floridaman still has problems with the concept of solid lakes

  yes portland proper can outvote the rest of the state
  exactly zero insulation  this was built solely for photo shoots nobody will ever sleep in it much less live in it
house thread  on /out/    uh
  if you are inside a tent are you still /out/  was jeremiah johnson a pussy because he had a cabin    is a guy out on a lake in subzero weather ice fishing not /out/ because he has a shelter
  floridians would disagree    what i dont understand is why this sauna needs seven toilets
  houses have nothing to do with outdoors
  this guy is not /out/     he looks pretty /out/ to me    might not even have internet connection
  floridians need proper insulation even more to maintain a livable temperature keep humidity down and not burn out the ac from running 24/7
  floridians need proper insulation    correct this works here for several reasons    it has a huge window park it near a beach    park it in shade     small enough for a small ac to handle easily    many many floridians run their ac from dawn til late at night just a fact of life    humidity is an issue but this place doesnt store antique books and seems easy to clean to prevent mold
a fancy fishing hut
these are houses that you drag to /out/ so you can stay /out/ longer
which of course makes them /out/houses
fish and then play poker for the fish
this is a clever idea for any ittybitty cabin
  vote for climate change denial    
this design might be applicable for other styles besides fishing shacks
piling sand against your trailer innawoods helps insulate it from the heat good work
this is just cute

this one does not look like it was designed to entertain girls    but you might win a bunch of fish
how many canadian monopoly dollars would it take to buy the raw materials for something like this    is it even survivable with canadian winters
  unfinished wood  easy to prevent mold  lolno
10k including shipping  including basic cabin fittings  woodstove guessing    depends on just how canadian you go
  from a lumber yard somewhere between 500700    yes but it would require a lot of effort
  whimsical meme houses  fuck  off    because of this stupid fucking fad 90 of contemporary books i find on diy home construction are this insipid millennial bullshit instead of useful information i want to learn how to diy a 1250 ft2 aframe with a dormer a small deck and skylights  not an unironic cuckshed in a seattle backyard

  this desu  i want something i can live comfortably with a small family while huntan and /out/an away from civilization  looking into amish style housing
  it has a huge window park it near a beach  in florida the millisecond you open that window you will have every mosquito in the county in your place  park it in shade   so its only 130f in the summer instead of 150f  small enough for a small ac to handle easily  not with the walls made out of 1x4s no  but this place doesnt store antique books and seems easy to clean to prevent mold  doesnt matter it will literally fucking dew in there and youll have standing water
      imagine voting
  i dont think you have spent enough time in florida camping or maybe ever visited    besides everyone knows it gets to 180f in florida
when i see people spend tens of thousands on these worthless things it makes me immediately think of all the homes you can buy here in the midwest for 3040k that people live in and that have a resale value
  lived in dunedin for a couple years coast is okay as long as theres wind theres usually wind but the mosquitoes are still bad if that thing had pretty much any style of window other than hurr clear panels in a garage door and hurr nonopenable noscreen panel it would be fine you could open it up and get good airflow but noooo they had to go the meme route and make it look like they tried to convert a fucking food truck instead of building to an end result    humidity is always a problem yearround and even in the winter people run at least the fan on their hvac because of it    my garage which still has better ventilation than that little retarded shack does routinely hit 120130f in the summer and its under a tree solely because it lacks good insulation and has very little ventilation    that thing would literally be a torture device inland and barely livable 10 months out of the year coastal
  my home is an investment  shoo shoo boomer
  this    why do new wave hippie liberal faggots think there the first person to have this idea why dont they just get a camper like the millions of other people in the country and stop spending so much time trying to be different
  with a camper no one will know if you are a raging faggot or not thats why tiny homes were invented to clear that up
  tiny houses can be built way sturdier and better insulated than any camper has ever been as well as better customized to your specific needs dont get me wrong i hate the hippy neoliberal millennial culture thats become so dominant in the tiny house thing but on a practical level theres a lot of advantages they have over prefab stuff
  fair enough but how much electricity could you use to heat or cool the place with the tens of thousands of dollars in price difference between the two not to mention at a rv park you usually get all the utilities included so its not a big deal just leave the heater on      i forgot faggots have a need to constantly tell people they are in fact faggots
  your big problem with tiny houses is going to be finding somewhere to put it     almost all urban and suburban areas have rules explicitly prohibiting full time living in rvs even on your own land which would still include tiny houses because they have wheels still attached to them thats the legal criteria to be considered an rv     now the reason people can live in mobile homes and not rvs is twofold 1 theyre actually constructed to hud construction standards and 2 they are tied in to the property meaning that once they get the mobile home to the site they literally remove the axle and put in semipermanent connections to the water/sewer/electric from the grid they are then considered real estate and not just personal property    the other loophole is mobile home parks and rv parks you can of course arrange to pay rent to a mobile home park and still keep your mobile home mobile or park your rv/tiny house at an rv park because rv parks have licenses to do that and it falls under a different legal scheme also most rv parks dont let you stay longer than 6 months    basically if you buy a tiny house your most viable option is going to be to park it at an rv park that way will be the easiest in one way because you wont get much hassle but youll have to live in an rv park not what most hipster tinyhousers envision     point being is that the reason that tiny houses havent taken off more irl not just on instagram is that you have to deal with all of the inconveniences involved in rv life dealing with rv parks  being prevented from using it as a fulltime residence on your own land but tiny houses are much more expensive/cramped than rvs ever seen a tiny house with a slide and so so much more inconvenient to tow and move around    its basically the worst of all worlds if you want a permanent residence get a manufactured home and tie it in on your own land if you want a mobile residence get an rv with slides for way cheaper
  i built mine for about what buying a usedbutingoodshape fifth wheel would have cost only difference is that what i built kept me comfy during 45c and my grandkids are probably gonna be able to live in it if they so choose  also propane master race death to electric
  r u retard heating a space on electric is so much cheaper propane is good for security and back up but when 6 cents a kilowatt hour electricity is available im going to use it
    enjoy needing a 3/4 ton truck just to tow an 8x20 living space the wind resistance alone probably knocks off 2 mpg     you probably dont even move the thing around if youre living in it over the winter in frigid arctic temperatures should have just built a fucking shed     if you had just bought an rv and used it as intended you could have sucked up all the electric you wanted for free at the rv park
    what i built kept me comfy during 45c     step 1 buy the fucking fifth wheel instead  step 2 put a skirt around it with 2 inch panels from home depot pop a space heater down there and wrap your water/sewer hose in heat tape and insulation  step 3 run the fuck out of your heat pump and space heaters inside with free electricity from the rv park instead of hauling 120 gallon propane tanks and literally burning through hundreds of dollars of propane a month    plus youll actually have something with some resale value instead of your cuckshed on wheels no one but no one buys peoples shitty custom vans/tiny houses
  yeah youre right about pulling it the goal wasnt to be all that mobile in the first place though i was just needing something to live in while i was in between owning properties ended up being around 3 years and that i could comfortably keep using while working on a permanent house its gonna end up being a guest house or something once im done with it so imo its much more of a permanent investment than a camper wouldve been and ive tried living in a camper over the winter as well so believe me when i say no amount of electric heaters can keep those things warm enough to prevent your blankets freezing to the wall      literally burning through hundreds of dollars of propane a month  its nowhere near that i only go through like 1015 gallons over three weeks in the dead of winter between heating and cooking in the summer the costs are almost mathematically irrelevant  plus youll actually have something with some resale value  dont wanna sell it
  actual location/cost/specs  i am very interested in hearing more
  location  central saskatchewan   cost  total was around 20000 including a 5000 extension i built once i put the thing on its permanent spot   specs  i could practically write a book on how i built the thing tbqh ask specifics and ill do my best to answer them
  unfortunately in most places the gubbermints dont allow living in a camper even on your own property fucking zoning regulations
  square footage/number of rooms  what did you base the structure on  that seems really affordable    i see lots of land innawoods with no building or rv restrictions on landwatch
  square footage/number of rooms  the main building is around 210 square feet and holds a living room kitchen bathroom and two bunks for guests used to just be the upper bunk and some storage for me the extension is around 112 square feet and is just a fullsize bedroom  what did you base the structure on  the main building is basically just a long rectangular shed with every surface insulated bolted onto a flat deck trailer with 8 heavy duty ubolts the extension is just the same thing but on blocks so that its level with the trailer and the two are connected by a small hallway only about a foot and a half long where the back door was  that seems really affordable  yeah its not too bad the main thing that cost more than i expected it to was the stove i had to order a specialty apartment sized one that actually cost more than a standard size just because theres not as much demand for them and they have to jack up the price to make up for it
i want to get a yurt desu they seem comfy and way less cramped than a camper
  based  have a mongolia screencap
  mad at boomers because he cant understand precepts of basic investment    enjoy trading blowjobs for happymeals when youre retirement age
  muh housing prices always go up  housing isnt now 4x the average annual income whereas in the 70s it was half   unchecked foreign investment and illegal immigration has had no effect on the supply of real estate   suicidal fha loans arent effectively subsidizing the value of real estate and producing a multidecade bubble   what is australian real estate  theres no international cabal of financiers responsible for the overfinancialization of real estate   boomers did nothing wrong     woah ho ho slow down there goy i clocked you at ultra good shabbos goy youre going just a little too fast even for my taste
      respect man honestly if youre up in central saskatchewan i can appreciate your need for additional insulation i was picturing some fag in colorado good for you
  the levels of btfo are off the charts
  i couldnt believe no one recognized this then i realized im not on /k/
  only my secret club knows about one of the most prolific and famed serial killers  or maybe its common knowledge and no one felt the need to point it out
  sounds pretty comfy desu thanks for the info
  thanks anon i probably couldve made my posts seem less confrontational to the camper guys though just to avoid the unnecessary bickering      no problem if you have any aspirations for building one i wholeheartedly recommend it you just need to know how to roll with the punches sometimes
  florida or south texas to avoid snow
  you could have one of these for under 1000 and it might be somewhat nicer on the inside
  forgot pic
  possum anon is probably salivating over this right now
  i miss him he is ok       this one is probably 10000 to 20000 usd depending on how nice it is inside    maybe less if you built it yourself
  you can go as small as about 5 x 8 feet which is enough for a queen sized mattress and a girlfriend but not room for much stuff
  5th wheel campers  depreciation curve like a egg salad sandwich  pick two
what is the vehicle that is the best compromise for something thats big enough to live in but mobile enough to still get /out/ and cheap enough to buy and drive mpg
  buy a used one
  boomer upthread was talking about resale one owner campers are a a 70 depreciation hit two owner campers are worth about the value of their appliances 3 owner campers are something you pay to dispose of    resale isnt a benefit to the owner at any point
  a large old chevy van extended body     it fits in a normal parking space and in a garage if it does not have a hi top    can look like a normal work vehicle if you want    large pick up truck with camper is a second option might be more off road than a van but probably less room mileage and stealth    vandwellers is a website with tons of data
  i understand i just hate to pay retail    school buses are awesome if you are short enough they have a few problems they drink fuel you look like a hippy/transient and it is rough when your 5000 bus needs an 8000 transmission
  honda element  not good for hardcore offroading but itll take you down logging roads and stuff just fine
they can really hold a lot of stuff
  i love my element it is like a civilized jeep that does well on the highway i put roof racks and a 2 receiver hitch on mine    buses can be made very nice on the inside
  imagine one of those swinging down on somebody just sitting there eating a piece of toast or something thump
  some people fix the low ceiling problem
  unpleasant have good chains    you can tote your jeep with you with this one
this is a classic way to fix the height problem
a small trailer with a covered area is also a viable option
this one looks really nice and very expensive to build and run
hunting shacks are a classic thing to go with this one has a shooting gallery in the attic

    dude you are twisted but not quite as twisted as you may think because this looks like its from the /tv/ show therefore making you a tremendous poser    while the arc of the moral universe is long it bends towards the vindication of theodore kaczynski
  perfect for op
  might as well get an annex instead of a tool shed theyre designed to house people and the insulation probably makes a big difference
  california bad  oregon good  you do know there is zero difference from a calfag to an oregon fag right  the whole west coast is pure liberal faggotry  but yes vote red
any suggestions on building a cabin as a squatter theres various tracts of land nearby that are unowned or owned by someone whos abandoned them actually buying land is out of the questions since im not a rich slut
  vote republican  ahahahaha
  i dont watch tv i didnt recognize what it was at first then i thought it was a picture of the opposite side of the house from the picture where he is standing next to it i was mistaken and now i know its not even his actual house
  im just busting your chops im not cool enough for /k/ but i see a lot of kaczynski on this board also linkola
id like to see someone tell us their experience with tiny houses also would it still be a tiny house if it didnt have wheels
so living in a fucking tiny house is fine but i live in trailer and im a fucking loser
  youre not a loser you live in a trailer d
  build it on skids or a trailer    you can tow it away on a truck or a wrecker if you need to vacate
i want to convert an old barn into a house for myself its on an old patch of land thats owned by someone but obviously not taken care of ever there used to be a small house near it but it was trashed and abandoned and one night a couple rednecks burnt it down for fun the barn is still standing and in good shape since its made of that old barn wood that never rots    im just hoping i dont get kicked out of it but i probably wont i know theres no electricity or running water there but thats fine its maybe 5 minutes from town but hidden away
  have you ever even been to oregon its redneck as fuck i was raised in rural california and im now living in portland rural california is conservative as fuck and rural oregon is too theres a lot of liberals here but if you step outside portland its all red
  linkola and ted k are really not comparable and the fact people here throw them together in the same bin makes me think that they dont really understand either thinker  ted k is an anticiv neoluddite linkola is literally a fascist theyre both deep green but they are on opposite sides of the spectrum
  if you step outside portland theres only like 100k people in the rest of the state
  nice new pristine looking building there
  theres only like 100k people in the rest of the state  is that supposed to be a bad thing
  no but that was intended as more of a if you arent surrounded by raging liberals you arent surrounded by anybody comment
anyone ever used old mines id like to build an underground tiny house and figure that an older mine would be a good start as long as i reinforced the mine so caveins dont happen
  pffft those things are the fucking worst teardrop trailers are so fucking overpriced for what you get you can literally buy a nice 19 foot basic travel trailer that you can actually stand up and take a shit in for the cost of one of those dinky twee little coffins on wheels
      honda element with an aftermarket hitch and roof racks installed   1500 lb towing capacity     i wish i were kidding i just looked it up instead of installing an aftermarket hitch and roof racks on a car that was designed for basedboys you could have just gotten a nissan xterra which is actually somewhat civilized jeep and can do light/medium offroading and tow 5000 lbs with no aftermarket mods oh and it has one of the beefiest roof racks available on an suv stock
  just go buy any one of the hundreds of books from the 1970s1980s that show you how to do just that
  mobile homes usually have to be converted to real estate from chattel that is generally expensive and it doesnt remove the obligation of conforming to building standards and unless codes start giving more leeway to remodeling housing is going to get worse    give it a few more decades and you are going to see an explosion in shoddy tiny houses and loosened zoning       you are going to need to gut that flooring and pressure wash that container in the spring newer containers have treated floors and insecticidal paint that humans should not be exposed to on a continuous basis
  stand up and take a shit in  why would you defacate while standing in an enclosed space like that
  orfag here  this is correct theres soon to be no distinction between california and oregon the state will burn down and go bankrupt soon for the exact same mistakes
  oldfag here ive been hearing that 10 years from now were going to be two feet underwater for about 30 years now
  is there a better sign of how fucked things actually are when living in a shed is the only achievable goal left for so many people i can appreciate the little design quirks and things like that but at the end of the day youre still living in a building with the literal footprint of a parking space
    the original tiny houses were built on double axle flatbed trailers but ive seen 1200 square foot houses on cement foundations billed as tiny houses recently it has turned into a bullshit marketing ploy because everyone loves them hipsterbux
  how fucked things are  you do realize that the only people buying these are the ones that lack the motivation to afford real houses right these arent popping up in the heart of the exensivecol cities theyre popping up in rural and suburban areas where theres a pleothora of older fullsize houses for the same or less money but those require actual social interaction to purchase and possibly a few weekends worth of sweat equity to make nice thats just asking too much from the autistic limpwristed nancies that buy the tiny houses
  the psychology behind these is interesting an awareness of impending breakdown in society fuels a desire to be remote and as self contained as possible yet still holding on to modern comforts theres also an element of retreat into childhood and trying to recreate the comfy feeling of occupying a treehouse
  you could have just said the only people who like these are mentally ill
  yeah i lived in portland for 15yrs   oregon and california are very similar   good bye portland   we will never forget what you used to be
  looks like an insulation nightmare  only good for summers
  pretty sure thats an ice fishing shack
  you cant afford a house now that the average house is 4x the average pretax annual income whereas in the 70s it was half   youre just not motivated enough     top fucking kek besides almost no one can even afford to actually buy a house outright youre just renting money in the form of a mortgage     you also have no idea what youre talking about btw the reason they arent cropping up in high col cities or any cities at all isnt that theres no demand for them its due to the fact that theyre treated exactly like rvs and travel trailers and cities have municipal ordinances prohibiting people from living in them full time even on their own land    you have no idea about the sheer amount of demand that even the traditional rv park industry has been trying and failing to keep up with in the last decade its so hard to open a new traditional rv park in/near cities so rv parks near cities literally have waitlists and rates so high it almost makes it not worth it     the demand is there hugely and growing im a fulltime rver myself and every rv park i go to i see at least one tiny house     if the status quo ever started to change thered be a small gold rush to be had by building modern clean residential style rv parks that catered to tiny housers as well in/near cities with good fiber internet that you can actually get since youre near a city    you dont think people would jump at that opportunity the system is sick its been a 40 year gordian knot of problems that have jacked up prices and encouraged builders not to build starter homes     where are the 100k small new construction homes on small subdivided plots that people could actually have a hope of buying without borrowing so much money itll take them well into the 2030s at least to pay down
  i have that book
  you know what screens are typical that americans dont put them on their windows
  lol the standard size for a roof mount a/c in an rv is 13500 btu they dont come any smaller than that except in very small shitty rvs that are like 16 feet     the 135k units get positively frigid immediately its almost too much in units that are any larger than 2425 feet they put two 135k units some rvs even have three     you can literally live downright comfortably with them in the middle of the desert during the day as long as you have a big enough generator stack to power each 3000 watts starting 1200 ish watts running
  nice    it does look best suited for a mild climate    yes it was a joke    yes that poster seemed rather angry about that picture  american home often have screens but tend to keep the windows closed anyway  in florida the humidity is high enough to cause interior damage and black mold growing inside the walls so many people keep their house sealed year round
here is another structure for some lonely and angry boy to bitch about
  where are the small 100k homes on small subdivided plots  suburbs of basically every city large enough to have suburbs and located between the pacific crest and the appalachians     my house was built in 2014 i bought it 2 months after it was finished its 1100 square feet according to whichever retarded method mls uses to measure which didnt include the unfinished basement i paid 83000 for it im in a suburb of a 1 million population major city
  how is this not a thing
  huh didnt know that about the mold i live in australia so its unbearably dry instead our homes are on 26ft poles above the ground so the breeze can flow under the house helping it keep cool we do big verandahs and northsouth eastwest hallways so the breeze can go inside too a lot of people put screens on their verandahs or just sit under the house on a hot day   winter is hilarious because itll still be 26c in the day and people dress like hell has frozen over
i have a school project and i was just wondering what the best way to grow peppers hydroponically i have four peppers that i know will grow together
the peppers are from the capsicum annuum group   bell peppers banana peppers jalapeños and scotch bonnets

the worst type of weather
cold and wet  just how i left your mother
whats a good minimalist shoe for winter continuous cold and rain gumboots are uncomfortable and have a raised heel should i get some drysuit boots i could wear them to bed too if theyre closed cell    trouble is zero breathability but if its cold slushy and wet my feet will be wet anyway so might as well be from sweat rather than mud or rain but if you get continuous dry days theyre going to be too hot and stuffy    neoprene socks inside leather minimalist boots the leather will saturate eventually and take a long time to dry and be heavy the whole time     fuck this gay ass season i just want to hike for a week what would you do out
  95f 80100 humidity  1 million mosquitoes    at least with cold and wet you can wear clothing to keep you comfortable theres even a good reason to make a comfy campfire and warm up to it
it cant be wet if its cold
i mostly camp in a desert/canyon rain makes everything so god damn fucking muddy and the mud is just bright orange
  what is freezing rain  probably the worst condition out there snow is far more easily dealth with
  its something that only happens when its relatively warm
  warm  freezing  warm air plays a part in making freezing rain occur but the times i have encountered freezing rain while out is certainly wasnt shorts and tshirt weather
  if youre a faggot yeah rain is comfy
  t has never experienced freezing 10 hour rain and high winds nor had all of his gear wet out at the same time
  any good leather boot is suitable treat the leather well and itll be waterproof and breathable wear good woollen socks for breathability and warmth if your leather boots are getting saturated then youve treated that leather like shit grease polish and wax
  doesnt prepare for the rain  k lol
  i love rain and cold the cold and rain makes the fire more comfy
  especially when its in a nice cave or under a tree v comfy
    its pretty much a guarantee that saying i hate x weather will get at least one tryhard to kneejerk with that weather is fine you goddamn pussy
  ive been in freezing rain when its 20f out its amazing what a storm can do such as manage to not freeze the precipitation before it gets to you despite being 50 below freezing
  wet and cold weather is nice be thankful you dont know how nice it is until you go into eternal sunshine shit is ass    t southern louisiana where its sunny 99 of the time
first time hunting   go out with my seasoned father for guidance  spent 4 days fucking all over gods creation without even a single sight just tracks  5th day with only 15 minutes before legal hunting ends a doe walks out in front of me  i am braced against a tree with perfect line of sight with a doe less then 20 yard away  she stands fucking still broad side on as i line up on her heart  click  misfire  recock the hammer  clicked  misfire  doe is spooked enough to walk away while i cycle another round  she fuck stop and turn presenting broadside on and holds there  click   3rd misfire  doe has enough of my noise and walks back into the tree    i am fucking done with this planet fuck this earth fuck this god fuck the entire human race i am done with this i want to die and end this pointless existence this rifle shot almost 30 rounds during sighting and giggles yet the two rounds i examined afterwards had incredibly shallow pin strikes
  what wad the weather like did you change ammo what kind of rifle did you drop it at any point was it disassembled or cleaned between zeroing and hunting
  10 degrees 9 windchill  no same boxes from same purchase time  browning 270 magnum blr 15 years old  rifle no ammo perhaps but always wiped off with a glove  allegedly this is a borrowed rifle
  it was the spirit of the forest teaching you something about yourself  say thank you
  browning blr  exposed hammer  10 degree weather  i found your problem
  ((()))
    this anon sometimes fate be like that learn from it and be grateful
  iirc the marlin 336 is popular up in alaska the guide gun configuration for it even originated in the state i dont see why that would be his problem unless browning is making shittier guns i dont know anything about their models
  the space between the hammer and pin can be filled with ice in bad conditions it is best to keep it covered and not cocked op is dumb enough to turst a gun that he knows nothing about and ammo that can not be trusted to have consistent trajectory i hope op learns to hunt responsibly or stops completely
  have been hunting all my adult and most of my childhood life 30 years  have never once in my life had a misfire including while using muzzle loaders in heavy rain  take care of your shit and it will take care of you do not use borrowed firearms especially if you dont have intimate knowledge on how they were stored or maintained do not use ammo you didnt source or is in any way questionable do not use reloads you didnt load yourself put a modicum of effort into keeping your shit out of the weather
  hunting a god deer  she wanted your dick not your bullets yet you just watch her walk away the fuck is wrong with you
  the spirit of the forest can eat a dick
  /k/ pls go
    not even going to lie first time seeing a doe she was quite pretty just a yearling so small but i could see how that meme got started she was a damn fine looking thing
  bro your first time hunting and you actually saw a deer you did fantastic next years hunt will practically be a sure thing i went hunting 20 times before i finally nailed a deer
  but how many times did it take until you finally shot one
  i shot one on my sixth trip very close range in heavily dense bush double lung shot it had enough life left in it to run far enough to prevent me from locating it i finally took one home on trip 20 fast forward to now ive just done trip 51 and my tally is up to 18 deer im not the greatest hunter but if you put the mile and time in you will smoke something over sooner or later
  you left the fucking safety on didnt you
  he probably did   which is why i like my old winchester 94 the safety is the half cock notch and you know if it is engaged
never been hunting before   have a total bro random roommate freshman year  we become best friends he turns me from a socially awkward fuckwad into a slightly socially awkward retard   roommates throughout college   takes me hunting our senior year  first night out see two bucks fighting   2nd day stuck in a hunting blind when the biggest wasp in the history of man attacks us and we both jump out of the blind screaming like little bitches and scare all the deer away  third day crawl up to a field   3 deer just chilling   he lays his backpack down i get the biggest doe in my sights   i freeze and hesitate taking the shot  deer start to walk off  roomy makes this weird deer sound  nothing happens they walk closer to forest   he makes sound again they keep walking   roommate screams hey bitch at the top of his lungs   take the shot   deer falls gets up falls gets up falls a third time gets up and runs off   was really far away takes us like 2 minutes to get to where we think it fell  cant find any blood   roommate has never lost a deer ever or so he says  spend the next 2 hours looking for blood  about 100ft further than where we were looking i ask hey dude whats this red gummy bear looking shit   find blood trail   hike through like a mile of woodlands   find deer   drag it back to the field uphill both ways in the snow across the train tracks barefoot just like our grandpas or just a mile then through it in the john deer thing   get a great picture   he makes me take a bite of the hear  drink a few beers   become even bester friends     probably one of my favorite days ever
  this but if you think the only point is killing the animal youre probably not going to enjoy hunting very much
  this is really sweet anon im glad to hear it
  wholesome
  (((deer)))
im sorry man that is incredibly gay sounds exactly like the kind of shit thatd happen to me
  unless browning is making shittier guns  they do as does remington aside from a few models they only sell guns because of dumb hunters like yourself who just go by brand names remington 700 series is good especially if its manufactured before they were bought out savage and ruger are the only companies im aware of that make fudd guns and havent had a sharp decline in quality
  nothing worse suddenly trigger pull is 100 pounds im sure ive bent triggers in the heat of the moment
  bro post the fucking picture wtf
  new winchester rifles are better than theyve ever been and im not kidding     their big knock is theyre not selling 500 rifles anymore a winchester model 70 is now 850 for just the rifle and a new model 94 costs more than 1000
  the spirit of the forest is a fag so it already does
need a freezer to keep deer meat in     will be putting in my garage    any recommendations
      get the temperature perfect for it or dont try and make jerky instead
  i already keep deer meet in my freezer in the kitchen    i just need mone in the garage for more space
  how did you manage to get so close to a sleeping deer
  idk how it is where you live but down here everybody has a deep freeze so you can buy them used at any skent n dent or similar place   a lot of people i know just take old house fridges pull out most of the shelving jack the cooler up to eleven and thats their deep freeze
  you gotta suck em off then they take a nap
this works good too dude 
would it be possible to store an entire deer in a standard refridgerator freezer or is a chest freezer kind of a must have
  a fully butchered and deboned midwestern whitetail will just barely fit in a largeish fridge freezer if properly packaged but youre gonna have shitall else in there smaller freezers larger deer or less than perfect butchering and it aint gonna fit
  i wouldnt say its a musthave but itll make your life a lot easier plus more space for other frozen commodities
  i use a decent 400l chest freezer i find it a bit on the small side any freezer that gets properly cold will do 20c works well for me       i would say so might be a bit of a tight fit depending on body size of animal and what you decide to keep racks of ribs take up a lot of room it would be a close fit depending on the size of your standard freezer and the size of the animal     i use an old refrigerator to age the meat in before i process it i think break the animal down into cuts and vacuum seal/label i then put the vacuum bags into larger bags that usually hold a quarter of the animal i then rotate the bags so the oldest is on top which is the one i eat out of     pic related buck aging in my old refrigerator atm
  just get a box freezer youd know what size better than me
  a cold one
    1 for possible spinal tap reference
someone explain aging
  time goes on   things do not

  i know the (((advertisers))) wont like this but whats your favorite /out/ activity to engage in while dude beering  for me its pic related  said no one ever
hello /out/    i recently discovered sailing and ive become very intrigued with the idea of taking some classes buying a sailboat and traveling around the world in it for a few years have any of you guys ever done any serious sailing and have any tips to share on how long it takes to learn costs of buying a solid sailboat maintence costs travel expenses preparations for such a voyage etc    im really interested to hear about any experiences youve had sailing
  ive only sailed tiny boats but i have a friend who has 2 uncles who saved from spain around tierra del fuego and up the west side of the americas from what she told me 3rdhand knowledge its basically suicide to attempt something similar alone additionally someone else on the ship will help to keep you sane
  yeah there are people who do aroundtheworld sails solo but it seems really rough i envision starting alone and picking up people who are interested in voyaging together
  hope ur rich and have a lot of free time  unless you are a professional sailor its a ridiculously pricey hobby
  buying a sailboat and traveling around the world in it for a few years  do you have 15m usd of discretionary income to burn no of fucking course not youre on the board that caters to the homeless aint happening
  not everyone here is super poor some of us are only slightly poor
  yeah about that unless youre independently wealthy   1 you aint affording fuel and maintenance long enough to sail around the world without working in the process  2 you aint affording a boat large enough and sound enough to do it in at least with any modicum of safety without going deeply in debt or spending every weekend and night for the next 15 years diying the extensive repairs itll need before it ever sees a drop of water that didnt fall from the sky
    it really isnt that expensive some people are able to work on their boats but most just live off savings    from the research ive done a solid 1530 year old 3850 foot cruiser can be bought for 50100k living expenses tend to be around 2530k/yr based on a few videos ive watched what i cant find info about is maintenance/insurance/marina costs and whatnot someone with a couple hundred grand saved could go a few years sailing
  so negative nice    professional mariner here   im laughing out loud
  am i way off
  idk your finances but you obviously lack experience with actually sailing   you can be ballin outta control if you aint got the skills to use a tool its useless     have you tried joining yacht club or something similar before you jump all into a hunk of debt like this
  oh no i dont have the money saved up at all im just trying to make the point that its much cheaper than people think it is     i graduate college relatively soon and i have a hunk of student loan debt to pay off im just trying to gauge what my first step would be towards learning the skills and saving the money to make this happen joining a yacht club sounds like a good idea
  okay so you sink 100 grand into the boat and no youre not getting a solid 50 footer for 100000 youre getting a barely floating deathtrap the previous owner is desperate to be rid of after giving up on fixing it himself100k might get you a decent 23ft boat that only needs new sails a paintjob and the engine rebuilt it needs extensive work especially if its 30 years old which is either time and labor intensive or expensive so you sink another 10000 diy to 30000 pro into it    and now its seaworthy but you dont have fuel you dont have permitting you dont have most of the require safety gear you probably dont have any electronics besides maybe a basic radio which honestly arent needed unless youre going out into serious open water 99 of recreational sailboats are coast huggers because the skippers arent that experienced and the safety gear for open water crossings is pricey  bbut its a sailboat why do i need fuel  getting in and out of marinas/moorings not getting fucking becalmed still being able to make forward progress in storms too strong for your sails so you dont get turned broadside to the waves and sunk and many other reasons now generally marine fuel is fairly cheap its basically highway diesel and in some cases is you wont be running the engine 24/7 although you might run a small and efficient generator unless you sank even more money into a solar setup    so you sink a couple more grand into it and youve learned in calm/protected waters now you need to actually stock it put a desalinator on it 99 of boats dont have one because they dont need one for short trips and make a few more modifications poof there goes another few grand    so now youre in it for about 200000 and you havent even started out sailing around the world yet at most youve putted up a coast in good weather for a day or 3 now now finally youre ready to begin
    oh yeah one other thing  upkeep  even just sitting in its slip or at its mooring youll need to stay on top of general maintenance corrosion is the big part especially since youre planning on sailing saltwater expect to be doing something with the bilge monthly repairing your deck trim quarterly repainting/recoating something pretty much every time you step aboard and replacing lines constantly this can like most things be cheap in exchange for sweat equity or it can be very expensive if you pay someone else like me to do it for you  marina fees  you aint parking for free marina fees run the gamut from a few bucks a week for a shitty mooring spot to like my marina 12 per foot of boat per week for a slip for a 50ft sailboat thatd be about 35/day     so the tldr of this is  large recreational boats and especially sailboats are fucking black holes you shovel money into for a few hours of fun a month    t marina worker no i dont sail
  ive become very intrigued with the idea of taking some classes  good  buying a sailboat  are you rich and its not a rhetorical question   traveling around the world in it for a few years  takes decades of prep unless you plan to have awful time and/or dying    i was sired by my parents on their honeymoon spend mostly on sailing and fucking they met together in sailing classes i sail since as far as i care to remember been in a bunch of crews that were on the podium during different regatta but nothing spectacular or professional my peak was 1st place in our class in tall ships races    as for costs  depends on material the yacht is made off wood plastic metal same with maintenance travel expenses are close to zero because all you need to pay for is food supply and then once you reach the port for the time in it so if you plan to sail for long periods of time with as little periods and number of ports visited then its relatively cheap as for buying yacht  unless you are filthy rich or plan to mortgage your ass so hard average mortgage for a house looks like a breeze by comparison there is just no fucking way charter the yatch instead or find a fucking sponsor of any kind or type  as for keeping things cheap and affordable along with allaround practical training yaching clubs are your main targets the only reason why i can afford sailing at all with my shit salary im a night guard is due to membership in a club
      thanks a lot for your answers i really appreciate it    so all these boats arent seaworthy for long journeys whats wrong with them      51 beneteau oceanis 520  75000    36 beneteau 361  50000    46 bavaria 46  74217    how much would all the necessary equipment cost for a journey across an ocean what about work on the boat to prepare for such a journey    how much is upkeep generally and you dont have to use a marina do you cant you just anchor offshore    does traveling around the world really take decades ive seen so many people who claim to have bought a boat without much experience and crossed an ocean with it like        yeah it seems foolish to try to sail around the world without knowledge or experience but does it really take decades
  that first 51 boat doesnt look to be in too bad a shape only things from the pics that really make me hmm are the condition of the shitter and the fact the mattress doesnt fit which could just be a shit fit or it could be indicative of hull warp engine mounts are rusty but not eaten through almost guarantee it needs rebuilt but thats something youre gonna be looking at regardless in a boat that age but you really cant tell a whole lot from pictures especially since they gave no view of the bilge waterline keel etc etc    for a crossocean trip you will need at a minimum  solid hull lifeboat/tender/dinghy with at least a 20hp outboard  desalinator  2x hf radio  radar which i know damn little about i do hull work  gps  backup motor typically a 2050hp outboard  generator that runs on the same fuel as the main engine doesnt have to be big just run the radios and desalinator but recommend one capable of running the whole boat  type 1 lifejacket for everybody onboard  throwable life preserver for everybody onboard  distress beacon  flaregun and at least 12 flares  i would also recommend either a satphone or one of the satellitelinked rescue beacons    how much is upkeep generally  thats very boat specific older boats need more wood boats need more upkeep than fiberglass which need more upkeep than plastic routine maintenance is fairly inexpensive anything requiring drydock is expensive but hopefully infrequent barnacle scraping etc is usually done once a season i cant give you a good range if you dont have a boat already and will vary on location im in a rich part of fl so rates are inflated    no you cant just fucking park offshore we use coves and shit for a reason protection from weather and shit waves and all the coves are fucking full you also cant trust your anchor to stay anchored when youre not aboard theres a reason your moorings are these huge blocks of concrete 
  oh nice im in fl too its a shame ive lived here since i was born and i never payed attention to the boating culture we have here     thanks for all the info im really excited to learn how to sail when i have the resources to do so have a lot of money to save up it seems lol
  no prob as a nonsailer i cant really speak to how long it takes just that i think it would be better quantified in hours of practice vs years of total time  someone thats on the water every damn day will be competent in a lot fewer years than someone that gets out twice a month
  i too have wanted to sail someday   a vintage yacht would be cool but whats the minimum setup i need for me and maybe a couple other dudes to catch the fish we eat everyday and sleep in the boat every night  ywn be a disc jockey for pirate radio
  minimum set up  you need lots and lots of money
  that part is obvious im talking about how large a boat etc i would need at the very least
  youre going to need a considerable amount of money i crewed boats for 6 years island hopping hawaii to papua and have thought about doing just what you are saying but  its expensive man and you need at least one other person to come along too
  been sailing since i was 5  great hobbies desu ignore all the negative faggots that say its expensive its not  you can get pretty descent yachts for about 10k or less and up generally i would advise you try and do some dingy sailing to get the basics before going big the basics work on any yacht and once you have them you can get a bigger boat avoid being that guy who buys a 50 footer but doesnt have a clue how to sail it myself and my dad use to beat 50 footers in our moodie 23 theres some cracking deals around if you go to the right spots go to boat yards look online go to boat shows boats unlike cars maintain their valve pretty well uk and ireland have cracking deals on yachts not too sure about the us ama if you have any questions
  its expensive theres no getting around that
theres a poster in this board that has lived aboard a beat up old sailboat for like a decade now he detailed his expenses in a thread and he was living with less than a two grand a month and traveling around europe and the caribbean for years now    but every time the it costs a fortune contrarians manage to chase him away
  thanks for the tips how much does upkeep generally cost and how much experience should one have before attempting to cross an ocean ill be sure to check out the uk and ireland for boats whenever i have the money and experience      damn thats amazing are there any keywords i can use to search for his threads in the archives
  well to put a boat in a boat yard which many people do will cost you 1k a year depending where you go maintenance is all down to the size of the boat id put maintenance depending what youre doing to your yacht maybe 500 to 1k range a year but even then its probably less maintaining a boat is pretty easy desu it only gets expensive if your engine blows up or the mast splits in two  to sail across the ocean i would say it would take alot of expierence i could do it but you would want to get a yacht masters course under your belt at least which would teach you chart work celestial navigation and basics that would be essential for crossing any ocean start off small go sailing in harbours first then go out along the coast then do three day trips from point a to point b try sailing in a variety of weather too that would help
contrarians have never heard of annie hill john vigor hell even bruce roberts    go small go simple go now
normally a /pol/fag but i would like to offer the following advice  know every system on the boat and dont rely on 12/24v install a genset  have at an absolute minimum a hand cranked desal
  check every shackle mouse thruhull anode everything before your throw ropes  lrn2chart amd colreg
  nearly forgot spend a lot a lot of time learning your mains/aux a lot of sailboats use a single or two lung diesel like the old bukh lister or similar spend a lot of time reading up on troubleshooting but remind yourself that they only really need three things air  fuel and power and take a multimeter with you
im a liveaboard which is probably why sailing is so affordable to me i dont really see it being that expensive    even on the off chance that you buy a more expensive sailboat on a loan you will still likely pay less than you would renting or for a house payment    i plan to travel across the atlantic and up and down the east coast of the us once i have more money saved up for a safety net and hone my skills more for offshore travel    i find sailboats and their systems onboard very simple and easy understand compared to large shipsjob so maintaining isnt too bad
ancient peoples discovered sailing 7000 years ago i think you missed the boat pal
  ahhh a weekend sailor niiiiice    colreg  why would you say such bad things here anon
  uh oh someone saw a utube video
  i sail on rivers once per month and on the sea/ocean in the summer  you can find some good deal on internet but you might want to live abroad otherwise you will need a pretty big amount of money
  dream cat 2
  end
  if i cannot crew a multihull alone then this
life jacket of choice
  none of those production boats are even close to ocean going ready they are nothing but lightly built river/coastal cruisers they fall apart at the first sign of a serious storm    and you will run in to severe storm in the open waters
  id say older iron ships may be better or aluminium/strongall if you have more money  pic related is one of the boats used for the ggr not steel made but does the job
  this is perfect id say
  this would have been a lot easier 30 years ago before there were a million giant ships at every port that you have to navigate around
first and foremost do some fuckin research learn all you can before you invest 1030 k to do something you may not like     anons are half right dont get it twisted shit is expensive however you can avoid a lot of expense by being smart  find out what you need and figure out what you want you need safety equipment you may want a shower on board while a foot pump sink a bowl and a rag will do the same    learn to fix your own shit if its a wood boat learn basic wood working if its fiberglass learn to mend and patch that     electrical systems on a boat are relatively simple get yourself a multimeter and learn the basics of trouble shooting electrical wiring youll be glad you did trust me   learn some plumbing and if you have the aptitude the knowledge on how to properly service and maintain your own engine and generator equipment will save you thousands     read read read lin and larry pardey wrote some books way back that while dated have some solid advice on how to live aboard and what to expect along the lines of cost for sails rigging engine maintenance ground tackle systems and the like
  rent is cheap if youre in a mooring field expect less that 300 a month if youre on a dock double that     you likely dont need anything over 3035 ft more boat  more maintenence same goes for equipment     youll need a good tender to ferry supplies and yourself to shore and back that also costs money but can be had for less than you think if you wait and ask around     if you know how to fix and maintain your own shit you will save so much dont buy a 5000 dollar west msrine inflatable dinghy with matching 5000 dollar motor if you can find cletus whos been trying to sell his aluminum johnboat for months     rowing works for tenders and is great exercise as long as youre less than a mile from your shore access     i didnt know shit about wiring plumbing or rigging but you learn quick when its sink or swim literally    for the love of god hire a reputable surveyor to check out the boat before you buy it or you may get fucked   if they dont check through hulls plumbing wiring electrical system rigging engine and hunt for soft spots in the deck and framing you may be fucked to the tune of thousands of dollars after you buy it     youll need to minimize on space and posessions and amenities you may want a generator to run a tv and console but your wallet will cry because of your new gasoline powered tv     solar panels are the best thing ever fuck wind generators     when you fuck up it may be painful my girlfriend left our battery isolator in the wrong position and so ran our house banks dry and then they sat for days because we couldnt start the engine to charge them presolar panel they were fucked and i had to replace them to the tune of 600ish dollars
  we hauled out recently to do bottom work and get an insurance survey nothing major just coat some paint and change zincs bottom paint runs about 300 per gallon takes about 23 gallons to get the minimum of two coats on our boat id like more but thats a lesson for next years haul out    the yard bill ended up being 1600 with paint and space as well as tool rental we do our own work   insurance surveyor was another 400    gf says be ready to learn and be positive i agree shit gets hectic sometimes but the feel of sailing into a new harbour is majestic af     last of all id say the key to making it work is to be able to work as you go a mobile profession is best     we dont have cars just bicycles and a dinghy and the boat its a good life simple and liberating   theres nothing like being able to putter out of the harbour at 5 am headed to live somewhere else because you found a better job or better neighbors or something like that     heres a small sample of some books i have on board that might help you out    whatever you decide just remember that you can make it work and dont be a cheap fuck with your pfds and get a fucking epirb and a flare gun and some tools nothing fancy adjustable wrenches some screwdrivers etc     good luck homie
    samefagging  nah anon ive been working on boats for 15 years now i was just trying to give some advice
  rule of thumb for anti foul is 75lwlbd per coat  where   lwl  waterline length  b  beam  d  draught
  oops that gives you the area most coating systems will give you a theoretical coverage per unit of volume say between 4 and 10 m2
i thought this would be a comfy thread about sailing instead i just got an op with a detached sense of reality and a bunch of really negative people
hey op i posted a few books earlier and i just remembered something that might really help you out    theres this dude captain fatty goodlander that writes books that are how to acquire and outfit a boat on a budget as well as seamanship and how to make a living as a work as you go type seagypsy     check his stuff out
  watch this movie  
  whatever helps you sleep at night lil buddy
  100k might get you a decent 23ft boat that only needs new sails a paintjob and the engine rebuilt it needs extensive work especially if its 30 years old which is either time and labor intensive or expensive so you sink another 10000 diy to 30000 pro into it  you are so incredibly full of shit you can get a 23 pocket cruiser in safe and sailable condition for 10000 or less and if you dump that much into it again it will be good as new
  a slackwater lake crawler yes nothing ocean worthy which is what the entire fucking thread is about
  all ocean sailing is transoceanic passages  the nature of the voyages never entered into the discussion you double nigger i was taking you to task for claiming that you need six figures to get into a 23 sailboat on top of that theres plenty of saltwater sailing that can safely be done with a small boat depending on where you live
  and traveling around the world in it   literally the op was specifically about transoceanic sailing you retarded asshole
    you dont need some ridiculous 40 tartan to sail around the globe all you really need is a 2527 boat read the book on how to sail around the world by hal roth and then see where you stand
  even if you were going to do that in a 23 boat you would still come in well under six figures
    your wallet will cry because of your new gasoline powered tv     lmao jesus christ /fulltimerver/ reporting in calling out your bullshit about wattage and power generation     run a 2000 watt inverter generator to a 750 watt power converter/battery charger into a bank of 4 fucking trojan t105 golf cart batteries each holding 15kwh for a total of 6kwh with a usable capacity of 48kwh factoring in a 20 safety zone    that means youll have to charge for about 8 hours which at 2535 load will take about 1 gallon of gasoline 250     a 24 inch led tv plenty big for a sailboat should use about 50 watts tops     so even factoring in an efficiency drop of 10 in the inverter for a total effective pure tv power capacity of 45kwh your tv can run for 90 continuous hours on one gallon of gas    which comes out to 27 cents per hour     youre full of shit guy
  sounds like youre going about this the wrong way anon  there are losses every time you go from ac to dc as you know  just buy a 12 volt tv a d charge your house bank direct from solar/ wind generator with a vsr
  shoo shoo retard im refuting a specific point about gasoline power generation
      factor in whatever inefficiency youd like call it another 10 thats still 3 cents per hour his post made it sound like the cost was at least an order of magnitude higher than it actually is
  and im providing a workable solution that doesnt rely on unnecessary losses and who the fuck wants a gasoline generator flashpoint of les that 60 c below decks fucking suicide no thanks
  youre fucking stupid m8 this has nothing to do with you he said something about gasolie and im demonstrating its not as expensive as you think     im providing a workable solution     hurrrr just hook up a solar panel theres my original idea that adds so much your contribution to this thread and my reply is completely superfluous i never said anything about solar not being an option     fuck right off i can tell youre a dumb fuck that thinks every idea he rips off from someone else is fucking genius     you could have even thrown out some calculations like i did to actually add something but all you did is come along and say oh just add a solar panel arent i smart you want a fucking cookie heres a fucking cookie youre a genius thanks for your fantastic contribution
  dunning kruger effect manifest you wouldnt know your asshole from breakfast when it comes to wiring a boat and i thank you for proving it nice flame attempt geocities wants its town clown back but i told them you were busy you wouldnt know a vsr or a xener if one nibbles on your left nut shit fuckwits like you use in tinned cable and wonder why it ticks out enjoy dying at sea you utter moron
  you must be a joy to have aboard such knowledge     in case your autistic ass cant parse sarcasm you and your calculations are wrong
by the way you can still buy a ready to go albin vega for under 15k spent 4 months living and cruising on one in 199495 best experience of my life
    haha samefag
i have a question and havent seen it brought up yet when i was looking into doing liveaboard a few years ago i frequently saw people talking about macgregor 26s all the time as a great boat for a newb at the time havent looked in 23 years i could find them all over here in fl for like 315k depending on condition what is wrong with one of those i dont see why we are saying its like 100k to get a liveaboard boat
  weve been talking about boats that can do a transatlantic crossing those are spendy if you want a coasthugger or puddle piracy boat you can go a lot cheaper just be aware they cant handle rough water or really high winds
  ok that makes sense i was about to add im only looking for something to cruise around the caribbean or whatever
in my part of the world we have hundreds of crusty old and young guys who live on sailboats full time pic very related    its basically my dream to become one of them
    build the boat yourself jeff
  you picked the smallest fucking picture     neck yourself
  liveaboard  macgregor 26m  goddamn thats a small living space i guess its doable but holy fuck
  full standing headroom  i wish i could believe this
  its barely seaworthy and sails like a bag of flaming dog shit so theres your tradeoff those things were never intended to leave protected waters theyre something that you trailer to the lake youre vacationing on so that you can take your family day sailing or something you buy as an inexpensive way to bob around the bay on the weekends
  designed around mainly being run with an outboard 20kn with the factorydefault 70hp outboard  its a powerboat hull they stuck sails on for the meme tax its specifically for new/inexperienced/weekendwarrior sailors to putt around inshore/freshwater of course its gonna sail like huck finn rigged his bedsheets to a sapling hobnailed to the deck but its also almost impossible to capsize
  ive been looking into sailing for a time hoping to get a job on some boat using crewseekers and most of the decent jobs require me to pass the rya day skipper course which is reasonable in order to even get into the course i need a set amount of logged hours on a boat im totally inexperienced with boats where do i even start to get hours so i can take the courses
  this aint one piece bro
  please somebody help me with this im at a loss
op if you really want to go this way  get the book 20 small boats that can take you anywhere by john vigor then post again after you read it
  that means you better have at least 125k in your account right now  lets see it holmes
  and you still believe that to be cheap do you know what the majority of people make in a year
  do days recreationally sailing count when i sat my first commercial ticket i could only claim 50 out of 360 days the rest had to be on commercial vessels and half of that seaward of sheltered waters
  sail away sail away sail away  comfy musics
been sailing for a few years and just retired with more money than is good for me i ordered an amel 50 will be ready mid next year    ill be living on it and will travel the world
  godspeed anon what kind of jobs did you work youre living the dream
  i was a project manager but made my money by investing money from an inheritance wisely 20 years ago     it was really dumb luck    not having children also saves a lot of money
shame to see a sail thread go toxic i dont know why it always happens but it always seems to turn into a whos saltier contest see sailinganarchy anyway some sage wisdom from and oldfag    wife and i followed a 4 year plan to get ourselves financially ready and somewhat trained to take on an eventual circumnavigation in that time the most helpful resource was reading the many books on the subject if youre solo watch the video accompanying the book alone together on youtube pdeece idea of some of the more philosophical aspects of sail but also some practical info for the extreme example of budget sailing i recommend voyaging on a small income the advice is maybe foolhardy in some cases dont skimp on electronic navigation aids or an epirb for the sake of masturbatory levels of thriftyness but it will teach you how to live on 2 worth of dried navy beans a week there are countless excellent other books on the subject     we started out taking about one us sailing certification course per year sailing on other peoples boats and chartering once qualified to do so typically we would do trips one week at a time and a max of twice a year i built a sailing dinghy from a clc kit for fun and to keep basic skills sharp you can learn quite a bit dinghy sailing that will still apply to larger boats like general boat behavior reading the wind surface of the water picking up a mooring and so on we saved for that 4 years with the anticipation of spending about 100k and having about another 100k in reserve for cruising expenses and a max of 20k for refit ideally we also had a fairly high living standard and budgeted around that but over budgeting is never something that will hurt we ended up getting disenchanted with the larger boats we were planning on after sailing a few 4043 footers and coming to grips with the difficulty of docking and boat handling in poor conditions
  even taking a reef or making a sail change was a chore modern boats are not really intended for that to happen often while on charter in the med or similar boom heights are more accounting for headroom on deck than sail access older boats are tighter quarters but make a much more efficient use of space than the more modern production cruisers we were looking at so we found an old catketch for about 40k usd we waffled between a cheap older cat ketch freedom or a more modern sloop rig with an inner self tacker and mod cons that wouldve been closer to 100k but opted to refit the cheaper boat we spent a good deal up front on surveys but it paid dividends with a solid hull and a recent repowering what was left was mostly rewiring and replacing electrical systems which i mostly did alone being somewhat handy     updated engine controls new chart plotter radar all new wiring depth and a masthead refit along with new mattresses head hardware and some custom upholstery later and wed spent just over 20k modernizing there isnt an incandescent lamp left on her thank fuck     so 60kish sail away price couldve done for less we rarely run the radar or need to with ais and the plotter could do without except in nastiest vis and nearshore     we spent about 2k a month at first on westmarine shit and opulent food before we set off from the east coast of the us on the transat leg last year but now idle closer to 5001000 eating well to be honest youre not going to spend much time in marinas unless thats what you want anchoring is usually free many mooring fields are too your mileage may vary    tldr weve done it for 60 with an extensive refit ive had friends find solid old boats for 30 and cruise with much much less budget than we do its all about how much of a hobo youre willing to be and whether you care about being flashy at a slip somewhere in a sleek newer hull its better to budget big and spend small
  ill stop sperging since ive tldrd already but i just want to highlight the earlier posts saying things like needing hundreds of gallons of diesel and a backup outboard  should you be becalmed it illustrates the stark differences in attitude in this community we get becalmed all the time we dont fire up the diesel we have a drink and read unless youre outrunning weather why bother does it suck sometimes sure but well keep the 100 of fuel money any day your priorities will totally dictate what you need try living a more spartan lifestyle on land first to see what you can get your own budget down to while youre living in an environment with which youre totally familiar try cooking and eating like youre on board already youll save faster and youll be more prepared for the real thing no amount of mojey or diesel will replace good seamanship and tiller time   jfdi safely
so now that we got all the it costs money shit out of this thread what can you do while sailing i figure the fishing must be bretty gud but i would like to dive especially for pic related what are the best sailing destinations
  florida keys are pretty great while also being safe and accessible from most of the us bahamas are a little better but also a little harder to get to and a little more likely for weather to shit on you    further afield the mediterranean is pretty awesome but generally hard for us burgers to get to and there may be language barriers    i would love to sail the persian gulf its protected from weather but then you run a notinsignificant risk of getting durkad got to see a good chunk of it from the deck of a destroyer would love to get out on my own
  im the guy that brought up the fuel and engine issue im a hull tech for a boatyard in fl every week i see a coasthugger or bay boat come in that either got caught in weather or becalmed and stuck on a reef or sandbar that needs extensive hull work as a result i repair or replace around 50 centerboards a month specifically because they either didnt have or couldnt start their engine you dont need much for most boats a 99 evinrude will move a 23ft boat well enough to duck a storm or get you away from the reef you got becalmed in or even just get home in time to keep the dog from crapping on the carpet for nearshore/gulf stuff but i do recommend both an inboard and a backup outboard and plenty of fuel for an oceanic crossing simply because an openwater storm will absolutely kill the shit out of you if you cant keep your bow into the waves and can last days    sure skill makes a huge difference i see people tooling around the bay just fine in big sailboats in 1mph wind theyre slow but theyre moving and in control likewise ive seen drunk or inexperienced skippers flounder in 15mph steady winds my advice was for the op that wanted to do a crossing it is overkill for everyone else
  that looks like a pearson triton the boat itself is 50 years old
  im a liveaboard which is probably why sailing is so affordable to me i dont really see it being that expensive    this is key    owning a house and keeping a boat is as a hobby is one of the most expensive things you can do owning a boat and living in it instead of a house is pretty cheap
  yeah the larger boats are nice but i dont want anything larger than 4045 feet as a liveaboard cruiser currently live on about a 34 footer and only want a little bit more storage space d
  about those barnacles
  what a fucking boomer post
does anyone here do long term bicycle camping  mods please dont delete this thread not sure what the new rules are and there have been so many thread deletions but this topic is well within the scope of this board
  bicycles are mostly over on  though with tons of autism on the topic which is sometimes pretty good and other times terrible
  this thread is meant to be about camping though   seems to me that you dont need to go nearly as light and its better to get gear that will last longer   i am thinking about doing the baja trail with a small trailer
  theres nothing wrong with posting in two places when both are legit
  going light and stripped down is the first thing you want to do if you want to tow a metal box behind you    also fuck these tiny wastes of money condensation traps stinky cant go truly offroad will be asked to move on in most places or youll end up paying for a hitching plus they have a tendency to be blown over in storms stolen smashed up for a laugh rolled into a lake or clipped by a car kablamo  get a tent or a tarp or a bivy pal suck it up you wont look homeless if you have a bike outside it
  seconding   this anon has it right fuck that micro trailer bullshit you can fit everything you need for camping even long term multi season camping into panniers and onto a rack
    i meant just a cargo trailer  not a camper like in the pic i need to be able to carry two weeks food and everything to cook it this food will be from mexican grocery stores so not ultra light in any way i also need to carry at least three gallons of water
this is my home anon i started with a trailer cargo not camper they are shit you want to be able to get your bike into wooded areas without some extra shit dangling around behind you snagging on everything just for starters get front and rear racks good ones especially with a front that has a top to strap things tomany only have side panels and a set of panniers
  op ive rode from denver to new york city over the summer    where are you going to be camping that you need two weeks of food and three gallons of water if youre going to go camping just drive a car there if you want to travel slowly and experience the rhythm of the world then take your bike on a long trip not an extended campout
  i have done this in a jeep not this exact route and its no joke even then   the three gallons of water is so i dont die   how much water can you carry with that setup 
op here i should add that i am not going to be doing this trail at a fast pace i will be stopping at remote beaches here and there to fish and take it easy this is when water is really scarce
    about 10 gallons  6 liters with the containers that are presently on / in it
    i should probably clarify that with that being the total water capacity of all containers but i wouldnt actually ride with the 10 gallon dromedary bag filled so 6 liters max whilst mobile
  if youre riding through baja you dont need to carry two weeks of food just stock up at gas stations and grocery/dollar stores and for water youll need a gallon or 6 quarts at most with a bike you can easily cover 100 miles in a day if youre in good shape over flat terrain so unless there are 100 mile stretches on your route without any source of water youll be fine and if there are 100 mile stretches without water on your route then you might want to rethink this trip
  id want more than 3 gallons if i was biking this ive only been on the drive from la paz to cabo san lucas but i remember the whole way was pretty barren and arid having worked from like 7 to about 6 in the nevada high desert for field work in 40c weather i think we averaged around 7 x750 ml water bottles a day trudging up and down the hill/mountains apparently that works out to 14 gallons mind you this was excluding fluids consumed at the hotel in the morning and at night add 15 l then to that thats about 18 gallons id estimate having 3x that for 3 days if needed so that comes out to 54 gallons unless you are planning to refill water daily on the way    its also be nice to have some kind of awning and cot setup for siestas in the mid day to that end id recommend looking into the helinox cot one easy to pack takes up very little room and weight and youre off the ground
  sorry i over estimated the size of the bottled water since i normally dont drink them and also am not good with imperial the bottles were about 500ml or 17oz it looks more like 13 gallons per day so 39 gallons for 3 days based on my experience in physical activity in hot dry weather thats what id suggest
just got done exploring death valley mines for the last six days ama
looking up to the next level
some of the outer workings
climbing the man way down an inclined shaft
find anything cool
cool thread op  you do this sort of thing often how rare is it to find a mine thats possible/safe to explore i imagine many of them have no entrance these days
did you find the loot
  cool did you find any artifacts how old are the mines you went inside
  do you have a fucking death wish   have you considered riding bulls instead
  id mostly be concerned with being exposed to dump chemicals used in process
  did you die
  a few parts of wooden dynamite boxes but nothing too great on this trip
  safe is relative we explore a few times a year it is getting harder an harder to find good mines to go into
  nothing of any real value just fun to explore
  no death wish just enjoy living was around rodeo a lot as a kid but never really like it not a fan of horses     old ore cart missing its wheels
  most chemicals used in mining are used during the milling process i am more worried about falling than anything else
  nope
how do you find your way around    do you bring a gas detector how do you know the air is safe
  we learn the tunnels as we go not too difficult climbing through stopes and into different levels makes it a tad more confusing    looking down an inclined shaft
headed back up inclined shaft
rough climb out
see or hear anything spooky op
  not really
hoist room
boards run on top of the braces for a large stope it was about 100 foot down to the bottom
miners graffiti from 1917 1919 and 1920
another inclined shaft that leads to lower levels didnt get to the bottom of this mine but i was told it has 8 lower levels that extended over 800 feet down
as usual the bats stayed asleep as we explored
where is the mine
  we visited 6 mines on this trip all in southern ca
  actual location though so that one can go to it this sounds very interesting
  please get the creature next time
have you located the cartels underground smuggling tunnels yet
  sorry im not giving out locations
  we just leave them alone    another bat hanging from a wire
  not yet but we will keep looking
ore chute that leads to a massive stoped out section
did you die
  is that white line a quartz vein no wonder they dug there
  nah the chemicals would be in the mill ruins
  find any cool artifacts yet a friend of mine found a pistol down in the bottom of a mine in washington
  it was a fault line some of the mines had a quartz vein that they followed
how do you keep track of your path to return to the exit assuming the caves split
  hard to get lost just get a little turned around from time to time larger mines usually have multiple exits
ill keep posting as long as there is interest
this is cool as fuck it looks like a lot of these walkways and scaffolds were hanging over some pretty good drops is that true or is it just the lighting making it look that way
  what do they look like when they walk
  death valley is in california you idiot
  the stoped out sections are usually around 100 feet down while the man ways that lead down shafts were hundred of feet up or down
  no idea
  fuck we have a geography major here the pic of the sign was from a mine i explored in arizona the have the coolest looking signs     this inclined shaft led 500 ft down to the bottom level of this mine
  this is some awesome shit really its very evocative to think that beneath that labyrinth of old scaffolding and haphazard shitty walkways the darkness is just the yawning abyss of a fatal plunge into the earth it almost seems unreal one of those remote corners of the world that dont play by the same rules as the rest of it what got you into doing this op if youre still around
  i grew up in mining towns in northern nevada as far as i know i come from six generations of miners my dad used to show me old mines and i fell in love with them the history of what guys were able to do over a hundred years ago still impresses me we all fall into the final abyss of earth but i want to enjoy the mines i love as much as possible
  also since you have the writing skills of a poet here is another pic for you    wood stacks like this are called cribbage they hold up tons of weight and are build in area that could cause catastrophic collapse
make a video / webm next time
  there are lots of abandoned mine video on youtube just go watch them i mostly take pics i do this for me not a youtube channel
    i appreciate these pictures and the others its not something im likely to see in person having no background in mines or particular inclination to enter abandoned ones without knowing what im doing    the cribbage is pretty cool too it and all the other derelict equipment really make you wonder just how many things are down there not just in the accessible mines but in ones that have been flooded or sealed or filled with unbreathable gas it seems like its all on such a grander scale than what the ancients did i wonder if archaeologists in the future will ever get to these places and find those initials torched onto the rock or other things we left behind i actually think about this shit pretty often time must slow to a near standstill in some of these deep places
  i think of it as documenting what we can while we can these guys did extraordinary thing
  agreed we stand on the shoulders of giants really its amazing what was accomplished to give us the life we have now its a shame that were squandering it
how was death valley  i always wanted to go there  the stars must be phenomenal
  my favorite part is how remote it is ive only been there in fall and winter months but i hear spring is the best time have driven through there a few times during the summer and it is miserable     the stars are great and so is the lack of noise
  find any cool mineral specimens i like to rockhound i live in florida so my collection is mostly fossils and calcite
  these mines had galena in them we have found lots of quartz iron ore copper ore wish i could tell you more but i dont know much about minerals
what time and weight does to timbering
  stop hoarding all that lost aztec/confederate/pirate gold op
  find your own treasure ill keep getting mine
  neat ama op  can you post more pics of the bats  you should try pat one next time
  more bats
  and more
  i dont touch them because i could give them white nose a fungal infection that will kill them and they may have rabies
  also just for you here is a pack rat hiding in a blast hole
more cribbage
  invest in rabies vaccine
  i dont want 6 shots to the stomach over a 6 week period so i just leave them alone
  know any cool mines in the san diego county area ive done the warlock mine and the ready relief mine and i now i want more especially now that the weathers cooling off and the desert areas are more accessible
  its only three shots for pre exposure prophylaxis in your arm better than dying if a bat touches you you may have been bit without knowing it    primary vaccination    three 10ml injections of hdcv or pcec vaccine should be administered intramuscularly deltoid area  one injection per day on days 0 7 and 21 or 28 vaccine preparations for intradermal administration are no longer available in the united states        t pharma fag
  those are pretty much the only good ones in sd a few prospect tunnels in dulzura blm     here is one
fuckkkk i want to go mine exploring now im going to find out which mine you went to and enter it myself too im going to go buy a 4x4 to see these cool areas
  just not going to fuck with them and not worry about it
  do what you got to do we all only get one life
  worryjpeg
  dont forget to grab the loot before caveanon finds it
super interesting topic and pics thanks for sharing op    what was the most dangerous situation you found yourself in while exploring
  honestly ladders have been fairy dangerous seeing they were made 100 years ago and from time to time the rungs break while climbing collapse is always a possibility i suppose most of what we do is dangerous
  yeah i was very cautious around this section of the mine
  i grab all the loot
ladder leads 300 ft up to an escape audit not a fun climb
  wood stacks like this are called cribbage they hold up tons of weight and are build in area that could cause catastrophic collapse  no theyre not theyre called fucking jenga its just what the miners did when they were bored learn your shit op
  did you check out panamint city worth the hike is louie still at the mine by porter peak cool crazy dude
  i havent gone to panamint city but i would like to   there are so many good places to check out in death valley i hate that it is an 750 mile drive for me now
  doesnt seem like a fun game to play underground but these guys were tough
how do you not just continuously shit yourself down there like one fucking minor collapse and you could be fucking entombed
  risk vs reward i would rather die doing something that i love than dying of old age wishing that i had done it
checked out any of the mines near joshua tree theres alot of smaller one and a few larger one that arent marked on many maps
  i have not been to ant mines around joshua i may have to do some research next time im in that area
  is this some kind of chute what do you think about tommy knockers
the chances of you dying are really high but please be sure to grab any well formed crystals that occur in pockets or holes in the rock i can identify them for you but not if you die
  yes it is an ore chute that leads to a stoped out section of the mine dont really want to talk about the knockers i never believed the old timers when i was a kid but i do believe in them now dont whistle in a mine never bring a red headed female in a mine and always leave food for the knockers
  next time im underground i will look for cool rocks for you
any tips on how to find mines that wont get you killed with gas or fucked in the ass by the government a minor fucking is cool    my uncle has several mines on his property but i could never go in due to gas warnings
  thats a nope from me senpai    but holy fuck  thats rad
  there is no such thing as a mine that wont get you killed honestly if you dont know what you are doing it is best to stay out
  yeah there are some super sketchy areas but there are also a lot of cool ones
headed down to next level
looking up
looking down    i will keep posting if interest
  awesome thread op
at one point there was a fire in this mine everything was covered in a thin layer of soot
  isnt it freezing down there
  no these mines were fairly warm mid to high 60s other mines ive been in have been below freezing
  underground
  cant argue with that
      um yeah anon this isnt something you can necessarily avoid theres a reason why most rabies protocols require postexposure prophylaxis even if the bat was only in the same room and the chance of contact was minimal you wont know if you are bitten     youre in a mine shaft with probably hundreds of bats freak incidents of rabies transmission without even so much as a bite are possible and have happened before the victims always die
  not op but tommy knockers are fucking real and fucking spooky tangentially related the borrego ghost lights are also real and also pretty spooky       i was more worried about that splintered support beam if im honest
  thats fucking awesome and scary like something out of a horror movie you look down as your climbing and your light catches a glimpse of some terrifying creature
i always enjoy your threads thanks for sharing
  drake
  do theres some cool ones with alot of equipment left over some have the steel grates over them but you can slip through if you lay on your back and pull yourself through
  bats are not a big concern of ours
  my pleasure
  who is drake
  i hope i make it down there sounds like a lot of fun
  i honestly believe in tommy knockers
  cute
  its cribbing or shoring
  slim
im a little late to the party great thread op    are old mines like this one generally at risk for catastrophic collapse
  tommy knockers  ive just googles and learned that this isnt only a nickname for boobs  thanks /out/
  they sure are
  yup
  who is slim
  every mine i have ever been in shows signs of collapse some of these mines have levels that cannot be reached due to collapsed tunnels
  tommyknockers as far as im concerned are not to be tried with if you feel a mine has them the best thing is to leave some food
  tommy knockers  is that waht i think it is
  i dont know what do you think it is
  qt tommy knocker
this thread is spooky and those mines look like a fucking death trap
  not death traps unless you dont know what you are doing
  never fuck with bats they carry all sorts of nasty zoonotic diseases like marburg sars ebola and many other emerging diseases
do you have a gas mask with you 
  like i said before i leave them alone 95 of the time the stay sleeping
  no we use dust masks gas masks would not help much
audit slowly collapsing
old homestead near mine probably built 1880s  1910s
another high desert mine 8500 ft elevation
pine tree growing into an audit
another one that has collapsed and we couldnt find entry
op what are the temperatures like in the mines
  main tunnels are in the 50s  60s the lower levels are a bit warmer usually in the 70s
head frame for lifting carts out of the mine
the ore and waste rock were dumped into the massive ore bins the ore was shipped of to a mill the waste rock was dumped off around the mine
the large areas around the massive ore bin is waste rock they built a rail road to go in there and collect the ore it must have been high grade ore
explosives locker or maybe a tool room im not sure
very well timbered portal leading into mine
image count reached     ill keep answering question if interest     be safe /out/ there boys and enjoy life while you can
post some /out/ hats

what are some good socks for a cold fucker
  i mean those socks right there
    ones made with merino wool
  these    with     as a liner
  people socks boi
  today i spent 70 on 3 pairs of these socks    seventy  dollars  on  three  pairs  of   socks      god help me
  wait till you see the price of merino wool silvers
  unconditional  lifetime  warranty
  in fairness ive had the same pair for 6 years and i wear them daily from mid november to early march ive heard smart wool has gone down in quality though so im dreading having to give up on darning mine
  you come out ahead in the long run
  smart wool i prefer it to darn tough socks because theyre thicker and better for cold weather when youre going to be wearing merino socks
    implying they wont be stolen away to the lost sock dimension
  same pair for 6 years  you mean socks or silvers
  wigwam ice socks are the warmest socks ive tried but theyre so thick you might not be able to get your feet into your boots
  hows this work with darn tough    you just mail in the old pair to them and they give you new ones for free    i just bought 3 pairs but it was like 50 dunno how this  nig nog got ripped off so badly
  ive got 3 pairs for 34 about a year ago but two of those are super thin low cut running socks havent used the warranty yet but apparently some gear stores will replace them for you or you fill out the form online and mail them to vermont for a couple dollars based off this example story  
  silvers sorry proofreading is important kids
  20 a pair plus conversion rates from usd to cad
  try here sale going on  
  i like my icebreakers but heard they wont live as long as darn tough i was just able to get icebreakers sub 58 a pair
check costco merino wool socks brand great for any shoe wicks moisture away breathable and thick
  unironically this
  tfw no fem boy to fuck in woods
  ive recycled 6 pairs 23 times each keep your receipts no problems then i wear holes in the ball of my foot doesnt matter what shoe fit or sock size
  tfw am fem boy and no bf to /out/ with
    do you guys even realize how gay you sound right now
  doubledubs say youre also gay and want to fuck 
multiple socks
put on normal socks  on them put thick wool socks that will be kinda loose or blood circulation in feet will get disturbed and youll get cold faster  make sure your boots lacing arent too tight see above  also remember  cold feet is a sign your body is cutting of blood from fingers to maintain the heat for more vital organs  so choose warmer wardrobe drink something hot or do some phisical excersize when that happens    t guy who just came back from 7h work in 4c
i picked up these 10 pairs for 20 on ebay merino wool very warm and hard wearing
  can you post a link to the ebay listing i cant find any that are that many socks for such a cheap price
  someone said maybe i got a bad batch but i had a pair of smartwool get holes after wearing them 2 or 3 times not consecutively
  this i layer regular wool blend hiking socks underneath a pair of wigwam socks fit snugly inside a pair of wellies or a pair of laceups with lots of give
  checked but being in a slow moving board like /out/ doesnt count
  anything smartwool
  id also recommend a pair of thin dress socks underneath to help 1 avoid blisters 2 keep a notable amount of sweat from getting into the socks
  darn tough  /endthread
  i do this    i suggest this     pic unrelated
i only trust darn tough fit amazing indestructible
1 for darn tough have a few worn out pairs as well that i need to send back
do you guys agree with these parking passes that they force you to have in both national and state parks i mean i get that it helps out the park but sometimes they requires these in areas that they dont need to and i have doubts that they use the money wisely
  i am not so poor that 5 is going to kill my hopes of going to a state park get a job and pay like the rest of us to help maintain the park or find somewhere else to go
  i think they should do a lottery for free passes and then if you lose the lottery then you can purchase a pass for some amount of money they need to limit access to a lot of areas in the name of protecting it for future generations but at the same time they need to allow people with less disposable income access to the parks
  this
  the usfs does pass lotteries for protected areas like the enchantments in washington after the lottery is over a limited number of walk up passes are available
  this jesus fucking christ
  get a job and pay like the rest of us to help maintain the park or find somewhere else to go  assuming you are white middle class and/or above you already fund the entirety of us social benefit programs considering that same demographic white middle and up comprises the overwhelming majority of state/nat park visitors taxes like these essentially amount to nothing more than a jim crowesque poll tax on whites pretending like the people who visit and utilize state/nat parks arent the ones already supporting them is laughably disingenuous
tbf we wouldnt have to charge for a lot of shit if we werent subsidizing military defense for half the fucking planet
just hike to the place youre going to hike and stop being a faggot
  so stop being a nigger jew and pay the 5 fucking dollars it is less than you pay for your morning coffee you fucking cheap ass is your self entitlement so deep that you can not help the outdoors that you claim to like 995 of my taxes go to shit causes like food stamps for fat niggers so when they ask me to pay 5 to get into a state park i spend 25 and get a year long pass grow the fuck up
  back to /pol you autist
  so stop being a nigger jew and pay the 5 fucking dollars   is your self entitlement so deep that you can not help the outdoors that you claim to like  i already have an annual state park pass but that doesnt mean i cant criticize an unjust tax or law when i see one and these sorts of taxes are unjust for a few reasons one because they further tax the same group that already pays for essentially the entire gov budget and secondly because they punish people for wanting to go /out/ this is foolish what we desperately need is to encourage more people from all backgrounds to go /out/ and get in touch with nature people will never care about the environment if it is just some abstract concept they never interact with the notion that increased visitation to natural areas will destroy the environment is ridiculous if anything it will encourage people to fund and prioritize the survival of our natural world by expanding our existing wild areas and creating new ones
  i find it very funny that you think charging a parking fee at a trailhead is the same level of unfairness as denying an entire population demographic the right to participate in governance  are trail parking fees unfair and mostly paid by middle class whites yeah is that the same as jim crow laws denying blacks the right to vote for their own representation in government not even close
  amerimutts need to pay to use public land  i dont know how you can handle so much freedom        yo goy just pay them shekels  the absolute state of tripfags
  i find it very funny  thats because you didnt understand or more likely intentionally misrepresented my point its unjust because it specifically targets a specific ethnic/cultural group whether or not its intentional in this case it is not is irrelevant it would be no different than specifically taxing public basketball courts in the innercity to target black people     is that the same as jim crow laws denying blacks the right to vote for their own representation in government not even close  see above intent is irrelevant in this case a law that targets a group based on their ethnicity/culture has no place in the us
  i suggest you actually look at where your tax dollars go for almost all of the us tax money attributed to preservation of /out/ is at the very bottom pay your local park fees it makes a difference seriously unless you want the us to be like europe where you camp under a hedgerow then help pay to protect our nature
  it doesnt intentionally discriminate against whites its an unfortunate circumstance that mostly whites pay the fees but nonwhites are subject to the fees   jim crow laws were specifically and intentionally written to discriminate against blacks i understand the point youre trying to make and im not misrepresenting it in any way im just pointing out that they are not the same at all in either intent or severity but thank you for playing i look forward to you further trying to prove that youre the victim of the same discrimination as antebellum blacks
   need to pay to use public land  we have more state and national park land than you have country get big bent
  ameritard makes uninformed statement  color me surprised    кoгдa yзнaют aмepикaнcкиe cвиньи
  russia  only cnn cares about you go squat in a corner and cry vlad
  also considering that nps and usfs are partnering with companies like rei to try and increase minority /out/ activity you cant even argue that it unfairly targets whites because theyre literally actively trying to get nonwhites to go /out/ and pay thus pay the same fees  but please dont let me ruin your game of im the most oppressed i know its a favorite pastime of selfabsorbed millennials
  where is the nps making you get a parking pass
  pay your local park fees it makes a difference   i do as i have already said several times   but localizing taxes around these kind of public spaces is unjust and inefficient its unjust because low income areas are unable to fund said public entity to the same degree as more affluent areas this same dynamic plays out in our public schools further exacerbating wealth/class inequalities it is also inefficient in that people overwhelmingly vote against tax plans that do not benefit them directly and since /out/stuff is niche already this means preserving/maintaining wild areas will forever be a low priority       it doesnt intentionally discriminate against whites  i literally said it was not intentional in my post but intent is irrelevant in this case because the outcome unfairly targets a specific group     but thank you for playing  id recommend you spend less time playing and more time improving your reading comprehension skills       also considering that nps and usfs are partnering with companies like rei to try and increase minority /out/ activity you cant even argue that it unfairly targets whites because theyre literally actively trying to get nonwhites to go /out/ and pay thus pay the same fees  this is nonsense a halfassed virtue signal by a few globalist corporations is not a solution     but please dont let me ruin your game of im the most oppressed i know its a favorite pastime of selfabsorbed millennials  oppression like most things in life is relative to the individual it isnt a competition its simply acknowledging injustice when you see it
  they need to allow people with less disposable income access to the parks    public transportation quite a few parks in my area are well served by bus routes
why do push cut saws still exist
  they are a specific tool for a specific job learn to distinguish what tool you need for the job use crosscut for perpendicular to the grain cuts and ripcut for parallel to the grain cuts of the crosscut saws a push or pull saw is chosen depending on the type of wood you are cutting through and/or the job at hand that distinction usually doesnt matter in most cases outside of fine wood working
  silky  pull saw  what did op mean by this
  silky saws are pull cut tho not push cut which is vastly inferior
  that was my point i think i missed the point op was making by posting the shot of the silky i love silkys     the last company i worked for was talking about banning silkys as they were the main source of injuries they were suggesting all sorts of cooky ways to prevent us from nicking ourselves with them everything from chain mail gantlets to just making us use a chainsaw the whole time the office people couldnt come to terms with the fact that silky nicks are pretty much an accepted occupational hazard
  why does the one in the op have both push and pull teeth like a bucking crosscut saw    because it is actually a mini bucking saw
  this shit is why everyone hates hs they should just focus on the big stuff like stopping people from lopping off their own limbs with a chainsaw ffs it isnt rocket surgery
    yeah i think it is more about hiring people who are not morons i mean shit ive never cut myself with anything since i was like 12yo and i use a shit load of dangerous equipment 5 days out of any week people who got injured or someone else injured in shop class back in high school failed the entire class instantly and were banned from the shop forever they were basically told they shouldnt ever work with such tools for the rest of their life the fate of one banned person was to die in a chainsaw accident a few years later at home he cut the top of his thigh and bled out before he could get very far he was completely by himself of course
  unironically this you wouldnt hire an out of shape softcock to be a cop or a 70yo retired midget to be a lumberjack
  lol this same experience in high school wood shop in nz had a south african teacher who went on about safety credits told a story about how one student who was a rugby player literally pissed himself when the table saw kicked back some people are accident prone and lack the self awareness but shit still happens to the best of us know a lot of people who have no training with chainsaws and have fucked themselves up big time
  to be fair table saws aint nothing to fuck with
  you wouldnt hire an out of shape softcock to be a cop    i wouldnt but it seems every single police force disagrees
  add woman to that list at least here in europe anyway
    so much this 98 of all accidents are due to people not following basic safety guidelines  either because they are unaware how to abide by them or because they dont care the former need to do some reading/get instructions and the latter should just fuck off  almost any tool can fuck you up if you dont treat it with respect
    the biggest thing ive seen after someone actually learns all the proper safety procedures and how to use a tool is spacial awareness and self awareness some people simply dont have spacial awareness for anything another thing is that employers and teachers sorta dont always understand that or how to look out for it people who dont have at least good spacial awareness shouldnt be allowed around tools that can cause harm to themselves or others like driving a fucking car teaching spacial awareness takes a great deal of effort the only time ive ever seen someone teach it was the high schools football coach he made it so that all players on the team could tackle each other at any time at all while they were on school grounds thats including class after a few tackles people really started being aware of their surroundings    self awareness is a difficult one too the most important aspect is how tired you are people tend to think they need to work through their tiredness the tiredness may be lack of sleep over working over several days or just muscle pain from doing on thing too much and not taking a 30 second break to let the ache leave their muscles in shop class we were trained to watch each other for fatigue of any kind because someone elses fatigue can get you killed as well as themselves killed
what exactly does a bahco laplander do better than a silky or even a corona the bahco is the most popular but a corona is about the same price or cheaper and cuts dry or wet timber twice as fast with half the effort

so i am in the market for a decent jacket i am located on the shore of nc and i was looking at a waxed barbor or filson jacket anyone know if these are just /fa/ or can i go /out/ with one and not hate my self any better recommendations preferably ones that are /out/ worthy and are able to be worn around town trying to get a qt
  wax it yourself  just get a canvas shirt in a big enough size to wear warm stuff under it and then buy some beeswax  youll save like 100150
  this dont be stupid op and buy into the brand game spend a quarter of the price and do it yourself go to the local good will purchase a nice used canvas jacket or shirt and then buy some fabric wax online you may end up spending all of 15 dollars
  i did the whole flecktarn/memetarn german parka dyed it dark and then waxed it i liked it so much for /out/ and /fa/ purposes i bought a second and a heat gun heat gun is nice for other tasks warming up engines stuck bolts whatever but makes waxing a hell of a lot easier jackets are robust warmer than goretex and work well
is it remotely possible for someone who is poor to escape all the intrusions of corporations scammers solicitors and government bureaus into your life ive considered buying some kind of vehicle to live in just to get the fuck away from the constant harassment and intrusions shadowrun sucks ass i want to be left the fuck alone
oy vey
  id check this link out        hes got a really good 21 step plan on the side of the page
  i hate to say it annon but no somehow someway you have to pay taxxes and gas and all the other forms of bs and if you dont thats against the law   is it possible yes  is it legal no
  doing this will bring more corps govt and harassment into your life unless you buy a remote piece of land you will be constantly harassed everyone wants to know who you are what youre doing there plus the scamming thieving methheads are always a threat
living the lifestyle you desire is not that hard you can buy massive swathes of developed land in places like montana which will allow you to live as off the grid as you want 200k will get you 20 acres a massive house a massive barn and an incredible view but youll be lonely as shit expect to not even have a paved access road a dirt/gravel county road is likely all you get and that will largely be inaccessible during the winter but yeah its not hard to live that lifestyle just annoying
  second question how can you actually do real damage to a major corporation i mean like financial fucking ruin
  i know the poorer you are the more the corporategovernment parasite wants to pinch your pennies and nullify your existence ive about had fucking enough
  nah some prick with a clipboard will be wanting his taxes every month for land you own they make it hard on purpose unless youre incontinently wealthy just expect to toil until youre useless real advice is find something you can tolerate and do that for the next 70 years
  200k for 20 acres a small parcel of whats basically wasteland fucking outrageous why is everything so expensive that normal people can never afford it
  already am but these fucking pests just wont stop regardless of how much i swat
  200k  kill yourself i mean it you are human cancer
  escape all the intrusions of corporations scammers solicitors and government bureaus into your life  move to central africa and hope and pray you dont get culturally enriched or caught up in the weekly ethnic cleansing du jour
  because jeff bezos and erik prince need more billions          literally have to live in a fucking active warzone to escape the human parasite sickening

      americans have zero conception of how bad social mobility is in their country
  nah they tend to overestimate how fucked it is    average americans arent that much more ignorant than other people its just that dumb americans dont know how dumb they sound a dumb canadian knows to keep his mouth shut
  nah they tend to overestimate how fucked it is  this is a blatant lie we may as well be living under feudalism its so bad lazy 3rd generation heirs are always telling everyone how lazy they all all for working their asses off and being poor this country is fucking aids
  working their asses off and being poor  t someone that has a 27 hr/wk part time mcjob and spends the rest of his days in front of his 60 4k oled tv playing one of his 3 currentgen game consoles while browsing 4chan on a 1600 mbp
  what the fuck is social mobility love tehse retarded metrics that europoors come up with to substantiate their pathetic lives
  another american triggered by reality intruding on his steady diet of bullshit corporate propaganda
  project mayhem
  fight club  fucking plebeian and disgusting
  its a measure of the movement of people across social classes this typically measured by comparing lifetime earnings from people relative to their parents irrespective of social class     a highly meritocratic society would have a high social mobility index whereas a society with a rigid class system would show a low index comparing this index from the usa to other countries indicates that the usa is less meritocratic than american culture seems to suggest
  translation for the dumb americans capitalism is antimeritocratic rich people have never once bootstrapped their ancestors are simply lucky or criminals and they inherit wealth then spread lies
      yeah thats a stupid metric there is no meritocracy in the jungle stupid people are poor and smart people are wealthy
  although largely right this view denies agency of individuals to some extent there are certainly examples of rich people bootstrapping but they are few and far between you dont want to end up in a situation where you cease to emphasise personal responsibility for individuals life outcomes     meritocratic society is an unreachable ideal the issue is how best to approach it i believe most western countries have figured this out by ensuring there is a strong social safety net in place and quality education available to all classes in society the fact that these countries are the best countries in which to be a median citizen is compelling evidence for this conclusion imo
    this is mostly true but how is it right that smart children of stupid people will forever be hamstrung by their parents choices    conversely how is it right that stupid children of smart people should have access to things smarter and poorer people dont
  donald trump kanye west kim kardashian paris hilton nancy pelosi etc ad nauseam are real real smart    capitalism  meritocracy is nothing but a lie spread by aristocrats to prevent their heads going choppy in the guillotine
greed for money is the root of all evil
  the gross heathenism of civilization has generally destroyed nature and poetry and all that is spiritual  these tempel destroyers devotees of ravaging commercialism seem to have a perfect contempt for nature and instead of lifting their eyes to the god of the mountains lift them to the almighty dollar
  lol fuck you faggot    i will kill you for the rich people
  this is what americans actually belive    where do propose is better
  no one is being hamstrung except by their parents if your mom got knocked up my some subhuman then blame her poor people get lots of undeserved benefits anyway like free food college and medical but they cant fix iq by poor breeding choices
  you may try i will kill your entire species
  not only will they not leave you alone but theyll actively make a point of harassing you even more for trying to be free of them
  hurr kill da rich cuz they have more than me  what a nigger
  kill they rich because theyre actively turning the world to hell in order to be richer
  the rich
  let me explain it in another way    the rich and the globalist corporate banking clan are two separate concepts one simply has a lot of money they can be good bad or neutral with that money and the power it brings the other group is comprised of the most evil people on earth raised to worship pain and evil since birth these people used dirty tricks and assassins constantly throughout history to secure their placement at the very top falsely thinking they are enlightened despite a hatred for the truth    it is those globalists that are the real enemy of mankind
  implying poor people dont do 100000000x more damage to the world than the rich    i mean the entire reason africa has always been a shithole is its always been inhabited by poor people its short time under european colonial rule has been its richest and incidentally its least shit from every other perspective
  and if we were able to bring down their entire control grid monetary information physically spiritually we would see a new age of technology prosperity and unity that we can only dream of
its frustrating as hell to see people simply say fuck the rich because they dont understand how theyre really under attack and who is mastermind of the whole operation
  but muh afriiikkkkkaaaa  the west consumes more resources than anyone      the rich and the globalist corporate banking clan  yes in your head thats how you keep your stuipid neonazi philosophy while shoving all blame onto jews if whites do something bad its actually good you see but if jews do the very same theyre evil banker jews i know your bullshit better than you know it yourself this is nothing but coping with cognitive dissonance your bullshit is evil but you benefit from it youre not a good person nor are you intelligent
  the people saying fuck the rich actually are the rich ones
  literally the rich i fail to see how the mental illness of subjugating billions for infinitely increasing material wealth you literally cant ever use is acceptable
  es in your head thats how you keep your stuipid neonazi philosophy while shoving all blame onto jews  i am not a neonazi you stupid motherfucking npc stop defaulting to programmed insults and think    think and do research please
  i assure you i am not rich fuck the rich
  because some rich people albeit a rarity actually empower the people around them and want to see everyone succeed
  i am not a neonazi you stupid motherfucking npc
  oh no dont call me a racist please ill shutup  oh no dont call me an antisemite please  shut your bitch mouth the jewish lobby completely controls us foreign policy and aipac isnt even registered as a foreign agent operating in the us the globalists arent exclusively jewish but about 75
  too many backups of important documents onsite and offsite to truly cripple a big corporation financially by blowing up their buildings
  oh no dont let him call out the elite rothschild that are ruling everyone by name quick call him a nazi
  make me weakling    the globalists arent exclusively jewish but about 75  not even fucking remotely correct you just reclassify any white billionaire making a mess as not a globalist and wipe your hands dont call other people npcs when youre this fucking dumb
  he actually believes that list of the richest is accurate  he deliberately ignores dark money because it would shatter his narrative to pieces in seconds
letting boomers and their mentally defective zoomer grandchildren have access to the internet was a mistake      literally anything you say is wrong because of my circular reasoning  checkmate atheshits  god damn youre retarded
  circular reasoning  learn what words mean before you use them tard banking clans still hold all the power
or to think about it another way why the fuck would you trust the establishment to give you figures on the most powerful people on the planet a lot of those shadowy figures are actually anonymous to the world the rest are proud of it but know they have to brag in subtle ways to prevent a critical mass of people all waking up at the same time
  the west consumes more resources than anyone  china and india account for over 60 of the global resource consumption and nearly 80 of the global pollution nice try but fucking no
  these filthy pinkos always lie about everything i hate them
  first off define poor  second you cannot avoid taxation period
    denmark norway finland sweden spain belgium australia japan portugal korea     us doesnt do too bad slightly below oecd average
  living paycheck to paycheck or not having a job at all using any type of government welfare still living at home with your parents being a nigger overall
  raised 3 kids on blue collar work yeah it was paycheck to paycheck sometimes still found a way to buy a house and build equity it wasnt a quick fix or easy it was tough at times tough like selling tools vidya systems or whatever else it took to make rent early on     seems to me that this up and coming generation just doesnt want to buck up and work hard sacrifice now for what you want later its a shame really yes life is unfair yes people will have things you wont ever have so what  work hard play hard chase your dreams having the life you want is attainable its only on you to make it happen
  seems to me that this up and coming generation just doesnt want to buck up and work hard  sacrifice now for what you want later
  you are both and dont even know it good luck in the real world the first time you leave mommys basement
  can i recommend that if you want to live like this consider outback australia     buy yourself one of those tiny homes or a camper van and just go bush try to make friends at outback pubs and chase down work on some of the big ranches to carry you on with fuel    alternatively you can do it in stages do casual work for a few months then disappear for the rest of the year and live off near nothing    i know your feels op it is very hard ultimately though the happiest route is trying to get yourself a property that you own and just minimise the interactions if youre a good goy and play by the rules you generally will be left alone on your property
  oh it is for sure
  at least you are in a first world country like the us and even if you are in a dire need of some money you can start flipping burgers or pumping gas for at least decent money  i have the same dream as you im in my mid 20s but i already dream about buying some land and a cottage in the countryside and fucking off the problem is im in an eastern european shithole where even people with more decent jobs like lets say bank clerk make around 700800 euros monthly at best the plus side is that things are relatively cheap here so you can easily live a comfortable life with that money or at least pay your bills never go hungry have some money for gas etc but if you plan on saving for some bigger purchase or have the sudden need to repair or renovate something you are screwed  and when i say salaries in the 800 euros range that people in the cities if you move to the bumfuck countryside you wont be making even half that so you have to depend on eating whatever you grow yourself thats why im trying to figure out some online business where i can make at least a decent income while living more frugally and having the time and money to maintain a countryside lifestyle

  i know people making 6 figures that live paycheck to paycheck because they have expensive tastes and poor money management skills and i know people making 35k/yr with hundreds of thousands banked because they live simply that is the most retarded metric for poor you could have possibly come up with
     well its true my parents worked their way up from the projects to the upper middle class in 20 years
  same  grandparents libed in a 1 room dirt floor shanty built off native handsawn lumber as tenant farmers worked their way up to living in a nice 4 bed/3 bath house in town and owning 600 acres  dad couldnt afford college and grandparents couldnt help him because they blew every spare penny they had putting his older brother thru college joined the military and went through ocs retired at 46 after 22 years in now teaches hs algebra and between salary and pension is making around 150k/yr in a small farming town where 26k/yr is livable living like a king
  buy it strip its assets shut it down this kind rape and murder is fully legal
  africa is a shit hole because niggers are lowiq subhumans     look at what theyre doing to the west

  one reason for poor social mobility in the us is poor education which you have demonstrated by not knowing the difference between possible and best in the world
    no what you do is park your car and backpack into public land coming back to your car for food and water then going back in dont exceed 14 day limits and you wont be harassed    also you have to be okay with living in a tent but fug it you want to be alone this is how you do it
is there any youtube channels similar to vek0 with his food tutorials
why is it that i never hear anything about ll bean boots i got a pair recently for the hell of it and because of the nice warranty and they seem pretty good thick leather relatively nice stitching waterproof relatively comfy etc for the price they seem pretty quality so far so why does nobody talk about them especially with that warranty  pic related is boots i purchased
that warranty is no longer lifetime
  the older ones were much better when they had the lifetime warranty then there was a real benefit to buying from them my grandfather had a pair of crestas from the 80s90s that he passed down to me theyre still going strong although i only use them occasionally ive also got a pair of the newer crestas that ive used pretty much daily for four or five years now that have held up longer than any other boot ive owned theyre still waterproof and look decent with a fresh polish albeit theyre a bit heavy compared to whatever the newest meme hiking boot is
  how can i tell from that picture you are 300 pounds of neckbeard
id like to say the most significant drawback to them is that they make you a faggot but those look pretty excellent to me what is the model ive just checked the llb site and cannot find them for further investigation as best i can tell id prefer those to my merrells
   sorry anon close but no cigar 165 lbs of college kid  top kek though good try
  if i remember correctly they are the katahdin iron works boots theyve treated me well so far
  its still a damn good warranty    because theyre not fancy enough for the yuppies to rock them everywhere outside if boston and portland and hardcore outdoorsman seem to have some weird grudge against them for not making all their shit ultralight like its great your fucking rain jacket weighs 05 ounces less than mine but mine didnt fucking rip on a bush like yours did
  this seems more or less to be the case ive never had one of their products break on me   i just read up on their guarantee and you can return it within a year for any reason and if the product fails past a year you can also return it so basically if you arent retarded then its basically still lifetime a great warranty still albeit slightly less great than it used to be
i wear pic related and they are comfy and work well havent really got them soaked yet  looking for something better for winter hikes though i dont really know what better means
  i think what the anon said about not being yuppie enough is true i almost got the same pair being from maine originally i like to support beans when i can i think those boots are made by chippewa i went with red wing iron rangers instead but i do have a pair of maine hunting shoes with the fleece liner that are my winterhunting boots
  but mine didnt fucking rip on a bush like yours did  this is my main issue with most of the superlight stuff yeah it looks like itll just shred apart at a poke i feel if i go out with one of those light day packs that ill end up with all my shit everywhere when a seam pops and ill just have a useless bit of plastic where once a bag existed
  granted i know most of the stuff is more durable than it looks
  mfw i am such a new england yuppie my parents have matching bean boots      feels good
  ll bean catalogs are 10/10 fap bait frens
  not fancy enough for the yuppies  maybe but fuck if i dont see a pair of bean boot or some offbrand duck boots on every other college girls feet once it gets chilly out theyre like uggs but for 20somethings with better taste     great boots though i love em
be advised that ll bean has steadily shifted towards being more antigun over the last decade dont support gun grabbers buy elsewhere
what about those mofos hold whatever shit i throw at them and all they need is to break in
258 recycled edition    previous thread      thinking about picking up a new hobby want to get a memecaster havent mastered the palomar knot click here         talk about fishin
first
  first for bowfin
how big of a meme are interline rods  also why is 72 objectively the best overall rod length for bait and life fishing
  life fishing    wot
  you
  lure fishing i mean
  you got it wrong twice in a row thats nice have another you
been working 60 hour weeks to save up for this bad boy right here the ice is literally knocking at the door here in michigan well be on hard water by christmas for sure
  frabill    spend the extra money on a nice clam or an otter everyone ive talked to who bought a frabill shanty said they are pretty shitty quality     im looking forward to getting my new one man clam out of the box in a few weeks
  what about eskimo like the cheap 150 dollar two person shanty i probably wouldnt fish in the negatives too often and if i did i have a wooden shanty to use
anyone have any experience specifically targeting trout through the ice
    every time people talk about ice fishing it makes me nostalgic for the long dark where i spent 6 months trekking from ice hole to ice hole and the island doing nothing but fishing and rabbit trapping unfortunately it doesnt make me nostalgic for local ice fishing since theres been nothing but shitty warm weather the past 15 years and no freeze overs thick enough to walk on safely
  havnt heard many bad things about eskimo if it were me id take the eskimo over the frabill       no but i plan on trying a lot for them this winter since im surrounded by brook trout ponds and good lake trout water
  if i had the extra money id get an otter but god damn 1300 for a shanty is outrageous and clam isnt much cheaper
was pretty funny was down at the lake on saturday fishing was a hispanic guy down there just riding a bike we got to talking for at least 15 or more minutes were using his cellphone to talk to each other using google voice translation gotta get around to uploading the video hella funny video
bought a pack of these off amazon and some blugil ones i tried them out but got a bit intimidated that i wasnt gonna catch any thing with them and i know i didnt give them a long enough chance using them but had to decide do i want to catch fish or do i wanna be out here catching nothing just because i didnt catch anything with them doesnt mean that they wouldnt hit them some other day all i know is using the yum worms i was landing fish   was a cloudy day fishing but still i was using like a black and blue color yum worm and was able to catch fish im not sure how to fish a bait like this
  no one wants to see your cringe compilation fatty     go post your gay shit somewhere else   
  someone is mad that people catch fish and arent scared to show their face  poor fella do youve bad acne and scared to show your face or are you a registered sex offender whos scared to show his face
  i catch more fish and am objectively better looking than that fat piece of shit ever will be anonymity is important and having faggots like that think this is their personal blog is embarrassing and shows how new they are they need to fuck off or make themselves a trip so everyone can filter their posts like all the other trip faggots     but yeah no keep gate keeping for that fat fatty
  yeah
  im too beautiful to show my face if i did you would all fall in love and it would ruin your current relationships    also i havent been fishing in months
this may be the worst striper year of my life next striped bass moratorium when
  fish shallow fertile water early in the day im talking like 5 fow flat if the lake has one if there is a weedline even better they come cruising up in small groups in the early morning for feeding then head deeper later in the day and feed less a lot of times you can sight fish them which is extremely fun shoot for typical structures during the day like deep points or dropoffs especially rocky ones if you have browns as they feed on crayfish    browns act almost like walleye and feed mostly on minnows and crayfish rainbows are weird as fuck and can do anything from being a normal predator to swimming around just under the ice in 100 feet of water and feeding on plankton that might just be because the rainbows in my area are mostly stocked while the browns are wild though
check my channel cat out new pr for me was caught on a 3in live brim
  hey thats a nice fish 12 pounds
went down to bps and finger fucked pic related  was severely underwhelmed by it when handling in person which is a shame since its a beautiful color but glad i saved myself the buyers remorse  does this happen to anyone else
    anybody know of any channels with spearfishing or even just normal fishing videos like this one i am a freshwaterlet and will never be able to spearfish so i love watching videos like these everything english i can find on youtube is just blaring music and badass montages with disjointed clips i love that dudes style because its mostly longer clips that display the hunt rather than just the shooting alongside some generally nice underwater footage of stuff    i just want to watch long videos of comfy spearfishing dammit
    the best channel imho for spearfishing in greece used to dive a lot but work stress smoking and age has destroyed my free diving skills much like in most of the med scuba spear fishing is illegal and ofc frowned upon due to spearfishing tradition and the greek topography longest coast line after norway in the eu and like 7th or 8th in the world combined with deep waters we have one of the most active communities in freediving spearfishing in the world   pic related my bestest catch ever at 28mtrs depth
  hell yeah thats exactly the kind of thing i was looking for thanks anon
  i got my first cod on top water today i missed a second hit but it was still exciting to see
      i recall someone on /out/ posting their spearfishing video it was the funniest god dam thing ive watched in awhile    does someone have it the dude had funny edits and stuff throughout the video
         nevermind i found it
apparently i might be moving to reno nevada soon is reno good for the /out/ life pic unrelated
ive got a buddy out in that ballpark and he says its pretty alright youll be within reasonable distance of some neat national forests plus lake tahoe is gorgeous  if driving to california isnt your thing theres always the deserts on the nv side
  proximity to tahoe is nice
  i never spent much time in reno when i lived nearby but as the other guy said you have hundreds of miles of national forest just to the west of you obviously tahoe which is crowded but since you live there you can go to the good spots    lassen is pretty cool with the volcano and lava fields i remember pyramid lake and the wild horses being pretty cool as a kid that whole high desert area is neat and make sure to go to the virginia city ostrich/emu races if they still have them    i just remember reno as depressing but now that i think about it its probably a decent place to live if youre not a tweaker
quick question anons from camping noob what tree produces god tier firewood
  ash
  you lucky eastern anons
  oh shit nice i got a good one near me thanks brother
  birch
  depends oak burns hot and long birch usually burns fast at first but its great because the bark is always flammable even when wet cherry maple and apple have amazing smells but be careful fruit trees need to season a little longer or theyre toxic dont burn pine unless you have no choice the smoke is toxic and if you use it in a fireplace it lines your chimney with enough creosote to make a mile of railroad ties plus its kind of annoying how it burns consult this shitty infographic that i barely read
  manchineel
  is that why its called ash
  dead
  /b i r c h b o i s/  make you some of that sweet birch syrup and birch tea  
  birch 100/1 sap/syrup ratio    maples have a 40/1 syrup ratio and the sap from maples doesnt go bad as fast as birch sap
eucalyptus
can we all just take a minute to recognize how much beech sucks  splits like ass  burn hot and fast  leaves no coals
  poison ivy burns well
i dont know what type of shit theyre made of but these soda cup lids burn better than anything they burn hot they burn long theyre basically free theyre very light as long as you dont breathe the soot and make sure to wait until theyre completely burned off for you to start cooking theyre the perfect firestarter    but environment but climate change  we have more serious problems than some guy burning soda lids in the woods
  the wrapper on cough drops halls for example is ussually fatty/waxy and burns very well too
  ive never actually had birch sap and doent maple sap have to be refined to be made into a syrup can you just eat it as is straight from the tap
  delet
  birch sap yea its delicious sweet and with a very light refreshing flavor had a beer brewed with it once as well and it was delicious too
  its just maple flavored slightly thick water straight from the tree its something like 50 gallons of sap makes 1 gallon of syrup
  burns smoky maybe it takes longer to dry than other woods but even low dead branches always smoke me out
  eucalyptus trees make very good hardwood firewood if you can source it i live in tasmania so this isnt much of a problem
  that would be polystyrene same stuff as styrofoam only without the air bubbles
  kek
western juniper it seasons quickly it crackles and pops wonderfully and it smells amazing  it is a bitch to split though its really fibrous and frequently grows weird shapes and gnarls that are hard to bust through
  can you elaborate on your views on pine wood your source aswell as im sure youre pretty far out here
  beech is actually pretty good as for splitting do it when its green and git gud   
  pine for starter and oak for the long run  t louisiana
  god tier for starting fires though
another noob    how do you shower i remember doing mountain man rendezvous and venture scouting but i scarcely remember showering if we did it was in a large pine outhouse which sucked ass  ive seen those tent style stalls for showering but what about a steel tub and some firewood
  also releases styrene when burned insanely bad for your health if you breathe it in
  pic related
  now were talkin
  this
  pine wood toxic  nigga what
mesquite  t texan
  ask your firewood dealer
  agreed
  cracks and shatters instead of splitting cleanly
  best way i found to start a fire at least where i live is to find a pine of some kind as they usually have low hanging branches that are dead and dry pick all the tiny little sticks up and wrap them up like a cigar usually goes up pretty good then can add dry hardwood or more pine if needed pine makes a fuck load of smoke though burns really quick too if no lines are around i would say birch bark
  lol had a problem of wet wood so took a rag and wiped the bottom of my truck and soaked up all the oil and whatnot made a nice fire starting torch
  splits fine    you are sounding like a soiboi beech is fine
  can confirm burns hot at fuck for a decent amount of time and leaves a good coal bed
  i think i just came a little
    which is why i said not to fuckin breathe it nigga
related question how do yall dry out your fire wood if youre camping in the snow or after a rain storm like you hike to your site and everything is wet what do you do
  split it first most of the time theres some dry wood inside the logs    then once i manage to get a fire going i stack my wood around it to dry it out
  cutting down an old dead standing tree is your best bet it will be a lot drier than anything lying on the ground
i always felt like cherry burned longer than any of the other trees around me     t heat my home with wood fire stove

  its stupid and it sucks
  based and blueberried
seems like a great way to live if youre not attached to high comfort and you like the outdoors     would avoid parking near roads too much for the fume inhalation
  how to end up as a hobo/10
  i think living in a van sucks
ive heard negative things
isnt life just crazy sometimes
  whats it like living in a house    i plan on living in my campervan im doing up i think it depends on how you do it is it a sleeping bag in the back of a ford econovan or is it a fully decked ouy rv    i think if you can work out what your minimum is to be comfortable and if you can figure out where youll park/where you can access a shower or toilet etc its not so bad
its dirt cheap living invest the money you save by not paying rent in winter its cold in summer its hot in my land hot is worst because it can take most of the night for the van to radiate enough heat for the interior to reach a temperature cool enough to sleep in or just not at all    its super easy to travel a fridge and extra couple of batteries would be a wise investment
  just buy an old rv instead you will be better off assuming you live in place with winter 0 celcius and below buy also insulation mats in any given construction yard and secure the inside
  i worked with a guy that did this for a year he was constantly being hassled by the cops and always smelled like mildew despite taking a shower at the gym right before work
  its all spin  living in a van down by the river  river front tiny house close to nature walks  eating government cheese   charcuterie platter
i live in a semi truck half the year and the other half in a van doing /out/ no rent ever i spent six month straight camping fishing kayaking hiking and climbing then i go back to work in the truck  houses are over rated unless you have kids not worth the money
  i lived in my sedan for 2 months while traveling around the us it was quite comfy i removed the glove box and passenger head rest and had about 7 feet of space to lie down on the passenger seat folded flat to meet the rear seats i threw several pillows on the rear seats and was golden      buy front/rear window sun shades and then sun shade made from spandex material to cover the side windows i would also tint your windows if you like privacy    blankets for the cold or a nice sleeping bag   japanese hario hand powered coffee grinder do this at night pour in some water and come morning youll have a very strong cup of coffee the grains settle into a cake at the bottom so you can drink it without a filter    get an inverter so you have a 120v plug for your laptop and other electronics   canned food baked beans chili thick soups bread and butter non irish cultured butter doesnt liquify in the heat and stays fresh for awhile if sealed   810 gallons of water for drinking bathing brushing teeth you can fill these up at a gas station for free for bathing you just need a gallon soak soap rinse    710 days worth of clothes detergent for the laundromat    fork/spoon/knife a bowl and two smaller bowls or cups for drinking sealable   plastic bags for trash keep these away from your living space cause it smells dump at a gas station    kindle for reading youll have lots of time    clean your car every 12 weeks its a small space where youll be eating and sleeping   never sleep in the same place two nights in a row unless its 100 legal look on google maps search for green areas then satellite view to find a place to pull off and sleep in peace avoid busy roads try to have 34 places to rotate through in one area    i recommend you go out to a restaurant 23 times a week so you dont go crazy on canned food tell people youre traveling and theyll immediately be interested in talking with you
  mm what else    there are places to poop in most national parks always carry a roll of toilet paper and paper towels and wipes these can also be used to clean your feet if they stink if you have to go in the woods then just do it gas stations work too     the bonus the spandex sun shades is that you can sleep with your windows open without bugs getting in     use google maps to star your successful camping locations and others you want to check out will save you frustration when youre trying to find the last place you slept
  no rent ever  i spent six month straight camping fishing kayaking hiking and climbing  no income either
  are you stupid  i go back to work in the truck
  i think he means i get no income for the six months i am camping  he is right  for six months i live off the money i made in the truck i am able to save almost all of it because i dont eat out and have no rent in the truck i have a fridge  a hotplate and a microwave  i just go shopping once a week like everyone else  honestly i am working so many hours that i do not have time to get bored and seek entertainment  i spend a few hours on the internet then go to sleep
  pros  cheaper because not paying rent   mobile good for people who need to travel for work or /out/ hobbies such as rock climbing surfing or skiing   minimalistic lifestyle    cons  small living space not an issue if you already love in a small apartment but if youre used to living in a large house itll take getting used to  owning to much shit  gets cluttered quickly  only enough room for single person or a couple no room for kids or a family unless you go with a bus or massive rv  loneliness its hard to keep in touch with friends if youre moving around the country a lot  still need a place thats like a home base for a po box etc and for tax purposes  insurance can be a bitch in some states/countries  fucking cold in winter hot in summer if youre too used to having a/c or central heating  if youre doing it to save money on rent parking in walmart parking lots all the time gets old very quickly  shitty mobile internet or leeching wifi from places like starbucks or mcdonalds   if you dont have a toilet or a bucket in it getting up to piss/shit at odd hours sucks   people will think youre a hobo and be suspicious of you if you dont do it stealthily enough   going to the gym or work to have a shower gets old after a while    all in all depends on why youre planning on living in a van   there are shitloads of guides and qa sessions on youtube and lots of books honestly 4chans one of the shittier places to try to discuss or learn about vans /o/ can at least give you good advice on what vehicle to get and /did/ might be some help in doing a build in the back
  i plan to build a van up for this but more for a travel thing rather than a life style thing    easier to drive than am rv
  breddy paste sooners boomers who r gonna die soon hate it cuz you wont buy that one condo they invested in in lieu of a legitimate retirement plan

  sure seems like it
  if youre living in a van you gotta be down by the river
  ok retardo monteblan
  except for all the equity appreciation tax advantages and rent you collect while out trucking for 6 months    seriously anon dont think for yourself with your low iq
  renting a house gives you none of that
  renting out the house you own gives you all of that and more
  mate of mine does custom van and camper builds for a living its quite the opposite he has boomers throw him 200k to make them a custom rv for them to blow their retirement on a trip around the country
  honestly just search for vandwelling on youtube there is a huge community of them and they all seem to make video content covering any and all questions you would have
  yeah i am not buying a house to rent out to strangers in a place i dont live just to be a landlord  there is another real estate bubble coming anyway
  this is not true all boomers are broke and will be broker when they sell their multiple houses in san francisco that they bought for 1000 30 years ago with a part time job that i cant afford because they are now 1000000 and i cant get a job because the boomers are broke and wont quit their jobs cuz they cant sell their extra houses
  double loser detected
  boomer are broke and will be broker when they sell a couple of their extra 1 million house and have 2 million they will be broke    anon you are either next leve stupid or having fun tard larping
  so are you here in this thread just to be a dick
  im sorry anon i didnt know pointing out the obvious made me a dick
  you didnt know calling someone a loser made you a dick
  not if its obvious they are a loser and everyone is pretty much already aware they are a colossal loser that just makes me a conversationalist
  not if its obvious they are a loser  this is not correct  pointing out the obvious if its hurtful  makes you a dick for sure
  its great if you dont mind being alone for long periods can get expensive if you put on a lot of miles and dont know how to do repairs yourself
  did da waddle baby get his feelings hurt    grow up loser
  actually hes right  the boomers inflated the property market by purchasing second homes and not building  it caused a two tier property market and now all city properties are chronically overvalued    boomers want to sell their second properties now but millennials dont have 50s salaries and wont buy them as a crash is imminent sub prime crisis didnt correct the market well keep having them until prices fall    so boomers have a million dollar property they cant sell for a million to anyone but the chinese they rely on rent money and so cant retire  their increased life expectancy plays a large part in their calculations    millennials now often arent inheriting property as cash strapped boomers mortgage primary property to keep two millennials wont mortgage the old properties at inflated rates so everyone is renting    ironically the crash will likely fall on the banks as foreign investors keep buying blindly banks will hold increasingly large and insoluble property or loans from foreigners with the same issue
  i miss it very much
  enjoy being a pleb forever
  so subprime type crises is waiting in the wings again
  do your current hobbies include spending an hour or more each day looking for a place to take a shit and shower if so then living in a van might just be for you
  lol who the fuck would want to rent to someone who only wants to sign a 6 month lease then move out when youre done working sounds like a methlab situation
  nothing has changed   banks especially in the us are still giving huge loans on properties only worth two third of the loan value     they are still doing it because until the crash they are leveraging the debt on unsafe loans and keeping the market inflated because they themselves own housing     its like a store selling pencils for 20 but loaning you 18 for no interest   you are forced into debt then they buy 18 of pencils from their supplier well pay you when anon pays us

  you are sooo delusional there is a line of buyers fighting for every good property that goes on the market in fact i just met the new owners of a bidding war property in my neighborhood they seem like a nice young couple probably in their late twenties    the fact that you cant afford real estate does not me there is anything wrong with the market a million  home is not a big deal anymore and no one is relying on millennials to buy them there are plenty of buyers and its still a sellers market all the homes that recently sold around me should in a week at full price
  no peaceful place to shit shower and shave
  getting paid rent  cant retire    do you even hear yourself think anon or do you just not know how to do math
  my boomer dad is in the market of purchasing homes to park money in real estate and what youre saying is right  if the home is priced right people will buy it   now theres one down the street from me asking 950k and just dropped to 650k because theyre tacky pajeets and the home probably has issues  but nice starter homes 180k250k are being sold fast
  anon is law in your country no retire if no sell home no retirement if sell home to chinese why must sell home to retire
  starter homes 180250k    which ghetto in which flyover state are these homes in
  180k thats cheaper than rent hell cheaper than livin in a van
  if youre dad is a boomer you must be like 4050 years old anon
  i hope you werent planning to live in that specific van
  its the suburbs of pittsburgh   theyre nice in a good area
  interesting pennsylvania is no flyover i wonder why more anons arent moving to super affordable pittsburgh
i live in a us college city with pop 250k decent housing in a modest neighborhood with low crime runs 90k 175k lots of more expensive places around of course      the biggest problem is good parking places  you can either travel and stay at state parks  or rent a spot in a friends yard or driveway and pay them for showers and a power cord    if you are scrounging for parking spots police involvement is a concern
  the biggest problem is good parking places  unless you are in a really obvious hippie rig that looks like it is inhabited by filthy criminals there is no problem
how important is stealth for living in europe  simple white van with workman stuff in front  vs  comfy van with windows and curtains  will i be moved on much is it worth the stealth
  i lived in a van for a couple of months wasnt so bad but i did it in the summer and parked off the beach just showered there and used the restroom at bars and restaurants also travel in it and its pretty easy just have to pack very basic and minimal shit
  van living is kino /out/ life a mobile log cabin that you dont have to pay property taxes for and an instant extension/guest room to your house when you eventually build/buy one
  there is a line of buyers fighting for every good property that goes on the market  yep and the buyers are all chinese land developers   the last place i rented the whole suburb was being rented out by some chinese billionaire
  from what i hear the stealth will help but itll likely depend country to country   you can still have windows and curtains just make sure theyre one way or very very dark tinted and have thick curtains with magnets/velcro so you can block out so the light from escaping at night     like anywhere 90 of it will be where and when you park if you park in a rich neighborhood youll get moved along within five minutes even in a normal suburban neighborhood youll have ol missus johnson who knows the license plate of everyone in the street call the cops about a suspicious vehicle if you park in the day   park in a day spot and have a night spot scoped out dont live to your night spot until youre ready to sleep drive there at midnight park and dont leave your vehicle have a way to access the back from the drivers seat make sure youre up and gone by dawn and you should be fine   just dont be doing stupid shit like watching got on max volume laughing/talking or getting out to piss or w/e     hardest part is knowing where to park watch youtube there are lots of videos podcasts and qa sessions from well traveled van dwellers who do guides on youtube best bet is probably kombilife
  thats lots of work to be a hobo since laziness and van life go together this explains why most van dwellers are crazy drug / alcohol addicted homeless people the normal people are too lazy to live in a van getting a gym membershipkekgoing to the gym dailykekshoweringkek    plus whos gonna make your pizza rolls while you play fortnight
  sees one chinese land developer     thinks all real estate in usa is now bought exclusively by chinesetop kek

  jean jacques rousseau wrote prodigiously about the noble hobo but most of it was in french so what i did catch was more like la tableau avec et hobo which roughly translates to the table and the hobo sure rousseau help invent america but he didnt know shit about hoboes    in regards to living in a van i imagine from the youtube videos youre either cut out for it or not and if you are then like anything else in life it will suck sometimes and then be full of grace and then it will suck again like being married to a french girl ive been told
  where is a good place to park your van without getting bothered couldnt you just park it on the side of a street where everyone else parks what gives    i mean as long as you arent loud how would they even know that youre there
  a line of buyers  yea to buy a 1/3 overvalued house because investment in new housing has stalled    i dont know what youve been smoking man but the current system of housing finance is completely unsustainable    people are buying but that doesnt contradict what i said because buyers are just taking mortgages  a rent  to  buy loan       the issue is that they are on a fixed income   they havent got enough liquidity regardless of their assets if grandma breaks her hip they might have to sell     they have mortgages on one or two properties they cant service them from the rent on one       thats because as housing prices rise to more than the market value of the property investors want to buy and resell for a quick buck  creating an inflationary cycle
van thread on /out/    everyone posts problems with living in a van in a city    the whole fucking point of living in a van would be to get away from societys bullshit yeah either im missing something or you are all fucking retarded    get a van  rig with water heat etc  park in the woods  basically camping every day but with a heated shelter and more supplies  wow i already know what thats like    that was fucking hard
  i would say park in a area where there is a lot of apartments no one will know which apartment you live in or what car do no one ever gives a shit
  can anyone tell me how they made the walls for this van   
  just looks like plywood with auto carpet glued to it   i remember a few people in diy videos recommending auto carpet as a cheap lightweight way to do the interior
  yeah this is good i also heard some people say industrial areas arent bad too if your van looks like it belongs there plain white etc same for building sites seen a few people park in front of some house or school being built  for an industrial/construction area though youd have to get up early and be gone before workers show up   main thing is park so you can drive off quickly if something happens you dont want to be reversing or doing a 3point turn to get out of there

    but vans suck for going innawoods thats the problem the primary theoretical selling point of vandwelling is the ability to stealth camp in parking lots and neighborhoods which actually blows try taking your rapevan out any trail into the woods and youre gonna be in for a rude awakening either your tranny is going to shit out or the pitiful ground clearance of a van means your undercarriage is going to get ripped up    vandwelling is for urban areas travel trailers/fifth wheels are for boondocking innawoods
  or just take a smaller vehicle and slap a solar panel on that bad boy stop trying to take your microwave and coffee grinder /out/   just because op is looking into vans doesnt mean hes not going /out/
  slap a solar panel on that bad boy  a solar panel     pfft wanna know how i know you dont know what youre talking about a single solar panel isnt going to do jack     youd be lucky to get 600 watts a day out of that in the best conditions maybe 1000 watts if youre out in the desert youd literally be better off idling the truck for 15 minutes a day in terms of power generation     rving nooblets have no idea about power generation and storage and dramatically underestimate what they need and overestimate what muh solar can do even a dc shitfridge is going to need 150watts every hour of every day     theres a reason why literally everyone carries a genny and multiple gas cans even if theyve got a massive 8 panel array on the top of their rig     stop trying to take your microwave and coffee grinder out    then dont get a van or rv in the first place living like a tentcamper out of a van defeats the purpose of getting a van either go /out/ without any convenience or be fucking realistic about your power demands and level of convenience     living in a van with zero creature comforts is going to get really old really fast
  a dc shitfridge is going to need 150watts every hour of every day  holy shit you are talking right out of your ass  you need to get your maths worked out m8
  kek i tow a 5th wheel with a silverado 2500hd i know exactly what im talking about my fridge uses 150 watts and runs on a/c dc fridges are utter shit and wont get anything cold anyway they should be called dc coolers sorry i dont know the exact wattage of a dc cooler off the top of my head but my fridge uses 150 you wanna run heat electric blanket lights water pump water heater coffee maker microwave fan hot plate all of em use electric and arent gonna be served by a shitty single solar panel trickle charging the shitty single deep cycle battery and inverter you overpaid for at west marine
      even if you found a magical excuse for a fridge that somehow managed to run off 50 watts continuous that still means that even on the best of sunny days your solar panel isnt going to be able to run it for more than 12 hours even if you didnt run anything else at all forget about the less than blue sky days     point being you should overestimate your power needs and underestimate your power generation capabilities the opposite of what giddy first timers do when they think ill just slap a solar panel on top
    this guy gets itanything else and youre just homeless
  ok anon respect for your rig but either its a rig with electrical problems or a rig with a busted up fridge you could have some cooling with a decent system and also use propane
  noble hobo    i see what you did there
  once again you are showing that you are just guessing with a little knowledge instead of do just a tiny bit of research
  what the fuck are you trying to power with that much 600w 1kw   like we tell you every thread stop trying to take your microwave and coffee grinder
  you wanna run heat electric blanket lights water pump water heater coffee maker microwave fan hot plate
  i run my whole house off two panels maybe you just need to git gud
  dc fridges are utter shit and wont get anything cold anyway  yeah you are thinking about thermal exchange coolers and fridges the cheap truckers sometimes use  a good modern dc fridge has a compressor and costs about a grand they can be used as freezers or refrigerators  you once again demonstrate that you do not know what you are talking about
  you dont know how to run a simple rv fridge
  you dont seem to understand that there different types of dc fridge
  you dont seem to want to use a simple fridge that works
  walmart parking lots theyre safe parking for travelers and youll never be hassled
  theyre full of metheads and drug dealers
  but i do  i also want it to run on a 200watt solar panel and two 6volt batteries  which i have done for over two years without issues
i have decided to live in a van because i wanted to save up to buy land unfortunately the city is where moneys at so i have to stay around for some time i had my share of flats with dozen of flatmates noisy neighbors cramped balconies and exhaustpainted windows its remarkably easy you just have to be organised  lol dude water  get 2 18 gallons a pump and bam you have a sink get a portable shower or frequent community centers with sporting facilities  so tiny  ive always found the term living stupid i sleep in my van but spent the rest of my free time at the park at the library or at friends house spending time in a van is fine when youre /out/ but in the city its plain stupid its like a tiny flat bedroom with more noise  must be cold/hot  so what are you some kind of pussy    while im at it fuck those instabitch approved van dwellers living in a van is great way to learn new skills in car reparations to handle waste to survive with what you have and also to save up but these assholes are more interested in taking pictures with a sunset and their van bed in it so much so that it has become the unique print of the personality if you decide to live in a van dont mention until asked in peoples minds you cannot be normal and live in a van at the same time thanks to the what the aforementionned shittubers have presented as the canons of living freely i can confirm that npcs cant handle these kind of reflexions so dont bother by the way fuck them too
hey lads im going to be homeless soon and live in a van my question is kind of retarded but how the fuck do you guys live with your sexual urges will noporn fix the jewery in my mind ive been living a pretty easy onions life up until now but even now i become uncomfortably horny and i cant stop thinking about how unbearable it would be if i actually got some testosterone in my blood from being outside in the cold 24/7 vs playing vidya all day in my mothers heated basement
  living in a van isnt gonna stop you from having a wank mate
  for the sink there are some good foot pumps or you can just gravity feed  tiny  this my current apartment is only just slightly bigger than a van
  maybe invest in a good cooler and go with ice for the meantime as long as you arent opening the bloody thing every 10min itll last most of a week especially if you get blocks instead of bags of ice   and end of the day the only thing you need to refrigerate is fresh meat beer uht milk eggs vegetables etc dont need to be refrigerated
  cant tell if bad reading comprehension or just pretending to be retarded
  option 3 actually retarded
see exgf dating new guy  theyre traveling/living out of van  its so great etc  2 weeks later status asking for money because van broke down  sensible chuckle
  i dunno man where i live you can boondock for up to 14 days in one place as long as its on public land not cordoned for other activities then you just find another spot there are millions of acres of forestland with easy access from logging and nf roads vans do fine innawoods i see them all the time
  lots of posts about the sink and getting water in the sink    not one post about a drain
  if you are stealth mode in a cargo van an industrial area works well i work in one and have permission to park it there so nobody bothers me except for local crackheads from the tent city nearby once woke up to a fucker unscrewing my gas cap to steal gas punched the inside van wall right where he was and he fucked off quick while apologizing no problems since
  this is what sounds exciting about living in a van  getting out of sheltered life in the burbs  mixing it up with the gritty underbelly of society   crossing to the other side of the tracks  learning to survive amongst the scetchy people  learning from the school of hard knocks  this seems more exhilarating than trying to survive alone innawoods
  mixing it up with the gritty underbelly of society   crossing to the other side of the tracks  learning to survive amongst the scetchy people  learning from the school of hard knocks    this is being a bum not living the vanlife  i live in a van 6 months out of the year and i do none of this  while i do stealth sort of  once in a while traveling more than a few hundred miles i live in a van so i can do /out/ related stuff every single day  i always make sure i have plenty of money do pursue all of my various hobbies     when you get a bit older  you will realize there is nothing glamorous about hippies and bums  99 percent of them have mental health issues or very low iqs
  yeah i did this for 4 months last winter around the southern us and it was no problem
  a single solar panel will power a ceiling vent fan and charge your laptop and phone this is really all you need to live comfortably assuming you also have propane appliances
  the glamorous thing is that they tell society to get fucked and prove that you can actually live just fine by refusing to be a cuck for the system sure lots of them have issues that kept them from ever being a part of the system in the first place but there are lots of intelligent hippies out there who just found a way to beat the system and dont give a fuck what people think of them
  lots of intelligent hippies  this is just not true on a properly proctored iq test  very very few hippies would score in a range considered exceptional  this was not true in the 60s but it is true now   the interesting thing is that so many of them think they have uncommon wisdom
  how do you know that to be true
  lives in a van 6 mos a year  thinks other people have low iqs and mental health problems     wut
  basement dweller detected
  edgy teenager detected      listen to this man and for the love of god try your absolute best to drop the muh finding muhself by slumming it urge/phase as fast and hard as you possibly can its not a good look at any age except for a brief moment in your late teens if and only if you do a single something cool and noteworthy to get it out of your system that makes for a good story and then drop it and move on and dont drag it out    living out of a van and having a constellation of shitty nonstories about the weirdos you had to fend off or the junkie wisdom you received while sharing a park bench with one does not count at all as theyre barely stories at all and shitty ones at that     go hike half of the at or something during your senior summer or something
  if there wasnt some weight to it why do so many of us seem to resonate with the idea of dropping out of society  it doesnt seem to me so much like a fad or a phase as it does a symptom of a sick world  i cant see it as being the sort of thing a lot of people are just able to get over
  the last generation that dropped out were the boomers  is that what you want to be like the ones that went on to achieve things were the ones that had every advantage to begin with  the ones without rich parents or huge natural talent became lower class citizens for life they are mostly bitter and filled with regret  think hard anon squander your youth at your own peril
  we all have talents but i dont care for money enough to leverage mine for financial gain  the furthering of this corrupt society is not something thats on my agenda  id much rather go my own way in life and im in the process of figuring out a way to make it work i cant keep living the way i am
  we all have talents  this is a hippie lie anon if you are going to go down this path at least be honest with yourself do you really believe that everyone has natural talent do you think things like iq are just social constructs that dont measure anything important   if you think the power of positive thinking is going to feed you when you are old think again  what you do now affects your financial future forever  lesson one  we do not all have talents do not believe things just because they feel good and follow the dogma of your peer group
  i dont believe in natural talent no neither do i believe iq is a particularly useful as a measure of someones general ability at any given skill although it could have an impact on their ability to learn sure  im currently in full time employment and am fairly confident in my ability to find work when needed  im just disgusted at the world were creating for ourselves
  fair enough anon but you are navigating the world with an inaccurate roadmap    i know this guy is a meme but he is a professor and his job is to explain things as plainly as possible     
    you can drop out of society without rubbing shoulders with junkies and thieves and other wackos i promise that theres nothing glamorous about them or that lifestyle theres no hidden junkie wisdom its just sad desperate people in shitty situations     its not an uncommon male adolescent fantasy to want to do something like that but theres just nothing there i can assure you it takes a few more years to recognize that but its true     if you actually think theres some hidden wisdom you want to acquire from them which there isnt then volunteer at a church or a homeless feeding operation or something you dont have to become one to get it     and you can drop out of society in many other ways get a trailer go live in the desert for two weeks at a time save up and buy a plot of land in southern colorado and get some building permits and put a septic tank and a 1 bedroom manufactured house on it and go from there try living in a truly rural area trust me thats gonna feel plenty like dropping out of society     hell go live for 3 months at a time out of youth hostels in different countries for a year youre going to have a hell of a lot better time than hanging out with junkies     youll notice that all of these ideas do require some amount of money you still need to have some scratch but you can still drop out of society without communing with and becoming a downright indigent bum yourself
  i really like your post anon    no hobo
  wow you are so off target with the way you are rewriting history in your post you obviously know nothing of the boomer generation and e onto i s of that era
  literally all a boomer had to do to succeed was not get killed in vietnam and go to college    how has not going to war and getting a college degree worked out for you in 2018
    thank you sedan bro great advice would you do it again
  boomers are the ones who can afford to travel this way often using rent homes as their income and thats not what a sooner is
  and you can drop out of society in many other ways get a trailer go live in the desert for two weeks at a time save up and buy a plot of land in southern colorado and get some building permits and put a septic tank and a 1 bedroom manufactured house on it and go from there try living in a truly rural area trust me thats gonna feel plenty like dropping out of society   thats pretty much my aim unfortunately living in the uk however buying any area of land is completely infeasible for me as of current
  its exciting for sure but usually in a bad way the only reason im dealing with this shit is because ive got a bad power steering leak and cant drive away school of hard knocks had been my life for years and its not fun im just glad ive got a job so i can eventually get my van fixed and drive to somewhere safer found some coat hanger wire next to my passenger side window the other day someone had tried to jimmy the door open earlier this evening some creeps had parked right behind me as i was going to sleep the only good thing is not paying rent or dealing with roommates good luck ever finding a girl not many are badass enough to want to deal with this shit unless they are on drugs and no i dont do drugs i wish i was still in my comfy apartment and hadnt let my shit roommate in to eventually fuck me over maybe once i put some work into this piece of shit itll be nice to live in but right now its not that great
  ive lived in a van for 3 years now and ive really enjoyed it of course ive never cared about the finer things in life that many here obviously slave their lives away for  going back to fishing have a nice day
  finer things    like a fridge stocked wit beer and steaks aplace to take a hot woman heat running water a flush toilet a place that doesnt perpetually smell like feet and ass
  like a fridge stocked wit beer and steaks  not him but i have that in my van  a place to take a hot woman  vanlife instagram opportunities in a van gets women hype as fuck   heat  people do canadian winters in ski towns in them all the time not to mention you can just drive somewhere warmer if you want there are plenty of heating options for vans in cold climates  running water  most vans have this  a flush toilet  some people have these too but they take up a lot of space and waste a lot of water when its easier to piss outside and take your shits at work  have these a place that doesnt perpetually smell like feet and ass  living in a van / unwashed hobo the small living space makes them piss easy to clean     grrrr stop liking things i dont like1  youre gonna have to try harder than that /pol/ thanks for always bumping our general all the time though youve been keeping us on the front page all year
  nice larp but no one believes you since youre so full of shit
  get sick  you go to the hospital one very cold night and your lungs could be full of fluid and take half a year to recover at half physical strength    there is a lot that goes on about staying warm and then theres the vandals who think youre homeless or they want your ride    wheel lock steering wheel lock  medical reasons sun exposure truckers left side are 10yr older appearance wise etc    humans are meant to be in the shade and warm with clean air that takes a while to reach out lungs all that dust that settles in the house are particles caught in the wind    were fragile very very fucking fragile oh and if you find a lover she may 360 and moonwalk away from you over being homeless    its a college student who is healthy and not in sweltering weather over 120faren inside a vehicle and not in winter conditions any months of the year    hauling shit takes cash too a vehicle with 400lb of crap in the vehicle could cost 20 more in fuel or more and then the miles add up in your living space    what if things break no space to haul it to say drop it off here mate ill have it fixed most places will keep it two or three days until its fixed    its fucking homelessness and only works with a caravan of 23 vehicles not to take up space look like youre in a group that watches your back and have a backup option/people watching over you when shits and fans connect    fuck van life
  finding 23 people retarded enough to live in 23 vans and stck together    kek then a long smile while being entertained by this thought
    thanks again for bumping the thread /pol/kun hopefully youre learning stuff that might be useful to you
  wanting to be around negroes  youre gonna get murdered
should living in a car be considered vagrancy and what punishment should such vagrants receive from the government
  should not consuming bpa be considered toxic masculinity and what punishment should such chads receive from the globohomo corpocracy and government     let people find their own way if they dont want to pay property taxes or rent so what do you have a problem with snufkin or odin or any wandering archetype its not harmful or degenerate since its a way to increase mindfulness stoic attitude self sovereignty unplugging from excess consumerism etc which overall creates a better citizen to one day raise children the only critique of car dwelling is that its hard to rear livestock hard to keep consistent friends or host large indoor gatherings but all of that can be achieved in other ways    source raised in a truck was amazing im finally getting my own after living in various houses for the last decade
  and another 5 years if you run 24601
  i want to live in my car for a couple months while traveling up north
  should the size and scope of the government be limited what punishment should a government that does not represent the people receive
  houses are over rated unless you have kids not worth the money  when theyre priced at an avg of 250k yep fuck that
  what ghetto are you talking about where the average home price is only 250k
  thats personally my dream one place to park and a whole lot of teamwork
    just seek out truck stops ta flying j loves etc theyre not just for truckers its foe travelers too you can refuel and even sleep overnight in their massive parking lot but like you said rotate stops every couple of days to avoid suspicion also they have showers if you sign ip for their fuel rewards you can even get a free shower  textrucker
  /out/ usually has a van bum threads
  you mean /out/ previously had vanlife threads before we found out that busanon was just larping while living at some rich anons house and they were just samefagging the threads to give off the impression there was more than just two idiots trying to lure people to tulsa for some unknown reason    busanon hasnt posted since
  i mean yeah but youre wrong on the samefag thing   busanon and angry polposter were the only thing wrong with those threads   next thread we should really open with a proper op with links to guides and resources so its not just  grrrr damn hippies  what generator should i use for a coffee grinder  so liek whar du u poop  50 posts arguing about solar  the one guy with a legit question who gets ignored  noone posting pictures of builds
  nah it was legitimately one autist pretending to be both sides of the fuck yuppies fuck bums arguments going on    busanon claimed to have met a half dozen people from the homeless generals and to have shown a few the ropes but none of them ever posted saying yeah i met busanon
  pretty sure we know the reason they had a consistent requirement for fresh meat  either socks or nipples i was never clear on who figured out what the rich guy and his gf and busanon were doing which is why busanon stopped posting
  so what were they doing
  lmao top ten anime imageboard twists should have capped more from those threads
  absolutely nothing wrong with it
  picking up street kids and chopping them up into dog food for their boarding kennels        those posts came much later   also fun fact im the person busanon was quoting  by that point he was extremely paranoid after having been exposed as their agent and believed his coconspirators were throwing him to the wolves and he didnt want to go down alone
  it was never really made clear on the outside it had all the dressings of a cult isolating and controlling people if busanon wasnt complicit then he was definitely a loose end that mightve been tied by now maybe theyll show up and explain in this thread if i start saying shit like busanon had kids and they were all in on abusing one who really knows though busanon has zero presence in the traveling world and zero presence online in the most common of places where even half as internet literate hobos have profiles like stp to contact other random travellers they meet who also dont have social media talk is cheap its more likely this post will just kill the thread or theyll ignore it completely
    if you take busanons earlier posts in context he is raving about how charismatic and intelligent the rich guy is and how he takes in travellers and lets them live in his penthouse   that sounds a lot like a cult leader
  im the person busanon was quoting  what did you mean by this mike are you trying to imply that jessie was the one who threw himself under the buslel in those threads exposing the whole ordeal i couldnt help but notice that feather hasnt left any reviews on google for a while did most of the loose ends finally get tied up    chopping up street kids to feed to the dogs   i mean you had it up until this part but i think we both know jessica doesnt feed her clients dogs
  and another thing that struck me as odd was how busanon kept saying multiple times how people over 26 should not hang out with him and that they always csuse trouble  later i realized he was probably told not to bring in people over that age      what did you mean by this mike  i mean that i am not scrotum mike but busanon thought i was when he made that post ive never met any of them nor am i connected to them anywhere except this board    that little dox post of his was to show his capabilities for mutually assured destruction because he was paranoid that he was going to go down for everything    you need to read those posts between the lines especially the one about feeding dogs   a dogs liver will shut down completely if it goes 4 days without eating and it wont last longer than a week without food   a dog that has gone 4 days without food wont be able to stand nor will it be able to eat on its own  goodle or ask /an/ if you dont believe me
  thanks anon
  google or ask /an/  but if you google it every link talks about healthy dogs going five days or more and being completely fine    seriously what did you mean by this damage control you think someone would do this just go on the internet and tell lies why would you tell people to google something when the first five results on google all prove your statement wrong   liver failure unable to stand after four days  
  humans can last weeks without food while going about relatively normal business  dogs cant last four days in a kennel with very little movement  are you just pretending to be retarded
  well you end up insane like the dude itt sooo dont do it
  yeah getting unceremoniously killed by literal iq 80 retards in the middle of the night is so cool and epic
  which dude    have you taken your meds yet whats life like being diagnosed with a mental deficiency while trying to maintain a sense of superiority project more loser
  youve viewed their profile 3096 times
  but if you google it every link talks about healthy dogs going five days or more and being completely fine    bullshit asshole every single link says that a dog will die in 35 days without food   anyone can google it and see for themselves    if a dog survives 4 days with no food it will require hospitalization and drip medication which in a dog is delivered through subcutaneous under the skin injection  it takes 48 hours for a dogs body to start going into fat reserves which are there for prolonged periods of low intake not short periods of zero intake so practically useless in this case    in around two days with no food a dogs body will start to cannibalize its own liver for energy and soon they will lose their appetite and even if you put food infront of them they wont eat        youre guaranteed too stupid to understand why but here it is anyway  dogs have a faster metabolism twice the heart rate less fat storage and less efficient food to energy conversion than humans do     in retard terms they get far less mpg and have way smaller tanks  how you understand now      busanon go away
  what can i say i have a thing for mentally deficient gals who eat scabs and abuse dogs
  the picture of the scooby do mystery machine in flames now fits this thread perfectly
  no kidding
  i mean i guess the bump limit isnt going to hit itself and remove all these nasty posts   putting that masters to good work i see
allow me to contribute to this dumpster fire with some poetry and prose created by our very own class clowns
        busanon why dont you respond to the accusations against you in this thread instead of desperately trying to samefag and shift attention on your accomplices to kidnapping and murder
  i am very smart
  imagine being so scared of someone spilling the beans that you had to constantly scour an anonymous underwater backgammon forum for posts about yourself sounds like someone has the fear imagine having absolutely zero plausible deniability in such a situation maybe its time to hop states again      i think ill create a new thread about this once this one hits the bump limit keep pushing pls i got a lot of things to dump i think this deserves to be solidified in the /out/ board culture this is very amusing really     kidnapping and murder   more like abusing/molesting one of busanons kids you really should have just dissapeared
look up vans  these prices  jesus do they really expect people to pay this much for their super niche van
    no one buys used custom vans thats part of the reason why /vanlife/ is retarded you buy a used van for 15k sink 10k in gear into it and then expect someone to at least pay 20k for it after 35 years of using it the reality is absolutely no one will pay for your custom van no matter how decked out it is if its done by a company with a warranty even if its expired thats one thing but you absolutely have to plan on any of your improvements being a completely depreciated sunk cost
  thats what i was hoping to take advantage of but all the listings are trying to charge out the nose for their random modifications
  just look up the kbb value of the van itself take a rough inventory of the improvements solar panels happijack etc then knock the retail value of the improvements in half and put in that offer and wait two months     trust me none of those wooks are getting any offers anywhere near their asking price on that shit if theyre getting offers at all
  maybe since i live near sf people are actually buying these things  or these dummies are losing their shirts on putting wood shelving in vans lol
  forgot pic  45k conversion upcharge
      yeah man thats unreal i cant speak for anything about the sf area georgiafag here but im sure that its not just the campervan prices that are inflated please dont move to the heartland and bring the liberal policies with you bromigo
  actually from georgia california has better /out/ desu
  oh i dont doubt it fren
  a custom mercedes is expensive  wow what a surprise     i doubt people are paying money for second hand conversions but they are indeed paying close to 100k for new conversions sometimes on second hand vans   taking out a loan on both the van and the conversion itself is a common thing and way less expensive than renting a place in a major city
  its half that on kbb
  kbb isnt for custom vans and conversions are very expensive if you were looking to get a new one youd be looking at 45k for the van and about the same for the conversion     depending on your job you might even be able to write most of it off as work related expenses
  taking out a loan on both the van and the conversion itself is a common thing and way less expensive than renting a place in a major city  how does the math work out even in major cities you can find place to rent for 1k that will be equivalent or better accommodations than a converted van so 80k on van and conversion is over six years of rent are you going to live in a van for six years    it only makes sense if highly value the mobility in terms of frugality it seems like horrible decision
  keep in mind the type of people buying these vans and the type of lifestyle they want to project sound financial decisions have a different meaning    for 1k in portland you get a shitty apartment in a shitty location plus you also need to buy a car and pay for utilities    for the same amount you can get a van that you can theoretically park anywhere utilities are cheap or free you dont need a car and you get lots of instagram credits and can go to the burning lgbt rainbows gathering at roachella festival    as for rent for six years what is the other option buying is out of the question they will be renting forever
  how ever did you escape reference connected missing persons surely you have the ptsds from this harrowing brush with cult sacrifice
  thinking people that would live in a van would be good at math  iqs between 80 and drooling on themselves   living on disability ssi or welfare  selling / doing drugs everyday
im going to begin building one in the fall i work at a state park that offers free rv sites to employees and volunteers showers and laundry available on site free wifi in the campground taking use of that with a comfy van set up would cut my living expenses down dramatically
  sounds like you may be describing your own situation
  nice comeback considering your 79 is anon
  maybe it is actually a cheap comeback and you think it is nice as a result of your own 79 point iq
  79 was being generous but you proved me wrong anon nice job
  ive always thought that the paranoia that potential van life people have to where they park/sleep is a bit neurotic and unjustified sure if you put up deck chairs and set up a barbecue infront of your van and leave the doors open so anyone walking past can see you have a bed in there then of course you are going be moved along i wouldnt want a hobo sleeping outside my place either     but if all you do is pull into a spot after you have gone to the gym had your nightly shower and had a bite to eat at your local park then no one is going to see you or bat an eyelid use common sense and dont park in a narrow court or dead end street instead park on a road preferably a wider one or one which gets a lot of traffic as a main thoroughfare during the day and you will be fine i can think of an entire list of places in every suburb i know where i could park a van with no issues     pick five locations in a suburb never stay at the same spot two nights in a row drive 10 minutes further next week and park in five different locations in the next suburb over local ovals arent such a bad place either after dark i dont know why you all get so paranoid about this stuff
  i can always tell which of you watch petersons lectures long before you actually admit it and/or post links reading some of your comments are like reading lines from a transcript of his lectures/interviews word for word most of the time its getting so bad i start to worry that it is being parroted as badly as leftwing ideology       btw i have little hate for the guy he is doing society a good service compared to the toxic left but i do wonder about how willingly young men seem to soak up every word and concept verbatim
lived in pic related for 7 months while going to school van life aint bad would do it again
  here vans are a big thing trick is to buy in late autumn when european tourists flood the market with them or sell in spring when supply is low
  10k  you can fit out a van for under 400 maybe 1k if you get solar and a fridge get gud
  why spend 1k on a solar fridge when a 100 niggermart fridge does the same     sure the compressor might not like constant movement but if it lasts just one year you still have enough cash left over for 9 more fridges
  the worst case is literally the cops just telling you to move on down the road too unless you go somewhere with no trespassing signs its not like you get arrested
  pffftt hahahaha sure ya bum just rip out the seats and toss in a mattress and call it done enjoy literally pissing in two liters and driving to mcdonalds to take a shit not to mention hauling your dirty ass dishes into walmart to wash in their bathroom     sure you can buy a few solar panels a few batteries and a shitty inverter and mattress and keep it all under 1k but youre going to be absolutely miserable condensation will be rolling down the windows because you didnt think to shell out for a roof fan because hey git gud right     t fulltime rver who knows what you need to be actually comfortable
  im the guy who lived in this  thing it cost be about 3k to put together including the van but it already had insulation in it also i had better access to amenities than most 24 hour access to a gym whose owners i did some work for and my standards for comfort are pretty low
    whoops switched the replies but you know what i mean
  lmao sounds about right i can literally see the condensation i mean like i said sure you can buy a shitty van to crash in like you appeared to have done but youll notice my original comment was replying to talking about reselling conversion vans if you actually have some funds available a higher standard of comfort and expect someone else to buy your van without you ripping out your improvements and selling it as just a van you need to put in some money and work     propane system and minirange electrical system including both a/c and d/c with shore power inlets grey water black water water pump on demand water heater toilet shower sink fridge battery bank fridge microwave cabinetry and coutertops ffs sitting area/murphy bed or happijack     to make something that youre going to be truly comfortable in and you could have a hope in hell to resell after a few years you gotta put in some time and money planning cutting plywood putting in laminate surfaces sealant vinyl flooring a secondary propane furnace and/or a/c unit so you dont have to idle the truck 24 hours a day to keep it cool/warm pcv piping valves wiring outlets cushions paint all costs money man     ive literally seen and helped dudes do some of this shit every little trip to home depot to pick up sealant you forgot or didnt work costs time and money     then youll actually have something resembling a livable space with a hope in hell of reselling it realistically if youre doing it right call it 10k     you gotta realize that what you did and an actual conversion van are pretty different
  oh yeah i see what youre saying i didnt read the original comment chain i agree spending 20k to outfit a van is retarded for me the entire point is that its cheap i did it to avoid paying rent and avoid the hassle of a long commute thats not condensation youre seeing though when that picture was taken i hadnt even been in it for like a month and a half
  every little trip to home depot to pick up sealant you forgot or didnt work costs time and money      307 on glue sealant tape degreaser cable ties 14k all up     pretty good video of that kind of detailed costs
  depends on why you are living in van
  no van dwellers posting on thanksgivinginterestingi guess the meals a the homeless shelter were more appealingkek
    you have the same defeatist mentality most homeless have when they get in a bad situation they never never take steps to fix it and never think out of the box for a solution    enjoy literally pissing in two liters  dont talk shit about piss jugs just use a with mouth jug dump the piss out once a day then rinse it out with grey water and put a splash of lemon scented floor cleaner for next time    driving to mcdonalds to take a shit   stop eating vegan food and you wont take so many frequent watery shits i shit once a week and can go longer if i wanted to  or you could just get a bucket wrap a bag around the opening then shit in the bag tie it up and throw it at a church sign while driving    hauling your dirty ass dishes into walmart to wash in their bathroom  wash dishes the same way you do when camping   get a wash basin put a little vinegar soap and water in a spray bottle then spray dishes after eating then scrub and rinse big fucking deal    condensation will be rolling down the windows because you didnt think to shell out for a roof fan  a brand new roof extractor is 150 if you get condensation just order and install one   crazy that you can do that huh
video showing some builds at a recent mobile house/van festival in japan 2 weeks ago   amazing what theyve done with these tiny vehicles   
  renting your house out when you dont live nearby especially if your plan is to be /out/ isnt nearly as simple as youre making it seem also real estate appreciation despite being heavily subsidized by the us government for decades has been meager when netted against upkeep and property taxes
  all people who are considered lowquality tenants by most realtors and property managers
  hire a management company and file your taxes properly     ive owned an apartment since 2012 that ive never been inside management co does everything including find tenants and maintenance/upkeep and their fee is deducted from taxes i would have had to pay anyway
  and van dwellers whoops
  100k  at this point you could buy some land
   i shit once a week and can go longer if i wanted to    nigga wat
    losers or dicks both of you are faggots for engaging each other for this many posts
  he drinks one of they onions drinks instead of eating meals
van living pollutes the air and you get fat from always driving places pic related is better in every way
  except for actually going further than a couple hundred miles friendo
    do things the hard stupid expensive cramped unsanitary uncomfortable completely sunk cost way instead of the affordable established refinedoverdecades way that actually gets you a shower sink and toilet to fucking piss in and doesnt require you to piss in bottles or travel to defecate or else youre a defeatist       if you get condensation     see this is how i know youre a newfag who doesnt know what end is what youve never lived in an rv you wouldnt know the first thing    you know how if you chill in your car with it off for a few minutes in the winter the windows fog up yeah now imagine chilling in it 24 hours a day that moisture has to go somewhere and it will permeate into every single porous surface and make the place and you smell like mildew forever     i know youve never lived in an rv or a van that much is clear but if you ever do decide to please enjoy your piss bottles buckets mcdonalds runs ill be enjoying my 27 foot travel trailer that i can actually shit and shower in
      also just because you can do something doesnt mean you should do something of course you can piss in bottles but should you thats exactly the kind of attitude that foreverpoor strivers have work smart not hard you fucking bum
  methane from your vegan diet also pollutes the air
when you have been slacking on emptying your piss jugs and now theres like eight of them and then you find the one thats been stashed in some corner or something thats over a year old
  where i live most cops dont give a shit as long as you are outside city limits state troopers on the other hand are usually just cruising around looking for people to fuck with
  lmfao id love to run that thing off the road
      hahahaha jesus christ imagine actually taking the idea of moving into or out of your own house every six months seriously and then badgering people about it on a basket weaving forum
  hey guys get a load of this big shot over here hes such a big shot on this anonymous board that he has to act like 1/4 mil is a small sum
me  walking to train station in bologna  pic related
  select all buses  select all crosswalks    which is it
  what do you mean which is it
    are you showing us that you should have taken the bus that was going to the station instead of walking
  dude what
  yeah  its kinda sad actually it was a long walk
  posting in a weird thread
  on /out/  not prefering to walk  did you mean to post this on /trv/
  when u start selecting buses but its actually traffic hydrants but youre too lazy to unselect so you just click verify
  tfw not tripping balls in bologna while posting nonsensical shit in /out/ thinking its /trv/
  when you click the wrong pictures on purpose and it lets you post anyway
tell me about your first weeklong hike /out/     im planning my first week trip and im located in the southeast us near north ga i still havent decided where i want to go yet but itll be in the spring   longest ive ever been /out/ was for a three day trip to blood mountain but i spend three weeks in junejuly every year camped out on the side of the road selling fireworks with no shower access and limited resources i think im ready for my first real trek if you can call it that
im planning my first week long hike too planning on taking a road trip to the rocky mountains because im a filthy lowlander always been obsessed with mountains and the appalachians arent cutting it so i kind of want to visit before i move out this way
bump
  you dont need to bump stuff here threads have to be inactive for literally 3 days before they get pushed to the archive and were generally pretty good about using the catalog
  do you want stories or do you have specific questions you need answered dont bump here /out/ is ssllooww
      op here just wanting to hear stories and apparently someone else does too because i didnt bump the thread id also like any recommendations regarding the perfect backpack for a week hike
  perfect backpack  totally depends on a bunch of stuff personally i do most my hiking with a small pack the main body is 25l but i have minimal kit and hike all day if you want to spend more time in camp fish or do other stuff youll want a bigger bag but desu 40l is more than big enough for a the season trip    ill write out a story or two when im home dont want to write tons while on my phone
    im actually considering buying an ll bean continental rucksack looks like the perfect thing for a 3 day or so hike
  be 22 decide to go for a 10 day /out/  load up my and my dogs pack  get dropped off in allegehny national forest at 5am  hiking and enjoying everything  take a late lunch at about 1  dog loves playing in creeks and eating crawfishsalamanders etc so i start playing and lose track of time   when your in a forest its hard to tell time when you cant see the sun and arent paying attention  start hiking again  it starts getting dark quick  only clock is a watch in my bag  its 800 sunset is 830  i basically panic start setting up tent  stop halfway through because we need fire first  end up running around the woods in the dark gathering wood and setting up tent  end up eating dinner in the dark at 11  put food in bear bag and hang it up  fall asleep on the ground by the fire while reading  wake up pitch black dog is gone  im freak out   gun out flashlight and screaming  me screaming reeeexxxx probably scared the skinwalkers away  fucking asshole is taking a shit about 20 away then comes running over to me  go to sleep inside the tent this time  the adrenaline from thinking i lost my dog keeps me up all night  the rest of my trip was good though  made sure to manage my time and be setting up camp at 4pmish  ended up bring way to much food  it was fun just make sure to manage your time well
  because i didnt bump the thread  then i obviously was talking to that person and not you you self centered dumbfuck
  is a 75l deuter too much for a 5 day its not like i have a choice its my only pack and it was a present but ya know good to know
  nah ill take a 75l for 2 days sometimes
  what a stupid question
i want to climb that fucken mountain how do i get into mountain climbing /out/
find mountain  climb mountain  be mountain climber
  thanks fren booking trip to china rn
  start by checking the catalog 
  be polish  climb mountainski  be mountain climberski
maybe start with something a little easier than k fucking 2
  but what if i dont want to live with a chronic victim complex
  enjoy never climbing k2
  
  why isnt there an escalator up k2
  k2 cog railway when
  you need at least 35k to climb to climb that mountain
  right after the first hotel on mount everesttm is built
  why would i need 35k when its clearly called k2 two
  because you need to hire someone who speaks ching chong to translate for you
  i dont see whats the big deal they already do that in yurop
  i dont think theres any stores on top of k2
  i dont see the big deal in trivialising and commercially exploiting a great achievement
  implying everest isnt already pay2win
  disgusting isnt it    i mean i do undertand their wish to reach the top but at one point it just sucks the worth out of the summit
  be rich man
  bottlenecks in the deathzone are dangerous
  partly because of traffic so yeah    s u c k
just take the bus to the top
check this out 
  why do i feel the need to summit the highest peaks on earth guys  i talked to my friends about it and they never had this urge yet i simply cant shake it i try to be reasonable but all i can say is that i am just drawn to these mountains it is almost like a religious attraction for some reason i just have this feeling deep inside that the answer to a question i havent asked myself yet is on top of these mountains in a weird way it feels like the reason why i was brought into this world lies ontop of mt everest or k2 like i will reach enlightenment once i summit and look down to earth
  this is very common my dude youre amongst friends
  why do i feel the need to summit the highest peaks on earth guys  i dunno try deleting your instagram first and see if the feeling stays
  why do i feel the need to summit the highest peaks on earth guys  i talked to my friends about it and they never had this urge yet i simply cant shake it i try to be reasonable but all i can say is that i am just drawn to these mountains it is almost like a religious attraction for some reason i just have this feeling deep inside that the answer to a question i havent asked myself yet is on top of these mountains in a weird way it feels like the reason why i was brought into this world lies ontop of mt everest or k2 like i will reach enlightenment once i summit and look down to earth    exactly the same reason why i want to do it as well i have this dream of standing at the top of these giants and looking out into the night sky and see the milky way above us i want to feel the sheer scale of the universe see how far up ive come from the world below but be awed at how tiny it actually was
  why do i feel the need to summit the highest peaks on earth  because they are there
  you might be subconsciously aware of the art youre able to see at these heights this may be why youre attracted
  nah mate lots of the people who have that exact mindset dont even make it to the top or make it to the top then die on the way back down  you can ppay for a seat on an expedition you can pay for food on an expedition and even pay for people to set lines cook and bring the food to youl but you still have to climb every step of the mountain  everest is still hard to do the death statistics dont really reflect it anymore because there is probably about 200400 people on the mountain in the season over half of which are probably sherpas who are there to bring you dont if you cant handle it
        literally wont happen because k2 is so northward it has notoriously terrible weather mutliple week storms in some instances that show up in a moments notice  plus its 65 miles away from the last village which is basically just a mountaineering hub for porters
        the region is so volatile that in any one season there is a 40 chance there is no window to actually summit
  implying instagram shills have any notion of the transcendent force of the mountains
okay so i know a lot of anons must be wondering if im dead or not since my last thread  died but ive been a bit lazy and so much has gone on so here i am    if you dont know im from london england and im hitchhiking from ny to la with no money previously i was a neet and decided to embark on this adventure while contemplating my flight back to london while staying in nyc    if you have any questions please ask and if you have any hitchhiking tales and tips of your own do share
am gonna tell some of my favourite stories so far because there are too many to tell    so my last post in the last thread was in denver about to meet another anon he didnt murder me he didnt rape me it was cool he gave me a blanket before we parted which has served me very well but the next day i was in nederland colorado and things were getting late and i was pointed to a nearby campsite up the mountains since this was the closest i decided to go there although i was worried about the temperature at night the previous night camping in the mountains i was really cold so i was second guessing this idea but i thought fuck it if i dont die who cares     but walking up the altitude was such that every time i took a breath i ran out so now i was really starting to think this maybe isnt a good idea but i was still adamant about camping there so i continued just as im walking i look down just by feet at the side of the road and theres a fucking sleeping bag still in its fucking stuff sack so of course i fucking grab on to it i cant believe my luck    i get to the top and check it out and its perfect theres some shit and twigs inside but i clean it out and its one of the best sleeps of my trip unfortunately i couldnt fit it in my pack so i left it in the hope another traveler finds it when in need and just stick to my blanket thanks anon
  how long do you plan to stay in the us im a suicidal neet and im considering doing something similar before deciding if im really going to an hero
  glad to see an update previous thread was great are you still in colorado
  just go to africa
  why i dont get it
  its a dumb joke from another thread
  
  it was cool  hmm reading between the lines it sounds like a severe case of stockholm symdrome
  op i just want you to know that you are an inspiration to me i desperately want to do trips like this to travel like this the main things holding me back are having the time off to do it im an armyfag and my gf    what are your personal circumstances job gf etc out of interest    good luck on your adventure
op is literally larping in his basement condo
  seconding this question what are your plans for when you arrive in la
  no op but curious whats your mos and how do you like it im considering enlisting at the end of this year most likely going 11c
  british army so i have no idea what you mean by mos im a paratrooper though
  the next day i got a ride into denver and planned on going south to colorado springs hitchhiking from cities is usually always a terrible idea and this was no exception all the spots were terrible so i kept jumping from spot to spot until i reached a gas station in this gas station was a really hot chick so i decided to ask her for a ride she said she was going to be a kitten from the pound and she would be happy to take me anywhere so im like hell yeah i love cats    we go there and have loads of fun and she even thanks me for joining her but once we get the cat it comes in this weird cardboard box and she wants to go home first before taking me where i want to go now i know from experience once im in somebodies home it will very likely end in me staying there the night so i happily obliged we get there play with the cat for a bit and then some of her friends come round until it eventually gets late her friends leave and im trying to figure out her intentions she says i can stay the night but i cant tell if she wants to fuck or not i decide just not to make a move unless she does because im not about to be kicked into the streets of denver at midnight    in the end she offers me the bed and shell sleep on the floor i tell i cant do that but she insists i just find it amusing so i go with it
  in the morning she takes me out for a nice breakfast and says that she would love to come camping with me but her car is busted its a simple fix and i tell her we could fix it easy so after a few hours we fix it and head down to colorado springs to see garden of the gods we drive in the most incredible storm and i was memorised i thought we could very well die on that road it was incredible     we get to garden of the gods late its absolutely pissing down and pitch black were not sure how we are gonna camp at this point this girl still hasnt made one flirtatious comment or even a look but i know if she wants to be in my tent with me it only means one thing so we just wait and for a moment it looks like the rain wont let up and we may be stuck inside the car for the night now im no chad not by any means so i know that if were in the car and im forced the make the move it might not happen     but the rain clears finally and she is super happy so we go and find a spot where we cant be seen in the morning and pitch my tent we get in and lay down and she tells me she likes to cuddle at night so i suppose this was probably my queue but we kinda just laid there for a while cuddled up for a few minutes and now i knew that it was now or never so i pushed her on her back and went for the kiss     and thats the story about how anon was finally touch on the penis by an american girl i ended up staying with her for about a week until we went to the mountains and i decided it was time for me to leave made a very dramatic exit and she was crying a lot made a few false promises and said goodbye
    about a month longer although who knows tbqh might never leave a part of me wants to throw away my backpack and stay in the desert for a while and learn some serious survival skills but seriously anon do think about it life is so incredible its a silly idea to waste it     i was thinking about this yesterday and when you look at the night sky you can see so many stars and plants and even galaxies but they dont have oceans wildlife fertile fields and food that grows on trees for hundreds of millions of years this planet had been a hub for life but we are the first to realise the significance of life we are the first to break out from routine of find food in the day sleep at night we are the first to try to give life some meaning through spirituality or a legacy or possessions do whatever you want    hitchhiking is good because its easy and fun and rewarding just go for it man youve already done nothing now do something
  none i had nothing before i left so i had nothing to lose remember theres always time though as long you remain fit you can do this in your 50s or 60s if your army and british youll be loved in america i can tell you that i get picked up by quite a lot of ex marines    also whats it like as a para ive been considering it for a while so im interested in what you get up to also is it right that you dont have to be a combatant to get your wings      who knows
  also is it right that you dont have to be a combatant to get your wings    well everyone is a combatant in the army not really the sps thoughand i guess rlc also though they got hit quite hard in afghan  combat logistic patrols are very juicy targets for terry taliban of course    but yes even in the logistics you can earn your wings only by passing p company obviously everyone else in the brigade 16 air assault can expect to serve alongside the infantry  signallers medics fire support teams all will serve at the sharp end with the infantry companies    peacetime military is a bit boring though of course you do things youd never do in civilian life but in between it sucks being part of a giant process driven bureaucracy people can literally make up a piece of paperwork and tell you that you did something wrong if your actions inconvenience them or embarrass them getting things done is utterly dependent on going through a ponderous and frustrating process involving lots of other people who may or may not be in work for the next few days/weeks nobody wants to be liable for anything if possible its an exercise in frustration and extreme patience    im in 7 para rha myself its not a bad gig ive jumped with foreign armies a couple of times and done some cool stuff joined too late for afghan though but been to the us jordan germany and kenya as well as a couple of cool places for at
    so after i left her i had literally no money i was a little bummed out and not sure how things could top the time i spent with her some mormons that drove me into denver said they would be able to give me some work in salt lake city so i set my sights there i cant even begin to explain how good it felt to get back on the road hitchhiking is so addictive that when i got my first ride i was buzzing guy was really cool even if he did have a suspicious bag of small white rocks who am i to judge     i got a few really good rides and i ended up at fruita colorado just a few miles after grand junction this is the last big town before utah and generally a terrible place to be a hitchhiker avoid fruita if you ever hitchhike that way only one place to thumb on and theres almost no shoulder for cars to pull over on which makes hitchhiking really fucking hard as only a crazy person is gonna pull over not to mention it seems the only people that go to fruita are people going for the state park only to go back into colorado which means theres almost no westward traffic     the day i got there i had only eaten half a whopper that somebody had brought me the day before and hitchhiking hungry makes for a very frustrating day especially since i have decided not to beg i strictly just ask for rides and just trust that what i need will come to me which it does eventually     right across the street from me a guy in all black arrives and starts waving a sign around a panhandler now this only makes things worse i try to differentiate myself from the hobos by being clean and dressing nice to make me more approachable but with this guy on the scene i aint gonna even get a looking so i decide to fuck off and find some wifi to talk to cass my girl in denver as i walk away the guy panhandling asks me if ive got some weed so i go over and talk to him hes nice but were two different hitchhikers i decide to go on my way and find a place to camp
  and thats the story about how anon was finally touch on the penis by an american girl    van anon here  i knew it was coming soon  i thought you might meet a girl in nederland where i dropped you off    if london anon comes to your city take him out to lunch he is great company and you wont regret it

  ive always wondered where do you bums get the sharpies from
  the average hobo in america makes 10 a day iirc sharpies are ez mode
    looks like some good chicken
    10 a day try again nigger panhandlers on avg through out the us make easily 50 plus a day west and east coat states most easily make close to 100 a day    t hobo of 6 yrs
  he hitchhiking not panhandling
  wew lad homelessness sounds a lot more lucrative than i thought      yeah im just saying sharpies cost almost nothing so its not difficult to get them at all even if you have almost 0 income
  everyone is talking about sharpies  but no mention of pooper
  hes right i worked at a gas station and was homeless while i was doing it and one night when i wasnt working and wasnt gonna get my check for another week so i went out and panhandled ive always hated doing it but i was pretty desperate that day cuz it was cold and my friend i usually crashed out was out of town easily made 250 just about what one week of working makes that night by just sitting on the corner looking miserable in one of the party districts in town honestly i can see why some people never get up off the street if they can easily make some good money and fuck around with it
okay i wrote a really long story that got lost and now im a little pissed so im gonna green text in short where i am so far and also im finally at a place with good enough wifi to upload photos    was thumbing with guy from my last post until we gave up and spoke to people at gas station  woman i asked said she could take me but not the other hitchhiker because of his dog  im going slc to meet these mormons i befriended who offered me work but this woman named trina told me i could do much better in her town of moab  she takes me into town to introduce me to some locals and buy me a meal  it would take me all day to describe how cool this woman is she has a tipi in her backyard she can communicate with hummingbirds she hates the cities and wishes for an apocalypse because she knows shell survive and loves the outdoors  perfect mum or wife material  she even lets me sleep in the tipi for 2 nights  anyway i never found work but i did get a 200 tax return out of the blue and them immediately after got another 200 from my grans will which i used to book a flight home while its still cheap  meet some hippies in moab  chill with them for a week go rock climbing for the first time go to slc where we pick up some hitchhikers on the way and one turns out to be the very one i met in fruita from above  meet a half navajo cowboy that lives in monument valley  he offers me a free horseback ride of monument valley if im down that way  decide to see him once i leave moab  stay for two nights and do a free horseback tour and jeep tour that he works for which would cost over 200buck  hitch a ride to st george where my mormon friends now are to get some work so i can go to zion my main goal of the trip  they pay for my entrance fee and even give mey own room in their rv  only get a days work in the end but got an extra 40 bucks in my pocket  camp out in zion for a night  gonna be going to the grand canyon tomorrow    pic related is trinas front porch any questions
moab from above
monument valley

zion from bellow
also went to a hs football game on monument valley which was one of the comfiest experiences ever
  sounds good no doubt i will be at some point is it fine to camp on the beaches in california because im thinking thats how i might spend my last week
              great stuff anon your life sounds like a movie right now am jealous
  u wont make it
  she has a tipi in her backyard she can communicate with hummingbirds she hates the cities and wishes for an apocalypse because she knows shell survive and loves the outdoors  is she part native sounds super cool
  if you make it to wisconsin i have a couch for you anon godspeed
so im in springdale southern utah like 7 hours away from la and got 3 weeks left right now i want to visit some of the surrounding towns of las vegas from fallout new vegas like goodsprings and primm and i want to camp in the mojave am also thinking of hitching through death valley    apart from that im not sure what to do any suggestions ive got about 80 bucks left
  yeah maybe i should have mentioned i was staying on a reservation the navajo nation runs across monument valley and yes they were very nice people and treated me very kindly although i was surprised to see how modernised they were i didnt expect them to wear nike and drink rockstar energy drinks but that might be to do with the fact their local economy is based on tourism
  i think maybe a tiny bit but for the most part she was white but yeah she was super cool we went for a walk and she told me about all the rocks we were stepping on everything she said was so interesting or wise i learnt so much talking to her and was very sad i didnt get to say goodbye but i met a couple that are going to moab and gave them a note with where she works and a message saying goodbye and thanks that i really hope she gets    pic related is her tipi
i also want to give a special mention to moab quite possibly the coolest town ive encountered on my travels there are two types of people in moab tourists and travellers everybody there is so welcoming everybody says hello to eachother and its completely normal to meet somebody new there and just go rock climbing or rafting or skinny dipping its got a real magic to it     most of the traveller types you meet have no interest in living inside the system and instead choose to find ways to sustain there travels and its so refreshing to meet people who dont care about bills or debt or petty gossip but just enjoy the breeze and the stars when you travel for a bit it does feel like there is a sense of weightlessness not having any worries or care about the future but just having faith that things will be alright and the world will look after you so long as you embrace it so meeting other people with this approach was incredible it makes me think back to home in london where all anybody does is moan and complain about their silly petty lives and i dont know how i can live in that environment    the hub of this town is a quaint little unknown coffee place that you wouldnt know unless someone told you about it called fmc i call it a coffee place because the owner makes his own coffee beans which he sells to local restaurants and coffee shops which is how he makes his money but he opens his door to anybody that wants to make themselves coffee which has formed the basis for the community here i met so many people but most significantly i met this two guys one who hikes across the country and one who bikes across the country both of whom live out their tent they welcomed me without a second thought into their group and took me on some cool adventures it made leaving moab really hard    unfortunately it looks like moab is growing too rapidly so go there while you can because right now the locals are saying the end of moab as we know it is soon to come
    fuck i want to do this just a few things that id like to ask how long have you been on the road and how much have you spent moneywise
  about 9 weeks i came to nyc with 500 dollars spent about half there then spent about 100 on gear that remaining 150 went pretty quickly but a lot of people have given me money so ive spent more than i came with although i have gone stretches with no money
  i have no idea how anyone looks at that desert landscape and doesnt puke at how ugly it is
    anon i have very much appreciated your sharing of your experiences but i take issue with your allusion to this dichotomy where youre either a an admirable freewheelin jack kerouac kinda guy or b a soulless wage slave who cant enjoy nature due to employment and its related responsibilities    i didnt grow up affluent and i dont like relying on others to facilitate my experiences so i have to maintain awareness that i have a job and bills to facilitate my /out/ endeavors i dont think that prevents me from gaining as deep an appreciation for the night sky and breeze as someone who is able to drop everything and hitchhike for months at a time    anyway moab and surrounding areas are beautiful i was just in that zone last month pic is related     keep doin what youre doin anon
  where is op at if you go hungry and have wifi let me know and ill order you some papa johns
  thats a great idea  i used to do this around christmas on /ck/ years ago  would order some starving college kid a pizza and have it delivered to him  i did pick the toppings though and made them as fucked up as possible  yes i know i am a dick  at least anchovies though bepis you gotta keep anon on his toes
  even more evil would be pineapple
ever plan on hitting up mn id be happy to meet up and share some soup      wouldnt this require an address
  wouldnt this require an address  there are several ways around this  easiest is anon just makes his way to the papa johns to pick up the pizza that bepis has already paid for on the interwebs or pbone
  this pretty much or op could be standing in front of whatever address he can find and i could order it
  no it is not  there are beach campsites but youll have to pay for a spot   but you can possibly get away with camping at beach if you have a small set up and break up in the morning
glad to see youre still alive anon youre living the dream
  i read that in a very different way than you did i see it as people who are there to see things read attractions history archetecture etc vs people who are there to just be there experience how life is for the people there to take in the everyday experience as much as the tourist traps this is why he said most of the travellers live outside the system or try to
    hello anon if you make it to northern california id be happy to show you some cool spots around the area yosemite is beautiful and i dont think its on fire any more
  there are also a lot of cool places to go see that dont charge an entrance fee
  if thats your terrorist hand please never return to uk   alternatively your real home probably great right now
  sounds like youll be going through the real desert soon youll probably be fine but dont get raped and murdered by truckers that stop at shitty highway towns near reservations
hol up how do you do this  what visa did you get anon im retarded and confused or is he doing all this in under 90 days
  hit me up if you make it to san francisco would be down to climb in the sierras with this anon 
  san francisco  enjoy your penus but
  i got the 90 day visa waiver aka esta which is the best option unless you want to spend like 150 for an extra 3 months
so i made it to the north rim of the grand canyon and i was impressed i got a ride there by these two nice old ladies one was 59 and the other was her mum who was about 86 they were very nice and must have taken to me because when they dropped me off at a gas station somewhere on navajo land they pleeded with the native girl that worked there to help me and so she offered her front yard on the reservation for me to camp in which i of course happily accepted and she even offered to drive me to horseshoe bend in the morning we went to her place and i dont think her mum was happy with the fact so she said we should go to her sisters because it was close to horseshoe bend and she would be cool well it turns out she wasnt so the gas station girl took me to horseshoe bend at night to camp there and she would pick me up in the morning she was very apologetic but it didnt bother me much    because it was late i couldnt be bothered to set up my tent and so i just got my blanket and slept on my pad i was pondering whether or not this was a good idea and was a little concerned about coyotes but i figured it was fine at about 330am i was woke up by something licking my face i opened up my eyes and began to pet it but it was dark so i couldnt see what exactly it was i knew it was canine so i shined my torch on it and oh fuck coyote i quickly turned off my light and for a very brief second i considered what to do and reached for my knife an automatic switchblade i got near zion but its so playful and its rolling around and showing me his belly and wait a sec coyotes dont have dog collars and so i shined my flashlight once more and of course its not a fucking coyote its a husky so i continue to pet him and he is very playful and decide to try find his owner so i get up and walk around the parking lot the dog is such a good dog he is right by my side walking with me but theres nobody about so i go back to sleep and the dog sleeps right beside me
so right now im in flagstaff and have been hanging out with so many random people my first night here i spoke to nice woman at an outdoor store and she said she would let me camp in her backyard once she is let off work what i didnt realise is she had a family so i was quite shocked to see she has a husband and two daughters a 5 and 6 year old but i was quite happy about it it takes a lot of trust to open your home to a stranger when you have little kids and also i really enjoy being in a real family environment its very comfy and wholesome and i like to watch what parents do so i can be prepared if i ever have kids     it was a very enjoyable experience and really enjoyed talking to their 6 year old who was very smart and mature for her age its strange when you can talk to a kid like an adult and realising halfway through the conversation that they are a tiny human that laughs at the word poo
  the next day i was offered to stay at their home again but i declined to see who else i would meet well i met this really cool guy in yet another outdoor store who i went out to get a drink with and let me crash on his couch when we were at the bar i even met this girl from la who said she could hook me up with a place to stay at her friends home in downtown la which was cool    and that brings us to today i left the guys apartment and he had a busy schedule so we went our separate ways and i decided to hang around the university i see some skaters hanging out and skating and i used to skateboard alot so i decided to hang with them there i met this blonde girl who was in all honesty quite boring but hot shame she had a bf when he came over she told him that im from london and hitchhiking across the country and he gave possibly the bluntest reaction i have ever seen he didnt say cool or even hi he didnt even look at me haha it was so funny because i know thats a pretty interesting thing to hear so to react like that i knew he was a little bitter in the end she had to go to class and i asked her if i could go to class with her and to my surprise to said yes without hesitation    now ive never been to university because i did poorly in school and tbqh i have always wanted to so i was so happy to go to a lecture even it was in biology and i didnt have a clue what the teacher was saying so i sat there at the back of this class for about an hour with this girl and it was just like secondary school the teacher talking about a load of stuff i didnt care about and me not listening i remembered why i didnt do so good after class i thanked the girl for letting me join her and said goodbye    right now i dont know where im gonna stay but its a college town so im gonna go to bar and either find some college chick to sleep with or a bro that will let me crash on his couch
  this has been amazing to read thanks for keeping us updated op glad youre still kicking where to now
  awesome op  let us know when you get to la more than glad to buy you a couple drinks and a nice dinner

  pineapple best pizza topping it tastes sweet which no other topping does yet still tastes good when warm it is nothing like any other topping which is why its so good
  has london redeemed his tripfag pizza yet
  im saving it for when i need it likely when im in la
it seems as though going to bars and talking to people is a sure way of finding a place to stay in my time in flagstaff i put it to the test twice and was successful both times i was a little bit anxious about going in to a packed out college bar alone not knowing anybody there but it had a garden that i could smoke a cigarette that made me feel better    first time i did it i got a beer went out to the garden lit a cig and browsed the demographic until i sat down next to this guy with his friends and just started talking when i told him about my story he introduced me to this one chick who introduced me to two more chicks all wanting to listen to my story they invited me to a party and then introduced me to a brit who introduced me to another brit and then all the sudden i was surrounded by brits that studied at the uni it was crazy i hadnt been around other lads in so long it felt good they then left and i looked for the chicks that invited me to party that were sitting next me and they were gone and replaced by a whole new group    so after a while of looking around a little confused i just figured i would talk to this new guy right next to me i dont remember what i said but as soon as i told him im from england hitchhiking from nyc to la he freaked out and suddenly introduced me to everyone there with hey this guys from england turn out he was a part of a frat and he was with these chicks from a sorority they were heading to another bar and invited me there     i had tons of offers for me to stay on their couch one of the guys was carrying my backpack and a chick brought me a hotdog when we were outside the next bar i had three blondes around me one in my arms telling me i should come back to their sorority but one of the fratbros the one i started talking to first yelled out theyve all got bfs they wont fuck you come to the frat so trusting his judgement i went decided to stick with them im still not sure if i am happy with that one
  we went into the bar and i got a few free drinks but i was still practically sober so i still felt a little out of my depth eventually the night ended when one of the guys got kicked out for complaining about his shot being too short when i went back to the frat house it was an incredible experience i never went to university but ive always wanted to since watching animal house and it was hilarious most of the doors were either gone or just resting on the frame because they had been kicked down for fun     the next morning everyone was hungover and sharing stories of the night before while watching sunday american football it was kinda funny the night before i had been offered to stay there all week but it was clear the next day that wasnt the case so i left a little too late too late to hitch out so i had to do the same thing as the night before go to the bar and see who i meet sure enough i met a guy who was nice enough to offer me his own bed while he went to his brothers but also call everyone he knew in la and lv     he had a nice place that he shared with two other guys pool table some good dogs guitars netflix and a bed all to myself i was chuffed    it seems as though this is gonna have to be my strategy from now on as i spend more time in cities ill be in vegas later tonight and have no idea if it will work considering everyone there is a tourist
last night i crossed over into nevada i got 3 rides from flagstaff 1 of which was quite significant in the guy just see me sitting outside a gas station smoking and asked to buy a cigarette for a dollar and then offered to take me up the road i initially didnt think it was worth it but went anyway because ive learned the hard way to accept all rides when possible just because its good to keep moving and not stay in one spot for too long but it was worth it because he brought me breakfast and said something that has kind of stuck    he said warren buffets is the richest man in the world and once he was asked what its like to have everything to which he responded by saying i dont have the one thing that matters time i kind of realised how lucky i am im young i have no responsibilities i can do whatever i want some people are born and have to look after their family from young some are born with the expectation to do great things some waste their youth not knowing how precious it is until its too late     but not me im a nobody i have no money no job no future no worries and i dont need it because im young and live by my own standards my own rules i go where i want to go im smart enough take and make opportunities and stupid enough to not care or be scared
  you go back and tell that nerd jeff bezos is wealthier than warren buffet also cheers on leading a somewhat dank life if i was a turbo autist i would try it
  aw fuck i meant wasnt
  vegas is a bizarre experience have fun and dont buy any drugs or hookers from the guys on the strip make friends with some locals and they can show you where the cool people ie not the standard tourist scum of the earth hang out     by the way captcha is the bane of my existence lick my scrote google
  but where do i find the locals i fucking hate tourists
im a neet hikki virgin and i too would like this but for a different reason    do you have some kind of electronic device to listen to music audiobooks whatever while traveling  do you carry books how much space do they take up   where do you get water  is it necessary to carry a weapon for self defense  how much human interaction is necessary  how much calories/food do you need a day    my dream is europe  no modern transportation walk everywhere  ideally only physical books but this limits me to carrying what can fit dont wanna get some electronic device i have to rely on charging in some library near people  stay away from people as much as possible ascetic hermit style  not wear shoes maybe  no electronics
  oh and  spend all time off from walking reading all the books on my list  visit various historical and holy sites  do what water fasts are feasible
    forgot the last question how long/hard is it going to get a neet sedentary body to hiking across continent is there a chance that my body/legs get damaged by the stress
  that hand  please never come back to europe we dont need more of your kind here  besides after reading your tales i feel like you should probably stay in the us youre having an amazing time so far
  we have this thing called the sun in america if you spend enough time out in it the back of your hands will start to get darker
  even pale pastey limey fucks
  since youre from the us its not surprising you cant recognize a pakis skin at first glance i envy you honestly
  tfw ive been a proud poc this whole time
  do you have some kind of electronic device to listen to music audiobooks whatever while traveling  yeah my phone but i usually just listen to music on it  do you carry books how much space do they take up   i tend to just carry one book and give it away or exchange once im done with dont carry unnecessary items unless they mean something to you   where do you get water  everywhere restrooms restaurants gas stations natural springs  is it necessary to carry a weapon for self defense  its more for peace of mind the longer you travel the more likely you are to need one   how much human interaction is necessary  depends how self sufficient you are if you can get your own food by buying it picking it or hunting it than you will almost never have to talk to anybody but if you cant do any of those things then you will need people  how much calories/food do you need a day  i met somebody who was hiking cross country and i think he said 3000 but i might be wrong but it kinda depends on you build  how long/hard is it going to get a neet sedentary body to hiking across continent is there a chance that my body/legs get damaged by the stress  im no expert since i dont walk long distances but i can tell you it depends on how far you are and how much stuff you want to carry if your just chubby than you will be fine youll be burn it off on your travels if your a fat fuck than you better hit the treadmill asap and get your body used it but i dont know how long because i dont know how far you are
  i dont know how far you are  all the way
was op murdered in vegas 
  nope although it would probably be more eventful than what ive done instead which is nothing so far i met and hung out with a hooker for a bit which was insightful and fired an m1a1 thompson which has always been a bit of a dream of mine but apart from that most of my time has been spent smoking in casinos watching people gamble now i got no cigs and almost no money which is worrying because my next stop is la and i dont know how im gonna get around without money for public transport let alone food
  there must be tons of anons in socal ready to share a meal though details on the hooker story 
  details on the hooker story   not much to say i was sitting in down outside a casino and she walks past and starts asking me what im doing and where im staying this night was my first night in vegas and i had nowhere to stay so i thought it would be cool to just stay up all night and explore vegas at night she then introduced her business to which i told her i had only a dollar and so she left after telling me if she sees me again shes gonna be all up on me     i wasnt sure what this meant i was hoping it meant a freebie but apparently it just meant getting a drink so we just chatted for a while until she went home thats pretty much it
  it was an invitation to become her new pimp  you were supposed to slap her to the ground and take her purse  you then agrily take out the money and put it in your pocket  after that you toss the purse at her and take her out to a nice breafast  jesus its like you brits dont know anything about women
  unicorns are so majestic
  if you have any questions  i read into the wild about alexander supertramp liked it a lot  id like to do like you but i have a rent to pay and no family or friends to leave my stuff to if i left my one room flat in town knowing the market and my profile hitchhiking abroad would be fun but back in my country id be homeless for real
  writers and prostitutes  bums and prostitutes    classic
  great post daddys boy
  look around your flat at all your possessions and ask yourself how much of it you will have when you are 30 or 50 or dead your possessions will likely be gone at some point but the memories and experiences you make will impact you your entire life so dont think twice about selling your possessions beside the sentimental stuff
  i read into the wild about alexander supertramp  liked it a lot  and into the trash it goes
  kek op gonna have the munchies real good when he gets into cali
  what is it that you didnt like little piece of dogshit
  he didnt read it
today i will embark on my last long distance hitchhike from jean nevada to los angeles california its really fucked up to think im coming to the end of my trip ill be flying out in four days im a little bit annoyed that i dont have more time to explore california but oh well theres always next time    am also a little bit pissed i didnt save any money for la because i have no idea how im gonna get about or where im gonna stay but fuck it thats all part of the fun
  muh society  muh courage  muh poison  its a steaming pile of shit full of falsehoods that encourages people to worship a dead dumbass who died because he literally had zero survival skills op is worth infinitely more than mccandless was
  i suggest reading the book
  i did granted the book doesnt glorify or romanticize him that much but the fact that tons of brainlets all over the world seem to be entranced by the tale of this fucking idiot is very telling and cant all be blamed on the movie
  i think people like or dont like the book because he had family issues and because of his politics  but he says nothing bad in the book about his parents  i dont know if op eats natural food growing on trees and can tell the difference between   healthy food   poison for starved person   poison for everyone    mccandless had brought a book about plants growing where he was not really a stupid move      pulp fiction commie novels   ill let you own that comment mammas boy  well go in nature without money leave your stuff at mammas place and when you come back make a stop at mammas maybe your trip to nature will help fix that unrequited hatred    god why am i being insulted take your pills mammas boy
  muh poison again  dude its pretty much established by now that mccandless just died of starvation because he couldnt find any food the book has been heavily criticized for this bullshit poisonous seeds theory ever since if was first published it makes mccandless look unlucky when in reality he was just completely fucking inept
oh shit i was hoping youd come back anon again if you find yourself in the spokane washington area ill buy you coffee im a milfag too so i can try to get you on base    ill also be back in northern california in mid december if youll be arouns    im so glad you finally made it back

  ah thanks downtown santa monica
anon was kill because starve on the belly
  hey anon you still down to meet
  number fifteen
  i was surprised to see how modernised they were i didnt expect them to wear nike and drink rockstar energy drinks but that might be to do with the fact their local economy is based on tourism  people have been saying that since literally 1600 anways i got a weird vibe from the navajo seems they dont really like whites but who can blame them or other indians also being in a navajo town is a weird experience its like a 3rd world country in the us people are drunk everywhere and they let their cows and horses all over the roads in the dark also no alcohol is allowed in navajoland
  i dont get this joke
give us an update anon
in la right now and ive been using my debit card to use public transport and eat despite it being overdraft which is now 49 but now the bank has put an end to that some im a little bit stuck the main problem it seems is i dont know how im gonna get about i was gonna try jump the metro but the station im at is crawling with security    any suggestions
  i know where that is ill come pick you up if you suck my tallywhacker
  all you need is money for a bus its like 2 just suck it up and ask for spare change
  are you a hot chick
  thats probably gonna be my only option i could call my brother and im sure he would lend me some money but i really dont want to do that
  whoops post meant for 
  incoming penuses  rip in peace your mouth and anis virginity anon  pretty bad mistake

    kek
  thats what is known as a freudian click  your subconscious knew exactly what it was doing
the rules of the road for hitchhiking as i understand them in usa  if youre young nice old ladies will pick you up and maybe feed you supper  if youre old only dudes expecting a handjob at least
  needing money at la    yeesh senpai good luck dont end up on hobo street
got a taste of hitchhiking last summer  now have a constant feeling of leaving everything behind and doing it again    fuck

  sounds good but ill be flying home tomorrow unfortunately
  damn man im still down to do it but i missed that message im an old man who goes to bed before 9pm and if youre on the west coast thats like 5pm or 6pm
  tfw op was even at a papa johns  fuck i feel so bad i fell asleep all early
boobs
  i think op is on his way back to the depressing bongland    he was already at the airport by the time we figured this out so our options were limited i fell asleep like 10min before he hit me up for the pizza last night too i feel like an asshole
  will you still post on /brit/
  it depends on how out of shape you are if youre morbidly obese it would certainly help to lose weight and do some cardio the less you weigh and the more endurance you have the easier it is the human body is pretty resilient when it is in good shape
well /out/ the dream is over im now back at home it is utterly bizarre considering how eventful the last three months have been to be back in my room with my bed    its kind of crazy it all started with pic related when i got a advance on my first neetbux payment but they mistakenly paid in two payments so i decided to book flights to nyc that night im still not sure why i decided new york but i did it mindful that if i wanted to it would be a great place to start hitchhiking because i had been researching ways to travel for cheap and figured if i wanted to see the states this was the only way i could although i wasnt actually confident enough to think i would go through with it but thanks to some advice and encouragement from you guys on /out/ i did and i have to thank you all for it shout out to beppu and special shout out to van anon i used that blanket for the rest of my trip and still have it
  how was la did it suck there i imagine its a pain to get any money or rides because of all the bums    was it better or worse than nyc and the east coast as far as tryin to survive    sorry again for falling asleep like 10min before you wanted the pizza i need to quit this job waking up at 4am is inhumane
hitchhiking is strange yet somewhat addictive i can only compare it to fishing you find a spot you wait not really knowing what catch youll get but knowing that as long as youre patient enough youll catch something and when you do its a buzz and you get going you make progress on your journey and get to talk to somebody thats usually pretty cool theres nothing like hitchhiking because one thing ive learned is that with people often come opportunities maybe its a job a lasting relationship a tour of the local area some handy knowledge or just meeting more people who may have something to offer themselves as long as your meeting new people theres no telling where you will go and i cant think of anything like hitchhiking where you are forced to meet people and such good people i was once very anti social and would often sneer towards people but ive been led to believe that as long as you surround yourself with good people youll live a fruitful life stick your middle finger up to the arseholes and a hand out to the good ones thats what ill say    theres also this sense of faith on the road im not religious one bit but i always had faith in what i couldnt tell you but i always knew that i would get what i need i always knew i would eat get rides and find good company if something didnt go my way i didnt worry nor care because i knew that as long as i embraced the road and took ever opportunity that came my way i would be looked after its really strange but its something every hitchhiker ive met will talk about faith its a weird thing but its necessary    i hope that you all enjoyed my stories and photos and ramblings and i hope that for those of you who have nothing and feel like a nobody that you find solace in the idea of nothingness because anything is better than nothing so everything you do will be an improvement its only you that can decide what life youre gonna get so be who you wanna be and dont waste any time
if you decide to go out and give hitchhiking or something similar a go and have some questions my anon email is dundundun291gmailcom feel free to contact me with questions your gfs noods or whatever
  i liked it but yeah having no money there is fucking shit your better off in ny simply because you can walk most places but you can camp on the beach at santa monica which is nice also when i went ny i had money since i was going there simply for a week holiday and got some birthday money for my 21st    i wasnt really that worried in la aswell because some hiker gave me some mris and id been saving them in case i was stuck in the dessert but this was even worse i was stuck in la but they did me good and then i got a couchsurfer who gave me 20bucks and paid for me to get a lyft to the airport but he was fucking weird though gay jew from west hollywood ive learnt my lesson there
  mri from a hiker  sounds legit how much was the copay
  glad youre out man    i love la as it is my home but i would never want to be displaced there

im gonna use this as a hitchhiking general   how far do i have to go til i get to a nice small town im from one myself but we dont have any jobs my other option is to move to a nearby city for employment which i would rather not do but will do if necessary   im from central kentucky as a frame of reference
thanks for the ride brother
  getting to a different small town would only be a few hours however a nice one i dont know depends on whats around you i tend to look at google maps directions and double the time they set for driving when hitchhiking because you never know how long your gonna wait
fuck i miss throwing up my thumb hopping in the bed of a truck and watching the road disappear behind you not a care in the world just the self the bag and the road ahead humbling experience  god speed anon
so is op a pakistani or arabic or not i need to know for sociological research purposes its important towards the fabric of this story and its place in americana
  no just tanned and very dirty i tan easily because my great grandfather was italian but other than that i am british dont see why it matters
was really comfy following your journey
what a belting post op seems like a truly decent chap and what a way to spend his dole
  vote for bernie  op is a yuropean who gets like 1500 bucks a month for being a young student no other questions askedz
  vote for a guy who is not running for office and you get     are all communists this retarded
  1500  more like 300bucks a month
  kek demsocfor pragmatic reasons here truly natsoc and we need massive transfer of wealth from juden billionaires to common people like us
  i want to do this soon just pick a cardinal direction and go there until i have to pick another i want to see stuff meet people hopefully find a wife i started practicing packing my stuff in these last few weeks
  no
  nothing better to do besides i think the world will probably end within 6 years anyways
  i want to do this soon     no you dont     i started practicing packing my stuff in these last few weeks    oh i can see you are serious now maybe a few decades practicing packing your stuff and you can overcome that massive hurdle of how to pack your stuff
  tfw a weirdo  does that men i cant hitchhike
  i can relate more to a european as a european since every anon on this site is me they are all therefore european
amazing content op happy the states treated you well
  all that crazy shit your moms has been teaching you is not true
  reminder that people in medieval time believed that too for a few hundred years always somewhere in the next ten years probably
  make sure to burn your possessions on the way out the door you brainwashed idiot
  fucking do it whatever direction has more ground to cover pick that one because youll see more and do more its easy as piss mate as long as your open and willing youll have the time of your life just pack only what you need
  of course you can dont tell anybody but the sign is a little white lie you have to be weird if you want to hitchhike
  what are you talking about you dont know me i want to leave right now but theres still a few things i need to get a hold of
  i dont need atheist cucks to constantly tip their fedoras at me if you dont like religion then just ignore my post damn
  religion is fine that end times shit is for the feeble minded  if you are hanging out with people who say the world is ending you are in a cult
  no my beliefs are all based on personal experiences research and discussions with many types of people from different religions

  fuck yeah that sounds cool as fuck i am actually thinking of going to australia too be sure to post some pics

    tips  ask people at the petrol stations  pick a spot where cars are going slow  always pick a spot where a car can easily pull aside w/out creating a jam  go near the edge of a city  smile  look presentable  offer to pay for petrol if you can afford it  trust your instincts
    why the fuck not go to africa  be you no reason to live  decide that yo will take life by the balls and go to mother africa  go there take a knife buy an ak  fuck endless thick/fat/thin/hugetit/phatass women for dollars yes less than a handfull of dollars and have them orgasm on your white dick like it was candy creme  yeah you might get aids but you want to die anyway right and aids is a decades sort of disease these days so no real harm there certainly no barrier to fucking all the pussy you could ever imagine for a few bucks worth of pocket change they are super eager and keen anyway     be you  had your fill of pussy until your balls ache and you dont know what to do with yourself at least if you an hero now you wont be a virgin  decide to live a little more instead decide to climb kilamajaro   its an arduous hike but you can hire a team of sherpas to carry all your supplies for as little as you spent on your sexcapade the last few weeks   you hike for several days before ending up at the tallest mountain in africa   you look as far as you can see and for once in your life you feel a peace and freedom that you have never known it is as if your heart and mind and body are all becoming one   you dont want to move incase that feeling disappears   if you died this second you would die happier than you have ever been   you live   you make the way back down the mountain and you make friends with the sherpas suddenly your life doesnt seem as empty as it always did at home   you get back to base camp and you have friends for life with these sherpas you part ways but you will always remember the last few days where they let you into their inner circle and you were part of a tight knit working class community   you go to devils falls because you always wanted to swim in the rock pool at the top of that gianourmous waterfall  you get there you are in the rock pool you want to peer over the edge see your
  i was here 8 months ago and read this wordforword are you really such a slow traveler that you have to copypasta your own story multiple times even on a board as slow as this to get your kicks or are you trolling these people by constantly posting your story to get attention and lots of yous     fasincated either way because you are quite a story teller but it is clear you are also somewhat of a troll/attentionseeker becuase you are clearly lurking her so much so that i can go for almost a year and come back to a thread that is word for word what i read last year     i could almost write your story depending on how much of it you have already written     tell me honestly bro whats your deal you can have a glitch in the matrix this one time the next round of /out/ readers wont know any better if you fess up this time
  i was here 8 months ago as well and this all seems new to me also archives only show one result when you search the text in that post  i think youre just having deja vu anon
dude this thread has been up all summer no one is trying to fool you
  tfw a schizophrenic zoomer comes to slander one of the best posters
    no this is legitimately word for word his exact same story from nearly a year ago i remember it because i was quite captivated with it at the time and it was a nice read well written same thing about the hitch hiking anon and the girl he met who bought him breakfast blah blah blah     and thats the story about how anon was finally touch on the penis by an american girl  thats the line that stuck with me exact same line i remember thinking good for you british guy our girls are amazing     the archive doesnt go back 8 months this guy has been around forever and someone is either reguritating his stories or he is like the attention whores on /b/ who post the same thread every hour/day to try and get some more bites maybe the anon got some good replies from people with this story which is starting to seem fictitious and he reposts it every few months
  
  well if op is really a scammer who was bored enough to go to lax for 15 in free starbucks ill give him an a for effort
  op here you are mistaken maybe your perception of time is a bit off and when you last read this it felt further away in time    if you look at the previous thread when i started i post more in the the moment and so you can clearly see me in interact with fellow anons and see its quite real main reason i continued posting is because i was too lazy to write a journal so just posted my experiences here and anons liked the updates so it made sense
  the archive doesnt go back 8 months

  boulder citys cooler than primm just sayin  now is an optimal time of year to hike in this area take in what you can the blue diamond loop is a bit of a detour but has a bunch of cool shit  my family and i are taking a trip to california in a couple of weeks from henderson and we could squeeze you in for a hitchhike in case youre stumped
    this is me     thought i would add my own experiences to this legendary thread flew into sydney a week ago and did workaway for a nice lady in the suburbs sydney was way too big so i wanted to get outta there asap and start hitching up the east coast     i trained out of sydney and threw up the thumb a goodcunt picked me up he was something of a kindred spirit as he had bike toured across many a country we exchanged stories and he told me to do this coastal hike he dropped me off at the national park and i went on my way the beaches here are picturesque i slept on the beach under the stars it was cozy     pic related is the morning sunrise
i cant believe this thread is still up  london anon this is van anon   how is life back in the uk are you happier for having made the trip or has it just given you wanderlust i hope you are doing well my friend

oioi
especially for those of you who go on solo outings
  i dont let alone on social media
i upload my photos to google maps
i have weird days off so most of my stuff is solo i dont do selfies so i just take a pic of my pack i also dont have a problem with that picture i hate it when you climb a mountain and you can physically see the tallest point like a rock sticking out and some idiot is sitting on it eating lunch then you say hey hows it going would you mind if i stood on that rock so i can say i was at the tallest point i know its retarded but then they give you this disgusted that they have to move look
  would you mind if i stood on that rock  this is what i mean the pointy rock is the tallest place on this mountain and i would have felt denied if i didnt stand on it
i take photos and write trip reports the reports are for myself mostly as it helps me remember what i did my family likes them too 99 of my trips are solo and the ones that arent solo i usually find boring enough not to write a report on  tfw just started posting photos on instagram  i just want to be a normie man
  i also send caltopo links of the route im planning to my family just in case something happens while im out
    i dont  if somebody is interested i offer them to join me and see for themselves whats going on    i behave in this way since i am firmly convinced that everybody reacts in their personal way to activities and describing something pushes my ideas onto them polluting the experience  this is expecially true for outdoor related stuff
  i hate it when you climb a mountain and you can physically see the tallest point like a rock sticking out and some idiot is sitting on it eating lunch  that happened to me last time i hiked mt washington there was 82858924 chinks land whales and canadians who drove up the fucking mountain bogarting the summit sign i turned around and had lunch 100ft down the mountain
  hiking mt washington in the summer  you deserve your troubles anon
i like to take pics of interesting parts on my phone for my own memorys sake i dont do selfies or anything like that sometimes i share them on facebook if i remember but i usually dont my family back home likes to see them so i still do it once in a while i almost exclusively go solo
  mount washington may be the worst for this coming off that 1/2 mile scamble at the top only to be greeted by an overweight wannabe hick boomer with his harley davidson tshirt tucked into his jeans asking if you climb up this thing makes me dread doing the presidential run again
    fine guess ill just crush it again in winter this time first one up today
questions that dont deserve their own thread  if youre too lazy to google or you dont want to kill innocent threads you can post here
is suunto a30 the compass to get
asking again about estonia last thread someone suggested sailing which sounds promising and another just said the baltics suck for outdoors without explanation     i know its usually flat cold wet and dark but is it easy to just backpack and camp out in parks seems like its heavily forested with low population density for europe but i dont know the laws or if they have an equivalent of american blm/nf land im not looking at anything too serious just wondering if its easy to hike around the country and camp out     maybe buying land to live offgrid on a more temperate island/coastal area to get more unrealistic i was surprised to see the lowest average monthly temperature is 24f on hiiumaa and theres nearly 2000 average sunshine hours in parts of saaremaa not as bad as i expected but still a pipedream
  yes i have it and it does everything i want or need from a compass
this thread seems to be dead but is this a good deal im not worried about weight would you anons pay 110 for this sleeping pad  
  cool pic
  its easy to camp there  dont buy land there buy land in finland or poland
anyone know any good deals on mountain bikes    i dont see myself needing some 1000 monster
sleeping with your boots on will make your feet significantly warmer right    i wear wellies gum boots for winter hikes they dont absorb water since theyre rubber only my socks do can i dry the boots off put them back on and wear them inside my sleeping bag for extra warmth am i better off using a pair of down booties
  i find that clothes leech warmth out of me when its real cold i sleep nude and i find its a lot warmer i run hot so maybe i just transfer flesh heat better that way
why the fuck does it always rain the days i want to go camp
  wait till after end of year then buy last year models at reduced rate dont worry about shocks or ebike shit get disk brakes if you can rim brakes are a pain in the ass  good reliable model is boulder 6000 though it has rim brakes get giant reliable and life time warranty on the frame dont buy carbon dont buy a fucking bike from walmart or kmart unless youve got the mechanical know how to tune it up because it wont be dont properly when you buy it get a bike fit and mark the areas with permanent marker so you can readjust it when it slips if your still growing get another bike fit every 12 years until your fully grown get a large cassette like 3840 teeth make sure youve got a helmet and visor and make sure youve got everything on you and your bike so you comply with the law if you wanna save money you dont want a 300 dollar fine for not having a reflector    make sure you have a rear reflector as well as front and back lights for night riding even if you dont intend to always make sure youve got water and carbs on you its down right dangerous to ride without both i cant stress this point enough always wear your helmet and visor without exception i personally prefer tinted visors when im out on the road because it stops glare from blinding me     what kind of riding do you want to do
  im looking for a pair of boots that would be good to wear on streets and on hikes i usually wear two pairs of socks and orthotic insoles so liners and inner sole quality arent important ive been recommended timberland 6 boots which are the sort of thing im looking for but i want to know if anybody has anything similar that are lower cost or more reliable pic related varustelekas own ankle boots
is this a good buy are there any other tents that i should consider    im looking for a tent with durable material easy to pitch and would last for some time 5 years maybe more
can i eat this
  the real question is should you eat that
  also carry multi tool and patch kit  plastic bag and poncho incase it rains
  personally id only buy an expensive mat for proper winter use the rest of the year a ccf mat is fine they are cheap and indestructible       down booties will be exponentially warmer than sleeping in wellies      sleeping nude is such a meme if its cold i wear extra clothes and its undeniably warmer      gd is testing your commitment to /out/ thank gd for the chance to prove yourself      where do you live and where do camp most often
  definitely looks like an amanita sp perhaps a strain of a muscaria but im not sure dont eat
  i live somewhat near the equator with 3 seasons climate im thinking of getting the akto cause enan is much more expensive    i mostly camp in rocky trails and grassy area but the rain and wind in here are harsh hence why i need a durable tent and easy to pitch too    i was also looking at smd skyscape trekker but one of my hiking buddies tent smd lunar solo was punctured by a small rock while camping and im hesitant to buy it despite a good cyber monday bargain    im open to any other suggestions
  personally i think pyramid style tents are the best as the are easy and quick to pitch and handle wind like a champ i know smd do some mid shelters in regards to durability its a personal thing how much durability are you willing to sacrifice to save weight thinner materials just need to be babied a bit more and can last a life time
im moving from florida to northern idaho soonish and i need some actual cold weather clothes instead of sweaters and jeans  everything north face is retardedly expensive  are there any decent alternatives  or should i just resign myself to spending a bunch of money on winter clothes
  there are places to skimp but generally yea being warm can get expensive a good tip for saving money is that a lot of camping and hunting stuff is exactly the same in different colors and the hunting stuff is often waaaay cheaper also comes in black also buy winter stuff at summer tent sales or right at the top of fall clear outs     i would not skimp on   boots  gloves you can get inexpensive ones but dont go wicked budget  coats sorry to say you will prob need more than one one because your damn its cold and im going to die why do i live in a place where the air will kill me are very different levels of cold  long john  just get the silver editions
    when i lived in west yellowstone which had a steady winter temp of minus 20 with dips to minus 50 i wore     polypropylene top/bottom underwear milsurp there are better options available now i presently own rei base layers rei has great shit thats usually less than the big brands somewhat ironicical statement yes     sorel insulated waterproof boots these are so common out there they carry them at the local walmarts they really did the job feet were always totally warm and dry     freezer suit a fellow complete stranger overheard me speaking about the severity of climate i was moving to invited me to his home old redneck trailer in the country to give me his old freezer suit from his old job at a grocery wholesaler it was bibs with suspender straps and coat top performed excellently i actually laid around in the snow taking naps in that shit and was totally toasty    between the underwear and freezer suit i wore plain old jogging sweat pants and a t shirt these days i would have the rei base layer underwear suit rei fleece top and bottom mid layer and some sort of water and wind resistant bibs and coat which the freezer suit was
  they sell a lot of knockoff cold weather gear on ali express if you look in the right place often times it comes from the same factory as the name brand stuff the tradeoff is super long ship times and poor quality control a lot of hiking and mountaineering forums will have threads on budget gear i would look there first      you basic cold weather clothing setup will look like    1 a thermal base layer this is skin tight and usually wool or synthetic  2 a midlayer usually a fleece  3 a down or synthetic coat and pants  4 a shell layer for freezing rain and snow this will either be a dwr treated layer or goretex this is the layer that you will probably not be able to find cheap you can get cheaper silnylon shells but they dont breath at all and kind of suck when your sweat freezes
can someone give me the rundown on these whats legal to do with them whats not wtf the alarm button does etc total newfag here im a /k/ milsurp guy so i need the baby version links to legal summaries would be appreciated    in east us if it matters for applicable law
    varusteleka and kommandostore have austrian jackets made of goretex and sympatex try asking them for the goretex one for 30ish excellent deal if youre actual poorfag looks good for casual wear too        after checking they seem to have gone up in price but these are excellent if you want to keep your eyes on it and see if varu discounts them or just shop around for a cheaper one
hemp is federally legal in the us now correct  can we talk about it here without being b
    easy to pitch    the hilleberg atko is not freestanding and given that    rocky trails and grassy area  3 seasons equatorial    id recommend a freestanding tent possibly with outer fly pitching first so you wont get the inner chamber wet when it rains with abundant netting in the inner chamber so you will have good ventilation and limit condensation since youre in a 3 season country    also hilleberg is goddamn expensive    protip avoid single walled tents theyre for high altitude activities
  careful big agnes pads are designed to be used with their bags inserted into a sleeve otherwise they can be very slippery

im thinking of getting merrell moab 2s but i heard people complaining about them not being waterproof very limited options of what i can get tho anyways to adress or fix this
  pot  anon asked about hemp
  silva 4 is a good option
are there any exercises that will help me improve my attention to detail skill when it comes to tracking during a hunt
i think i already know the answer is no but im going to ask anyway     are there any /out/ approved places to live that arent expensive have work nearby and some amenities i currently live in utah and my 240k house i bought 3 years ago now appraises for 350k i kinda want to take the 100k after closing costs and live somewhere cheaper where i can start a family a low mortgage or no mortgage looks really appealing at the moment     pic unrelated
layering    im in the uk its not that cold but its humid is it ok and normal for hiking to be sweaty and your under layers to be wet but not cold    or is the aim with layering to be sweat free    im hiking and im sweating but not cold and im still warm but im wet is this the aim or is being dry in all your clothes the aim
ive been bitten by the /out/bug  im excited to finally join the ranks of other /out/ers     after visiting out daily for months ive caught myself dreaming about beautiful moments innawoods camping alongside rivers and creeks meditating alongside majestic mountain views and swimming in natural springs i love nature and want to learn and experience as much as i can    ive been car camping in a state park in florida and it was the most fun ive had in years i would like to learn more about how to build a fire tie knots set traps for animals fish setting up a tarp use a knife/hatchet in various ways     id also like to learn more about nature myself identifying different species of animals trees mushrooms etc as well as backpacking and rock climbing/bouldering    my amazon wishlist     mountaintop 40l back pack   bahco folding saw  opinel no 8 /mora companion  fiskars x7  casio f91w1 watch  wool blanket  teton sports camping pillow  coleman sleeping bag  thermarest z lite  tarp  hammock  stanley cook set  stanley classic vacuum bottle 11 qt  first aid kit  catahoula 36 tarred and twisted nylon tine 117    ive done a lot of research on that list so im curious if it covers the basics of going out     looking to buy equipment that is relatively inexpensive while still maintaining a very high standard of quality thank you for reading
nix the hatchet stanley bottle camping pillow folding saw and coleman sleeping bag dont buy cheap gear that you dont need spend a little more on essentials like your sleeping bag and pack to ensure that you get a quality item that suits your needs
  i wanna get the hatchet or saw idk which im leaning towards the hatchet the stanley bottle is for coffee and regular day use i understand getting rid of the pillow and sleeping bag but what do you rest your head im use to a pillow of some sort
  staying as dry as possible is the goal but obviously youre going to sweat if youre hiking up a steep slope wearing a pack so youre secondary goal is to dry as fast as possible and stay warm while you are drying so you want to choose appropriate fabric and adjust your layers merino wool base layers are good there are also these awesome norwegian net base layers which are designed with cold damp environments in mind i forget what they are called but im sure the name starts with a b fleece makes a great mid layer for the uk as well as being a decent alternative to down which can be tricky to manage in damp environments     if you are camping its wise to carry some dry layers to sleep in if you are comfortable with the idea you can even sandwich your damp clothes between two dry layers while sleeping to dry them out a bit    when im hillwalking in the uk i tend to wear  merino t shirt  a very light grid fleece  shorts  wind pants  darn tough socks  and ill be carrying  slightly heavier fleece  light synthetic puffy vest  synthetic long johns  spare t shirt  spare socks  rain jacket  merino buff  this set up allows me to layer according to conditions which helps prevent sweating but its also fast drying so if i do get damp with sweat or wet with rain i know ill dry out as soon as conditions allow as it gets colder ill also carry  merino glove liners  rain mitts  thicker socks
  alabama near talladega national forest might be worth looking into
any trusted review/information sites when it comes to finding /out/ gear
  any activity in particular looking at what highly regarded /out/ist are using is the best option imo reviews are too bias people get sent gear use it once then post a review if the person in question hasnt used a piece of gear extensively their review isnt worth shit check out what andrew skurka cam honan pmags dirtmonger etc are using these guys all spend a lot of time /out/ theyve all pionered routes and spent a lot of time off trail skurka hunts as well so he is a good one to check out if you are looking at gear that isnt just for hiking and camping if you are feeling flush then splashing out on a backpackinglight membership is also great they post some crazy indepth articles and often run state of the market reviews where they cover a bunch of gear in a certain category plus their forums while slow are full of people who really know their stuff
  mainly hiking and camping  currently thinking about getting a new air mat and some pots and pans that are good for hiking
  mainly hiking and camping  then definetly look at what andrew skurka and cam honan are using theyve also both writen great articles that cover hiking and camping gear in general as well stuff on skills planning food etc stay off youtube and again i cant stress how wary you should be of short term reviews if someone hasnt used something for a while then they cant give you a decent idea of durability and versatility i could easily sleep on a mat one night in my garden and write a glowing report of how great it is  pots  these are fairly easy just grab a titanium pot that is big enough for your needs even no name stuff is good  pans  like a frying pan imo this is trickier because a good pan should be thick and heavy making it less than suitable for hiking
  thanks im checking out the blogs now and they seem good    ill just getting a pot and use that for a few hikes and see if i really need a pan
  pan  a pan is a great thing to take on a more relaxed with friends sort of camp but imo if youre solo and looking to move then they are uneccesary the sort of things you cook in a pan arent super suitable for a multi day trip i find a 500ml titanium pot is as big as a solo back packer would need   they seem good  you can learn a ton from these guys bewteen them they have hiked in most conditions especially cam honan hes been everywhere the guy is a super chill smiley australian who just loves to hike no hikerbro mentality not seeking pseduo celebrity status and most importantly doesnt force his gear choices or approach down your throat
  this is not extremely important but id suggest getting a casio w59 instead of the 91 since you might need the extra water resistance being in florida    it seems like youre getting decent advice about figuring out if you want to prioritize hiking distance or comfy camping before prematurely buying a bunch of stuff especially because you dont really need any of that wishlist stuff to go walk around on long dayhikes besides a sack with some water bottles and snacks and a rain jacket  you might find this helpful but keep in mind this guy is sacrificing camp comfiness for comfiness while walking 30 miles a day and collapsing in a tarp after dinner
    layering sweating cooling off and drying off    i wear   synthetic tshirt  walking trousers  thin merino jumper  soft shell jacket cheapo karrimore but with underarm zips  its like a fleece not waterproof    i carry a feather down jacket decent waterproof trousers and cheap waterproof jacket umbrella additional thin jumper     when im walking up a hill i can strip off to just the tshirt im sweating but im warm from the exercise but i feel the wind cooling me off and so when i stop i put on the jacket but i will still be sweaty and the tshirt will be wet when im trying not to die in the cold sometimes i will walk with just the tshirt and jacket i wouldnt be able to walk with just that bjyne net shirt though    each time i seem to catch a cold the next day even though im hot from the exercise i seem to get sick     i dont know how to dry off after climbing the hill  do i stop and wait it out do i put dry stuff over my sweaty tshirt it seems as if theres always something thats damp at the end of the walk usually the top part of the back    is a merino tshirt better than a synthetic one does it need to be skin tight
  i dont know how to dry off after climbing the hill  do i put dry stuff over my sweaty tshirt  this is wear a lightmid weight fleece works really well as you can put it on top of your damp tshirt to stay warm but it will let you dry off as well obviously its going to slow down the drying off but theres a balance between fast drying and not getting ill to be found the point is the fleece will keep you warm and is also fast drying to so will help wick the sweat away from the damp item power grid fleece is awesome for this its really warm for it weight and is very breathable pic realted  is a merino tshirt better than a synthetic one does it need to be skin tight  merino is just a bit warmer when wet and also a bit better at not smelling funky its main downside imo is that its pretty fragile so finding a nice merino/synthetic blend fabric is optimal  skin tight  no my merino base layer t shirt is like a normal t shirt fit
  thanks     im going to try one of those brynje nets and see if they help i think im wearing too much as i set off and so am warm before i really hit the steep bits too

  i cant stress how wary you should be of short term reviews if someone hasnt used something for a while then they cant give you a decent idea of durability and versatility  qft i dont even know why people bother with   i just bought this and havent used it yet but it looks great  reviews  theyre fucking pointless and just bury worthwhile reviews
keeping warm when hammock camping in winter stuffing clothes in my sleeping bag is warm enough to sleep but is not always the most comfortable but i vastly prefer it to tent camping regardless

  mfw i pack whatever color was on sale when i was shopping
  i am looking at grabbing some crap from china for 3/100 feet so i can get it in basically any color
  im taking a group of newbies winter camping for their first time what should i expect them not to think about packing so i can make sure they dont die
  you should go over an essential checklist with everyone going before setting off in the car eg gloves hat heavy socks boots yes boots matches/lighter etc

    the valleys are getting pretty expensive relatively speaking as stated theres been about a 50 increase in the last few years dont people know were full ive found houses elsewhere in the lower 48 for less than 100k that look about as nice as mine 4 bed/3 bath 2005newer 2000 sqft etc but theyre in places i dont want to live like waco     i dont mind living somewhere less appealing to others as long as i have   out  guns  work  decent internet
are those little woodburning camp stoves any good any of them worth packing
  you can still find some very affordable places in idaho montana and wyoming my wife and i ditched arkansas for idaho so that we could be closer to her family and we couldnt be happier we did give some serious thought to wyoming for a while though
  i have the firebox nano and enjoy it well enough itll only work for a sierra cup though its kind of a hassle if thats all youre using it for better off with an msr pocket rocket if i had to do it over again id get the normal sized firebox its a great way to keep a small fire contained and accommodates larger cookware im one of those weirdos that doesnt like to have a fire innawoods so if im going to use fire to cook it normally happens in my nano
  yeah i was looking at getting something like that but for about 10 off of aliexpress was looking at those lixada stoves just not sure which model to go with
  look up revelate equipment underquiltoverquilt pack down to smaller than any single sleeping bag i own and i have camped down to 15 degrees comfortably and 0 degrees uncomfortably    if you have the space bring a tarp to cut wind    revelate is admittedly expensive as fuck and before i invested in that gear i cut and sewed a bottom hole in an older down 0 degree sleeping bag slid it over my hammock and was good to go but wouldnt want to go below 20 degrees poor air seal and old bag probably did not help
where do i get a corny nordic hat like these any brands places canadian but cant seem to fins anything at the normal places online mec atmosphere etc
  dont people know were full  as long as theres semiwealthy californians trying to flee the sinking shithole they helped create because their liberal paradise costs more money to maintain than they expected when they voted for it the answer is a resounding no    i live in the ozarks my house was built in 2011 on paper its 1836 square feet plus an attached 2 car garage but thats because the local building code doesnt count basements or closets or bathrooms i have a full size halffinished basement so ive got around 2700 square feet of actual living space cost me a grand total of 115000 to commission and buy the plot for an hour east and pretty much the exact same house is 350k except its on a smaller plot and comes with all the headaches of a hoa
im looking at picking up a new flashlight to replace my old halogen mini maglite specifically something that i can use for emergencies ie in buildings outdoors etc and illuminating shortrange and longrange like down a dark path at night at a camp  what should i pick up would something like this fenix ld22 work its a little on the expensive side for me but im willing to pay around 4080 for a good flashlight
  i wont buy any flashlight without a usb charger
torch to see in the dark
  that may be a good idea too  also i just tried taking off the tail cap of the maglite and the damn thing is stuck id guess that the batteries that are inside it leaked at some point
there are no differences in product quality between any of the chinese flashlight brands olight fenix nitecore jetbeam etc is all 100 the same shit the executives and engineers bounce around the companies and the components are virtually identical
  then for features/value what would be the best
  this    
i have a streamlight microstream i like it it uses 1 aaa battery and i normally use 1 every 6 months
  not going to click on a third world website link
  replaced my minimag with a fenix ld20 many years ago been quite happy with it   fits in minimag holsters too
  for /out/ purposes headlamps are way better than flashlights
  as long as it has a disposable batchree option as well on account of flashlights being most important in scenarios where theres no electricity access and possibly for a long time    see also oil and candle lanterns
  usb is still better in that situation because it gives you compatibility with power banks and solar chargers
  thrunight is good for what you get verty reasonable
  it is a german companys website fyi
  acculux    looks like rebranded chink shit sold at huge profit margins for milking govt contracts     stay away    get something like nitecore tip with usb charging after maglite youll be blown away by the light output of even the smallest led light
  breaks
i like my fenix takes 18650 cells but also charges via usb hardly use it mind i much prefer my tactikka for /out/ purposes
    beats searching for the batteries innawoods
18650 batteries for brightness and longevity but you cant find batteries just anywhere    i have a skilhunt h03 bretty good so far just wish the beam was wider
  nitecore  can you buy those in canada
  nitecore  has usb charging  not chinesium    oh your delusions are showing anon
hmmm
  you keep missing the point that although rechargeable/usb batteries are a great thing the best configuration is a flashlight that can use both even my camera which uses a big rectangular rechargeable battery also has an option to insert aas if you find yourself in a pickle if youre gonna be out for days its silly to assume a solar charger is definitely going to be sufficient tossing a few aas in your bag is too easy
maglites are shit they always break on me  are over priced for what they are looked a fenix  nitecore not bad lightes but pricey  didnt really fit for what i wanted    got a 15 light local damn thing broke in a day said fuck it  got the cheapest shit i could find  for the price you can get 10 of them over 1 higher end light sure the aaa kind of sucks  the lumen seems low as does the run time   all said its a good light didnt break the first day lumen seems way brighter then what its listed at shines out pretty well for its size  run time isnt as bad as i thought
  if youre packing batteries in case your power bank breaks why not pack a spare power bank
i picked pic related up last month very happy witht it    5 brightness modes from 2000lumen floodlight to 1lumen nightlight  magnetic tailcap can attach to whatever  usbcharging  dropsafe dropped it onto rocks with no issues before  waterproof down to 2m depth used it while snorkelling at dusk  comes with head strap pocket clip lets you attach it to anything
  as most people have said here figure out what battery and form factor you like and as long as you pick from the common brands you cant go that wrong every brand has one or more variations of the same format light and for the most part which one you pick is not who makes it but the particular features like built in charging tail standing switch interface ect     fenix nitecore thrunite olight zebralight klarus jetbeam armyteck ect and i recently got a lumtop that im very impressed with for the price     i recommend a 1x18650 with built in charging that way it is easy to upgrade the battery common format and you dont need to get a charger typically this generation of slim 1x18650 lights are around 100013000 lumens on the floody side if you want throw you need a larger reflector and range from 40100 depending on brand and features
  if you want something with good throw for cheap comes with battery but no built in charging i recommend the lumtop gt mini a bit to big for comfortable pants pocket carry but small and packs a punch most pocket lights throw less than 200m this is rated for 750m
  down a dark path at night  you may prefer red light in that situation check out the fenix tk25red
  would the price also depend on where i live im in canada i would prefer to buy from a place like mec or hopefully another local shop rather than try amazon or the likes of canadian tire or walmart unless i can get a better deal with amazon then i guess by all means    thats a pretty big head    i dont quite see myself needing redlight functionality but ill keep it in mind
  4u
  how much
  dry cell batteries last for years in storage so you can just toss a few into a bag and not be worried about it plus you can get dry cell batteries anywhere at any time its more about choosing a light that allows you to use your flashlight in whatever unknown scenarios you may find yourself in the future assuming you intend your light to last longer than next summer and lithiumion power banks are basically a full time job to keep optimally charged and discharged if you use one every day itll last awhile but they dont survive long in storage as backups
anything at the checkout lane in lowes or home depot should do you good
  lithiumion power banks are basically a full time job to keep optimally charged and discharged    you wut m8 liion not nimh you know the same stuff in your phone and laptop     i have at lest 12 protected 18650s and i hardly ever do any thing with them i put them on the charger until the red light turns green and then put them in my light i use my edc light about a month or so until the low battery warning shows and that night i put it on charge for an hour till the red light turns green and if im not using a battery i put it in its little plastic case that most 18650s come with and leave it in the battery drawer it will be good for more than a year at normal room temperatures     and if you have a light with built in charging its the same as owing a phone just plug it in when the low battery light comes on and for long term out door use carrying a solar charger is better than handfuls of extra batteries     more so most 18650 lights are compatible with cr123s which generally have a 10 year shelf life but in general its better to use 18650 because they have larger capacity and over the 35 years of use practically cost nothing compared to buying nonrechargeable i have some 18650s that still work after 5 years but at less capacity       nice quads
  bought a tacticool edc flashlight   wake up during the night to take a piss and want to try my new flashlight  grab it and turn it on  get completely blinded and disoriented by the 1000 lumen output  hit every furniture on my way to the door
  lmao
  thats what you get for shining it on stuff first instead of holding it down to avoid getting blinded
  it happens before you get used to the interface     unfortunately i still do it from time to time with my 4000lm tm26 not the worst while out doors just takes a minute for my nighteyes to come back but its quite an experience when using it as a lantern in a tent or room and it goes from black to 4k with no warning kind of like taking a sip of the wrong drink
  keep one eye closed when you do that that way if you blind yourself you still got the other eye adjusted still
whats the verdict
are coast lights any good
a couple months back i dropped some dosh on an anker bolder lc90 flashlight and ive been quite happy with it     flood and spot modes available through a telescoping flasighlight head  flood is bretty gud  spot isnt this things strong suit but reaches out around two football field lengths  sos strobe modes included  18650 battery for that long battery lifeup to six hours on brightest setting  usb chargeable    only real weaknesses are its bulk and its buttonthe former because its stupidly uncomfortable in tight pants or with smaller pockets the latter because the switch is hte only way to cycle it on/off or cycle through the modes himedlostrobesos in that order
  ehhhh they are good enough but not fully recommended they are a step bellow the normal quality and performance of the enthusiast brands fenix nitecore olight ect but better than random badly translated chinglish junk most of the time they are popular just because they are sold at the big box stores along with led lenser     you are better off with said enthusiast brands in fact the brand thrunite has a lot of less expensive aa and aaa lights that are good
  i think i might go with fenix at least
i kind of want a tk72r but im not sure if id ever actually use it
  thats a big head
  smaller pockets  tight jeans hipster is detect
fenix is awesome for cutting edge    that said with todays tech you can easily go to a dollar store or harbor freight and get a couple of lights that will beat anything you could buy a few years ago at less than the price of a burger i say a couple because the fact that theyre still chinese shit is an issue and quality control/durability isnt good performance is fine though
i like thrunite and fenix missing a few lights in the pic
  wouldnt most places at least like dollarama/great canadian dollar store only have things that would be at best several years old in terms of tech
  the shit they have now is not even that good even compared to cram from 5 years ago most times the button fucks or breaks just from a slight fall
  looks like 8595 bucks on amazon
  had that light for not even a week before it broke made me a sad panda
  and you contacted olight and they took care of it for you you know part of the price is for a warrenty and customer service     ive dealt with them before like 5 years ago i bought a little cheap aaa light from olight for an ex after a month it had a problem and despite it being like their cheapest product they replaced it and were pleasant
why are there no good flashlights with proper mode selection instead of just cycle through all of them
  yeap contacted and went into full detail on what is up for some reason olight is justkinda fucking me over ive talked to them easily multiple dozens of times about replacing shit which they have in the past olight itself is an amazing company who produces great lights but the h2r fucked up due to bad soldering they shouldve man up and replace it or at least give me a 20 discount on my next purchase
  define proper mode slection
anker lc40  no cringe tacticool design  uses 18650 battery or aaa  no clicking through setting to turn it off  half clicks switch settings  ultra bright  super tough  compact  light  13  actually just thirteen united states dollars    best light ive ever owned
  something like a notch that you twist in order to select the brightness
  see these quads  
  so clicking a button to switch through modes is not proper
  why you posting a default pic if its super tough yours must have a lot of wear on it in order for you to vouch so of course you want to show that shit off
  press button to turn on flashlight  have to flick through all of the different modes to get to the one you want  overshoot it because you were trying to be quick have to do it again  every time  meanwhile with a notch it would be  easily just twist it over to the one you want by feel  can see which mode it will be on when you start it can select mode without turning it on  im really surprised that its not a thing it just seems like such a comfy convenience
  or you turn on the light have it already set due to memory mode i dont need to hit a button 50 times to get to what i want one click to what ever mode i preset it to which covers 99 of my shit hold down to have it turn on to fire fly mode or quickly double click for turbo mode all the while doing this with only one hand being able to go through modes with my pinky or ring finger able to turn on or off with thumb still hold it in my hand in a way that it can be used as a defensive tool which ive used as one once
  there is a large difference in design and manufacture quality which leads to differences in performance/ capability for example level of water resistance between torches the ipx ratings are affected by design and production quality
  namefagguchan have you think 14500 battery is good 2600mah lithium battery and torches are normie aa battery compatible desu 18650 is a shit to find innawoods    3
    damn double quads witnessed       well then that does suck      i find that with most well designed single button interface lights i can get to the mode i want almost instantly and with one or two clicks only needing 3 or more clicks for lesser used functions like beacon or battery read out some lights take a few clicks to get to strobe but typically it is still very fast to access once you are used to the light     as for what you are looking for in particular i cant think of a multi mode light that has independent switches or switch position per mode however some lights have screw heads where clockwise is brighter and counter clockwise is dimmer like my eagletac g25c2       almost all lights made by the big brands have ip67 or ip68 ratings its just about standard more so almost all of these lights use 18650s or other common liion batteries or a proprietary battery pack which is essentially made from a selection of the same base cells and circuitry not to mention most use cree leds sometimes they dedome them but thats uncommon more so the materials anodizing and machining are pretty universal there is some difference in machining a budget brand light thrunite tends to be less detailed than a fenix but functionally there is little difference     its kind of like buying a car all the brands makes some good ones with similar specs similar prices and some minor different options and features all will get the job done but some have particular features that suit you better
  hey knifuchan     some aa lights can use 14500s as well but most cant make sure the light you have is rated for both alkaline is 15v liion is 37v but can be up to 42v most lights that run on both have separate performance specs for both kinds of batteries     however i dont think you will be able to find a legit 2600mah battery typically they are less than 1000mah apparently i see fenix offers a 1600mah with a built in charge port but im kind of extremely skeptical     what you may have found is a what i assume is a non rechargeable lithium aa so its single use and going to be a lot more expensive to work with in the long run     honestly i think 18560s and larger are ideal for /out they have tremendous battery capacity over 14500 i run 3500mah protected cells in all my lights so at like 15lm a comfortable amount for one person to hike with thats like 150 hours of run time and even at like 60lm enough for two or three people side by side you can expect 35ish hours and having the ability to burst around 1000lm for an hour or two depends on the lights thermals is a big advantage over 14500     and as for charging you can get lights with a built in charger so you can carry a few 18650s if you are /out for a long stretch and charge them when you get to a town or just charge it off a solar panel or battery pack
  basically if you have a solution to keep your phone charged while /out you will have no problem keeping a 18650 light or one with a larger proprietary battery pack charged if you are using the light conservatively ie not pic related
  thats like 20 with ns hst
  got a power pack for my torch that has a big led torch in it
  how can you need this many flashlights
  i herd u liek torches so we put a torch in yo torch so you can see in the dark while you see in the dark
  you can never have too many flashlights
  hihi 3 sorry namefagguchan is rechargeable nimh battery theyre pretty cheap ikea sells 2450mah batteries also room clearing abandoned building was good found loot found two aa batteries and some other stuffs _     crack dens are fun
  nice
  thats not even all of them too got a few more weapon lights and other hand and head lights too mostly more thrunite and streamlight    each flashlight serves a dif purpose i also spread them out so if i dont have my edc light on me or it breaks/dies got a spare near by also do a lot of night walking with friends most forget to bring or bring a crap light    also about to get thrunite th30 headlamp has a pocket clip so you can pocket carry if you want max output is 3350 lumens lowest is like 05
    nice
  n i t e c o r e e c 2 2
  lel
looking for a headlight for max 25  not a problem if its from gearbest     doesnt have to be fancy with different light levels etc  has to run on normal batteries or usb accu
  home depot has these for 10 dollars no red light but great otherwise
  50 lumens  0
  its bright enough
  thrunite th20  firefly 03 lumens 14 days  infinity low 16 lumens 21 hours  infinity high 230 lumens 95 minutes   if you use a 14500 battery you can get 550 lumens 25 dollars complete steel body if it breaks in a 2 yr period thrunite replaces the entire thing
  just what i was looking for many thanks anon    have 1 internet
people collecting flashlights  this is one of the cringiest threads i have seen on /out/ for a long time
  youre welcome
  this is one of the cringiest threads i have seen on /out/ for a long time  that just shows you really dont come to this board we literally have this thread all the damn time
  power brick with fuckoff huge led on it  use it to charge another flashlight  i have this abstract sort of feeling that this is below the optimal rate of efficiency for the task of projecting photons into your local environment
  namefag i didnt know you were from australia
try a fenix e12
  e12 is really not that powerful more suited for edc tasks
  then what do you suggest
  thrunite archer 1a 3v or the 2a 3v the 1a 3v is pretty much the same length as the e12 but thinner its also 70 to 80 lumens brighter and a much better thrower too the 2a 3v is pretty much the same just 1 battery longer and being 370 lumens brighter than the e12 both lights have multiple mods heres a fenix e21 which is same thickness at the e12 the 2a v3 next to it sorry for potatoe quality cant sneak off from my kids atm to take a better picture    also both the thrunites are just a few bucks more than the e12
  nah im a pure blood merican hick but some times my phone can be a cheeky son of an outlaw cunt aint nothing more communist than a chines made australian 
  pure blood merican  no such thing 56er
  are you suprised    buy cheapo rayovac led light that runs off 3x aaas  buy 5 walmart 3350mah power bank  replace aaas with 20650 battery from power bank  super glue circuit board somewhere  bam  you now have a 10 rechargeable liion flashlight
  keep one in your car you can even charge your phone off if it all in one super bright magnetic work light/ power bank/ fire hazard
  is this the most retarded or the most brilliant thing ive seen on the internet today
  its made of a bunch of free harbor freight lights makes me want a 3d printer so i can cook something up that is more ergonomical than a chunk of wood    was my first attempt at anything like this and frankly im amazed it works
    magnets go ham too    the second one im trying to incorporate it all into the original case but i attached those 3 bright strips for max power have been messing with it for awhile though troubleshooting the little board from the power bank since these lights dont pull current the same way as an iphone but i want that board in there since it will provide safe charging for the battery as well as protect the battery from draining it too much since that kills liion    also those boards have a tiny button on em you can press with little leds that will tell you how much battery life is left    and you can drop those liions into pretty much any of those led lights with the little plastic 3xaaa battery carriers but you gotta find a safe way to recharge them and you need to watch the voltage to make sure you dont run it too low i believe you can buy batteries with little protection curcuits built into them too but theyre physically larger
  pic related also shows my liion recharge cable might want to keep a multimeter nearby though
holy shit it actually works
  dood
  olight s2r or s3r
i gotta recommend the s30r by olight    small bright good enough beam for basically anything but search and rescue rechargeable and cr123 compatible in case you cant charge for some reason    pic related is mine more than a year later i havent babied it either and its still borderline new looking
  i mean its a work headlamp anything youre looking at that youd be working on thats more than bright enough
  is the tn12 any good
  lol
  very good very ramn durable great warranty can be had for 45 bucks 5 dif settings running from firefly of 05 to blinding 1050 lumens i keep mine around 300ish lumens throws great but its more a floor/spill    my only problem of the tn12 is its size its not huge as fuck but you can def fill it in your pocket specially if you carry a bunch of other crap like i do
  whats a better one for throw
anyone else only buy p60 compatible flashlights  i like that the led dropin can be removed so the best host has the newest led and the old led can be used as spare parts
  this seems like the thread for this but is there a good led replacement for old coleman multi fuel lanterns i use them when i go car camping and during power outages looking for an led lantern to fill the same roll so i dont have to mess with fuel
  i dont have an exact answer for you dunno much about the lantern scene but something good ie with good enough quality light where you wont miss the fuel lantern will be quite expensive leds have a rather deficient spectrum and thus terrible color rendering quality and lots of problems with glare you can get leds that perform much better but that shits expensive and you likely wont be able to try the lamp out first especially not in actual dark conditions when youre using scotopic vision good luck friend nothing beats actual heat for light quality though
  a p60 lantern head cost 13  a p60 xpl2 90 cri cost 13        
  so you want to replace the internals with a led bulb or you want to replace your current lantern with an led one i cant help for the internals for a led lantern itself give this a shot       fenix tk 09 is a better thrower also can be used as a weapon light only down side is the head is bigger doesnt have memory mode like the thrunite tn12 or fenix pd 35 have will always start on brightest mode tail tap the switch to select modes what all you looking for in a light
  190 lumens panel 475 bright lumens each  d batteries  single mode  too weak for 2018
  what all you looking for in a light  needs to use 18650 since i already have a bunch of those and chargers  i want decent throw with still ok flood  needs to be around 50 or so
  current lantern with an led one although a restomod would be kind of cool on an old lantern     i like the detachable panels and the runtime on that but how is it for general coverage one of my rusty old colemans will shit out light in a huge area and thats my problem with all the led lanterns ive tried which is admittedly few can i light up a campsite with it
  
the thrunite tc12 is 60 and does everything i need usb charging been dropped and gotten soaked many times still works fine any of the twobutton tailcap on/off and a separate button to change modes 18650 flashlights will do the trick    
  i legit used this one camping not too long ago and it was surprisingly good     
  yeah but thats shit light quality for a lantern might be fine for a flashlight but it wont come close to approximating a fuel lantern
  
  headtorch mate
  i was basically a 30 year old boomer before i started using a head torch but its definitely the way to go
  op seems to be wanting a handheld light
    yes giving it a bit more thought im thinking adjustable light output optional adjustable flood/spot modes momentary on/off mode memory and maybe dual switches body/tailcap
  
  interesting
    anker lc90 led flashlight    theres nothing wrong w/ the fenix ld22 though
  its a real good home light i have one its just kind of big for keeping on your person while doing active things
    fair criticism    if thats a problem i recommend the j5 tactical v1pro 300 lumen ultra bright flashlight
one the cheap 5 or less a piece single aa lights would work fine for meone mode small decent battery life    had one for years and its still working
  5  eeeeeeh
  i have a klarus xt2cr i like it up to 1600lumens in a fairly neutral beam between spot and flood has usb charging and their claim of a 3600mah battery is quite close as i fully charged one to about 3560mah
  thats a stereotypical response from a certain group of people
  hm that sounds pretty good nice small size too
know any good cr123 dummy cells that ship to europe malkoffdevices cost 12 a cell 50 for shipping and all that is before vat and import tax
just got one of these and its really freaking bright    feels decently made too    the only downside is that it used 9 aasi would have liked to try to use 18650s but it would probably only fit two
  oopsie poopsie
    what about some 18500s i think theyre about the same length as aas but as fat as 18650s
    or the next size down
    like 9 aas just to use the light christ
  it has a custom insert like 3aaa lights that often can be swapped for an 18650 that holds the batteries its 6 7/8 long and 1 1/4 diameter    there is no spring in the tailcap the insert has pins in both end that have springs built in      yes it takes 9 batteries at a timeits even brighter than my modded maglite that has a dx insert and runs on two 18650s    it is basically all flood which is perfectly fine     ill see how long the life is especially with rechargeables i think its going to be on sale for 28 on black friday so i might pick up another one
  why but just get one that uses bigger batteries and isnt flood that thing is trash
  unless you own one you cannot proclaim that with much resolve    ive heard lots of good things about the defiant flashlights from home depot even though to most people they might look like junki may look in the bf ad to see if they have any deals on those    i didnt need a thrower my maglite does that fine
  mag lites are pretty ass also they arent bad in their own but they havent kept up with the market at all and you can find much better values out of o light and thrunite for example flash light should take something larger than aas in that case and flood flood light for that amount of batteries is shit also
  it is not stock    its even brighter than my modded maglite that has a dx insert and runs on two 18650s
harvested my old almost dead lenovo battery yesterday  got 6 free 18650 that works fine  i think laptop makers does the same jew trick as printer makers where they use planned obsolescence chips in the ink cartridge
  the third generation maglites and beyond are awesome they have decent leds 500lumen lumen options now theyve come back not even booming
  5001000 lumen options
  i was at walmart the other day and found pic related in the garden section by the solar powered lights 14    i found a drill battery on sale and got a bunch of 2000mah samsung cells for 4ea not button top but i used them for other projects and if you cut the tabs right they will work the same as a button top    also walmart has these power banks for 5 that are made of a little board and a 3250mah 20650 ripped a couple of those apart and they fit in my flashlights with the 3xaaa carriers they actually fit better than the 18650 because theyre the same length but a little fatter
just got this little guy the other day obviously its got nothing on my 18650 lights but i wanted to try out a nichia led and this was a cheap way to do it also i figured it would be a good light to keep in a first aid kit because of the warm color     it really looks like mid day sun light its impressive
  if you want to use it as a backup it is best to put lithium primary batteries in it they self discharge slower than alkaline and rechargeable lithium batteries and never leak acid
  dont think ive ever seen those in the garden section just aas    i was thinking about getting some from the 10 kobalt batteries
  anyone here bought from prometheus lights if you have unlimited money it seems great
  from looking at darksuckscom they are some of the most pretty flashlights i have ever seen  nichia 219 still has better colors but i dont understand why he does not offer newer xpl2 that has better output efficiency and throw than both xml2 and mce
  thanks for the recommendation i may end up getting a few and holly crap 1200mah from a aaa i forget how much nonrechargeables can hold       yeah if i had so much money i did not care they do look nice       the form factor of the light can only dissipate so much heat he could go with a much higher output cree but it would only be able to sustain that out put for a short time before jumping down like the similar sized 1800lm nitecore concept 1     i think the kind of person willing to spend so much on a light for the sake of pocket jewelry would appreciate more stable outputs and the better color accuracy with the lower output nichia and honestly i just got my first light with a nichia and its kind of amazing it looks almost like sun light it makes all my lights with warm cree leds look blue/green i would value that color more than having 50 output for a few minutes when it comes to a edc pocket light     i guess it is a case of the tuned sti maybe faster around the track than the ferrari 488 but the owner of the 488 does not want to have to worry about keeping up his turbo pressure or wonder if that new radiator can handle the californian summer
  lithium batteries also operate in very cold climates 40c where alkaline batteries cease to function
  oh thanks i will use this to explore mine shafts and old caves

  armytek vs thrunite  
  i just got a cree xpl2 3000k and it looks kinda meh compared to the older and more pretty xml1 2700k
whats a good cheap online store to buy 18650s  i cant trust ebay because of fakes  i have an olight but theyre batteries are too 
  good cheap  pick one    lowes has 10 kobalt tool batteries that should have 6 cells in them
  its not exactly cheap but illumn tends to have authentic batteries
any reccomendations for a cheap lightweight red light
  cursed image is cursed     please help up smite this
  whay use walking at night keychain bike light or hunting light with long throw
  buy locally from a shop you trust many of the best cells are rebranded samsung and panasonic batteries if the price is too good then it is likely a fake
  second illumn or mtnelectronics dont use amazon either as they mix their stock from different suppliers and theyre full of fakes    18650s are average 5 but theyll last a long time
  uhhnight timewalkingyeah
  yes cheap compared to olight they want around 20each
  only one vid also looking at reviews all armytek seem to have barely any while each thrunite seems to have 100 if not more reviews videos etc
  wtf are you going to do with a 300 flashlight   probably just look at my shoes at night
  itd be cool to have thats about it
      red led cheap 246usd free shipping
how do you cope with flashlight flicker ive never had a flashlight that didnt start to flicker after a while it occurs when theres a tiny film of oxidation over any nonsoldered electrical connection the more connections there are the worse it is the solution is always to clean or rub the connections together flashlights that use a battery pack seem to have less flicker than ones that take standard batteries it seems to be due to the fact that the pack normally have those clip leads that are soldered to the batteries    oh and im talking 80s horror movie flicker where the light dims and/or goes out and you have to jar the flashlight to get it back temporarily
  are you using incandescent or led
  both do it from the 1980s to today ive never seen a flashlight that didnt start doing it eventually except one that used a sensor you touched to turn it on and off and had all connections soldered and no moving parts that one worked perfectly 100 of the time so long as it was charged only the sensor drains the capacitor so you need to charge it every so often but it was the kind you wind to charge so it wasnt a big deal that one was led
  never glue or lube threads on flashlights to keep moisture out it can insulate the metal to metal connection
  what why would anyone do that thats what the gaskets are for that come with the flashlight solder is a metaltometalto metal connection and is the best connection possible
  why would anyone do that  some people clean and lube flashlights the same way they would a pistol   do not lube flashlights
  lol wtf
    pelican 1910 20    1xaaa
  pelican 1910  106 lumens  plastic lens  2 modes no memory  blue as fuck tint
anyone have a recommendation for a light that isnt the harsh led white looking for more of the filament yelloworange a little hard to find led lights that dont have a headache inducing white hue
  look for a nicha led i just got my first light with one a massdrop ti blue aaa one it really looks like midsummer day sun light pic related i took with the nicha as the only light for the photo no editing besides what my iphone does automatically
  even better keep the lens capped with your other hand and open your hand to expose only the amount of light you need light isnt free dont be wasteful
  thanks friend i know this is a flashlight thread but got any recommendations for a lantern with the same warmth looking for something to read by when im in a tent
  hmmmm sorry friend i dont know much about lanterns and if there is a lantern that uses nicha leds i bet they are pretty expensive     you can get a pretty powerful 600 lm light with a nicha for under 200 though and its really easy to make a refuser out of paper that would make it into a lantern that would work more than well enough for a tent
  1  as a rule of thumb cree has the highest output in lumens but nichia and luminus generally has better comfort and more vibrant colors true 95cri  cree do make high cri leds but they are more rare than nichia and luminus i know first hand some alibaba brands sell normal cree 4000k 60cri as cree 3000k high cri
  looking at low cri light feels like listening to pirated yt mp3 with shitty background noise pollution
  i usually aim the flashlight up in the air to the ceiling if you have a sheet of white paper or light colored tent it will light up the entire tent like a lantern it is also very useful for when the power is out at home a tiny flashlight can make a whole room light up enough to see and work for several people that way    also theres those tiny book lights with leds oh and i almost forgot if you really need to change the color of your light you can get some gel filters that are used for camera flashes those are sheets of colored material the light can shine through you simply cut them to fit your light        you can cut little discs out that have tabs so you can shove them into the front of a flashlight or just make a disc and fit it behind the glass even with lanterns you can cut a strip and bend it around the light
  neat
  damn thats sexy
  4 you

  its wind moron  the wind is so bad it got caught up under the sod/forest floor and is lifting it with the gusts

  the harbor freight bauer 15ah batteries are 20 and come with 5x 1500mah samsung cells i wish they were a little more powerful but at least theyre new samsung cells    that ave guy bought some knockoff dewalt and milwaukee tool batteries and ripped them apart one of them the dewalt maybe was supposed to be a 30ah pack but came with 10x 2000mah sony cells the catch was the cells were used but after testing them they worked really well so obviously they were pulled out of something that didnt run through too many cycles    as i mentioned though they wont be button top batteries theyre flat tops with the spot welded nickel tab but i cut them apart and trimmed the tabs on a couple so they fit well in flashlights made for button tops
 see       5 cells but stilll    the 30ah batteries should have at least 10 cells do the math and you know whats in them a 40ah cell will probably have 10x 2000mah 18650s in them    pic related shows a 20650 from the 5 walmart power bank the brand is onn and theyre the little lipstick sized ones or for 10 you can get two of them in the larger power bank in the pic the 3xaaas originally powered this flashlight but the 20650 actually fits better in these lights than an 18650    i have been keeping an eye out for power banks on clearance too but none with regular round cells just a few at walgreens with the rectangular ones
  that zooming cree xmlt6 flashlight is such a meme all over the world
  theyre not bad i didnt need an overpriced aluminum tube like the collectors in the thread have so i got two of those things for 20 off amazon theyre bright as hell easy to use and the liion drops right in walmart and a bunch of other stores still sell them for 20 in the hunter ellis tactical section next to the electric cig lighter    fun fact one of them is slightly shorter than the other and the led is a slightly different shade and doesnt have the same zoom
  5 cells but stilll    wwwyoutubecom/watchvkgts4ozjifs
  oh yeah the kobalt are 24v vs the 1820v everybody else uses my bad
  nice
can someone point me to a sturdier hiking flashlight for a long backpacking trip ill list out some approximations and see if anything is about right  price   any  weaponized/tactical  not required but waterproof is good  weight  light  usage  finding shiny stuff people drop on a trail or alternatively a headlamp/lantern for following a trail at night  power  preferably batteries usb charging not necessary    are there lights like the cheap headlamps just brighter and last longer ive gotten a few before but they all broke really quickly
  are there lights like the cheap headlamps just brighter and last longer                  
  thank you for all of that i read through the manuals i could find and a few reviews  i think im going to go with the hc65 its lightweight and has a redlight in case i end up in a hostel on some long trip
  the nitecore hc65 is a great headlamp with many features and has a better switch than many other headlamps nitecore is known for making some of the best battery chargers on the market   my favorite simpel 90 degree flashlight/headlamp on that list is the high cri zebralight  
  relooking at the zebralight made me realize that the hc65 weight is without battery i am easily tricked apparently
  i like that one  the face is cute   and its in no danger of falling over unless you got a crane
caterpillar hoophouse with a twist    warning multi page blogpost incomming    been looking into gardening a lot the last year or so tomatoes are my favorite food i have walked through a garden with a salt shaker more than once hydroponically grown tomatoes all taste like ass so i descided to empty a room in my house and grow my own 3 months of profanity later and about 1000 down the drain i gave it up well now its winter again and i had my last descent tomato a month ago this triggers me i just bought a house with a lot of large south facing windows northern hemisphere burger    if i can manage to not genocide tomatoes and a few other things then in february i want to build a large hoop greenhouse i got some good deals and have around 100 t posts and somewhere between 40 and 60 hog panels my fatherinlaw gave us 4 panels welded to a pipe frame when he moved it was his hog pen    i figured these would make good front and back walls    building it isnt the problem since i have a welder and can get affordable scrap metal rods and pipe from my best friend but i do have a few hurdles most people dont have    1/5
my floor is a giant limestone screenings rock dust pad is this okay should i make raised beds im going to put down a layer of top soil with a cat 934 wheel loader or making raised beds somehow  can i use water from the limestone pit or would it be bad for a garden    i dont have electricity but i do have a 137hp 2 cylinder perkins deisle engine i found a few pully driven generator heads so i should be able to have all of the power i need for watering and whatever else solar would be ideal but its fairly out in the open and i fear they would be stolen    fucking cows i need to make it sturdy enough that the fat fucking useless cocksuckers wont ruin it or use some hog panels for a fence instead of some of the greenhouse ill likely build a 2 diameter pipe frame and skin it with the hog panels    it needs to be portable im doing this at work to take advantage of downtime i want to make a little food and money rather than shitpost on /b or stare at the rock ledge wishing this quarry was mine i dont walk very well but i could handle some gardning i think summer is pretty busy here so i will probably try and get up early when its cool to get most of the work done then stay a little late if i need    2/5
we set up a plant about every 2 years and crush rock ill be building the greenhouses on skids im going to hope that the land owner will let me just drag them out of the way so i can still maintain a small portion of one on my own time or at least keep them near so i can drag them back here after the plant is gone if not then i live 2 miles away ill just keep them under 10 foot wide and borrow a lowboy to haul them to my house for storage    geothermal this guy has lemon trees in nebraska  ill be doing some testing soon by using my loader to shove a probe about 10 feet into several rock and dirt piles for testing the guys are due back late summer if things stay steady here well be stripping off several hundered tons of top soil and dirt from the rock ledge and adding to this plateau here its about 25 feet high but often has about 1 foot of water down in the pit ill be buying some 4 black plastic corrugated drainige pipe 250 long as the old timer in the video above did depending on how my temperature testing goes anyway ill buy a few loads of screenings and bury them then the guys will dump several loads of dirt on top essentially burying the pipes deep underground having growable weather year round would be amazing and cost under 1000 for 6 or 8 pipes and screenings to protect them from rocks falling out of the haul trucks ill either have to shell out some money for screenings or wait until 2020 for this its fine though because it gives me a season to learn and descide if i want to continue or sell out / give it all away    3/5
the skids will be 2 diameter pipe just thrown on the ground if/when it rusts out ill just weld another one on ideally id like to come up with some truck axles and just make them into trailers so i can move them around or maybe build some for the family and to sell    if i can get the mineral rights to my land or my buddys father will let us drill well have natural gas for all of the heat and electricity generation we should ever need theres a local greenhouse running about 250000 square feet of space over 90 on natural gas alone my land is in the same gas pocket my best friend used to own the oil lease next door and there is a gas well 200 feet from my property line itd be pretty cool to get my house off grid without sacrificing anything anyway and at that point assuming im not an absolute failure id finally be able to quit my job and run my own business    4/5
sorry for the blogposts im trying to write this at work in parts and busy as hell but i want to get a solid plan together and have the greenhouses ready to rock by the end of feburary next year    was going to post on /diy and still might but i figured since a lot of you garden youd be able to help make a better gameplan    thanks yall any ideas input or autistic fits of rage and criticism are encouraged mostly growing vegetables microgreens and flowers for my wife maybe starter fruit trees as well    5/5

  why do hydroponic tomatoes taste bad
people say everest isnt the tallest just the highest but according to wikipedia everest has the biggest prominence of all peaks and denali is below it    am i misreading something
  who is said that was it some random person at your local starbucks
  it means you have no idea what prominence is click on the wikipedia link for that and educate yourself
prominence isnt what you think it is basically its actually a measure of a mountains independence so as everest is the tallest mountain on its landmass its got the same prominence as it does height every other mountain on eurasias prominence is its height above the lowest point on the path between the two mountains i know im explaining this badly and possibly incorrectly but aye     wikipedia has a big article on topographical prominence might be worth reading
  elevation  prominence  base to peak height
  alright genius lets see you eli5 prominence then since this  faggot loser already failed
  people who claim that are retarded americans who cant imagine that the biggest mountain isnt in their country
most mountains are actually mountains on a mountain which is where the idea of prominence started people wanted to know the elevation of a mountain relative to the land around it so look at places like tahoe reno or coloradothey have a bunch of 10000ft mountains but these cities themselves are already sitting at 4000ft elevation personally i think its a retarded metric altitude is altitude the only thing it changes is how big the mountain appears
prominence is measured relative to the low point between the closest taller mountain    on this island mountain 2 has no taller mountain so its prominence is measured from sea level  mountains 1 and 4 have the same elevation but the saddle between 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 is different so 1 has greater prominence 3 is taller overall than 1 and 4 but the saddle between 2 and 3 is smaller than the 12 saddle or the 34 saddle so 3 has the smallest prominence
yall nibbas need spire measure       the only thing it changes is how big the mountain appears  yeah but thats very important otherwise you end up saying that some barely noticeable bump on the palisade crest is a bigger deal than mt washington
its another /out/ overexplains everything ad nauseam despite everyone basically being on the same page episode

comfy pics from a comfy trip to norway a week ago three nights the first spent at a hunters rest the second two spent in a tent we hadnt expected this much snow so we didnt get as far as we wanted it ended up being 30 km distance and 4 km in altitude change we reached three different peaks 1363 m 1364 m 1504 m it was my first actual mountain experience so im pretty happy about it
    in which place anon  also nice embers

    just got these today good
i just spent a few nights on the summit of spruce knob wv heres some pics for this fine thread
  heres a coyote print that i found im not the best at identifying tracks but i believe this is a coyote print because the toe pads are stacked behind each other instead of spread out like a dog i also heard them howling throughout the night and day i have a video of a howl
  it was too soaked to start a fire on the first night so i drank whiskey as my fire i put in a lot of work making a pit with a reflector and gathering fire wood that day i was very upset that it would not light that night it was so wet even birch bark would not light up
  by the second night i was able to find enough dry wood to start a fire but at that point my phone was dead so no comfy fire pics
  always go for the upside down fire anon every wet rotten log you find will burn beautifully as long as you sustain a small fire of kindling on top for 1020 minutes
  the main problem was finding dry kindling though i made this mistake of putting my friend on kindling duty while i was getting wood she came back with plenty of kindling and birch bark but it was all wet with only thirty minutes of sunlight left i gave it a shot but it would not light up
  fair enough man all things considered you made the best of it

exploring the woods around my house and in the middle of the of a large patch or thick forest i found a long short stone wall almost could have made a good path but it was uneven and about 2 feet off the floor was really cool looking down it tho was also covered in coon shit so that was kinds odd

im a senior in high school from ct for spring break 4 friends and i are driving to jackson hole wyoming and yellowstone anyone have any suggestions of places we should see along the way route is attached we plan on camping on the side of the road and driving in shifts to make the 33 hour drive in 2ish days
  did you purposely make the trip route as boring as possible nebraska freal
  my son did this trip from vermont twice it sucks first day youll get to davenport ia if you push it rent a hotel room off exit 295b you can afford it you will thank yourselves later  day 2 youll get to jackson around 11pm or so be careful of antelopes on the road at night from rock springs to jackson   hopefully you have a friends place to crash at in jhole housing is tighter there than a brazilian slum drive safe
drive safe and think about taking an extra day traveling so you can rest
  see places along the way  driving 33 hours in 2 days  pick one
what a retard enjoy freezing with nothing to do but get drunk and be homos
  jackson hole  i worked in/around yellowstone doing guide stuff for awhile dont waste your time in this tourist trap and dont try to find lodging anywhere near    dont miss out on grand tetons natl park some wonderful paddling to be had at the foot of some crazy sheer mountain cliffs    in yellowstone i recommend the hike up to the petrified forest really incredible views and usually not overcrowded be ready for sliding and scrambling you probably already know to avoid the main shit as its all lame and developed the whole upper north loop is really underrated has some incredible vistas    bring something to cover your face thick rag if you cant handle sulphur smell as yellowstone is full of sulphur mist spraying you in the face    sunscreen youre at a way higher elevation than home so youll be catching lots of rays not to mention most attractions have you standing near glaring pools of water dont forget to get the backs of your hands    enjoy yellowstone is awesome if you can avoid normie fatigue
  based      your literally driving through the worst part of america   nothing to see until jackson
  driving 2200 miles  who would want to do this to themselves
  this 100 the parts of pennsylvania being driven through are pretty good but once you reach ohio its fucking over and hell until the end
      and what route would you recommend for op to get from connecticut to wyoming as fast as possible that is scenic
  nigga take an extra day go through south dakota and see black hills wind cave wind cave    an dont skip grand titties as wwell
  youre going through iowa and nebraska thats 14 hours nonstop of corn fields add a couple hours to your trip and go through south dakota what month is spring break march/april going to be cold and bleak af wherever you go
  i did 1300 miles of historic route 66 in 25 days best trip i ever took
  tan before you go sunscreen is terrible neurotoxin shit skin irritant body was meant to handle sunlight and make use of it sunscreen products are not subject to fda approval like other topical drugs heavy sunscreen users get very sick ultraviolet radiation only causes skin cancer from burning build up with low amounts to increase melanin pigmentation which is the bodies natural defense if you are not a fast tanner like me get melanotan ii
  i almost added i prefer zinc sunscreen as it doesnt react with your skin but figured some other anon would sperg out with all the actual details thanks bud i always keep a tubba zinc cream in the ol pack brain
  tan instead
  senior in ohio here wish my friends were based enough to drive 33 hours to get /out/     ive done a couple roadtrips to the northwest and recommend stopping in badlands natl park mt rushmore and devils tower along the way the first day is going to suck no matter what but its worth spending extra time on the second and third days to see this stuff badlands are 100 worth driving through mt rushmore isnt terribly exciting but its worth seeing in person at least once devils tower is also a 10/10 11/10 if you watch close encounters of the third kind before    if you follow this route about halfway through south dakota you start seeing billboard every mile or so for wall drug store this goes on for about 50 miles or so before the exit take the exit its a massive complex of endless hokey tourist trinket giftshops in the middle of nowhere also worth a stop since its just off the highway and will get some laughs    anyways adding these stops will only add a few hours to the drive but will improve it tons the views will also be better as youll be going through the black hills of south dakota instead of the cornfields of nebraska
  you should drive over the southern states on the way there and over the northern states on the way back check out glacier national park
  yeah take the exciting route through kansas or south dakota
  whats wrong with south dakota
  you literally posted the only cool thing about s dakota
  theres both the black hills and the badlands
to the resident bongs are you afraid of getting arested for carrying a knoife while /out/
  no because i went through a 3 week knoife safety course and got me a loicense as long as you store your sharp objects in a approved safe youll be ok besides that you only need have a mandatory inspection every couple weeks but the good thing is that after your first year its only one time a month plus insurance but its not a problem either because as long as you have a few family/friends/neighbors to confirm that youre a law abiding citizen any major insurance company will accept you then theres only the whole voluntary work that you need to do but its no biggie just a couple hours every day of knife crime awareness
  not black  nah im fine guvnr
  implying the wogs are the ones the police are out to get
i got a loife and binned my knoife these days i usually take my dish sponge out with me had to go on a course but its worth it if you want one with the green scourer bit
  why do you need a green scrubber need to compensate for your tiny penis or are you a racist afraid of a machetewielding rocket surgeon
  unless youre in jockland youre allowed to carry a knife when out camping hiking hunting etc are all legal reasons to carry a knife scotland is proper cucked though and they dont recognise any legal reason to carry a knife unless you need it for your profession
  i carry a razor blade hidden in my medkit and a pair of sewing scissors total plausible deniability i used to walk around with a folding knife used it all the time really liked it but her maj has really done a number on that front could be banged up at any time i cant inagine what living under these conditions does to the average males testosterone levels constantly feeling like you need to censor and neuter yourself in every situation even the army has turned to a bunch of pooftas recently through no fault of their own
  racist  oi oi good old lad do you have a permit for using that kind of language in the queens land
  did the cop just say their cops are soft as butter
      tedious memeing     its perfectly legal to carry a knife within reason im not the least bit worried about getting lifted by the dibble
can someone explain the uk knife meme to me
  cant wait to leave this shithole
  within reason  theres the catch a copper can always fuck you up if he chooses to do so  yeah anon was acting suspicious and upon being searched he was found to be in possession of a knife    nah when you have to rely on being a good boy to be allowed something then its not perfectly fine       they get shit because they ban everything there and brits always come with justifications instead of being against having their freedom curtailed but tbf australia large part of eu some us states are the same just without the 1984 surveillance levels
  good reasons for carrying a knife or weapon  examples of good reasons to carry a knife or weapon in public can include    taking knives you use at work to and from work  taking it to a gallery or museum to be exhibited  if itll be used for theatre film television historical reenactment or religious purposes for example the kirpan some sikhs carry  if itll be used in a demonstration or to teach someone how to use it     the maximum penalty for an adult carrying a knife is 4 years in prison and an unlimited fine youll get a prison sentence if youre convicted of carrying a knife more than once    by the looks of it going hunting and ahit with a knoife is illegal mate  
does the queen mum cut your steak for you or is beef too dangerous because it increases testosterone     how long before they ban self defense courses
  sorry to sound rude i find it shocking i used to buy knives and swords on portabello rd  i walked with a cane without paying for permission    i am sad for englands citizens
  england doesnt have citizens it has subjects
the whole point of these laws is it gives english police the freedom to do whatever they want if theyre in the country and see a sixty year old farmhand in tweed with a landrover and whatever they can just ignore it if theyre london police looking for any excuse they can to clean the streets of filth and they seriously need this london is getting worse and worse then they can do so without being sued for discrimination or whatever    tldr london please leave
  theres the catch a copper can always fuck you up if he chooses to do so   anon was acting suspicious and upon being searched he was found to be in possession of a knife    same as everywhere every civilised country in the world plus america has restrictions on what knives you can carry and what you can do with them in public id rather take my chances with a british copper than a yank one        by the looks of it going hunting and ahit with a knoife is illegal mate      if youre going hunting youre almost certainly on private land where there are no knife restrictions at all
  does the queen mum cut your steak    shes been dead for 16 years you absolute mong
  yfw you can legally carry a sword and use it for self defense and defense of others in arizona  
  why is your society so broken that you might need to
  hur dur need  thats why everyone hates bongs your concept of freedom is non existent do you need a justification to buy a faster car a more powerful power drill or buy a large pizza instead of a medium you do it because you want thats the only reason you need fucking hell as much as burgers are generally sacks of obnoxious shit at least they dont have a slave tier mindset like retarded bongs        same as everywhere  except they cant do jack shit unlike in britain where getting caught with a knife is automatically butt fuckery coming on your way regardless of your reasons also this is not about cops dont try to change the subject you mischievous cunt
  go visit /pol/ to learn about that
  was arizona part of soviet macedonia or what
polak who lived in uk   i loved to hike and we all just had our pocket knifes and didnt give a fuck  i even talked to some cops over it and they ware cool about it   cops are humans too and they will treat you like a human being if you do the same   imho most of them are tired of that shit they just cant talk about it openly     pic related any limeys guess the place southyorkshire
share scary stories strange events or unexplained things you have experienced innawoods    and dont say this belongs on /x/ im asking specifically for outdoor stories
  i was skinny dipping with some friends when i was 10/11 and someone stole our clothes probably a pedo or a bear or a pedobear
  oh god he probably went home and put your underwear on his face and came into your socks and junk
  when studying in the sierra nevada for my naturalist certification i climbed up a small rock wall to check out a hairy man think sasquatch petroglyph sitting their right underneath the glyph was a huge fat fucking rattlesnake he didnt rattle at me despite the fact i was incredibly close within 6 feet to him ive seen rattlesnakes before but this was by far the biggest ive seen so far    later we had a lecturer who was an elder for the local native american nation he had a lot of stories about speaking to animals and after discussing culture with him our peoples are distantly related i asked him what he thought of the experience he told me that it was probably there to protect the image and that he knew i wasnt there to harm it so he didnt threaten me    ive read that crotalus oreganus oreganus the indigenous species of rattlesnake for that part of california is actually incredibly docile in general though
  went hiking in some prairies out in the country when i was a kid and i saw a single perfect imprint of a human foot in the side of a hill probably just my overactive child imagination but it was sunk more than an inch into the ground and i remember it having really distinct toes      thats actually a really neat story
   no step on snek
  not sure exactly what to make of this but its happened twice now both times when along a lake  shortly after dark light turned off trying to sleep  galloping coming towards my tent too many feet to count all in a line same direction  line splits and appears to be circling my tent in opposite directions  just as quick as they came they leave in a single line in the direction they came from    territorial coyotes what do you think have also had a group of 56 coyote bed down maybe 15 feet from my tent one night also close to water
scariest thing that ever happened to me was in backwoods shenandoah np maybe 56 miles from the nearest major trail    finished off a decent amount of whiskey before heading to bed but not enough for me to sleep totally through the night woke up to 3 or 4 distinct bears i could echo locate through the walls of the tent in the pitch dark arranged around me in a circle i could hear them rooting around cracking sticks and mouth breathing loudly     this was one of my first encounters with bears and i was scared absolutely shitless because i was young and didnt understand what pussies black bears are thats when i started sleeping with a gun for peace of mind
  sounds like coyotes yeah could also be feral dogs theyre curious
had a softball size rock hit a tree about 3ft away from me with enough force to splinter bark off the tree it hit backpacking up near searcy ar didnt hear or see a damn thing i wasnt scared as much as i was perplexed
not really outdoors but me and my gf were staying in the dublins phoenix park for a week in june because we had like 100 left from travelling and were in a shitty situation that sorted itself out but anyhow first night we slept there was someone walking around 3am or so and next morning we found leftovers of a tent so i guess it was a hobo/drunk trying to set up a tent and ragequitting on it in general it was shit because it got dark around 11pm so there was almost always someone around until it actually got dark  as dark as junes night can be  ive slept in risky places in general like in middle of venice so i think actual forest provided no bears or any other dangerous wildlife would be enjoyable as realistically there is nothing dangerous
walked up on a group of hogs once normally they arent dangerous but they had piglets with them and im told mothers tend to be agressive when they think little bacons are in danger i walked away but they kept following me a bit maybe not on purpose i was like o shit o shit my hands ware shaking so much i had problems reaching my gun  it was this spring in poland    i also met a huge deer once  it jumped out of nowhere stopped in front of me and looked down we stared at each other for a few seconds than it run off  few seconds later a huge dog jumped out and run after the deer it seemed happy and than i thought maybe the deer stopped to give dog some time dog has zero chance chasing a deer so it can fuck with him for a while  it wasnt that scary really just interesting        deers maybe they do crazy shit at night
  i was once on a trail and somebody else passed me from the other direction
  oh jesus how did you manage to survive that one
  coyotes      i could echo locate through the walls  just how loud can you scream
  you just didnt violate the nap and respected you for it
  deer had this happen winter bushcrafting numerous times
i hit a deer with my sled when trail riding at night the deer flew over my head and fucked up my entire front clip   scared the shit out if me i was lucky it didnt hit me
  found a bunch of old chinese graves from the gold rush while hiking near keithly creek bc not really creepy just unexpected
  thats actually cool as heck
  i wouldnt camp in phoenix park a man camping there may have been homeless was set on fire there a few years ago you never know what kinda freaks roam there at night
  it was mostly safe tbqh most of homeless didnt bother going as far some just slept in flowerbeds that were closer to city centre how many years ago was that
  i think it was about two years ago but my memory isnt great
  just checked it out it was in 2013
    damn dublin was crawling with homeless and all sorts of crazies which makes it no surprise
  i set his tent on fire later that day
when i was 15/16 i go fishing with my dad in a forestcovered cliff on the coast about 10 minutes fishing the weather started to get cloudy and suddenly a ball lightning strike in front and above us about 32ft the explosion left us paralyzed with fear for a moment you could feel the static in the air we packed our gear and went straight home before another ball could happen
  i got lost on day 2 of a 9 day trip didnt find the main trail again until 7th day
  not really /out/ technically idk of urbex fags frequent/out/ was exploring old factory that was all over grown total last of us feel was in a confined area with only one way in or out fire door rolled shut behind us was barred open after some panic found an escape by crawling through a fresh air inlet for a hydroair unit after circling back found an extra set of foot prints that followed ours and the fire door was now wedged shut never found who did it not sure if i avoided being kidnapped or what
  i wouldnt worry about it
i just aged out of the sc/out/ing after getting my eagle and im ready to start planning my own trips in my troop we mostly car camped because we had to keep things at the level that young kids can handle as a result we always brought along a portable kitchen with stoves pantries storage etc because we had the luxury of motor transportation its great and all to teach kids how to cook and work together but ive become tired of dinner taking four hours to cook/clean up and im on my own now im looking for simple fast recipes and methods of cooking that are leave no trace a backpacking stove should work but i dont know what brand and set up is best ive got a 50 dollar gift card to dicks so which of the following do you recommend from experience /out/ thanks in advance          also itt light weight stove recipes and cooking
    the pocket rocket looks promising but i havent used any of their products yet
    titanium stoves are great and lightweight but are only reliable for boiling water anything more than that will cause the stove to fail      these wind burneresque stoves are nice and great for trips where you dont have to carry your gear or if you are going to an area with a lot of wind they suck because you are stuck using a proprietary pot set and you usually wind up packing in extra weight for dead features piezeo regulators etc they are also top heavy      its a solid stove but its just a shittier version of the gsi pinnacle cannister stove reason being arms are flimsy arms are small its heavier and the carry case is trash 5 bucks more gets you a better stove      piezo regulator prone to melting proprietary pots top heavy etc etc    you want a reccomendation     remote cannister ability to invert fuel functional at temperatures up to 10 as an isobutane stove as well as functional in alpine situations a little on the heavier side ability to take 8 pots more fuel efficient than 90 of stoves on the market
  all we ever did was car cap     lmao this is why the fucking eagle scout program is meaningless nonsense when i was 15 on a learners license i was literally making interstate multiweek canoeing solo river trips during the summer and and weekend solo backpacking trips before everyone started partying hard af in senior year     meanwhile a fucking eagle scout goes car camping and has someone cook him pancakes and does a little creek cleanup project for his eagle and tries to act like hes hot shit and the next state fucking senator because of it     fuck outta here
      also just to answer your gay question the msr whisperlite international is the first and last camp stove youll ever need i still use mine that i bought 12 years ago
  /thread runs on any flammable liquid  white gas  kerosene  unleaded fucking gasoline
    its a great stove but the msr reactor is the best stove in the world
if you want a great system get a pocket rocket 2 and either an aluminum or better yet titanium pot and cup this is super light and compact and you have two containers one for drinks and one for your food which beats the msr reactor or jetboil where you have just the one pot
      i agree that the reactor would be a great secondary stove for ultra technical and very cold situations such as intermediate/advanced mountaineering but in choosing a stove you need to consider operating costs and convenience i fundamentally disagree with canisterbased stoves unless you absolutely need it like in a technical situation     the operating cost is too high you cant find them and if places are closed late at night or youre in a remote area youre not going to be able to just zip over to rei to pick up a 3 pack of canisters     liquid based stoves are categorically superior from a flexibility and cost perspective and if youve never used one the convenience difference between using a canister vs priming and lighting a liquid based one is not very big at all its easy to do     its so silly to force yourself to rely on such a specialty item for such a basic thing as boiling w water when going /out/ you shouldnt have to worry about it and if need be should be able to fill up your tank with gasoline at the nearest station anywhere in the world if you run out/forgot it
  i have this as well and though its a great and versatile stove during my last outings for years ive always decided to pack my msr pocket rocket instead     if i ever reach for the whisperlite again itll only be for an extended outing with multiple people
  well excuuuuuuuse me princesss i just so happen to be state senator now
  canister stoves are too expensive  git gud and learn to refill them with butane    buy 8oz lighter refill butane cans at chinese grocery store for 1 each  butane works fine in warmer summer months  you can refill before each trip so you arent carrying halfempty canisters  you get the convenience of canister fuel with the affordability of white gas sure in the winter time you can switch to white gas or go back to using regular isopro canisters
    for backpacking while the msr whisperlite//international//universal are fantastic stoves they are more geared for long expiditions and alpine usage unless hes fucking off in the woods for 10 days at a time or living in the mountains for a bit isobutane is probably much more significant for backpacking the stoves will be lighter and the fuel as well      once again pocket rocket 2 is great but the gsi pinnacle stove is 5 dollars more and so much more of a stove use a titanium pot only if you aim to boil water only
  refilling isobutane with butane    theres a reason why its mixed isobutane is incredible clean mix thats designed for boiling water efficiently the less butane you have in your isobutane mix the cleaner/hotter/more efficient your burn will be msr isopro will have a less than 1 butane content whereas say a company like primus 5070 if you are just doing pure butane you are only going to get pure butane butane burns cooler cleaner and isnt that great at boiling water in sub 2 minutes at 6600ft dont get me started about lower temperatures too
  this is a fair point but the integrated container/heat exchanger ie jetboil setup is impressively slick    wish someone would make a liquidfuel heatexchanger stove desu would probably boil super fast too
i got a jetboil minimo for 70 this black friday and i love it kinda heavy at 12 oz but meh rest of my gear is ultralight 2 cups of water boiled in less than 2 minutes is pretty great as well
  ive had the msr pocket rocket for years its a great minimal stove with the case on it can easily fit in a jacket pocket i had a small bout of homelessness 5 years ago and that stove plus emergency candles saved my ass lol still works great years later havent done any maintenance on it yet
  i got the msr and love it also theres another brand i got from a mom and pop shop came with two pots and a burner quality too for 50 will post more later       its kinna sad they dont do any high adventure stuff member philmont member camel backs man i member
ive got the exact jetboil pictured and i use it in the field in the army all the time its an amazing personal stove for one meal/drink its super easy clean and very light to pack out     i havent used any of their larger products but i would definitely recommend the brand to anyone who wants to try it

should i wait till spring to start my new flock of layers where i live doesnt get too cold but it can get down into the teens during the really cold months i just want to make sure they wont freeze to death i know chicks can be very fragile and would hate to see them die because of something preventable also where would you guys recommended getting chicks the feed store in town only has them a fraction of the time and they arent my ideal breeds when they are in stock
  here i have to use heat lamps if i raise chicks at this time the electric is really expensive for that i always wait till spring for older birds if they have their adult feathers then they should be fine most feed stores and big farm hardware stores have chicks and other poultry in the spring and near spring id call ahead and ask what breeds they plan to have and make recommendations for breeds youd like sometimes they can order them for you and you pick them up otherwise it can be a 200300 mile drive to a breeder
is there any special care necessary for more beat up chickens and rooster or they just get better as you feed them and let them enjoy themselves we are trying a small poultry nothing too special or big
  if they are not bleeding and not lethargic they should be fine a lethargic chicken should start recovering in 3 days after that any other signs of problems youd need to google or give more specific info here they can get pretty beat up and recover with enough rest give them feed and water access shade from the sun and warmth from the cold
surprisingly some of the raspberry cuttings from this summer actually started growinghopefully they make it through the winter    supposed to start getting shovelworthy snow soon so they got covered along with the strawberries
  sounds nice they should do well then
ordering seeds online a bad idea when its below freezing temperatures
  ordering live plants anytime is bad they either freeze or get cooked seeds are usually fine in freezing temps during shipping but it depends on seed type
  one of my indoors grew a few leaves like that too but im fairly certain its because i left one of the branches that was struck with some bacterial or fungi disease and now has black spots on it maybe yours is just sick or you have pests if the led is cool i dont think its heat i had cf tubes fairly close to mine seedlings and they didnt care and those tubes get hot     great looking plant to use as a bonchi    im sure there is something but you usually do the do hundreds of them at once so taping them is not that bad and you cannot really tape up small seedlings like that you need clips or tubes
  great looking plant to use as a bonchi    any good guides you can recommend for making my pepper a bonsai ive never done it before so i have no idea what is involved ive done a google search but its mostly low information guides or people trying to sell you their book
  not him but the original one here        has some good info if you scroll down past the book ad
  awesome thanks
  i read the guide and i have to say it is way more straight forward than i expected i assumed it was some kind of fine art but youre essentially training it for a small container with some pruning i would have done this years ago instead of letting dozens of pepper plants die from the canadian frost each year    the fact that you can reverse the bonsai process by putting them back in the ground is also nice
  yeah they are very easy and forgiving you can apply those techniques to the trees for making bonsai for the most part
  i want to order some super hot pepper seeds like trinidad maruga scorpion dorset naga/ghost and a few others
  the seeds will be fine any time of the year
it feels lucky to have great native plants like highbush blueberry black huckleberry virginia strawberry concord grape and more raspberry rose hips etc can i be a permie with native plants
  i got a really big problem was checking on the status of my avocado trees root progress appears the roots have started to make their way near the holes i dont want to plant them in the ground yet i didnt expect them to grow that fast theyre not even 5 months old yet   picture is just of the one but all three of them are heading that way
  they are airpruning you can simply plant them in a larger container they are most likely being root bound and thats no good for a tree you need like a 5gallon or larger bucket/pot they grow roots quickly and they are rather long you need to get them in the ground asap if that is their final location
anyone ever grown tobbacco ive bee researching the topic and have found a good bit of information was just wondering if anyone had any tips or anything im planning a garden for next season that is everything that i want to grow thats not a vegetable and tobbacco is on the list along with cotton and other nonedible crops
  theres at least two other anons that do so hopefully they chime in    along with cotton and other nonedible crops    ive been considering dogbane and nettle for cordage fibers
anyone growing pumpkins indoors this winter
  i will disagree with you if he lives in a place where winter climate has started tree growth should start slowing down to a crawl i would wait to repot or plant in ground in early spring
  noooooooooo
  if it were a colder environment and a maple i would agree since it is a rather warm climate and they are avocados no
anybody here /homegrow/ fish
  just aquaculture in a pond but really only for sunfish i dont manage it all that well and let it be for the most part ill probably be adding some pine trees and branch piles to it for cover and microbe/algae balancing later i also want to get lotus seeds and see if i can get those started i also want duckweed ill be getting geese and more ducks later so they need something to forage i currently only have cattails iris and spike rushes with more cover for the fish i can have a better system setup harvesting is typical rod and reel    it was having really bad green algae problems a while ago from the chickens and ducks crapping on/in its watershed i was going to get a hay bale to toss in but a big pine tree died and blew over into it that was enough to balance it and the algae disappeared id like it to be deeper to help protect better from freezing but winters the past couple of decades havent been as cold so theres that i guess
  ill be getting geese and more ducks later so they need something to forage  i too would like a pond with waterfowl and fish but im afraid it would turn into a literal shitfest
  you just need to manage it correctly that means only x number of waterfowl per x amount of square area im not sure what the ratio is though i think it is 69 square feet per bird for farm fed numbers and up to 65 square feet for more open wild birds that forage i think the highest number single flock is like 100 birds and no more    plants and things help a great deal for effluent management
i have a mircalegro aerogarden and want to get replacement growing media    anyone have any ideas im thinking about getting this    
  ive never used that sort of growing medium before the reviews for it seem fine except everyone is complaining that the slow boat from china is too slow lol
  damn that pic is comfy af i need to move somewhere with water and some good growing land
  i highly recommend it when my mind turns a bit to i wish i had more and this and this i have to stop and remember those years in the city were terrible and this place is actually really nice i just need to utilize it better
here are my last harvest of chocolate reapers that are probably trinidad moruga scorpions gonna be using these on my roasted chicken later today
  sadly im gonna have to transfer my avocado tree in the ground on saturday gonna have to visit lowes and buy a 64 quarts of potting soil with fertilizer so i can dig a roughly 56 foot hole and fill 3 feet of the hole with potting soil and hopefully the tree will take and not die after transfer planting it on the east part of the yard will get full sun from sunrise till about noon after that the big oak tree will block of the sun i think it might help from getting to hot in the summer  sadly i have two others that i dont know what to do with now
  those years in the city  you just live off your unsold labor now
  farming and woodworking
  make sure you start hardening it off to sunlight before planting it or you will need a shade screen to put over it otherwise it will scorch in the sun and die
  sadly  im the opposite i wish i were in a frostfree climate which would allow me to plant such things into the ground no more moving pots in/outside no more repotting as things grow and much less watering
    do they look healthy
  id guess so leaves seem lush green no chlorosis
  i highly recommend it when my mind turns a bit to i wish i had more and this and this i have to stop and remember those years in the city were terrible and this place is actually really nice i just need to utilize it better      thats the dream i am looking to get into a 23 year program to become an allied medical professional not a doctor but the lab workers who run tests and send the results to doctors and they are in relatively high demand outside major urban centers in canada soon as i am certified i am getting the fuck out of toronto and buying a nice plot of land and making whatever i can out of it    also keep posting comfy pics if you have them let me vicariously live a fulfilling life through you
  all of the doctors i know personally are farmers at home we trade seeds all the time
  do you have any woods on your property have you ever experimented with growing some wild shade cropsramps/ginseng/wild ginger etc
  what kinda bulbs should i get to start seedlings in a 10 gal fish tank looking for a bulb that wont keep my ass up all night while i try to sleep
  i planted some ramps about 20 years ago in my woods this year i was able to harvest some seeds from them and plant a dedicated woodland bed for them i also have a sugar bush i can make maple syrup from if the winter weather is right ive not been able to make maple syrup for the past 2 years its been too warm id like to start some wintergreen      drape a mylar emergency blanket over it youll still see some light through it but it will help contain most of it and they are super cheap as for the lights if you are only starting seedlings that will go outside later then anything 5k or higher color temp will work fine 6k8k is more ideal you can use dedicated grow lights or some cheap shop lights lumens and color temp are the most important thing some plant types need more light than others like if you are doing tomatoes and cucumbers then the cucumbers would turn yellow from lack of light while the tomatoes were just fine so make sure you have tons of light for whatever you are going to grow just watch out for heat build up and keep a small fan blowing around in the tank
  anything but incandescent    i started tomatoes peppers cucumbers pumpkins sunflowers tomatillos cantaloupe squash cilantro catnip and peas last year using 4 standard led bulbs in a plastic totepeople keep going on and on about having to have certain kinds of bulbs but for seeds it doesnt matteri did it    i painted it with multiple layers of white paint so ill see if that helps next year with the brightnesshowever the lights were only on from 6am10pm
  seconding    i did/am doing pretty much the exact same thing including timing my first shelving unit pic used aluminum foil over cardboard panels which helped a lot i built a much larger shelving unit for 15 trays and after painting it all white inside ill be putting shiny emergency blankets over the walls ive painted white the walls of 2 shelves and need to paint the 3rd im still going to make some cardboard panels painted white with mylar stretched over them as spot reflectors    im using super cheap 5k color temp led shop lights i still need to buy 5 more hopefully in january
  and heres the new shelving im using now the bottom shelf still needs fluorescent lights replaced with energy efficient leds
a few new additions to the grow tent one of my fig cuttings rooted and started putting out new leaf buds so ive moved it to the tent for now since the tomato plant is now in the basement to spend its last days im using the space to grow some lettuce to see how much i can get in a solo cup depending on the yield ill start filling up gaps between the peppers with lettuce throughout the winter the jalapeno x thai dragon f1 crosses are picking up and doing well so far although ive noticed a bit of leaf curl on new growth
  that fucking harvest
  trim the roots and make one a bonsai
  lol
    an electric fence with 1 strand of wire is all you need just place it at low nose height for the type of animal you want to keep out if theres more than one type of animal and their noses are at different heights youll need a single strand at each height all standard fences can be circumvented by animals it is the electric shock that has a psychological effect on them to stay away    a fiber glass rod fence post with wire clip to run a strand of electric fence wire through is all you need to make a fence and hook it to a fence charger you can get a top that slides over the rod so you can easily use a mallet to install then in the ground being fiberglass i advise wearing gloves as they get older years they tend to give off little splinters and any damage to them will have a section with splinters those splinters are fucking nasty so wear gloves as a habit you can install and move them very easily with just gloves and mallet
  kinda my bro is in to ant farms and if we make any money building them im breeding colored crawdads and bait fish for a hobby    i want to eventually breed tazmanian giant crawdads they are as big as lobsters and pretty much are but for fresh water ive already contacted the guys in charge of it in australia they said i would need a pretty good reason to export any i gave hin a quick summary of my planed cawdad hatchery and said i would get my shit together and make a respectful name for myself in the crayfish community and would start a joint effort breeding program with other hobbyists to sell to zoos and eventually have the american pet stores stocked to prevent extinction    he pretty much said fuck yeah they have a fishing season for them figured if they allow ill make some buddies and teach them how to properly ship them in seperate shipments in case something happens    a fucking 15 pound cawdad that will outlive me is going to be epic
  i could be wrong but i always heard cat tails were a sign the pond is dying makes sense with all your problems
  id give my left nut to grow citris in southeastern kansas    it might happen if my greenhouse works out ill build a giant polycarbonate greenhouse if theyll live
  no shit man
  i planted the cattails they grow in the shallows only if a pond is dying it is because it isnt holding water as deeply as before and the cattails are able to grow in the now shallower areas it once could not grow in either the pond needs to be dredged theres not enough runoff to keep it full or the dam is malfunctioning in some manner ducks and geese actually do a good job of eating young shoots and at one point it was almost wiped out from too many ducks eating it
  thanks anon probably going to have to cement 5 gallon buckets for the posts and i know i have a fiberglass boat half done because fuck fiberglass    im not really worried about other animals since itll be enclosed at night and i can keep an eye on it with my target ar and a garage door censor to my phone for alerts    its the useless faggots that tounge fuck my cars paint job to death that im worried about if i start havibg trouble ill put a game cam up so i know wtf i need to murder for stealing from me kek    thanks man kinda made my day i was pricing used barbed wire to cobble a shitty one together i could rip apart and bury cheaply     if this works out at all im just going to see if my conpany will let me keep a large area clear and bury new pipes as i grow for temperature control hook the landowner up with nore than he can eat and he shouldnt care hes a laid back old dude and lets me do wtf i want so i maintain his roads like a fucking highway going to surprise him with a pipe creek crossing for christmas    some days are hell but if i can just water and half ass it for a day or two at tumes i should be alright or suck it uo and work all night wouldnt be the first time i put in 90 hour weeks for shit pay lol    but i mean days liklike today for some reason its nice and sunny as hell outside in late november and ive had 1 guy show up to get a load of rock twice ive worked 10 minutes in almost 6 hours likely for all 10 today    i just want my freedom and i really need to stop being a lazy fuck and get paid to do a side job while at work    people need to eat theres a small town grocery store and a dollar general here nothibg else for 35 square miles
  i guess you could grow c trifoliata but theyre considered inedible way too bitter  i might look into a satsuma next year for planting in the ground in a protected corner oceanic 8a so its a bit risky
  cool i didnt know that turning my small pond into a duck pond after i doze beside it and plant stuff that attracts them     been going to feet the ducks since i was born i love the feathery bastards
  yeah shaft my only hope is geothermal unless i make enough money i can run a gas line and transplant some citris trees at home ill keep a camera on it and auto water if i can keep a descent climate they shoukd be low maintenance
  cement 5 gallon buckets for the posts    that is fine if you dont have ground to pound them into but sucks to lug around without a dolly good luck with it      neat got a list of what youll be planting
  well its rock and rock dust thats had a few thousand passes of w600 komatso loaders hauling 15 ton loads its pretty much concrete thanks for the time ill roll them in and out of my loader bucket     to start probably cycle 25 varieties of tomatoes at a time and log taste tess until i find the ones i like    been following this guy a lot since hes succesfull with 1/10 the amount of space i have and in canadian weather    i like to tinker and time at work not spent gardening or working will be spent on automation chris here makes 6 figures and cuts his best sellers with a knife a handfull at a time i finally found a machine i can replicate its a glorified headge trimmer with 2 conveyor belts slide racks onto belt it spits out the cut greens into a bulk bin and cut trays go out the other side i have some geared wheelchair motors and all of the free belts i want automated packaging etc stuff like that i looked and he has 1/4 acre and i have 4 about 35 if i dont farm my yard so i have about 15 times the land and can get more for 1500 an acre if i get lucky itll be shit and ill have to clear it with a backhoe or hire my buddy with a dozer but its doable i also have a half acre lot and a giant shitty house im moving out off that would be a great insulated greenhouse with natual gas heat    i easily have more land than i can maintain alone there are no jobs here and i could hire quality help for 15hr because its cheap to live here and half of the guys working on the road i know want to come home but want a descent drive without a 3 hour commute ill happilly go hire if i can    getting 17 cart lengths in front of the horse tho sorry just excited to finally have a goal to work towards and not be broke and bored at work 50 hours a week    1/2
  i finally found a machine i can replicate its a glorified headge trimmer with 2 conveyor belts    what will you be harvesting specifically
  2/2    microgreens pea chutes sunflower chutes 45 others on rotation for     vegetables random salad mixes arugala spinach white salad turnips cucumbers carrots peas     peppers random    flowers starter roses to line my fence at home and cuss at while mowing dont know any other names wtf ever my wife likes and some kind i got at walmart that stayed alive for over a month    citris lemon lime oranges other random    other potatoes squash corn other    ill probably start with just tomatoes and microgreens and grow into the other stuff as i learn and hone in on the best of the 2000 types of tomatoes ill chat uo a few reputable restuarants and offer them free shit for feedback and ask them wtf they want    i really dont care so long as i can feed the family and make some money    population is low af here my best bet is a 45 minute drive to bartlesville oklahoma to start small and im 2 hours away from wichita and tulsa its a bit of driving but i have a good 1 ton dually and a cdl i can make my walk in cooler a goose neck trailer with a generator and haul ass to the city once or twice a week again tho getting ahead of myself i just want to start simple and small but grow anand learn extremely fast while running the greenhouse at cost and upgrading until i dont have to do anything besides watch my wife boss people around and chase other business opportunities    i just figure ive tried gardening many times and failed it isnt that hard ive been laid up and broken before i have some land now and god forbid times get hard id like to be able to scrape by and eat well for health and moral
  to start microgreens pea chutes spinach and a few more that are harvested in the same manor    if i start producing a few things that sell well and i can do it consistently then my next move would be to drop off large loads of those few specific microgreens in wichita and tulsa and pay some bros or a delivery sevice to run around town and deliver    itll be a little tough to manage but if/once i get enough interest that im hauling truckloads myself ill be set
  the winter harvest with eliot coleman      worth the watch for you i think
  to start microgreens pea chutes spinach and a few more that are harvested in the same manor not really sure yet anything tastey or that will sell well
  will do boss
  i know a guy who made most of his money just growing greens for local restaurants i think his furthest ride was like 50mins away or so it is certainly doable
  i appreciate it anon that old bastard was pretty funny this is the only reason id ever even consider looking at a garden again this guys spent years of his life learning all of this and i learned it in under an hour i imagine its a lot like playing sports you can study the fundamentals all you want and it helps a great deal but youll never be worth a shit without experience    tractor laying hoop houses  genious
  i sure hope so anon even if i cant quit my job for a bit it would be really nice my wife makes about 20k in a job she hates shed be happy as shit to handle post harvest stuff and handle all of the paperwork my bro is an attorney so getting incorporated is nothing but the cost of fees an i owned a dump truck for a bit so i already know how to jump through hoops with all the bullshit governmental trucking regulations    ive pretty much got everything under control besides actually being able to grow without suiciding all of my plants out of stupidity    it would really be nice to figure out tho my neighbor is a horticulturist and i know the place he works at is shit in every way especially pay hes also my tenant tho so i dont want to pester him but if i could pull him away from there even if hes lazy as hell he would be able to just make a list of wtf needs done for other people i think hed go for it
making applesauce inside  snowy and cold outside  the whole house smells like apple pie  pic fully related    pretty comfy here right now      very true theres a world of good established knowledge out there it is only a matter of finding it and determining if it is the correct information for you      shed be happy as shit to handle post harvest stuff and handle all of the paperwork    just make sure the equipment to do it is good and top notch try to keep away from plastic it tends to break with actual use ease of cleaning is another good feature
  just make sure the equipment you get is good and top notch    fixed    i accidentally hit a paste button while typing
  shelving unit  id much rather be doing that with shop lights but i just dont have a lot of space and with cats everything has to be enclosed or they will destroy it      cheap weed and applesauceand pie    nice
  use hardware cloth to keep cats out
  how long did those take to germinate
so i bought some shiitake and reishi growing kits from a local guy and i was wondering if after the kits have been exhausted if i could take the kits and use them as a starter culture for future growing anyone tried this before
  omfg yes and my friends wont leave me alone my dream is an epic shine still and make the best around here i like my bed tho and have a descent job so i told my friends i would give them instructions on wtf to do and i wanna try it    apple pie moonshine omfg yes
  and thanks for the advise my bro welds stainless for a living everything i buy and modify or build will be twice daily douched with a hot bleach water mix and if one single spec of dirt or leaf or wtf is found i will do it again    bleach water is cheap
yo if anybody had any good harvests this year post em i get off on that stuff
  i get off on that stuff  so did i
  is the lettuce going to be microgreens if you want garlic tops for fresh eating a single bulb per cup with a little bit of soil grows really fast      tazmanian giant crawdads    those do sound interesting and damn they are monsters    fishing for the giant freshwater crayfish was never a commercial proposition and its slow growth and aggressive nature suggest that the species is not suitable for aquaculture7 as an edible animal they are further disadvantaged of being so spiny that they can cut hands if carelessly shelled after cooking and they yield little meat relative to total weight15 however the striking nature of the species makes it a potential tourism drawcard7    looks like theres some challenges i think slow growth isnt a problem it just means a slower start up humans have tools to remove spines i quite sure people east sea urchins after all i think the aggressiveness cold be bred out of them if you controlled the population very well but id probably just segregate them and not worry about a breeding program per se as the main goal considering they are overfished is a sure sign people are not having trouble eating them    there are people in my area who raise hellbenders cryptobranchus alleganiensis and release them back into streams they are near threatened status and people are acting now to prevent it from going any further they are really slow growers too evidently it takes years for them to be able to mature to mate
  yes theres also a fungi growing guide in the op second pastebin link read up it is ridiculously easy easy enough to make you wonder why everyone doesnt have one sitting on their kitchen counter i prefer using logs reishi is a bit different in some regards so read up on it individually
  ive pressed 179 litres just over 47 muttgallons of apple juice from a single bramley tree this year few more buckets still to press but unfortunately i dont think enough to hit 200l this is despite major losses to codling moth and the drought my press is also nowhere near as efficient as it could be im drinking juice like its going out of fashion and giving the stuff away because im basically out of freezer space
  do you make any other apple products like applesauce ive been making apple sauce apple jelly and apple slices for apple pie the past week all are water bath canned
  nothing like on the scale of the juicing    made a bit of apple sauce which i freeze also peeled bagged and froze some slices for crumbles pies shortbreads etc     bramley apples can also keep for months because of its high acidity so i picked out some of the best and wrapped them in newspaper in the cellar i will have them later as baked apple with ginger raisins and clotted cream
  sounds pretty good
  cider both alcohol and vinegar
my sunbox has been expanded with 2 led grow lights i got off of amazon  now they get about 8 hours of sunlight and supplemental artificial light my neighbours probably think im a massive pothead but i swear im growing only basil rosemary and tarragon
  whats the inside look like now
still have to paint the new wood white to maximize reflection probably will do that this weekend
  now it really is vibrant to the point of hurting the eyes lol
  yeah after looking in there with no goggles my eyes feel a bit funny afterwards also if ive been looking at the lights for too long and then look away all the green on my other plants look ultra green for a while as if my eyes were adjusting to the high red/blue and low green inside the box i should probably invest in some glasses
  lol
is there a buying guide for grow lamps want to set up and indoor rig and would prefer leds just starting and was hoping to find something for under 50
  these are the lamps i just bought         they were 40 canadian a piece for a 2ft long lamp
        forgot to add a picture the 2 super purple looking pictures are my new grow setup with 2 of these lights they are very strong
i want to get into growing my own salads with hydroponics and leds i like sugar snap peas so i thought about growing them but i see that they grow vertically on a vine ive never done a setup where the lights are shooting to the side and the plants are growing vertically in rows or in vines but it intrigues me anyone done something like this before any tips
  it depends on what you are growing what are you growing and what stages of their life will they be grown at under artificial lights
  there isnt much to it you can have the lights on one side and all the leaves will point to it as it grow upwards you may need to train them since youd need to do that normally anyway
mi just legalized mary j this month i thought it said you could grow 12 plants per household and now all the hydroponic stores are seeing increased businesseven they though theyre not supposed to even talk to people about growing despite the law going into effect in december because of the federal laws who doesnt need a butane extractor for growing tomatoes    i wonder if it will have an effect on supplies also used for gardening/vegetables over time    i dont think a lot of people grasp what it actually takes to grow it and that cops can still really jam you up if they want to    never grown it not planning tojust thought it was kind of relevant since there are a number of people who have indoor setups for vegetables
  with increased demand prices will eventually start to drop as more gear floods the market to keep up with demand and cheaper manufacturing methods are developed to do that    but yeah those plants are still federally illegal and can land you in prison in every state if the feds want to ill certainly ride the coattails of price drops and better gear for my food crops
  prices will eventually start to drop as more gear floods the market to keep up with demand  thats what i was thinking about and better availability    those plants are still federally illegal  not that im expecting people will have problems with that there were/are already a ton of minor drug cases that were/will be thrown out as a result of the ballot    people should be more concerned with the holyerthanthough types who love to report anything and everything and law enforcement who did not share the publics view on legalization    i remember an episode of cops or copsesque show from not that long ago in which they were responding to a complaint of a grow operation the guy had all his medical paperwork he was perfectly within the limits of the law and his setup included filters to minimize the impact to neighbors the cops were insistent on shutting him down so they deemed his light setup unsafe even though he said it was professionally done and it didnt at look haphazard they got his power shut off and the house condemned that day until it was inspected
  it was legalized here but theres an increase in arrests as a result someone even speculated it was a ploy make people in the drug trade to relax their security protocols and be caught off guard it actually seems to be working though i highly doubt that was even considered at the time of the ruling theres been bust after bust and the courts are currently jammed evidently most people cant distinguish medically prescribed to patients only from i can grow  smoke all the weed i want now    regardless they can all piss off with the latest led tech prices are dropping anyway and more people are simply getting into gardening now than since the victory garden era and they are doing it specifically for their health more than for anything else
im in a tropical country and im planting some sorghum any advice on this
  victory garden era    dig for victory  
  what are you growing it for theres grain fodder and syrup while each can be used for that there are better cultivars than others for each use making syrup is the hardest part and i highly suggest you get access to equipment that is specifically for sorghum grain is easy but birds will strip everything off if you dont harvest as soon as they are ripe you can plant an excess of sorghum to ensure birds dont eat everything or you can put bird netting over everything if you dont have much planted for fodder you need to harvest it at special times in the sorghum life cycle in order to reduce the amount of cyanide in the plant for instance the worst concentration of cyanide occurs in colder northern areas when frost hits fodder sorghum are normally hybrid crosses between grain and sweet sorghum so saving seed from them wont be as good as saving the heirlooms of grain or sweet sorghum    if you are going to use it for fodder some animals can get hcn poisoning faster than others from less cyanide in the fodder i read that rabbits are particularly susceptible to hcn poisoning    spacing will be the most important aspect of planting other than fertilizing do a bit of research on row spacing so you know what will be optimal for your needs watering isnt too much of an issue it seems they are highly drought tolerant and while a rainy season isnt ideal it is more about soil temperatures being warm enough than say how rainy your spring may be soil temps in a tropical country are probably going to be a lot warmer year round right lol
    i only know its sorghum bicolor from the seed seller   i want to use it for both syrup and grains will the syrup have high content of hcn if i wait until its ripen  i will be using sugarcane presser for the syrup extraction
  you wont have a problem with hcn if you are making syrup after the grains are ripe and before any frost hits if it doesnt frost when you are growing then i wouldnt even worry about it that would only ever be a problem if you are eating it as fodder which you wont be a sugarcane press should work well you might need to run the stalks through more than once most sorghum presses have 3 rollers and are designed to press the stalks twice as they pass through them if your press has smaller rollers theres a chance the joints of the stalks will stop and not go through if that happens you can try just smashing the joints with a hammer before running them through i doubt that will happen    enjoy your sorghum pancakes and sorghum syrup
    theres no frost here so maybe its okay i will probably try to make beer out of the grain for fun
  that lamp makes me nervous because it doesnt list its specs and when asked about them the seller does not know      to start probably just herbs and prefruiting vegetables maybe eventually building a pepper set up as i understand it i would just need blue and red my goal for my set up would be minimizing cost wattage correct while sacrificing as little versatility and quality as possible
  some of these videos are pretty good and contain info that isnt usually seen now for some reason the europe ones seem to be better and more educational with actually good info while the us ones tend to be more about duty patriotism and very general gardening info though the us civilian organization vids are of course better than the wartime government sponsored ones one recommends using arsenate of lead as a pesticide which was banned in 1988 for that use since you knowlead which couldnt be washed off crops before eating arsenate of lead was replaced by ddt lol    europe          us      
  forgot one     which is my favorite
  banned in 1988  if that is correct it wasnt succeeded by ddt ddt was banned the previous decade they say it almost extincted our national bird oops
  commercially ddt became more popular and arsenate of lead fell out of favor their banned dates have no meaning in that regard
whats wrong with is plant
  water deeply allow to drain well if you fertilized it recently before this happened flush it even more to help remove excess build up of fertilizer it can be underwatering or root burn
why arent people growing more of their own food    are there some small plants i can grow on a cold windowsill this winter /out/
  why arent people growing more of their own food    convenience lack of knowledge preconceived notions class distinctions time involved etc take your pick    are there some small plants i can grow on a cold windowsill this winter /out/    of course garlic for garlic tops is super easy as is chives most herbs do well it really is only a matter of how much light they can get with enough light you can grow anything from tomatoes to fruit trees
    what direction does your window face if you are in the northern hemisphere a north window is the worst because it never gets direct sunlight an east window gets a few hours of sun in the morning and then indirect sunlight in the afternoon a west window gets indirect sunlight during most of the day and several hours or direct sunlight after noon south is the best as it gets the full days sun basically south  west  east  north    if you are growing edibles i would stick to herbs if you dont have supplemental artificial light as another anon mentioned chives or garlic/onions for their tops is a good start as that is vegetative growth and those tend to grow quite vigorously    rosemary and tarragon have grown well in my west window and ive heard that mint/basil/thyme/oregano can also do well     if you want anything that produces fruit artificial light really is a must
how much of average land you need to feed a single pig on grass from young to maturity lets assume its a durable pig race so it would be alright in cold and heat
  the biggest thing is to make sure you have enough land to rotate pastures you need at least 1250 to 1750 square feet per pig so it you have a 36x36 to 40x40 pen for 1 pig it should be fine but only of you rotate the pig to a new pasture as they start to become too tore up and fodderless bigger is better and rotating sooner than later is better pigs and other animals shouldnt be kept in muddy torn up pasture there can be a wallow the pig can access if it wants to roll in mud to keep insects off but the pasture should be good it is normally best to rotate them on fields that will be plowed for gardening after the pig is rotated off    pigs are omnivores and will require a rather varied diet suitable pasture for them may be difficult the above small pen area may not have everything a pig needs to eat so youll need to supplement its diet they are not like sheep that can just graze on grass or goats that can forage on weeds and shrubs they will eat anything that comes into the pen dig up roots tubers  grubs eat tasty plants and forage for nuts they will even kill and eat snakes mice/rats or whatever they can catch and kill much of the later will depend on the pigs personality and previous experiences
  damn thats quite a bit of land it needs i guess two or even three 36x36 pens per pig on top of that i need to give it other food than just grass maybe leftovers but i wouldnt be so sure about it  in theory i should be able to upkeep a pig in small forest behind my house but that would require fencing that stuff    how does the situation look with sheep and goats i generally aim for something that i wouldnt have to look after every day or something
  i generally aim for something that i wouldnt have to look after every day or something    if you raise animals you must look after them every single day that is part of the responsibility they get into trouble all the time they may get caught in the fence escape get injured get sick etc and need you asap so skipping a day without looking in on them is very irresponsible if you cant do it on one day you need someone else to do it for you theres no skipping days you can reduce this using technology like using cameras that you can access from the internet then you can check on your animals from anywhere in the world that wont be as good as being their in person but it is an option    continued
    continued    sheep and goats    heres something ive been making for myself via research some of it may be incorrect but it may be a good place to get a start for your own research most of these seem to be max animals so having more land or fewer animals on the same amount of land will work out better some animals like rabbits and guinea pigs can be rotated twice a day so their tractors can be twice as small the amount of land you need for grazing animals on rotating pastures has to make up enough plots so that by the time you rotate the animals back around to the first plot the grass will have full recovered        1 acre  43560 square feet  208710325 x 208710325  43559999 square feet    land required all animals will require grazing rotation of some sort    210 goats per acre pure grazing/foraging acres amount depends on quality of grass and scrub  1 cow and 1 calf per 152 acres  1015 hogs per acre  48 sheep per acre 3 day rotation  1 chicken per 1089 sq 4000 chickens per acre 3day rotation  1 rabbit per 6 sq 7260 rabbits per acre daily rotation  1 guinea pig per 6 sq 7260 rabbits per acre daily rotation  1 goose per 10 sq  1 duck per 35  sq  1 snail 24083 sq containers can be stacked maximizing land space 1000 snails per flat 200 sq 5 container high stack  5k snails in the same floor space  1 bee hive per pollination acre 2 mile forage radius required around hives 1257 square miles/80448 acres more hives can be done per acre if flowers are planted for them
  ah my bad indeed everything can happen if youre not looking theyre not plants after all      well turns out my sparse forest has about half of acre so i could fit in a goat or a pair there is quite a lot of grass in a season or a few sheep if i bothered dividing it for rotation    my parents already have chickens and ducks so i got that covered but i would be interested in adding few guineafowl to the forest as those apparently eat up ticks and im damn paranoid about them    rabbits are rather diseaseprone creatures my father had a few on top of that it would be bother to manage the whole lot of them    sure i could fit in some hogs but i would be worried about them not getting a balanced diet i wouldnt want to feed them some artificial feed because that would defeat the whole point of pasturing    i was both shocked and pleased how much land is needed when i heard about acres on one side pastured animals sure need a lot of land but on other hand this isnt that bad if you rotate them and they can be pastured on poorer cheaper lands average price for hectare of land 25 acre here is about 25 times the minimal monthly wage it sucks i know where grass still would grow wild and the sensible pasturing would improve the land    thank you very much for replies you helped me a lot
this is my elderberries second year of life and it shot up like gangbusters i didnt want to trim it because i was just happy for all the growth didnt even have to water it much at all except when it drooped a little a handful of time the whole summer north carolina summers mulch ftw but now its fall and im wanting to address how rangy it got even growing into the patio area how do i prune this beautiful monster to make it more bushy and not destroy it i dont know if you can see the red threads but i wrapped threads around all the limbs that produced fruit this year so i could tell them apart because i think that affects how you prune it
  elderberry two not as much growth but i love him anyway he put out great fruit too
  all poultry/fowl eat ticks and everything else they can chase down breeds that are better foragers will catch more insects reptiles and small furry creatures    rabbit disease    this is mostly from how people are raising them they are not disease prone theres some specialized knowledge you need in order to raise them properly for instance if you put them out to pasture without first slowly introducing fresh greens into their diet it can give them the runs and end up killing them thats just a diet change thing and can happen with most animals if you use a rabbit tractor you need to move it twice a days usually keeping it in one spot too long will just make the rabbits sick again that goes for most animals caged rabbits need clean airy conditions and you have to keep the manure moving out to your compost all the time just like you would muck stalls every day for horses or whatever    one big thing some people dont realize is that rabbits overheat easily they are also nocturnal for the most part and cant have sun shining on them their cages and rabbit tractors need to have roofs over them to block sunlight they also need fresh water every single day as do all animals    the whole point of pasturing    unless you become a shepherd and let the animals pasture themselves across 100s of acres they are not going to get a balanced diet youll always need to supplement their diet growing your own feed/fodder also takes a lot of land time and resources        very nice im considering moving mine they are many years old now and in a location i cant fertilize well enough    prune    remove all dead stuff remove 3year old canes at the end of their 3rd year before winter remove anything diseased thats all you do dont cut back the tops or anything like that expect to have a rather large bush if they do well thats just how they need to grow tagging the canes to tell what year they are is a very good idea
    also if you want to gain a bit more info about rabbit raising for meat and fur heres a few videos i highly recommend everyone watch    indepth 9part series on all aspects of raising rabbits for meat best videos ive found yet on raising rabbits                      how to treat rabbit hides for use info is duplicated but theres some differences in each method        fyi a high percentage of a rabbits diet is grass it is something like 80 i think onyl giant guinea pigs have a higher percentage at around 90 so both are very feed efficient animals if you have the pasture to raise them on
rabbits seem fine but they got no fat on them
  they have fat it just isnt all that much
  you cannot live off rabbit alone as you will get fat hunger  might be good to sell it to urbanites and then buy good pork but i would prefer to eat what i raise
  the same thing can happen if you only eat kale rabbit meat is about 33 fat wild rabbit meat stewed compared to beef and pork which are 32 fat 1 pound of rabbit meat has 10g of fat which is 16 of the daily requirement for fat in a 2k cal diet compared to 1lb of roast cut of beef that gives 61g of fat at 95dv 4 ounces of walnuts would give you 100dv of fat fyi               it should be noted that there are no good sources of information on rabbit starvation but theres a shit load of blogs about it the main thing is to vary your diet as always eating anything alone can get you killed fat hunger is something no one should be worrying about theres just too many sources of fat you can eat the same goes for anything you need in your diet thats just proper eating procedures
  i understand i just kind of want to go be on mainly carnivore dietseems to work nicely for me no gasses and stuff so i would need lots of animals fats that rabbits alone wouldnt be able to provide if i wanted to just live off land i know it would require a tremendous amount of land that in modern times is more of luxury  maybe breeding rabbits for pork money wouldnt be a bad idea as its more expensive despite needing mostly grass to live on
    thanks for the info gonna look into them
  fyi a high percentage of a rabbits diet is grass it is something like 80 i think onyl giant guinea pigs have a higher percentage at around 90 so both are very feed efficient animals if you have the pasture to raise them on    is there an alternative to storebought pellets maybe sprouted grains i sort of want to be selfsufficient in terms of nutrition for rabbits in case if money gets tight in case of prices changes
  btw im referencing to the videos you posted she said she still rabbits the pellets
  i hope you are ready to read basically you grow grains and seeds to take the place of the pellets youll need lots of wild greens as well and of course a ton of hay    short version      tldr version        of course growing food to replace the pellets is a pretty big deal to try to do those pellets are jammed with nutrition making up for that loss requires a bit of land to grow different stuff and a host of equipment that family probably doesnt have they have a large amount of rabbits after all
      there are 800 ounces in 50lbs bag of rabbit feed    in ounces these are the recommended amounts on the side of the bag  mature maintenance/early/mid gestation 3040 dry does and bucks  growing free choice bunnies  late gestation/lactation 60140 lactating does    low number at 34 ounces a day 266200 days worth of feed per 50lbs bag for 1 rabbit  high number at 614 ounces a day 13357 days worth of feed per 50lbs bag for 1 rabbit    butchering fryers are butchered between 8 to 12 weeks5684days of age    feed cost where i live 1569/50lbs bag  200 rabbits from birth to butcher no birthing 1120016800 days of feed needed  4384 bags of feed totaling 67467 to 131796  rabbits at butchering weighing 4 to 55 pounds and should dress out at about 2 to 3 pounds usually 50  60 percent   200 rabbits producing 400600lbs  329 to 112 per pound includes bones    it is no wonder people want to let rabbits forage as much as possible for their feed if you have the land to let the forage in rabbit tractors then you should be able to reduce the feed costs by about 5080 the cost of growing your own feed to replace the store feed is too varied to pin down at best you can expect 60 bushels 1 bushel60lbs of wheat berries per acre of land thats 3600lbs of grain per acre the pellet food from the above numbers ranges from 2150 to 4200 pounds for 200 rabbits planting 2 acres of grain would give you 7200lbs of grain which is enough for 670 to 342 rabbits    172 rabbits per acre of grain rounded up  43560 sqft in an acre  2541 sqft of grain per rabbit 100 grain fed  50 to 80 for foraging 12705 to 5082 sqft of grain per rabbit  200 foraging rabbits would need 25410 to 10164 sqft 0583 to 023 acres    in the end 200 nonbreeding rabbits would probably require about 05 to 075 acres of grain  038 to 066 acres of forage  total land 088141 acres    numbers may be way off one way or another
    man thanks  and holy shit there is quite a lot of work with that  no wonder rabbit is rather expensive in my country its a lot of managing with these little creatures
  it is only a big problem if you want to grow your own stuff but that goes with just about anything when you dont have enough land to let the graze as they normally would meat requires a lot of mass and energy to make
  well i would try to have a few rabbits live off whatever they find on my land  hay and peelings during winter and see what happens i got about half an acre so it might work out
  it should work well enough if you are not raising hordes of them
  cool thanks for all    might i ask for info about goats and sheep or am i tiring you too much
  lol youll get faster more indepth information simply googling your questions    how much land per goat  what to feed goats  sheep diseases    that sort of thing just start with diet shelter equipment and diseases the biggest thing with goats and sheep is birthing young some breeds are notorious for needing help meaning youll be up to your elbow/armpit in goat/sheep pussy trying to turn a kid/lamb around so you can pull it out with your own hands other breeds will be listed as easy birthing finding info on which breeds are which can be difficult
  alright will do the research thanks    meaning youll be up to your elbow/armpit in goat/sheep pussy trying to turn a kid/lamb around so you can pull it out with your own hands  nope definitely i dont want that
got a question about water pressure here im planning to build a stacked indoors aeroponics system with three beds under grow lights i reckon it will be about a meter and a half high with 6 spray heads per bed for coverage should i be putting the pump at the top and using gravity to build pressure at the bottom then buy another pump to recirculate drainage or just buy a stronger pump to send the water up from the bottom also if the latter what sort of power pump is required
  you mean you need to know the water pressure for a mister youll need to refer to the instructions for the misters and its recommendations it should list water pressure requirements flow rate it has and distance requirements you also need to know the depth of the pump and the head of the misters from the pump intake you should be able to select a pump from those specs and a flow     or is this merely a gravity system that is unpressurized i dont see that working well without a pressurized mister
i got my first houseplant a golden pothos    how to not kill    how often do i water it
  when the top 12 inches of soil is dry give it a good soaking and make sure to set it in the sink or someplace where it can drain out before returning it to the drip tray otherwise it may overflow and also suck water back up that may cause problems later on if it does that too much
  dont cut back the tops or anything like that    i was expecting it to be bushier than it currently is and like i said its encroaching on a sitting area i would like to shape it to be more bushy instead of long and rangey
my indooring poblanos are flowering a shit load are they selffertile like the black hunarians if i could get a harvest of poblanos and black hungarians over the winter that would be sweet      my family has had one of those for 20 years you can water them once every week or two weeks and it only needs indirect sunlight never water until the top 2 inches or so of soil are dry i fertilize it with half strength 101510 every 23 months     my mother has a brown thumb and she kept it alive until i took it a year ago sometimes she forgot to water for close to a month she claims
  also my new grow box was given a fresh coat of white paint no photon shall go to waste
  it will get bushier by sending out more stalks as it gets older over the years it is kind of similar to asparagus like that
  nice i ran out of paint today with the last of the painting i needed to do for my seedling shelving unit
anything special to growing sweet potatoes
  pick the cultivar that fits into your growing season let them ramble along on the ground to root everywhere and dont let them crawl up anything
  they are called devils ivy because they are impossible to kill and they stay green even in the dark according to (((google)))      so just cut the problematic stalks thanks
  yep i intend to pressurise the system im just not sure how to work out an appropriate strength pump do i add up the requirements of each mister head like a series circuit and would it be easier to put the pump for the misters up top so gravity can help it pressurise the bottom or just buy a stronger pump to drive the water up from the bottom
  so just cut the problematic stalks    yes      double check the type of system required for aeroponics high pressure or low pressure low pressure uses water and a pump while high pressure uses compressed air and nutrient solution using an air compressor        now heres some of the math stuff that should give you enough to get started      also theres usually a hydroponics system building thread over on /diy/ from time to time thats a good place for design issues like this while this thread is a good place to ask about plant/animal needs and such there are 2 threads right now   
  all peppers are self fertile and usually you dont need to do anything wind and general movement around them shakes the pollen but if you want to be certain you could shake the flowers or hand pollinate with a brush i never found a need to do that tho
  i use a stick taped to my electric shaver then i gently touch the stalk near the flower with the stick and the shaver vibrates the fuck out of the flower without being so rough as to pop it off pollen practically shoots out still gentle tapping of the stem works well enough
how well does using grass clippings as mulch to kill a garden sized patch of grass how much grass do you need to kill the grass its covering how long
  probably 48 inches thick of fresh green grass clippings but it may not be able to kill all the roots if it isnt thick enough time taken may be a few weeks
anyone have any clue on the best type of system  nutrients needed are use to grow peppers to their full potential hydroponically
i planted these hyssop thinking my southern facing bay window would provide enough light for them to grow well clearly it didnt how can i salvage these i think i used all of my seeds for these and i dont want to kill them
  plant them in much larger pots and give them tons of light but youll need to harden them off to lots of light so it doesnt burn them
  i think the system type might be an eternal debate nutrient recipes are also a debate topic    
  its winter here i dont think there is a way to give them more light without exposing them to the cold winter air /
  i thought they need uv i didnt go to school for biology
  leds are the sate of the art technology for indoor lighting to grow plants    
simple datamining    when did you start growing your own plants  do you consider yourself a gardener market gardener farmer etc  do you have any livestock  do you have a favorite variety of plant you like to grow
hey /out/ i need help finding a solid pair of boots the last pair i had were similar to pic related i do field work and live in the midwest so i need a pair that can last in the snow i obviously dont want fashion boots and id like comfortable seeing as ill be hiking around in them i was thinking of getting chippewas but wanted to get other opinions
  cowboy boots is all u need
  pic related is a good all rounder that can handle snow
  just ordered those cant wait
  do you have a link im not sure what brand this is
  read file name
    can confirm have those exact same boots and they are solid comfortable and the locking lace mechanism is killerallows to tighten the forefoot and then locking it into place before doing the upper so you dont lose tension good stuff
vasque breeze iii gtx    i have their talus trek ultra dry which is also a decent boot but you can get the breeze with insulation for a real all around boot instead of a non winter boot
literally the most comfortable snow boots ive ever worn
    i rec these
  cloth shoes in the snow
  all fabrics are the same  leather cant get saturated with water
can cop these viking hunter for 200  some old norwegian man far in the mountain told me they were tough and comfy as fuck  should i
  do they need to have certain safety features     i live by red wings when it comes to work boots
   oh youre talking about snow snow
  im not op just hijacking this thread
  you gonna be snowshoeing or going places where you need to wear crampons
danner  always the answer anons
  im thinking about getting a pair of danners not sure if i should get the ones with nmt toe and zipper or just standard
    wrong pic
heel toe drop  yikes
blundstone
                those are sneakers anons sneakers
  step aside boys the real man has entered the thread
  do you feel in charge
  back off buddy
  god damn i have so many boots the ones i like best are danner rivot tfx very light great ankle support not waterproof though i count it as a decent trade though theyre essentially sneakers im taking a pair of the swiss combat boots hiking next week full grain leather thick padding waterproof combat boots should keep your feet toasty and dry for the snow i might pair them up with some people socks or something look into those if you want some anti snow boots under 100 usd ks90
i need some boot that will say  im a rich queer who doesnt give a fuck  but will also protect me from the canadian winter
  have cow hide grafted to your feet and surgically deaden every nerve below mid calf
  rich queer who doesnt give a fuck  la sportiva got you covered
  get cowboy boots have them fur lined and waterproofed
  limmer boots buy a pair that will last for your grand kids
  have these they be leaf rated
    whatever you buy make sure its water proof i bought a nice pair of mid length merrill moabs they fit and feel great but they werent waterproof my first trek in some morning dew and my feet were soaked in minutes lesson learned
  how is this possible decent boots should at least repel water
  just bought some browning stalkers 400grams pretty impressed for price
  i just bought some helly hansen boots as my winter pair they were like 50 off did i fuck up
while not technically a boot it has met my demands for shoe/boot hybrid if youre like me and despise the heavy rigidness of boots maybe look at these theyre the most comfortable things ive put on my feet
  solid leather  i think people in the 1800s used to wear those
best
  these are indeed pretty great boots
  nah youll fit in great with all the other girls in line at starbucks
i love these wear them almost every /out/ing would recommend
  i wear these for work its indoors so im not sure how they do in the snow
im finally able to start hiking again knee and foot surgeries kept me on my ass for a few years     my only decent boots were danner and i learned that my feet sweat like a whore in church and the gtx made it even worse    i tried on a pair of quest 4ds and like them but i cant tell if they dont make the nongtx forces anymore or if amazon listings are just retarded    what do
  i ended up buying these theyre comfy as heck ill report again after a couple of hikes
  thats because the dingus bought trail runners
  i dont even care theyre comfy as fuck
i have chippewas for working off trail in the woods would recommend for that use for non work applications id say a full leather 8inch boot is pretty overkill
  full leather milsurps mine are about 27cm/11 are great for stuff like gardening desu waterproof therefore nothings leaks in when youre in the muddy clay or stomping down the compost heap and also easy to clean just hose em off  at the same time you dont jam your toes like in gum boots because of no lacing/lack of stability  also do well enough for day hikes especially in shitty weather
  i need advice on this as well except im a size 5 to 5 1/2 in kids shoes im a petite person i can fit inside my own rucksack and finding any decent hiking gear in kids sizes is pretty difficult
can you hike in these
how are merrell moabs thinking about using them in for hiking and around snow
  yes but you would be better served in hiking boots unless your hike covers rocky second and third class or involves snow and ice
    id go with something else if your doing snow theyre very light boots and when i outfit people i try to avoid these granted they are easy to break in and quite comfortable theyre not gonna hold up as well as others
  try different socks you want thin wool socks    the 4ds are great if colder lowa hunter extreme evo stupid name or la sportiva nepal cubes have worked for me
  meh being eu485/us14 isnt much better often the specific line youre interested in ends at 46/47 or you pay 50 extra
  ah alrighty ive been looking at the danner mountain 600s are those any better   im painfully new to these types of shoes and im starting to wonder if its worth it
thinking of buying these g2g
  lowas in general run rather narrow from my experience and im not really a fatass 190m/82kg the zephyrs seem to be a somewhat lighter variant of the renegade so probably best in somewhat dry/warm climates
  im buying these for a warm/wet environment why would these be preferred for a dry environment they have goretex
  ive used those boots for the past 4 years just retired them and they worked great slightly thin but amazingly light the stiffness of the front of the shank will decrease over time as with all boots and the ankle support will go down with time but theyre still amazing boots i did some class 3 and 4 14ers in them and they worked great dont expect them to be super warm during winter especially if the outside gets wet and freezes but you should have other boots for that anyway
  probably not very waterproof for stepping in deep puddles/tall wet grass for extended periods but more breathable
  thanks for the input im in florida so cold weather isnt a concern for me i am worried mostly about keeping my feet dry from wet mud snakes and standing water also i heard these run small so i was going to order a size up
  should do fine one word of warning mine were oddly slippery on wet rock maybe they changed the sole though you may want some high wader boots or gaiters but idk i havent been in that environment much
  my issue is they just dont have the same quality as adult shoes seem to
  thats even worse of an issue if youre a bigfoot the area of the leather increases but not the thickness so theyll get progressively more prone to wear and tear as size increases it especially shows in my daily trainers  wearing them regularly they often fall apart after less than a year even when im not putting excessive stress/force on them its just that theyre designed/tested for the forces of tiny eu40 feet had one pair of trainers in 2006 that fell apart after 4 months girl i know size 38/39 or so has had the exact same model since then and still intact now
  i cant seem to find anything with a quality sole in my size theyre completely toast and feel awful halfway through a 45 mile hike its like they dont actually expect kids to be hiking in their hiking boots
  sorry about your baby ankles anon ill try to wait for you at the bottom of the canyon but no promises
  whites nfpa rated boots
  can rec danner mt adams
  based
no complaints after 2 years
  for example my work boots are a size 36 eu and technically arent even real work boots they just happen to be boots that fit
can someone breakdown trail shoes vs hiking boots i plan on hiking more and just use running shoes i do 10 miles tops
damn b getting into /out/ heaps lately but 90 of these boots are fuckin goofy couldnt pay me to wear them gonna have to pay aussie prices as well
  if youre putting a pack with weight and/or on a trail with roots and rocks big enough to roll your ankles then go with hiking boots if youre just doing a day hike and dont expect creek/muddy crossings or wet weather do trail shoes salomon ultra 3 leather gtx for a beefy example
  have you field tested these yet they look like something people would wear around campus not out in the woods
  what do u think of the lowa zephyrs anon been thinking about getting a pair of them
  jesus fuck are you an actual midget/dwarf
  not the same anon  but i personally love my zephyrs best long lasting comfort ive had in a pair of boots  the goretex keeps out everything except prolonged submersion in water  i wore them walking around a marsh for about 12 hours and they were still comfy even though my feet were soaked
tfw an eyelet on my haix broke off today after some light gardening  havent even had them for 2 years cost 200 and havent put more than maybe 300km on them screw them for outsourcing production to croatia hopefully some shoemaker in the area can fix it
  300km  i had close to no profile one the sole after one year of daily use never had anything break despite that those were made over ten years ago though
  bullshit i only wear boots for snow i primarily backpack in trailrunners my brother backpacks in cheap skate shoes ive hiked 2 miles crosscountry in crocs wear what youre comfortable in
  oh the army 05 model have that too for about 3 years maybe put 1000km so far on them and those are still fine just bought the ksk3000 for alpine hiking mostly because the regular 05s are a bit too slippery profile
  you do you booboo i like ankle support others like the flexibility more ive done plenty of hiking in flip flops but doesnt mean it was what id prefer to wear
  only sizes up to 45 available  fuck
  i hiked 10 miles on sunday in them they were pretty good
  you gotta understand these dont really flex its like walking in ski boots unless youve got crampons and snow in which case its incredible
  theyre actually 3/4 shank so they do have some flex at the toebox theyre quite stiff otherwise though
decent enough tread for wet rock   6 for muh ankles  non goretex non waterproof fuck off ill avoid water    wat boots fit this criteria
anyone got any recommendations for hunting boots something that will keep my feet toasty and warm while im sitting in a tree for five hours at 1040f
  asolo tps 535    hit it with some snoseal and condition and reseal every six months
  moonboots
  finding something that fits to ensure good circulation is going to be just as important as the warmth of the boot for an application like that you need to try on ones until you find one thats the bestthen break it in
month or 2 into some super rain forest and theyve been great so far get heavy after around 1k meters broke in basically instantly runs large     i had the 520 and i really liked them took awhile to break in
i just need cheap waterproof boots is hitec still the go to
ive given up on trying to buy boots im just going to wrap my feet in a mix of dried grass pine resin and moss
question unrelated to the op ive got a set of keens i cant remember off the top of my head what particular line they are but theyre soft toes sommilar to the detroits    so they like to stick to concrete like all the dots on the bottom are acting like suction cups but its literally the only material that they do this to anyone have any ideas why
im looking for some good hiking boots preferably durable comfy waterproof and 6in shaft id also like for them to be at least somewhat /fa/ like maybe a full leather upper any recommendations
  same poster id get some danner raptor 650s but i want an all season boot and they look to warm for the warmer months
  your mom likes a 6in shaft
  you gots a problem with all leather boots or larping 1800s camping
  if you have a buddy in the marines they should be able to pick you a pair up either in a px or on their gear website

reliable 46 and 4x4 gets me through some rough terrain and dont care if i scratch it up parts are cheap and plentiful but could go for some more power
gets me around but will be looking for a 4x4 soon
what can i do to make this more outworthy out    havent really had experience with car mods before
  its probably fine as it is but you can get a full size spare wheel and 5x of the biggest all terrain tires that will fit and a skid plate that mounts under the oil pan primitive racing and lp aventure both make some

  fi tech and 343 gears i get 1516 mpg     that was my biggest issue i had with it when i first got it so i took out the 410 and put in 343 and took off the quadrajet
  yeah those gears will do that gj man    i hauled too much shit over too crappy a terrain horse trailers to ditch the low gearing well that and i was too poor to really afford to do it  there is no kind of stuck that sucks quite as bad as being buried to the frame on a clay and flint chip 2track in a torrential downpour with a full 9horse trailer  there isnt a winch alive that could have gotten me out of that i walked out came back an hour later in a different truck offloaded the horses and came back for the truck 3 days later with a tractor 30 feet of 2x10 3 other dudes and a dozen bottle jacks and it still took the 4 of us almost 2 hours of digging with shovels to get it out

  truth im getting a mini camping and trail riding trip together with a buddy of mine hes wanting to get into that kinda thing so i figured id take him on a light trip to break him in   feels good man    anything /out/ in ur near future my man
  id love a diesel one of these
  i like your style anon   old man emu shocks and steering   arb bumper  4x4 labs rock sliders  new radiator and other shit  bought for 5000 prob spent 800 so far on it for the new stuff
/o/ut/ is all im here for
  noice debating getting rid of the lpg tanks to put rock sliders on but then theres no rocks here to have fun like  gonna have to go on a trip to find them i have to downgrade my lift soon because of new laws coming in and was considering old man emu no complaints
it gets me to camps and trailheads good enough and the turbo makes pavement fun too dont have any delusions of it being as good as a 4x4 offroad but i didnt buy it to go mudding or crawling

  1kz or 5l
  wheelbase is sooo long though haha
  last of the 5l pump diesels before the 5le  would like the extra power of the turbo 1kz on hills but meh i still get there the only time i badly wanted turbo was in sand dunes but i rarely do that
  does your boyfriend like it
  ive got a coworker with the same sort of gen hilux but with a 1kz in it if rather have the 5l over the 1kz ive heard the 1kz are bad for cracking heads and are very heat sensitive
  ive had mine working hard in deep sand in blazing heat and the temp gauge was not moving those old jap drivetrains just dont leak overheat or blowup i wish they still made them to that standard instead of prioritising comfort driveability and anti pollution crap
  this vehicle has the bumpiest ride almost like riding on a horse drawn wagon ive never been in a vehicle with a worse suspension

  holy shit i wish we had these in the us that thing is awesome
  i used to work in a camp in maine and my buddy had a 2500 suburban  we would take it out on logging trails with just street tires and it was surprisingly cabable i enjoyed it it just sucked that it cost almost 200 ti fill up
  if an 89 year old grandma wearing a shawl she knitted was a truck this would be it
  200 to fill it up wtf are you talking about i dont spend half that
  ive got a 38 gallon tank and dont spend that what third world shit hole are you in
  maine  okay i dont live there but if hes got a 3040 gallon tank i know a few years of the suburban shipped with a 34 gallon tank coupled with the 4/gal gas the northeast had for like 5 years straight its possible
  lightbar mounted on top of bullbar    check your state laws mate cops are cracking down on that shit everywhere bro in law got done a while back for having rod holders on his bullbar 680 apparently in sa apart from antennas with as spring base nothing can protrude vertically or horizontally from your bullbar for pedestrians sake like getting hit by a bullbar alone wont fuck someone up sick ride though
baja bug for out stuff
  looks like hiltons at yalata
  broadly similar to you just come back from a couple of weeks up the cape
  ive never been pulled over since ive owned it and i pass highway patrol fairly often and never had a problem      i think this was at the 42 mile crossing
  4 gal x 38 gal tank  152 still not close to 200 if the tank was bone dry and gas was still as high as 2008 just sayin
  how hard is the telegraph track are there easy routes around all the obstacles     what are the flys like must be pretty bad since youre always near the water
my money pit
  some nice street tires on that thing 
  ive got two sets of wheels my dude 70 on road use so i figured it made sense to invest in the second set plus the street tires get me most places in the dry seasons
  nah according to 4chan of you dont have mud tires 25/7 youre just larping
  whatever you larping fuck
  the tele track is fun but not too challenging except for palm creek and gunshot you actually dont lose aaaaaaall that much time compared to the dcs road because its quite a bit more direct we did a pretty quick and dirty trip this year so we didnt do the tele but these are general comments that are usually accurate season to season    gunshot you can bypass or theres usually a chickentrack  though not last year didnt go there this year i get why people like it but to me its just a vehiclefucker for no real reason    palm creek if its chewed out or wet can be a bit of a pain in the arse but if its in the dry at worst you just wait til someones coming the other direction and use each other to pull you up therell almost always be someone in two vehicles along before too long so you can drag each other up if its early or late in the season theres plenty of trees if you have a winch if not there are two crossings to choose between and youll have time to figure out a way up    nolanbrook and the deep hole between fruitbat and twin falls needs a bit of caution nolanbrook usually kills a few cars each year    flies can be a pain in the dick but outside of the wet season theres usually a breeze to blow the fuckers away theyre worse in some places than others campsites near townships and communities will be more flyprone than those a bit more remote youll want plenty of bushman for sandflies/midges anyway though  theyre not everywhere but if you get the wrong time on the wrong day you dont want them to ruin whats otherwise a nice place

  jelly havent been on any real demanding trips so far just camping at a few remote spots to go fishing for a few days did you take your towball off yourself im stumped as to why mine wont come out if i remove the pin and bash it with a rubber mallet it moves slightly side to side but refuses to come out      same here depends where you live the local cops here dont care but the revenue raising wankers who come up from the city on holidays will no doubt bust your balls over it what state
  yeah i change between a ball and a treg coupling so i pull the gooseneck out semiregularly they do tend to fit quite well and are then able to bind with a bit of dirt or sand or whatever else so if you loosen it up with a few taps and keep working it itll come out try a bit of wd40 as well
  ive already spent a solid 2 hours wd40ing and bashing to no avail there is a welded bolt underneath that i really hope has nothing to do with it yours look anything like this
  this looks like a screenshot of some over the top japanese car ad
  have you tried heating the pin up with a plumbing torch
  the pin comes out did you mean the bolt/nut underneath im just stumped on whats stopping the hitch from sliding out might need to lower the spare tyre to get a better look from the back of it btw the 100/105 series had a recall for the shitty cables holding the spare tyres up underneath just breaking and dropping tyres all over you ever get it looked at/paperwork from previous owner that they got it fixed
  i dont have the welded bolt the old mans got a 100series as well ill see if his does i should be seeing him today or tomorrow    dad got the recall on the spare wheel but id forgotten that was a thing  ive never actually checked if it was done but the previous owner was pretty meticulous with servicing paperwork etc so ill go through the book and have a look  cheers for the reminder
  greatly appreciated if you can find out does yours even have a bolt i will never buy another car from a used car yard ever again because you dont know what the previous guy did and why they did it they did a shithouse roadside job repairing the front left axle seal disconnected the ac hose for the lpg system and fucked up the wiring for both aftermarket light switches among many things
  pretty sure thats not the bolt holding the tow ball    remove the pin above and pull it out
  just yank the split pin amd remove the bolt  then go to a secluded spot and wrap your recovery strap around a tree and your tow ball and drive it out

  do you even read      gonna take another look today after work otherwise i might have to try this      i was originally looking for an 80 holy fuck the boomer tax is real good luck finding one with less than 400000km for under 15k that isnt trashed
  depends where he is in maine you have to know that in these remote areas the nearest service station might be a two pump setup outside a general store and their prices are bound to be higher sometimes 2x to 3x higher than what you would get in a rural city centre     considering that you can either fill up at this little boutique place or drive another two hours to the local population center to get slightly cheaper gas then plently of peopel will happily pay the higher price     im just sayin that given this scenario it is not that unlikely to pay 200 to fill up a 40gallon tank

  welp hope the previous owner wasnt a goose and welded it in for shits and giggles it has been in the way of a few little hills and ruts being the lowest hanging part of the undercarriage      fellow sanon cops are cracking down on that shit here save yourself the hassle and move it or just avoid any roads on holidays bro in law got done by a motorcycle cop from adelaide last easter driving on back roads for his rod holder they even told him the cops here werent pulling their weight and they were specifically here to bust balls and get fines cunts
  that thing would go a million miles further than any pootrol they arent that popular and for a good reason

do you have question about sightseeing     im from osaka 大阪出身です
what are some /out/ things worth doing in japan     whats with that volcano island they dont let you do without a return ticket is that real
  well japan has some big forests and has some nice mountain areas as well look them up and go for it or check some shrines they are nice too check aokigahara or climb the fuji if you are in a good physical condition but be prepared for the cold and the rain you could easiky get hypothermia if you are not prepared enough
  people from osaka are retards ill wait for someone from a better city to ask advice from
are you allowed to wild camp in japan are rhere a lot of untouched areas with just nature
what do teenage japanese girl feet smell like
  you appear lost i believe you want  to properly jerk your ego off
  please dont come to yellowstone
  can i just wander the country side like zatoichi did  i just want to walk down dirt paths in between villages and buy onigiri and whatnot from roadside food stands
  this might be way out there for a regular trip but a friend of mine went on this pilgrimage called the 77 or something shrines of shikoku you hike around an island stay at temples and shrines and get enlightened or something takes more than a month apparently i wanted to do it but now im a felon/scum so i cant go anymore
  this sounds cool
  the hell kind of crime you have to do to get blackballed from a country
  if you go to prison you cant enter a lot of countries  us included
this is sn advertisement right
  canada wont let you into their country if youve ever had a dui
  not op but ive lived in japan 10 years its got lots of /out/ hard part is you usually need a car and to not live in tokyo/osaka to get to the good stuff   lots of good snowboarding hiking rock climbing surfing whitewater rafting and camping here       butthurt tokyofag detected
  butthurt that i dont live in the eternal special education classroom that is osaka yeah no
  it was retail theft and japan hates people that make mistakes like me i didnt go to jail and the felony was removed cause ive been a good boy but i still couldnt even visit just another reason to regret what i did
  never gave it much thought glad i didnt crime as a hobby i suppose       unless youre a brazilian tranny seems a bit odd rule      so where can you go
  i agree with you but youre retarded if you somehow think tokyos better than osaka   theyre both shit osaka was good 10 years ago but its like 60 chinese tourists now
  i actually learned to ski in japan on a school trip the exchange school we were with had an annual ski retreat that we got to tag along on i had no idea what i was doing and it took forever to get the basics as my japanese was trash and no one in my group spoke english still a great time and the mountain and snow were great wish i get the chance to go back some time in my life
  i have never met an above average intelligence person from osaka ever not even once in my entire life even when i am in the west i still encounter people from osaka and theyre still retards  this is an osaka hate thread now
  i can go to a lot of places no problem went on cruises through caribbean and south america and went to europe like another anon said it is country specific i am a us citizen and ive traveled to western countries but when i tried japan they denied me theres plenty of stuff in the western world though just mad that i wont see authentic weeb shit
  oh i am able to go to china but not russia apparently no interest in either though
    ive gotten a dui and been to canada several times
  maybe ten years ago m8

besides getting paid 50cent/hour and working a dead end job what else can one expect
  expect to learn spanish
  but i already know that anon
  the opportunity to spend your work day stoned listening to sleep at full blast in your headphones and the knowledge that you can quit your job any time without anyone batting an eyelid and be pretty sure to get hired fairly quick when youre back i work as a tree surgeon and its not a disimilar vibe i have plenty of buds who work as landscapers during their off season they have a blast stay in shape and just quit when they want to head /out/ for a while  50cent/hour  yikes maybe not they get paid ok here as long as you live simply
  sounds good now tell me the fucked up parts    yikes  i was meming but is little above the minimum wage around these parts i assume a tree surgeon is a far more qualified job and therefore better paid
i worked on a golf course a couple weeks and outdoors most my life its pretty good no one really bothers you as long as you do something and yeah minimum wage who cares if you get fired you probably ride a lot learn spanish occasionally do something
  no a tree surgeon gets paid more because it is a dangerous job
  better paid  yeah its higher paid than landscaping but the sort of work enviroment is similar   the fucked up parts  desu senpai the worst i have dealt with is the odd rude client and dog poo thats kind of it you can get some shitty companies wholl try and get you to work longer bla bla bla but if youre being paid by the hour and saving for a trip extra hours  extra money    you need a bunch of qualifications to work as a climber for a reputable firm in this part of the world but yeah they arent hard to get
  mandatory overtime up to 50ish hours a week working all the spring/summer holidays and getting harrassed by all the shittyowner dogs in the neighborhood if youre doing residential     i havent done it in years but i lucked into a company that only did business greenscapes other than long hours i was scheduled 52/wk and could basically work as many more as i wanted it was a pretty chill job mostly mowing some mulching and tree trimming relatively straightforward work we didnt really edge much which was nice i started at 050 over minimum wage and got a quarter an hour raise per month for the first year then a dollar a year after that by year 3 i was making good money and due to the high hours/overtime it was livable from the start
      thanks i very much appreciate the input famiglia i havent got the job yet but during the interview they told me i would likely have to work with a chainsaw and brushcutter for which i have absolutely no experience plus since i look like a bum they kinda complained that my hadji beard would get in the way and i would be shaving it within a week
  i made 14/hour as a gardener being in a tourist town working on expensive vacation homes and big mansions probably had something to do with that i think my boss charged clients 30 per manhourthese people wouldnt bat an eye at a 900 bill   its definitely a good job if you dont mind working in bad weather and getting filthy
  i did landscaping for the city i made 21 an hour  benefits youre gonna be in the elements a shit ton so dont skip on what ever gear you need for your neck of the woods make sure to drink a shit ton of water learn ever bit of equipment you can
  dont be a virgin gardener get into chad tree surgery double the pay double the fun double the workout and double the danger
  this guy gets it
  most job offers are for gardener havent seen one for tree surgery in ages at this point i just need to make some shekels
im a tree man myself thing is you can get work landscapeing or tree work in just about every major urban area in the world if you are good you will get payed accordingly i found we got better tips doing tree removals then landscaping
if you know horticulture and landscaping design you can be an independent yardman and charge a bunch more for your services and you can do it with a modest amount of equipment  you get paid for your knowledge as well as your labor     if you want to be a tree man you might want to work for a company who will cover injury expenses
gear that looks cool but you never really need

  sorry anon but this isnt the  gear that looks gay but you actually use  thread
  looks stupid and you never need it
  why the fuck would you want those
  bbut anon where im at they close the trails at winter unless you have crampons and an ice axe    even if i dont use it on a trip just having it has saved me from being ticketed a couple times when i have run into rangers
  this triggers /out/
  this 100  my friends carry fucking 200 3lb axes even on short hikes and the number of times they use them is so few i could count them on a hand and even on those occasions a knife couldve served the purpose fine     also adding knives to the list not all knives but ones that are 4 inches in blade length anything more than a folder is unnecessary
  its true you just snap deadwood and if its too big burn it in half
  i used to carry a bowie knife when i started going out shit got old really fast with it bumping into my leg and arm now i go long distance trails and still have yet to be in a situation where i needed a knife or hatchet

  larpin dis hard
  climbing protection  u stick it in a rock crack and hang from it or what
  well the goal is to not hang from it but yeah basically you put it in a crack or pocket which is what tricams excel at clip your rope to it and hopefully it holds if you pop off
  ahh cool thanks
  yeah but she gives a mean blowjob
    bad post    good post
  lmao at all the ninnies itt  just climb bro
  54 climbing grannies at crags all over north america are using very specialized pieces of protection  its a pretty standard bit of gear dude
  where its this looks like ricketts glen bit they dont close parks here in the winter
  how does it feel when this part cinches up on your testicles

  as long as its sized correctly for you it shouldnt be any less comfortable than having anons mom cradle them
  a knife
  thats the butt side of the harness
    the truth that hurts /out/      disagree i use a compass all the time      strongly disagree theres plety of activities where boots are absolutely necessary if you have ever walked outside of trails for longer distances with weight on your back then trailrunners wont cut it
  strongly disagree i carry heavy multiday packs full of climbing gear cross country in the sierra exclusively in trail runners the key is to get good beefy thick stiff soled trail runners not soft glorified street runners designed for people who think central park is /out/
  good eye it is ricketts glen anon  they close the falls trail in winter unless you have crampons and ice axe ive run into rangers patrolling the trails and they actually do check for gear and will ticket you if you dont have the right stuff    and there are parts where it is actually useful to have one since the steps ice over completely

  because this is a blue board we have to make do somehow

  grating like this fyi
  swedish log stovetop  designed in quebec  made in canada  ive never heard or seen them in sweden    exactly what is swedish about this

      its a bit like a danish the cakething here in denmark we call those wienerbread referring to germany and like that we also call those in the pics finnish torches language can be retarded like that

  i dunno out of your moms basement would be a good start
  go check out those islands at the north of canada  bet there isnt anyone up there   bring mittens
  if you need to ask then you dont have anywhere near the skills necessary to pull that off
how about your nearest park so when you realize how dumb you are you can backtrack
  a sturdy rope  to hang yourself with

  why do these threads always pop up you wont make it even if you were born in the wilderness and adapted it would still be the challenge of your life either stay in your moms basement or take 10 people with good experience with you and live like an 19th century cult or am i taking the bait

how difficult is this mountain really
lol like just keep walking up nigga
it is considered to be the easiest of all eighthousanders hence why it is often climbed as a steppingstone to more challenging 8000ers so i reckon it is not exceptionally hard that being said it is still a big mountain with its summit lying in the death zone so it comes with all the risks and dangers one would expect from a peak of such magnitude
    it is still an eight thousander  easy compared to other himalayan peaks but chances of you dying are much higher than nihil    also alpine style increases chances of death if youre not experienced
oc because /out/ likes /out/ pics
its got 1/3 of normal oxygen levels can you climb up a mountain with that amount of air with 40 pounds of gear
  what peak
  there is a way its called acclimatization
  is that the north ridge of everest
  no   pic related
  with oxygen bottles yeah
  did you climb any of the mountains
  im not the guy who posted the oc pic but to answer your question unfortunately not but i pray to god that i one day may do so
how hard do you lads reckon it would be to put together a tiny expedition  like a single sherpa to climb the mountain  it could be done pretty cheapy if you found a way
    no its the same as op cho oyu    more oc from cho oyu      only island peak not quite 8k      permits insurance equipment supplies and getting that all to bc and above is still going to turn out fairly costly
  how much did it cost altogether to climb island peak and how difficult was it
whats the difference between hiking and mountaineering  west buttress of denali isnt a climb but is certainly mountaineering  a boulder problem is a climb but some would argue isnt mountaineering    my opinion is that once youre doing something that a reasonable person would want technical gear for like crampons or rock shoes then it is mountaineering this includes higher angle winter hiking and even bouldering    thoughts
  when your goal is to reach the summit of a mountain and there are no paths leading to it then it is mountaineering in my opinion however mountaineering also encompasses hiking
  booked through an agency when we were in kathmandu haggled a bit in person i believe we paid 650usd per person  probably about as cheap as it gets off season in december two people one will cost more walked up to the last village before bc by ourselves without guide or porter took 7 days including 3 acclimatization days  count 2030usd per day mandatory guide permit etc included youll also need a plane ticket from kathmandu to lukla forgot exact price but its fixed at 160usd which is faster and cheaper than taking a bus but having to hike more than a week extra    so youre looking at 1000usd plus flight to nepal and back under ideal circumstances would consider hiring a porter next time though we did the whole three passes trek with me playing photography pack mule and i lost weight like crazy  6kg in 17 days    pic is close to ama dablam bc
  fpbp
  what constitutes a path
this thread reminded me of the worlds largest photo a ginormous mountain panorama    
  i meant a trail
  as for difficulty its a long climb at high altitude from bc to the summit and back so its tough but theres fixed ropes so not technically challenging one short near vertical climb of 5m one dodgy ladder over a yawning crevasse last climb is 45 wall of snow/ice then very short exposed ridge to the tiny summit  all with fixed ropes so pretty safe but for me at least that was a lot more fun than the rock scrambling up to the glacier
  which agency exactly
  so the climbing guide was just waiting for you at base camp odd that they provide their services at such short notice
  heian trek i believe we stayed in elbrus home hostel in kathmandu and the agency was ran by a cousin of an employee there plenty of agencies in thamel though      guide came to last village before bc  chukhung low season and they had a week to plan stuff while we hiked to said village met up with a contact wed been given in dingboche before the final trek to the final village to get all the info worked just fine    pic is lhotse from pangboche best lhotse views are en route to island peak bc though
thread theme   
  do you mean something relatively flat or would you count rocky class 2 with blazes and slabby stuff
  something that has been carved out either by a person or by multiple trips kinda like this is the sidewalk up the mountain a trodden path a dirt path pounded out by feet that youre following basically following something that someone else did is mostly hiking and mountaineering is making your own path a step above in terms of skill thats my opinion on the subject
    there is an entire district of kathmandu dedicated to tourism mostly trekking and mountaineering  tamel a lot of hostels hotels outdoors equipment  both proper expensive stuff as well as bootleg stuff with production on the spot  there are also a lot of these small agencies that offer to organize trips to various places rent transpot get guides etc  ive been there a couple of years ago when i went to annapurna circuit really interesting place but its getting really expensive due to tourists from western countries street vendors would try selling me fruit for more than it was worth in my northern european country  also a lot of offers to buy drugs dont do that unless you know what you are buying
  easiest  of the 8000m mountains  to put it in perspective cho oyu is basically the easiest of the hardest peaks on earth if we want to avoid getting into debates about how technical the climbing is and such    its really a big grey area hiking and mountaineering overlap and honestly mountaineering is just a type of hiking
just bought over 1200 dollars of gear to climb mount washington this season   father is refusing to let me go because people die doing it     now what am i supposed to do with 500 dollar neon yellow boots
  father is refusing to let me go because people die doing it   
  easier then shishapangma or manaslu
  he thinks ill die    every year some dip goes above the tree line while the mountain is the second coldest place on earth and dies
  mountaineering is about freedom and self expression just go in secret
  i gotta listen to daddy    tell him to fuck off
tfw australian  tfw the largest mountains are practically hills you can walk straight up
  why would you ever live in that shit hole country     no guns weird bugs animals and aboriginals
  youre supposed to be 18 to post here
  im 20
  i did my first summit on a tiny mountain in wa state and told my parents about it after over the phone borrowed and rented the gear i didnt already have i dont know what kind of relationship you have with your folks but i have learned to ask forgiveness rather than permission with these kinds of things its the only way i can get anything done that isnt graduating college or finding a job
  go with a friend    also when are you going theres a narrow window where its a lot safer to climb
  next weekend probably but im only going to the tree line this time so i can get a feel for the trail i dont have any crampons or a axe either so i plan to stay in the trees till then     also i dont have any friends that would want to in the winter or have the gear to climb
  then do what you want anon the world is your oyster
anyone here into ski mountaineering  looking to climb some peaks in the alberta/bc rockies this winter
  pic related shitty but only one i have  mt athabasca summit  silverhorn from north glacier
  go in the summer first and then go in the winter    do you have any experience with winter climbing    mt washington can get dangerous in the winter
  ive gone up a bunch in the summer im very aware of the dangers risks and rapid changing weather to the extreme
  mt washington  i dont have any crampons or a axe  bro you gonna die    just bought over 1200 dollars of gear  wtf did you spend your money on then instead
  boots pants jacket mid layer base layer trekking poles gloves ect
  no snowshoes crampons microspikes ice axe  anon i  those better be some real nice boots
  did i say i wasnt going to buy that stuff or didnt need them
alright mount washington guy again just got some gators ill get a pair of crampons soon before i go    do i really need a axe if im not going above the tree line this time
  it all depends on you does your route involve steep inclinations in 1924 edward norton reached an altitude of 8570 meters on everest without any proper crampons
  still in the trees     fuuuucccckkkkk guess i need a axe
  yes you do get a walking axe like the bd raven lions head is the normal winter route and requires an axe and there are some snow slopes with questionable runout practice selfarresting though
  keep in mind as long as you actually stay in the trees youre very unlikely to nees to self arrest if you are clumsy enough to slip
anyone else prefer ice tools like nomics to an ice axe like the raven when going out to areas that have steeper snow/alpineice i dont have much experience but it seems like the flexibility of it would be nice especially with throwing an adze on
  thats what things like the sumtec are for theyre long hybrid tools with a sliding guard to make for better high and low dagger positions
  all ice axes shorter than 60 cm are considered technical ice tools
  depends do you think you can you climb this without ice axe  
  its realy easy  ground give up under your feets as you go  give up and die from cold
could i use this for mount washington     
  50 cm  too short
  i can get it in 60cm and its the closest to my budget
  get a secondhand one    
  just get the regular one 20 off also means its like 55   since you havent owned one up to this point youre not going to be able to appreciate paying 50 more for the fancier one
  ok i have a 10 dollar off coupon too
    just buy or rent a satellite beacon like garmin inreach mini or spot gen 3 so that your dad knows where you are    mount washington    which one the one in nh    62882 ft    babbys first mountain
  post your climbs bud
    ive climbed your moms mons pubis multiple times
  confirmed for gumby thats some class 1 shit low commitment rating too
what do you lads think of k2   personally it is the most badass mountain in existence  extreme isolation   extreme technical difficulty   extreme height
  recently read the book about wilco van rooijens adventure on the mountain   i know all 8000ers are extreme but damn they dont call it the savage mountain for nothing
should i put crampons over my gators or gators over my crampons
  if theyre actual crampons youll have to put them on over your gaiters because of the instep bar
  overrated k7 on the contrary has only been summited once
  500 dollar neon yellow boots  new  boot   goofin
  that actually looks terrifying
mountain washington guy again how are these black diamond cyborgs for general mountaineering i was looking into ive climbing also    i can get these for 90 bucks new btw
  i would say mountaineering is anything you need technical skills and equipment to do
  pretty damn good deal if youre only paying 90 for them  make sure your boots accepts the type of binding though
  what this guy said    frankly i dont think youd be that sketched out without an ice axe but crampons are very helpful     the most dangerous part about mt washington is the weather iirc
  many a mountain doesnt require any special technical skills and the need of equipment is always relative
  theyre going to be overly stiff heavy and technical but for that price id say yes
  walking in crampons is considered a technical skill
  mount washington has some real sketchy terrain i wouldnt recommend anyone go to the presidentials in winter without crampons and an axe
  i dont think its been summited only once are you sure any sources you have would be welcome i know 2 of the 3 guys who did the fa on the east face in 2012 are now dead 
  walking in crampons is considered a technical skill  wut unless you mean vertical incline crampons    is walking in snowshoes a technical skill as well then
  i made a mistake the pic i posted is k6 and not k7 k6 has been only been summited once in 1970 as for k7 the first ascent was apparently in 1982 and in 2011 the third overall succesful ascent took place you already mentioned the east face ascent in 2012 i read about hayden kennedy and kyle dempster as the saying goes whom the gods love die young
  thanks for the info  kyles blog was quite interesting to read its still up i think
  based paddy died saving gooks
  french technique is definitely something that requires a bit of a primer
  based paddy indeed   i dont think it counts as saving if they still die though
  typically you want horizontal front spikes for nonclimbing applications but go for it they should work fine
  pretty brutal mountain  there have been multiple instances where higher up on the mountain the weather gets bad someone gets lost then the rest of the climbers get lower down only to find shredded clothing and massive quantities of blood in a trail down the mountain  people get lost then fall off the face and get absolutely shredded to bits on the rocks  pretty much all the mountains in the karakorum are phenomenal looking
mount washington guy again went yesterday
  weather permitting planning to go next weekend up the ammonoosac trail is the lion head winter route open
  quit being a bitch if he throws that youre a man now huh just try to reason with him about how much you spent on the gear tell him your detailed plans establish a middleground like taking community medical classes or something of the sorts and talk to him about constant communications and make sure he knows you can find a way to and from safely wherever youre going  its like you dont use your brain you know
    oh i see you were just being a rich little baby wanting you attention  excuse my being mean but do take from it the rhetoric
    fuck off im not rich and i dont want attention
  looks pretty comfy which route did you take and how far did you go up  did you make it to lions head
  i dont think it was      i went via tuckerman ravine just went a littl ways past the hermit lakes hut
  wow he looked incredibly young in american history x to say that he was mountaineering some 80 years before
  thread
i read that self arresting is kind of a noob memes because the only slopes youll fall on once youre experienced you wont be able to self arrest on
    some plebbit nonsense at /r/alpinism/comments/8qrmte/has_anyone_successfully_selfarrested/
  i wouldnt call myself particularly experienced but i was caught off guard by a passing jet while on a very steep slope last winter and fell about 2m before arresting wasnt lifethreatening but probably wouldve been injured i can imagine something similar could happen on any similar slope regardless of your experience level
  roping up on steep slopes is an even bigger meme
arcteryx alpha sl glove or rab alpine glove
  bit scary desu
  or stormtracker
    thread themes    
  
  i got the alpha ar its a great balance between warmth and dexterity while having waterproofness if you prefer thinner ones id still try to find goretex my thin ice climbing gloves dont have it and water off an ice fall is cold even if it is 40f out no shit sherlock but still ive heard great things about the punishers though
    hard to fathom great pic
dumping a few useful links from mountaineering classes   student handbook   daypack gear list   overnight gear list 
  nearly 500 for a day hike in the whites  not even in the presis
  cant you read its an advanced day hike
  how do i get into mountaineering  i have this unexplainable desire inside to climb a mountain i dont know where it came from but seemingly from one day to another it just is there i need to get out there and do it i dont know why but for some reason i feel like i will find an answer to a question i havent asked yet on the top    what do i need where do i start  where do i get information  how do i prepare  can i go alone 
  from someone whos just getting into it you have to do this slowly its one of the most likely to kill you hobbies there is get freedom of the hills and read through it and continue to use it as a reference guide doing class 2 3 4 hiking is a good way to start to get a taste of mountaineering its good to have rock and ice climbing experience as well as selfarrest practice with axe proper use of crampons avalanche assessment aiare training glacier/crevasse rescue and roped team work from there youve got the fundamentals to continue on your own with a team    where are you located what nearby mountain ranges do you have
  mountaineering or climb up a well established path up a mountain with every other fat slob on instagram
  i live in bavaria so pretty much a shitton of mountains not too terribly far away zugspitze is like a 15h drive from where i live i live in munich and sometimes i am at my parents place which is somewhat close to salzburg austria so the options should be pretty good i guess    thanks for the advice did you do your first ascent already  which mountain did you choose and why 
  im in colorado us ive done some class 4 stuff ice climbing and rock climbing im wanting to do some of the 14k 43km mountains here during winter but shit goes from oh this mountain is a super easy 14er to holy fuck im dragging my balls on a knife edge of a mountain capitol peak pretty quick    just make sure you have good boots those are really important
  most likely the latter
  disregard everything the yank said as a rule they tend to be obsessed with training courses leadership skills risk management etc go out there and get a feel for the mountains yourself start slow and easy and advance to more challenging hills as you grow more experienced and confident dont let people talk you out of going out on your own keep your wits about you dont do things you arent comfortable with know your limits be aware of the risks but dont obsess over them neither because no right way is easy in this rough world and we must risk our lives to save them and above all enjoy yourself
  ahahaha and i thought the appalachian money club was bad
  my only point in not going solo was to not go unexperienced on glaciated areas that run crevasse risks you illiterate yellowtoothed cunt
  why are you so upset yankie
  ueli steck climbed that in 2 hours
    whats crazy about these images is you know a 2d photograph cannot possibly do justice to the mountains even in a place like colorado cant imagine standing where these photos were taken and feeling that experience
  one day id like to stand on that central rongbuk glacier and behold the magnificent sight that is the everest north face too bad ill probably have to mandatorily employ the services of a chinese communst party approved tour company
  agree seems like you can barely see the mountain from the south in the photos ive seen i think those chinese guides cant be too bad they need the tourist dollars
  lol not really all in good fun limey
  literally every mountain and mountaineer could be boiled down into well established path up a mountain with every other fat slob on instagram    i hate this neo elitism that plagues a lot of people in this profession         are they supposed to train people for free it seems a little steep but seriously everyone starts somewhere
  to be honest part of the reason mountaineering was more appealing to me than rock climbing was the people seemed a lot more friendly and less egotistic than rock climbing at least at the novice/mediocre skill area granted this is 4chins and i dont take it as a representation of the community at large    until im comfortable with picking my own routes through snowy ice and loose rock formations ill stick with the more established ones
just ordered a pair because what the hell at this price keep them as a backup or loaner for friends     
  500 dollars for a day hike is an outragously steep price besides what are they going to teach how to put one leg in front of the other its a gimmick for clueless and/or gullible people under the guise of safety
  yeah i know for 500 bucks these guys will teach you a lot more         and if you just want the basics ice fest has 2 different introduction day classes that are around 175    you do need to take a class
  you do need to take a class  thats where you lost me mountaineering is all about freedom for me i dont need someone to tell me what i should do and when i should be able to do it but if thats your thing by all means knock yourself out
  the courses are just opportunities to learn and practice skills that help you stay out of trouble or get out of trouble once youre in it no one is regulating things and saying you have to do anything if youve learned from someone great others dont necessarily have someone to take them under their wing if youre going to solo rainier/baker or do glacier traverse without knowledge or practice on that whatre your plans if shit goes bad
      this is reasonable any activity that falls above the defined treeline with crampons climbing axe and at least some minimal scrambling i would consider mountaining
  just walk back down
  shit like this makes it seem like youve never even gone on a hike before
  hes right though    because hiking in the whites equals to climbing eightthousanders
how good of shape should you be in to climb some of these baby mountains was thinking about getting into it with a friend im not fat but my summer physique has faded somewhat
  regular shape will do just fine
  kek
  its people like you that die up there
  extremely experienced people die up there
  you sure about that mr daddy wont let me go be a man
  if anything you seem to be the one that wants attention
aint no mountaineer myself but david lama has this sweet short film with conrad anker trying to do the first ascent of lunag ri pretty sweet he recently did it solo thought some of you may be interested
  his annnapurna 3 video is great
what peak are you all aiming for right now what are your plans for the future
  two things you want to look at    trail class 1 2 3 4  1 is easiest and just a walk  elevation gain  how much gain can you do in day are you used to air at 10000 ft  time of year  weather is a lot easier int he summer for most peaks
      to expand on that what would the ideal body for mountaineering be  i weight a bit over 200lbs and am a pretty strong guy i guess being a big guy is a disadvantage right 
  mountaineers are primarily endurance athletes training for the new alpinism is a great resource
  look into couch to 5k  will build your endurance to increase your stamina for the long hike uphill
    where i live it is somewhat cold nowadays so today i put on a hoodie and went outside i ran up and down some stairs at a local hill i never thought it would be this hard that shit really kicked my ass right in this moment i cant even imagine summiting a huge mountain when a few flights of stairs are already fucking me up this bad
  dont run just have a steady walking pace     its an endurance game try to walk up and down a flight of stairs for an hour and see how it feels     and youll have to be carrying a day pack full of gear/water    good news is you have a few months before the summer hits for clear mountaineering weather
  i live in europe what do you think a good beginner mountain is  can someone in decent shape summit mountains like the zugspitze as a first try or is that pushing it 
    19 km trail and 7500 ft elevation gain is tough for a beginner     youre going to want to look for a class 1 trail that lasts 812 hours 1215 km round trip for a beginner
i want to get into mountaineering but i dont really feel like falling to my death what can i do to learn the skills needed to safely start climbing
  sign up for a mountaineering class at the nearest mountaineering club or outdoor rec store
  thanks for the advice since i live reasonably close to the alps there should be more than enough options for easier summits around
  ive literally backpacked over 430000 feet of elevation change this calendar year and havent taken a single fucking class   anon is right its a scam get some gear and go the only way to learn is to do read some shit on the internet not 4chins and then practice it on the weekends
  runs up some stairs  winded already  never gonna make it
any of you fags actually summit an 8k
  lol only a couple of thousand people have ever stood on the summit of an eightthousander
  its people like you that die every year
  where do you live desu seattle area
  backpacking is a far cry from mountaineering do you even climb
  is this something im supposed to respond to i dont see your point      yea east side      with ropes and shit no do i climb mountains absolutely 430000 feet of elevation change over a 1000 miles comes out to about 500 feet per mile
  unequivocally based anon  double happy however is the man to whom lofty mountaintops are within reach
  20 year old cant make his own decisions yet  hahaha did he also buy your gear anon are you some kind of poor neet
  be nice how would you feel if that was your retarded son being mocked on the internet    pretending youll ever have kids
ive been looking to get some sort of night vision device for an upcoming trip but as ive been looking around i realize that good ones can go for 3000 i figure this would be a good board to come to because im sure people hunt at night i was thinking about getting a monocular because i dont really think i need anything with magnification   are the cheaper ones worth it or should i just spend the money on something good also any difference in clarity between the green and white night vision
  if you do not need magnification then even just a gen 1 with a cheap ir light will be more than enough and under 300
  buy once cry once cheaper models work but the picture quality is complete shit
  avoid gen 1 like the black plague gen 2 or 2 is sufficient for most people just make sure you have a ir light to attach to your helment if you dont mind used check instagram for good deals on built units from small companies like highendarms then you can find quality accessories from gucci milsurp from users like hello ship to ital and mr raid rod    if youre poor and have to have nods on the cheap the armasight spark isnt bad but its also isnt good edge distortion fish eye effect and needs a ir light for dark rooms but it does work    one thing to notice is the lp thats the resolution of the tube higher the lp the more brighter 77 lp is what most good gen 3 units are so if you do go gen 2 check the specs so youll know what youre getting     id recommend getting a gen 2  from armasight like the sirius or atn night spirit with 1x magnification around a grand in cost if you like what you get then later buy another one and a bridge mount to give you binos for around 2400 with bnvd type bridge
  i have a gen 1 nv riflescope its worthless cant make out anything past like 50 yards if that with any real definition at that point youre better off just adjusting your eyes to the darkness because i shit you not i can see better with my naked eye than i can with that piece of shit
  its been my experience that the naked eye is usually better than gen1 even when paired with a good ir light    some gen2 stuff is usable for navigation especially paired with an ir light but still borderline useless in no light or extremely low light situations and youre not making anything out past a couple hundred feet the resolution just isnt good enough    gen3/3 is where its at yeah its expensive if you really want nv its worth it    monocularweapon mountbinocularhandheld youll want a helmet to mount it to the head harnesses earned their nickname of skullcrusher youre also gonna want a ballast pack mounted in back to help with neck strain bump helmets are fine but get one with good suspension
i appreciate all the good information ive been trying to do my research and it seems like avoiding gen 1 is the general consensus i might just go with the gen 3 or a good gen 2 and lend it out to family since they spend more time outdoors than i do now i know a lot of people are saying to get a mount but is there any reason why i wouldnt be able to get away with just using it as needed by holding it up to my eye and going like that
  third gen or bust    gotta spend more than 1k for anything thats not a glorified spy kids toy
infrared is best imo everything else costs thousands
anyone know where i can find discount snowblades/skiboards and boots
  ski swap meets every ski town has one
  what is a ski swap meet
  craigslist in the summertime
  people bring their old/unused ski gear in it gets priced and tagged with a number and is sold on consignment theyre usually run by the local ski shop and/or a local charity/nonprofit  another way to get discounted ski gear is to shop clearance websites like steep and cheap manufacturers crank out new models every year so theres always a surplus of last years stuff on sale
  dude steep and cheap is crazy expensive
  swap meets  recycle shop or second hand shop near a ski town  facebook buy and sell at start/end of season
so having moved to a colder climate i was looking for a wool blanket or two to keep me warm after looking all over locally i found some randomly at harbor freight usa advertised as moving blankets and for 11 bucks  they are 80 wool 20 poly though but i layered a few up and they keep me very warm at night    i hope i help anyone in need of some wool
  how itchy are they
  11 wool blanket  cmon anon you already know the answer
  very
i have one    its very warm and kinda itchy on bare skin  so far the best use ive made of it is to line the floor of my tent virtually eliminates any cold from the ground   i keep it in my truck its been handy for all sorts of things  if youre looking for more of just a simple blanket that you can pack around this aint it its heavy and bulky id recommend a coleman fleece sleeping bag liner for weight and versatility    pic related was when i experimented with packing it didnt last long
  i hope i help anyone in need of some wool  any suggestions for affordable wool buttonup shirts
  i pretty much only use wool blankets ive got several surplus blankets from armies and disaster controll my overall favourite is the bw sanitation blanket its huge 2x210 meters and thick weighs over 3kg though then theres thenorwegian wool blanketnowadays hard to gwlet but light and good every one oftheseblanket was itchy in the beginning but after a while of use it gets plushy and comfy now i like the texturemore than normal blankets   70 wool is completely ok if the rest is not out of cotton the polish surplus blanket forinstance is super thick but 50/50 wool cotton therefore its super comfy and warm but just as long as you dobt get it wet or damp
  no such thing
  buy the blankets in the op  sew your own from them    have fun with your new ultra comfy shirts
  funny isnt it wool shirt used to be omnipresent back in the old day and now they have designertier prices    i wish i had those skills
  survivalist and bushcrafters have been talk about these for years they are itchy and stink untill the wash them in woolit 10 times they are also about as good of a quality as you can expect for the price
  hit up goodwills found a 200 brand new seudepatched elbow pendleton shirt at a goodwill outlet for like 067 probably my best find ever have found about 4 more pendletons for similar prices but not as pristine as the afore mentioned one
  ill probably try my luck on ebay for now i just find it so odd how much of an exclusive clothing item they have become outdoor brands pump out the most advanced synthetic thoroughly researched materials every year but god help you if you want a simple wool buttonup
  no shit
  not op but they are cactus level itchy just use a bed sheet to keep yourself from touching it in fact if you can sew you can sew it up in a bed sheet pouch to keep it nonitchy at all times just make one section button up basically you make a pillow case for them if theres problems with them shifting just knot them like a knotted comforter/quilt that isnt quilted      lots of people do that with those      i wish i had those skills    you are one youtube vid away from attaining them
  here    
  that site sucks
  t poorfag    enjoy harbor fright
  that site doesnt even offer shirts
  has nothing to do with finances their wares are shit and far from /out/ clothing did you forget where youre at again
  i wear every day clothing innawoods im not sure what your problem is
  christ ya dont get itthe original post that the site replied to was talking about button up wool shirts not fuckin mick sweaters dont know about you but when im innawoods i wear pendleton and filson not grandpa paddy shit
  mick sweaters
    
  everything this anon says is true
  you can actually sow collared shirts
  i dont actually know anything about it anon
  sowing is for seeds sewing is for needles
you can also get them for free with any purchase if youre subscribed for the harber freight coupons which is free the free wool moving blanket coupons come in for me about every month or so and you could literally just buy a 100 tool and get the blanket along with it
  good tip anon
  mfw at these prices it is not real wool but shaved turks
always check the tag  boycott british wool my 4chan friends you know where it comes from the malvinas they export thousands of tons of wool a year
  rent free
  either get lucky at a secondhand store or troll for vintage euro milsurp on the internet i know the swiss and austrians used wool duty shirts through at least the 70s
  i have a bunch of these from moving and hauling crap they actually make pretty good template for sewing wool clothing i got a cloak poncho thingy that i made thats pretty convenient go to walmart or hobby lobby in the fabric section and you can find pattern kits for capote like jackets and ponchos    op check facebook sales also i got a 6 point hudsonbay blanket for 15 off there
  alpine milsurp us korea shirts etc
  malvinas     theres no such place the falkland islands however produce excellent wool
  dude op fucking thank you    im prepping for a long drive through some serious winter conditions and the only 100 wool i could find was running about 150200 for a blanket at 80 having a few of these in my car is close enough for any emergency scenario    one suggestion with itchiness is to throw it in your washer with cold water then throw it in the dryer on tumble dry no heat with a few pieces of fabric softener after a couple washes it should soften out the wool considerably
  i found a wool lined coat from the 60s or 70s at mine it was like new but musty after i got it dry cleaned i wore it for a few years then donated it  one of many regretful decisions i made after in my 20s    sort of like pic related
new englandfag here    i have a couple really expensive hudson bay wool blankets and a cheap 25 amazon 80/20 wool blanket that i bought on a whim last year i dont feel a significant difference in warmth between the 2 i heat my house with a wood stove and im terrible running it so i frequently test this out     just something to consider
  think of it like creole food its good until you know whats in it    dont ask be happy
  thousands of tons  thats like 001 of all brit wool
  thats a handsome jacket anon i feel your pain
what mess kit does /out/ use  this is a wwii bulgarian mess kit that i use sometimes
  but most of the time i use this dyi one which nestles in eachother and fits in backpack side pockets better
  i had made a lid for the cup aswell but its hiding somewhere
  i have an old swedish canteen that works really well  my cook kit is separate and consists of a stanley adventure cook set a metal nesting cup and an old trangia
  cook kit  not my pic but might as well be me
wwii mess kit who told you that really curious i got a identical one from my dad not a wwii veteran and its useful but i always thought its more recent
trangia anodized
  i shouldve said supposedly    this in the overview sais its from the 1970s however this one   doesnt say its a ww2 one but it sais its from the 1940s and i cant find any other info besides this so i think maybe 1970s was a typoit does however look like a soviet vdv mess kit picrel me being bulgarian i say the commies stole our design updated it abit by adding the hanging thing on the big cup the reason why they are relatively rare i beleive is due to lack of resources in ww2 and also if they were invented by the soviets we here wouldve also mass produced them   but thats just a theory a canteen theory
    update  ive been doing some more research and it turns out its a civilian version of the vdv one  
  have the exact vdv one got as a gift some time ago but didnt bother to boil cosmoline/solidol off what is the best way to do it   i can post pictures if anyone is interested
czech kit has two sweet pots
whoa where can i get one of these vdv kits
  these look more like flasks than canteen what volum of water can it contain  maybe they look small because soldiers carried two at a time or maybe they dont need 1l containment because they live in snow country with many river/lake
  its a 1 liter  i have a 2 liter bladder in my pack too but thats the one i use while hiking in
are these kits any good 
  forgot the picture
what are some classic mess kits to keep an eye out for in the good ol us 
  no because  1 you dont need no fucking kettle  2 that plastic insulation on the pots will burn out also this type of handle isnt very stable  3 its too big for one person  4 that nonsticky teflon will wear out very fast since you will use metal tools to prepare dishes  5 the cups dont have covers youd want a cover on your tea cup trust me   6 fork knife spoon  that compactness comes at a price they are heavier than regular cutlery had them and you will have a knife anyway also not that comfortable    later ill post my set in which youll see the best cutlery set ever have a nice day
  i didnt even think about the teflon coating thanks anon i dont want to black out while cooking
    hmm seems like options for easily and cheaply available mess kits are few and far between
  why not build your own ill post pic later  also i can recommend this one but i rarely use it  its for longer trips or when more than 1 people come    pic related is a modern version of legendary czechoslovakian scout/tourist set ware very popular in the entire eastern block back in the day theres also a plierslike grip that lets you use the cover as frying pan sold separately now i guess  more modern versions are made from steel instead of aluminum     but if you only plan on cooking tea/coffe/soups/borsch youll do perfectly fine with the good old germanstyle copied worldwide mess kit  i fucking lost mine i have to find it    our finish friend describes it  
i got this last year a a gift and its pretty nice     its just a basic 6 potpanplate set but it all has copper bottoms for even cooking   im really liking it and its only like 15
      yeah they are decent    the kettle is super useful so you can have boiling water without cleaning out your food covered pot     maybe try to get a pot with a bail on it so you can cook over a fire but apart from that its fine    its the perfect size for cooking for 2 people because who does not go camping with friends    its not teflon its anodized al its fine     the cutlery and cups are shitty but you get what you payfor
  looking at options it seems like a good pot with a bail gets in where the only good option is to pony up for titanium cookware that brings it up to 35 for a 750ml pot and a 450ml cup set
for me its the diy bot
i have a knife and a canteen
hey /out anybody use or make their own hiking sticks got a branch of weathered purple heart harder than oak not sure how to make it aesthetic   tldr show off your hiking sticks
  carve into a phallic shape  sand to 320 grit  2 coats boiled lindseed oil  allow to cure 7 days  8 coats of tung oil not tung oil finish actual tung oil  allow to cure 1 month    profit
  thanks
  tung oil  blo    dont shove in ass without a condom
i just pick up a stick from the floor in the woods and throw it away when im done hiking but i guess you can make it facny
  tung oil actually dries unlike blo its also fairly waterproof so if op wanted to buttfuck himself with it he should be good to go assuming it has fully cured
  both tung and blo oxidize to cure they dont dry it is a curing process either is unhealthy to use in that manner like really unhealthy for the same reason you never use either on eating utensils
  dont forget to add a ferule to the end
  pshhhhhhhhhh
  i like the pic very boyscout tier
  tung oil isnt unhealthy in the least you know nothing drying in this sense refers to the touch im aware of the chemical process behind it thanks for the mostly incorrect and needlessly haughty response
  youve been shoving tungcoated wooden dildos up your ass that youve whittled at camp havent you i knew you were being too defensive
  hhow did you know
do i have to take the bark off or can i cure it with it on i dont want any moisture cracks
  seasoning is done slowly wax the ends and leave the bark on     
  nice what kind of wood is that
  shouldnt it be purple on the inside
  sissy sticks
  a sissy stick is a stick someone uses to hold up a piece of log in order to strike it with a hatchet people who dont use one typically get cut or worse it is typically innawoods 101 that your father should have taught you
  smaller diameter limbs and saplings tend to not have very large heartwood if any at all they are more apt to still have a pith core at that size the larger tree with thick trunks are what will have the signature color heart
  that would be a good starting point for one of these pic related  
  find a good hardwood
  my father is an avid indoorsman
  well if you want to get gud and teach your son properly youll need to learn how to sissy stick and contact split
  ill do my best to learn sissy sticking
itt post wildflowers youve seen and photographed while /out/ ask for help with ids share wildflower stories tips for finding flowers and photographing them etc post your flowers    pic related some poppies and other flowers i saw during the big spring 2017 bloom
the following are some species i saw in the deserts of southern california can anyone identify these
this one was really small
beavertail cactus in bloom
all ive got for now thanks for looking please share some of your own pics
looks like a southwestern state arizona
  various places in california sierra foothills antelope valley socal sonoran desert the deserts of socal and arizona are pretty similar in terms of plant life though
  looks kinda like sea lavender
  its definitely a type of lupine not sure which one though maybe silvery lupine
  neat
  what is that
  dessert mallow of sorts love eating them leaves      some sorta pitcher sage idk not true salvia sp but lepechia species
  burdock
    it is a type of thistle not burdock
took this out west but im from wisconsin anybody got an id for me ive been curious
  the big purple guy looks like lupine
  that looks like an azalea
  it looks like rhododendron maximum great laurel however my catalog says only lapland rosebay is native to wisconsin
  it could be an escaped garden plant may not even be great laurel which is a lighter pink and isnt fringed
theirs an app called snapplant that ids wildflowers i use it all the time
  cool im gonna download it now heres a pic of a columbine
while searching my library for photos for this thread i found out google photos search function is actually smart enough to identify some flowers    pretty cool desu
i believe its indian paintbrush with a few daisies
  just use inaturalist
heres some nightshade
i like flowers
replacing the wooden handle every now and then
    da fuck am i looking at
  looks like a wrist breaker 435 model with steel pipe handle
  correct beats everything else
  did you weld it on
  swings axe once into oak  shockwave rattles teeth right out of your head
  no longer pay for dental work  looks like another check mark in the win column for me
  when you strike with an axe you are supposed to let go of the handle just enough to allow it to take the impact yet still control it depending on what you are doing you even let it roll a bit to help knock out a chunk of wood or split wood
thanks op brb taking the struts off my car and deflating my tires
  steel handle is a bit to far op especially when you get some really good plastic fantastics that transfer less shock and are pretty much indestructible pic related is my favourite chainsaw/splitting axe for chopping work give me a super thin hickory or beech handle any day of the week   
  not fiberglass  kys
  fiberglass
  and are pretty much indestructible  never have to look far to find someone who doesnt know what they are talking about in a gear thread
  nobody do this this is a good way to develop a bad habit and lose control of the axe head glancing blow of target and take a chunk out of your shin  t retired arborist
  pretty much indestructible as in if you are not a complete baboon and have some degree of competancy with an axe you will not break one    doesnt know what they are talking about     you are more than welcome to check out my channel and spot all the errors cunt  
tfw occasionally required to cut things with an axe for work  tfw this happens often enough for people to know that i suck but not often enough that i git gud
  you obviously have no clue what you are talking about and you certainly have no clue how to use axes properly you never solidly hold any striking tool as it strikes it has to be just loose enough to take the vibration without losing control of it rolling the axe or hatchet as it hits is standard even with a spiting maul you only strike through the top 1/3 of the log round and never all the way through to hit the surface it is sitting on the follow through is what you are doing    you cant lose control of the tool using this technique because it allows you to remain in more control of the tool than to actually grip it firmly when hitting that always seems counterintuitive to people who were never trained to use the tools properly so they end up beating up their hands and joints getting tired too fast dulling/breaking their tools etc      thats because no one taught you how to use an axe properly once you know the methodologies stances and grips to use you can do exceptionally well in only a few minutes it is kind of like the need to learn how to shoot a rifle or swing a bat properly theres 100s of ways to do it incorrectly and most people do it incorrectly 510 times in a single session of using an axe
  doing the cord wood challenge by any chance
  no thats retarded and unsafe
  why is retarded and unsafe exactly
  plastic/fiberglass handle breaks  have to chisel out the remaining pieces stuck in the axehead before putting in a new handle
  lifetime warranty send it back and get a new one  40 and outlasts several hickory handles  fuck off hickory shill
  the only good challenge is the safety challenge
  composite axe/hatchet limited lifetime warranty  defined as seven 7 years from date of purchase limited lifetime warranty applies to the composite axe/hatchet only the composite sheath is not covered under warranty    amazing lifetime there every tool i own is no less than 20 years old some are from before ww1 ive replaced axe handles on everything but never needed to replace them since that was about 25ish years ago and i supply enough wood to heat two houses every winter at one time there were tool companies who wouldnt ask any questions at all when you brought broken tools to them that were from their company it didnt matter how old those tools were either it didnt matter if you were the first or 100th owner nor matter if you had a receipt or not now days everything has a short time limit and you need your lawyer with you to bully the company into holding up their end of the warranty
  cordwood challenge is literally about learning to use an axe safely and efficiency    sounds like you talk the talk but dont walk the walk
  fiskars have a 25 year warranty  i have tons of old axes as well and new ones like tuatahi but i still prefer my husqvarna composite i cut enough wood to heat 2 houses every month    price of axe is 40 new hickory handles are 20   if the composite outlasts 2 hickory handles which it absolutely fucking will then it has paid for itself fiskars have 25 year warranty and uphold it well i dont have to worry about oiling the handle and it wont split and dry out if i leave it out in the rain  its better
  the only cordwood challenge here is a race between two people to make 1 cord it starts with tree felling then bucking splitting and stacking a few people have been hurt badly none have died but the prize money keep people coming in to try      the axe in that photo is a husqvarna which has the 7y warranty i also make my own handles     if i leave it out in the rain    dirty fucking tool abuser your entire post is invalidated
  is it tool abuse to work out in the rain all day and not have to baby an axe i dont leave it overnight personally but a lot of people do becuase they dont care i have made handles in the past but i work too hard to have time to piss around on anything that isnt a competition axe
  recently posted to 4channel i work too hard
you know lifetime warranty is for the lifetime of the tool not a person
  not wanting to come home and replace handles   on computer working on project for bachelor of renewable tech good enough excuse fag
  if you didnt abuse your tools youd never need to replace handles you are making excuses for being irresponsible
  the term isnt legally defined so companies can set any limit on that they want
  feel free to spot tool abuse   
  yeah doubt theyd be going for the longer of the two though
  you need something to lift the log up from the ground to ensure the tip of the saw doesnt accidentally dig into the ground or worse hit a stone i get that just from the thumbnails in the embed preview image most people use a short small log further down the main log to lift it up for bucking if you cant roll/lift the log enough to perform that action to properly buck it youll need a tool called a log jack they make life much easier    i dont feel like watching the video for more

    great axes with a great warranty ive broken the handle on mine twice and both times i just sent a picture to fiskars warranty department and they sent out a new axe asap no questions asked    
  that doesnt happen anymore due to fraud you have to fill out a form    
  ah thats a shame  still though i think the composite axes are great and better for hard use than hickory can leave it in a vehicle without warping and shrinkage a guy made a wooden handle for a fiskars that worked well     i doubt you can name an axe i havent tried old or new and i still really like the plastic ones not as sexy but seriously good tools
  i doubt you can name an axe i havent tried old or new and i still really like the plastic ones    the problem here is that none of mine have brand names and are older than 3 generations i used shagbark hickory for my handles the main problem for wood handle breakages seems to be either tool abuse or an improperly made handle i can go by the racks of axes in the store and pick through the handles never finding one with a proper grain most have grain that will cause the handle to split about midway down the handle and a sharp angle while the other have the grain so it will break near the tool head if you make your own you can avoid all that
  i have made my own but it takes too long and good wood can be hard to source and expensive anyway ive never broken a handle from overstrike but from splitting cord after cord the area below the head abrades till it fails tape helps though main problem though is handles becoming loose in summer or when stored in a vehicle   surely you cant argue with this 
  when i split wood the handle never hits the wood being struck i also source the handle wood from my own property i also maintain trees for various uses so i know what i have at hand at any one time    tool abuse video    a worthless video just like those knife stress tests that do a baton test all you need to do is look up the numbers for fiskars handle material and compare it with the type of wood for instance the fiskars handle material is nyglass and is about 2753 times stronger than shagbark hickory in reference to modulus of rupture if the nyglass is laminated the number doubles which only matters if you are going to abuse it by smashing the handle against a tree like a tard    not wearing safety glasses  taking glasses off for the most dangerous part of the test    it is all fun and games until someone loses an eye to flying nyglass
  video is worthless  no it isnt it shows a clear advantage in the resilience of the fiskars to abuse over hickory therefore it will stand up to normal use better case closed cease your elitism    you mean like the technique i show in this video doesnt work on beech or very knotty wood   
  it is only an advantage if you are purposely abusing your tools    vid  using a double bit felling axe for splitting log rounds    im wincing here use a splitting maul for that job the axe in the vid is for felling trees one bit has a narrower grind angle meant for use up on the tree while the other bit has a wider grind angle for meant for use low on the tree near the ground the bit for closeground work uses that grind in case it will hit soil or worse a rock and not dull or knick the edge as badly as a narrower ground edge would neither edge is properly ground for use in splitting it takes more energy to use them for that purpose and it also dulls them faster than using them properly a splitting maul bit will have a grind on the edge that is well suited for splitting log rounds so that the shock easily flings them apart    rolling the axe as it hits    thats what it is supposed to so to prevent the tool head from going all the way through to the other side of the log round and hitting the ground or your table log round it also prevents wear on the handle as it wont be hitting through and scraping the sides on the log round should it not split properly the shape of the handle is also incorrect on a felling axe for splitting for this very reason when you are felling a tree the axe head roll is not very much and it wont roll so much as to blister your hands a proper splitting maul will have a round handle to better allow a longer roll while not rubbing your hands with a flatter shape or with a flatter grip near the end of the handle again though much of this information seems to be lost in time and you have companies making splitting maul handles like axe handles which fucks everything up    it really is the small things that can either end up harming you blisters at least breaking your tools or merely making your work less efficient
  this entire response    you just shown how little you know  make some content if you know better which you dont  waiting for your video though im not holding my breath
speaking of fiskars just picked these up gonna break um in this weekend while camping ayyy
  if you are able break them in at home you should do that with all new gear before taking it out in the bush or have a good backup youve already know is really good
  im not taking on dominic redwoods just a cpl days of camping and trail riding if i manage to break both of these chopping a bit of firewood i guess ill just die
  it is more like avoiding frustration factor because you now have a big blister on your hand because theres a little difference in the handle or something weird going on you were not expecting
  lol ill be good thanks though
  be careful out there anon
  lulz i have very callused hands i work with im for a living i think ill make it
  very callused hands    indication of improper tool use only slightly less worse than blisters due to very improper tool use
  i have calluses from the work i do ya silly goose not everyone has a nice office job
  you can always tell the experienced people from the inexperienced the experienced will be clean and uncallused after work
  hows ur cubicle dilbert
  ever shook hands with a pro timbersports athlete hands are calloused as fuck and they know how to use an axe better than anyone
  hes just some basement dwelling larper

one of my favs is vek0 no voice overs just him cooking his /out/ recipes and they always make me hungry to  
  nah scouts pretty old scouts been kind of showing signs of age for a few years already i remember seeing in a video of them camping from like 2 years ago joe already talking about how he didnt move like he used to   i mean it was the same with gary the goat jimbo got gary and started camping/traveling the desert when gary was like a year old he didnt start taking video and posting gary on the net until he was almost 3 or 4 poor thing died only 6 years old which is still pretty young for a goat     real question is now that all the big /out/ youtubers are losing their animal companions whos gunna be the next camping and outdoor channel with an animal companion
rip doggo  
  its a pretty big deal dude
  kinda made sense for gary to die when he did crazy guy wouldnt stop eating cigarette butts and jimbo kept feeding him alcohol and all kinds of other stuff

  indeed i happened to watch a video the other day that said 1 in 25 and that ratio is certain to be much higher at 4c
rarely uploads videos anymore  when he does theyre like 5 minutes   uploads almost daily on his japanese channel  production quality is way improved  he wont sub title his videos  its not fair bros
  this is great stuff anon thanks for sharing
this guy is breddy gud     rune malte bertramnielsen
  thats the guy
  gimmie the lowdown on this yellow man pls
  hes a sika deer hunter from japan who focuses mainly on knife videos he stopped uploading regularly to his english channel like 3 or so years ago
  link
                      its just a dumb ass dog lol  you crybabbies need to grow up this isnt a big deal
  if you think dogs are dumb or useless youre probably dumber and more useless than a dog
  yeah go ahead and show be a dog that can do multiplication thats right dogs are dumber than your average 12yearold   again grow up its just a dumb ass dog
  if you can say that then you must not have owned a pet more substantial than a goldfish     dogs become your best friend theyre loyal loving and become like a family member
wtf is happening to /out/ and this eclebs cocksucking youre grown ass men defending and obsessing about some rando that you have never seen nor talk to outside the internet one thing is to watch a youtube channel other thing is to treat it like its your football club that you have been following since you were 5
  you can do multiplication but you seem to lack any other type of knowledge like empathy and youre probably a larper that couldnt live longer than a worm in the wild what  said is perfect
    lol janet why are you sad your 2 year old son died lol he was a retard he couldnt even do multiplication grow up it isnt a big deal lol
  this guy is awesome link to japanese channel
  here you go  
    let me guess only child with parents that never loved him neck yourself shitbird
  
  something thats part of you and you gave life to is the same as some pet  go be retarded elsewhere and talk to dried ovaries old farts they will probably agree with you just have in mind that the sane part of the world will always think of you as mentally defective person
  god why do these make me so happy and so sad at the same time
  i was using a more extreme example fucktard i know losing a child is much worse it doesnt hurt my point though you can solely take care of a puppy from its birth and care for it creating a bond stronger than plenty of actual parent/child bonds so fuck off saying that it doesnt matter go get an actual dog and see how you feel when its time comes
  dont bother with the cunt anon
  boo hoo      a human child has potential to be something while all that the dog will ever be capable of is shitting everywhere and licking its own balls      wrong guess crybabby
tactical is pretty cool  
  shitheels like 1404936 crave attention just dont give it to them
  wish he would upload more i love how he doesnt hold back when testing his gear
  boo hoo  crybabby  cool you lost those arguments  a human child has potential to be something while all that the dog will ever be capable of is shitting everywhere and licking its own balls  scout literally disproves that completely you idiot hes a super useful companion to have around helping him do tons of shit thats not even considering hounds for smelling or hunting  and no you dont love your child because it has the potential to be a stemfag or something you love your child unconditionally because through raising it its part of you and you have a bond with it just like a dog you just keep proving your either damaged or an underage larper
  see 
  this much seething  lmao go see a psychiatrist since youre clearly unstable
  i would say that he is slightly more /k/ than /out/ but still not a bad recommendation
not sure if you would consider him a youtuber but dave canterbury is worth checking out
  damn
  you love your child unconditionally because through raising it its part of you and you have a bond with it just like a dog  he keeps repeating this like its true  holly fuck im start to think that youre delusional enough to believe it a mothers bond to her child is amounts behind whatever connection you may have with some mutt do some low life scum neglect their children sure is that the norm not by a million miles most parents would give their life for their kids i dont think many would do the same for their dogs and the ones they do had nothing much to live for anyway
  even though i dont like what he did with his dual survival resume he is a treasure trove of expertise
  1
  its so weird to see a danish bushcrafter in here we have such a small country and kinda strict laws so the fact that rune has made it this far is cool
  acting like i didnt say that parent/child bonds are still much stronger than dog/master bonds multiple times  good job ignoring the rest of my argument tho 
    have you ever heard the analogy about wrestling with a pig in mud just leave the idiot be this entire fucking thread is getting shitted up
        k sorry bros
  learned a lot from this guy and cody lundin on dual survival back when it was watchable ill definitely check out his youtube channel
  cody lundin  where is he these days
  he still teaches survival skills through his school
     pray for scout poor doggie
  youtube  money  you cant make money from it anymore unless youre in the 10mil subscriber mark pumping out daily 5minlong clickbait videos   any money he gets would be purely patreon but you wouldnt make enough from a 1 post a week youtube channel to live off   the real patreon money is drawing hentai art of obscure fetishes or drawing furry porn theres one furry porn artist makes 25k/month and only draws one picture every 6 months
  if you like your valor stolen then hes your guy
  happening  its been this way for a while already just seems like the digital manifestation of basic human tribalism to me
  redpill me on this ive seen a lot of guys talk about stolen valour in relation to that guy but im not aware of what he actually did to get blamed for it so much
  he was a good boy    f
  he was legit in the military but claimed he was more than he was on his resume for the show got found out and booted none of that has any bearing on the quality of info he shares which no one else even close to touches touches pound for pound
  lost my /out/door companion to lymphoma last fall as well only four years old pretty much stopped caring after that
josh james kiwi bushman pure blokey nz fun gunning down cunt deer and whitebaitin legend
  well part of it too is the hippie/vegan influence of jimbos wife had jimbo trying natural remedies and some mud pumice shit on garys injuries and sicknesses until he eventually found out that he was fucked goatd probably still be alive if he actually took it to the vet in the first place instead of rubbing mud on the injuries and trying mystical bullshit
  dog is 11 years old  sorry m8 it hurts but its not really that bad that dog is old old things die the dog has lived a full good life he doesnt give a shit about dying trying to artificially delay the inevitable via chemo is just selfish and only prolonging the dogs suffering
  t subhuman
  damn how could i forget this guy easily takes first place
  watch me skin a sika deer then talk about my new bark river knife video 478
the good thing about putting your dog to sleep is the knowledge that he was never aware of the concept of death from his point of view the life he is living is immortal and unending when you put him to sleep he just closes his eyes like he does every night and thats it its one of the nicest most pleasant lives any creature on earth can have
  he makes a wider variety of videos on his japanese channel besides i never said you had to like him i think his videos are comfy
whos the reviewbrah of outdoor videos
  absolute badass
  t dogfucker who doesnt know how to use t
        im a dog owner and i agree with   dogs are great tools for hunting and keeping mice away but when they get sick theres no point of keeping them i beat my last sick dog to death with a shovel because he was throwing up all over the place and would just lie around all day
  you may like the style more or less but he does give lots of good info his tree series is one of my favorites plus hes objective and doesnt eat soi      based more on the entertainment side thk
  bushcraft  is instagram tier nonsense
  goodest boy out there  rddit doge speak  kys
  the absolute state of youtube   go to a vet why in fucks name would your appeal to the youtube userbase for medical advice this video is straight up exploiting the situation these sorts of feelings should be kept private not broadcast on the internet
saw this channel in the sidebar a lot and assumed it was the usual lofi hip hop intro douchey bullshit but its actually awesome  
  you are one of the good ones anon
    this joe is a massive fag and the only reason hes popular is because he makes teenage girls and homosexuals peepees tingle i used to watch his videos sort of casually in the background sometimes but i had to stop hes like the personification of reddit
  cool bait bro
    claimed he was a navy seal  total bullshit
is there a redpill on what the fuck everyones problem with joe is hes just a dude in the woods with a youtube channel
  dude quit alone because he lost his ferrorod can he even into friction fire and banking it
    false pic related
  im sorry anon just know that your dog lived to love you 
  only reddit acts cutesy about dogs and cats  imagine hating fun so much
are you guys having an awesome youtuber thread
    this guy is a complete phony
  helsinkipop    i started watching helsinki poop vids after reading this thread and hes awsome also hates muslims and loves white civilization hates decadence often mentions it so our guy i guess

  are there any youtubers that do backpacking but arent just doing it the easy way for social media views  i mean are there people who just take all their /out/ gear and head off into nature for a few weeks and document their journey 
rune malte bertramnielsen doesnt have to many videos yet but hes pretty comfy  
  wako pls come back
  no that is being a father
john z easily  
  bait
  he literally just cries on camera all the time how is that at all entertaining
  at least hes man enough to do it   do you hike a thousand miles a month
  no but i do in a year i have a great job and great life and i still get out and do it
  gotdamn anon whats been your fave so far
  i honestly couldnt even tell you gun to my head a list of places in the cascades much more wilderness and fewer people     
  he really seems like a great guy always responds to my comments
  fellow washingtonian barring the marxist king county cancer/filth wa is a prime /out/ state
  i have not read truer words tonight
  godspeed you magnificent bastard
  i can understand hating cats even if they are an important part of 4chan then again we live in a new era of 4channel so maybe cat hat is ok now    also 4channel has far to many captchas
snow idiot here if anyone remembers my thread about going up to see snowplans are canceled i may be stupid but im not suicidal pic related going to go to lower elev in el dorado nf instead     letting you guys know i plan on living
  what car do you have and what is your snow driving experience
have fun where ever you and doggo end up      iirc op has a crv and 0 hes from texas
  damn i was looking forward to hearing about the search and rescue op
  all the retards in that thread thinking op was going to die  i didnt understand that at all op seemed like a very reasonable person well aware of his ability i was one of just a couple supportive anons
  egging op on after hes already called it quits  cmon now anon thats just cruel
    tfw my first time driving in multiple inches of snow was the noreaster last week    all in all it wasnt too bad even though it was over mountains the 4wd definitely helped
  op here yah some people think everyones as retarded as them
  link that thread i spend a significant amount of time here somehow miss all the good ones
  it wasnt that good op wanted to take doggo on an overnighter 3 miles in on a trail hes already been on to see snow as long as there was 1 of snow on the ground and no storms forecast with well stated intention to cancel if either of those conditions werent met but for some reason the hysterics took over the thread and decided that because it would be ops first time in snow he was definitely going to die if he tried it
  he was definitely going to die if he tried it  thats quintessentially /out/ desu i have argued with anons because of that theyre the ones freaking out if you dont carry backups of backups and a fak for day hiking
  calls everyone telling him hes unprepared retards  chickens out anyways  cmon op now you really have to do it hopefully youve already bought winter tires by now
  i dont know what your picture is supposed to be showing op  tbrainlet
  probably this
  dont feel too bad op another anon was going camping at pic related tonight too bad his thread just got bumped in the past day or so i bet he bails too  tonightmostly cloudy a chance of snow showers until midnight then a slight chance of snow showers after midnight low around 13 below northwest winds 40 to 50 mph wind chill values as low as 49 below   thanksgiving daypartly sunny high around 5 below northwest winds 45 to 50 mph wind chill values as low as 47 below   thursday nightclear low around 6 below temperatures rising to around 3 above after midnight north winds 30 to 45 mphbecoming northwest 15 to 20 mph after midnight wind chill values as low as 37 below   fridaysunny in the morningthen becoming partly sunny high around 23 west winds 15 to 20 mphincreasing to 20 to 30 mph in the afternoon wind chill values as low as 12 below
  how does this work
  measuring the mountains near where your staying     thats cheating and you know it if i did that it would be 5f with a windchill at 44f atm its 9f
    cold weather is no joke i cant imagine what its like below 0f
  t retard
  phd in what     anon if youre really that interested in going snow camping and youre not a total autist ill take you up not this weekend though but the season is just beginning ive got some experience in the sierras and youll probably not die as long as you can shovel some snow and help chop wood     shoot me an email at letsgosnowcampinggmailcom    if you only wanna go see snow and not actually camp in it get a snopark permit and drive up on sunday the roads should be pretty clear by then try not to drive in the late afternoon when everything is refreezing also buy chains check the sidewall of your tire for a ms marking if its there most likely you wont need chains but they still theoretically can check for them just go to the oreillys and ask the dude for whatever fits your car
  cant say my department is way too small i have ms tires bought chains and a snopark permit thanks for the invite gonna go check it out on my own first
the only thing that matters is that you you have snow tires and dont drive like a fucknut brake before turns and practice slowly in a parking lot as far as camping/hiking you want to be slightly chilly at the trailhead but bring stuff for much colder temps than you expect
  ms  enjoy dying anon
  what shoes do you bring for winter in sierra  mountaneering boots or hiking ones and switch if you go to a summit
  usually just sturdy and waterproof hiking boots i can still kick steps with i got a pair of asolos on sale mountaineering boots only if im using crampons since i have automatics i find that mtn boots are better at keeping my feet dry but mine are also much heavier
oh yeah affirmative asians ice house reservoir is not too bad
    kek    i once drove 150 miles in a zero visibility blizzard on the highway often times i had to use a flashlight to see the edge of the median dip between lanes and the ruts from the other trucks i was in a wee tiny rearwheel drive pickup truck with chains on all tires i had to buy gallons of windshield wiper fluid at every gas station just to keep the window clear enough to see taillights i had to hang my head out the window to see when i ran out of wiper fluid the only people on the highway were emergency people semis and retards like me at one point after fueling up i nearly ran off an embankment at an intersection where you turn to get back on the highway i was pushing snow with the truck the entire time because all the other trucks were higher up than mine it was 1030mph the entire way took fucking forever and luckily my passenger passed out after being exhausted from being too nervous for too long    fun times
  thats pretty badass why do bother hanging around with losers like us
  well im back and i learned a few things  1 snow chains really helped driving however driving in snow is really similar to driving in loose dry sand like in south texas so i was pretty confident in a lot of areas where i saw people getting stuck   2 i need to buy gaiters and snow shoes there was maybe 20 of snow most places and 30 in others i only hiked about 2 miles before i decided to go back to my car and just have lunch with doggo i had a lot of fun just following in the footsteps of people who had snow shoes   3 built my first snow man apparently snow does just stick to itself when you roll it in a ball      i would definitely go again i probably wouldnt camp there unless it was again around this time of the season or nearer april i think its a little too dicey in decemberfrebruary for me     had a blast and it was a great learning experience     finally most of yall are probably backyard campers or some shit its just fucking a little snow
  there was maybe 20 of snow most places and 30 in others i only hiked about 2 miles before i decided to go back to my car and just have lunch with doggo i had a lot of fun just following in the footsteps of people who had snow shoes  nigger postholed for two miles and ruined the trail for everyone else
  it was the first snow of the season and pretty much slush dont be an idiot
  it seems like for most sierra summits youd need crampons but if hike in is 10 miles you would just carry the stiff moutnaneering boots until you got close
  follows /out/s advice about winter tires and ends up not dying  ignores advice about snowshoes and ruins the trail  still has the audacity to call us faggots  show some appreciation nigger
  ooh tough guy went out playing in the snow so manly
i know this is rather contradictory but i recently got into firewatch its a pretty comfy out game
another one that would work is the hunter call of the wild
finally i always thought red dead redemption was a pretty out game
try the long dark if you havent already
  tis extremely based
the misr survival is another survival game with some bushcrafting and standard /out/ survival shit from the makers of 
/thread    just about everything in this thread so far is /out/ verified and condoned  any suggestions henceforth may be subpar and not a bonafide /out/ quality game
  botw
the witcher 3 is also pretty good for an /out/ experience    too many monsters maybe
rainworld for that sweet post ecological collapse urbex or rather industrial exploration index
  arma 3 best /out/ /k/ mashup
  abzu
a lot of the thread seems to be missing i know one anon was sperging out hard      arma 2 doesnt have graphics as good as arma 3 but damn it is really sweat to just drive around the massive map of chernarus i would edit it so theres all manner of civilian people everywhere and things going on but no military maybe sprinkle in some civi aircraft here and there one time i map missions that amounted to being a bus driver where you picked up npcs from various bus stop locations and dropped them off using a dirt bike or just going walking in the woods is also pretty nice
breath of the wild  elder scrolls games  the forest  mad max  the witcher series  the hunter call of the wild  old turok games
the long dark is pretty good
we need something like tes oblivion with modern graphics and focused on bow hunting and fishing for survival could also have some basic combat to deal with bandits and the like that game had more immersion than skyrim
scum looks pretty amazing but its a slow development     classic dayz mod is unparalleled for /out/ explorations     stalker series rocks    farcry3 is for big dick nibbas
quake now that was a good game
farcry34 has good outdoor stuff i think theres an editor too you should be able to make nonfighting maps or get mods/codes to turn off such things
unturned
  truth
subnautica
    firwatch campagin lasts 4 hours   fuck mad max
  this
stalker sorta fits the bill but if someone could recc a good survival mod then itd be golden
tfw learning unreal so i can create my own outdoor utopia    anyone here got a good idea for an /out/ game
    i think stalker is king of /out/games
  it at least should have real world plants akin to those oblivion/skyrim that have real world edible/herbalist properties
  yeah im on this scanning/modelling all the plants i find in my garden
  that is more /k/ i feel that the long dark fits the bill better
  seconded i felt it was more realistic on lower difficulty too
  give away any consoles delete steam go outside wtf
  give away  why not sell to fund some gear are you some kind of hippy
    now that you mention far cry primal seems to be out af
  what do you do when youre not outside anon whats wrong with playing videogames wtf
  check out skyblivion
  a sedentary life is a wasted life there should be plenty of constructive things to do both indoors and outdoors playthings are for children
cataclysmdda and dwarf fortress    youll get used to the ascii
red dead 2 makes me wanna go hiking
i usually play rdr2 and far cry primal when i am inside which isnt too often considering i work far away from home    but rdr2 is amazing the hunting is ace and its just cozy
  read son
the forest is pretty out if anyone plays let me know always looking to hang out with aome people on there
  ill give you this one anon ive been meaning to delete all this shit for awhile now sucks up alot of time that i could be out and /comfy/
despite the blocky graphics terrafirmacrafts been fun it makes survival in the wilderness more believable and to me more satisfying than the base game if you spawn in a temperature range far enough from the equator winter is cold enough to kill your crops so preserving food or hunting is necessary crafting tools weapons and armor is a more involved process than vanilla it encourages the player to value what theyve made instead of stuffing chests full of easily created items    when excavating a mine wood supports are needed to prevent a deadly cave in when mining youll sometimes hear a collapse happening nearby it all helps create the impression that this is dangerous and that there really is tons of rock above you just waiting to come down torches go out after a couple days so reentering that mine and hearing monsters somewhere nearby can be unnerving and theres no towns or villagers so its just you and the wilderness i didnt install a map mod or look at the spawn coordinates so making visible markers and observing the terrain is important if i want to explore and find my way home again    a game like this with even more survival aspects and tesoblivion level graphics would be great
  the only time it is remotely good is when you only have an hour or two between other things you must do and it is dark storming or too cold to suit up and go innawoods the only one remotely /out/ is     if you havent played the long dark then you really need to    
  read  learn  work out  plan next /out/ trip  build mail bombs and send them to people holding us hostage in this technological prison
i used to love playing dayz     its very different now but id like to start playing again
  the mod or the stand alone the mod pretty much ruined arma 2 server lists for years and years i was glad when it went stand alone
  good luck you ll need it
  underrated
  arma 2 is pretty much completely dead i prefer it over arma3 but i dont like playing with russians
  well it was like 56 years ago that dayz standalone was released before that arma2 servers lists was nothing but dayz servers for a while things got back to operating servers on the list i dont know what it is like now the best games i had were with clans filled with actual irl military personnel but i still prefer single player sandbox just for the innawoods experience
i wish i had other things to do than gaming its eating up most of my leisure time how do i get /out/ instead of being a /v/irgin
  go to bass pro or some other fishing store buy a rod buy a lure go to a lake and fish
  fishing without a licence is illegal here and you cant get a licence without having done a course thats both expensive and takes quite some time same goes for hunting
  courses for fishing wtf try looking around for some places for hiking i guess
  get an player or headphones for your phone which can play m4b files then go to audiobookbaynl and download the emerilia series if you wish you can use a throwaway email address to join so you can download the magnet links go outside and start listening to it youll get motivated from there a word of warning though it is litrpg genre meaning it focuses on character building and related stats there will be listings of stats that is fine at first but it may get old hearing the lists so you can just skip ahead if you have that problem another warning all other litrpg books are terrible trash for the most part so dont let their taint tarnish emerilia since it is the only one that somehow circumvents that crap books 911 are not out for audio book yet fyi
  the vanishing of ethan carter was one of the comfier /out/ games ive played except for the olde haunted coal mine part that was kinda spookyfish
  that does have some really nice screenshots for a game
  minecraft literally as /out/ as you want from growing stuff in a garden youve made and sleeping in a comfy cabin to building minas tirith
  that game was too addictive for me and i had to delete the entire account to get away now i build and garden/farm like a mad man irl
  based    neoscav is pretty great clunky mechanics and crappy ai are the downsides but the story and ambient are awesome its sad that no one knows about it  also project zomboid without zombies though it becomes waaaaay to easy to be enjoyable even with max difficulty if there are no zees
  except for the olde haunted coal mine part that was kinda spookyfish  i actually have never been more shocked in a video game no enemies for the whole game just story and puzzles and beautiful environments and then suddenly maggot man eats me shook me more than id like to admit
  too bad its pay to win crap
for me its minecraft
  knew a guy like that before he was based af but it didnt end well for him
  just go on an overnight backpacking trip get a basic set of gear go exploring for a day set up tent and come back the next day bonus points if you can add some fishing or hunting to that
final fantasy xi had great exploration and some cool secrets like notorious monsters and rare items that really primed me for becoming an true /out/doorsman
monster hunter world is a naturalists dream the early game before it becomes about getting the best armor so many animals to collect and the environment is absolutely beautiful the early game makes you feel like theres always a bigger fish
    it does have good visuals i think the devs either had access to the sites they made ingame or very very vivid imagination theres even an old wooden german/dutch church at some point its just great at sunset the sounds are also great   the story is also good but i wont spoil that for ya
  hey ive found it i hope 4chan allows links on sfw boards  
  isnt that the game where you have to pay for bullets
  since it is legit /out/ related i dont think it matters those are really pretty locations for the most part seems the only main difference other than some building locations are the trees theres more pines in the real world and in the game more deciduous ones
  theres a lot more to the ingame map than meets the eye its somehow made into two parts two large map parts that spand through the entire day and are divided by a smaller ingame level also most of the buildings are traversable and have smaller puzzles for certain machines and objects to work allinall its pretty well done i cant decide on some kind of a grading system since i only downloaded firewatch and the long dark like an hour ago
  i havent played the long dark since before it had bears in it but back then playing on the lower difficulties was far more realistic otherwise youd do nothing at all but fight wolves constantly back then if one followed you to a door and you went through the outside world paused and the wolf would still be there regardless of how long you stayed inside hopefully they fixed that it is a pretty good game story mode wasnt made yet so i dont know how that is
  huh this is really interesting
guys nobody have mention monster hunter what is wrong with you  also maybe deathstranding
  something like that hopefully another anon can chime in i played it for a bit then saw that id need to pay to access the good areas and so forth so i hung it up
custers revenge
i miss dayz mod apparently the standalone is getting better but the damage is done and ill never forgive it for that  i miss camping with people and playing songs out in the wilderness where no one could find us  i miss the adrenaline kicking in whenever we had to enter a town for supplies and food  i miss getting a vehicle and just driving across the roads while getting shot at occasionally by other people who were travelling  i miss having our hidden base destroyed by bigger clans and heading out for theirs as revenge  i miss sniping big groups and then having to get the hell out of there with my bicycle  oh and stalker is great as well    does arma 3 have any good survival modes these days  im somewhat feeling the itch    monster hunter is too arcadey to be /out/ and the maps in world doesnt feel as much as the wild as the older maps in previous titles its also missing a god damn ice map
  this running thru a blizzard in the middle of the night minutes from death   the survival mode is where its at if you die the game is over exciting
  i like the sound of this
  apparently the standalone is getting better  really i own it but havent played it in almost 4 years i think i gave up shortly after they introduced vehicles
  this game has really disappointed me so far  cheap lazy art style ruins immersion  godawful ui further ruins immersion  core gameplay consists of staring at loading bars while your fire starts  zero effort put into geographical/ecological realism  whats the appeal should i keep playing will it get better
  i have been playing the long dark    its a good game
  dwarf fortress adventure mode if you want a more rpg/roguelike feel  the forest if you want to pretend youre in a deserted island with cannibals you can set it to peaceful and instead play it just to build a nice cabin and go hunting deer   medieval engineers is better for building but its got no risk and hunting in it is pretty basic/shit right now maybe keep an eye on it a year or two from now then mod the fuck out of it   the hunter if you just wanna hunt   7 days to die if you want to do /out/ survival in a post zombie apocalypse setting like a better dayz
  then move somewhere better dumbass   youre like the kind of guy that loves mountains but instead chooses to live in a coastal city
  my nigga  it also had the best and most realistic fishing of any mmo or online game even to date   location moon phases time of day rod bait weather everything made a difference  i think only stardew valley fishing came close
  nitpicks minor details   outright wrong opinions  i dont think the problem is with the game anon
red dead 2 with a few minor tweaks to animal/ world behavior the addition of packhorses and safe pelt storage caching would be the end all be all for me  you go root and toot in town ill be up here in the high peaks making meat of dall sheep and elk see you in a couple months with my horse train of plews going to market
cue autistic screeching but fallout 76 has been /out/ af for me    the setting portable camps and no human npcs really plays into it
    real shit though it took me a while to realize that teds manifesto i was reading wasnt something hed written this year from prison and was indeed decades old holy shit was it prescient    history will vindicate him
    moderation is always better than just giving up shit you enjoy doing
    holy shit when i lived at yellowstone 98/99 it was at 22 million annual touristsnow its up to 4 there was already a lot of traffic back then with some jams which were annoying enough at that level but it was usually of tolerable duration and not to the point of miles    from what ive just read i wouldnt even consider going there during tourist season anymore at all its also interesting to note that these spikes corresponded with social media and selfies    also perhaps severe limits on foreign tourism is in order let us citizens take priority in enjoying our wilderness parks
    luckily it seems that this problem is mostly isolated to normie attractions/routes go backpacking explore the wilderness area go during winter etc i guarantee you wont see anotehr fucking soul just dont be retarded like the people in the article and try to selfie taft point or the geyser at noon on a july weekend shit isnt complicated
    winter at yellowstone is fucked now too i was reading the other night that one now has to snowmobile in with guided tours which means being taken to normie spots brief stop then move long i went in just me and ex waifu by ourselves during the off season went wherever we wished stayed at certain spots for extended meditations no other human souls around theres no way id subject myself to a normie group
  prioritizing those native to the country is a pretty solid idea same shit happens here in texas colorado bend is fucked during the spring summer and fall booked for months in advance even if you reserve a site its not guaranteed youll even be able to park    winter time is the only way to go once it drops below 50f most people around here grow vaginas
  theres too many people  we need more people  can they at least be coherent and guardian of all places
  how are tehse people even getting to yellowstone that shit is so remote yosemite i understand but yellowstone
  shit there are 5 entrances to ys its easy to get to just a long drive i lived at west yellowstone which is the most popular entrance but the town itself is or at least was then 1 square mile total population then 1012 so its a fuckton of people squeezing through a funnel    there is a lot of yellowstone that is remote the backcountry but there are roads that go to most of the big stuff like hot pools geysers and such they are small roads though and handle way more traffic than they were designed for hence the bottlenecks and jams in tfa
  also perhaps severe limits on foreign tourism is in order let us citizens take priority in enjoying our wilderness parks    it is a money maker so i doubt that will ever happen unless it is wartime the other solution is to create more park land and park infrastructure that takes money though
geez the environmentalists are really shitting up the nest on this one maybe inviting every human on earth to live in the united states and get a few gas guzzlering cars and fly around on vacation was a bad idea anywho its not hard to get away from people if you can walk a few miles
    i just realized you were referring to winter specifically yes its definitely more difficult then the roads are all under snow but they plow pack them regularly so its hard still requires tire chains and such and the nearest greyhound can get to it is salt lake city during that part of the year theres much less tourism in winter but still a good bit every single morning i had to suit up maybe 100 snowmobilers and there were a couple of other companies doing the same
  oh say can you see
good thing tourists are incapable of walking more than a mile so hit the trail and youll never see anyone
  massively increase the price for foreigners to enter the park all the chinese that visit are insanely rich and dont know the value of a dollar anyways theyll still pay
they should increase the fees to yellowstone there are hundreds of millions of acres of public land in the american west and alaska that charges no entrance fees where you can camp as long as you want for free let the plebs stay in their little playpens i say this as someone who has gone on two backcountry trips in yellowstone where i didnt see another person for 8 days
tourists fucking ruin most things they touch go to local parks or just walk really far out on the trails as  stated
  itt retarded europoors that will never learn the difference between a national park and a national forest not because they cant but because they wanna believe their ass backwards shithole thats half the size of virginia is somehow comparable to the 4th largest nation on the planet
if you can still see a road or a path you havent gone far enough
heuh you think thats bad try shinjuku gyoen or yoyogi park on a sunday
  if you want national parks to be less crowded you will have to make them hard to access   just let the normies to their shit activities in the cities
  why not just go to another area of the park the ones in burgerstan are fucking massive
  yeah seems like theyre not there to experience general nature but very specific natural formations to take pictures of
please make it stop i didnt even buy options this time and im still getting fucked
  ban chinese people
typically id agree with the notion of just go where they arent but yellowstone specifically is a different case due to the profoundly unique geological features which are well worth almost anything to witness and experience directly for oneself
zion had the good solution with their bus system really wish yosemite would do something like that
    i remember i was up at sequoia national park and sequoia national monument both over the summer the national park was goddamn flooded with peopleforeigners and domestic tourists alike going through the main visitor centers was a crowded mess my gf and i had to go out a bit deep onto the trails to get any sort of solace from the tourist rush and even then we kept running into this american broski type who was quite obviously was trying to get into the pants of these two french girls he was hiking with     the national monument in comparison was dead quiet no crowds and pure solitude we only ran into two other groups during our short time therea large family from the midwest that had brought their grandmother complete with wheelchair set and a pair of finns who kept to themselves and chittered between each other in that queer language of theirs
  if you want national parks to be less crowded you will have to make them hard to access   just let the normies to their shit activities in the cities  /thread  replace bathrooms with pit latrines  get rid of the restaurants  no paved trails  get rid of hotels  stop maintaining so many trails
  snowmobiles in yellowstone  theyve had that for like 20 years man
  fly into jackson  drive 2 hours    its honestly not that far
  go to glacier in july  nobody on the highline trail past like a mile or two   see a wolverine 10 ft from me  watch an amazing sunset as i walk down to my truck  really anything that requires a modicum of effort will be empty
  theres a lot of backcountry thermal features which are pretty cool
  edward abbey wrote an article about doing this in the 60s i think it was in fieldstream
    we lived there 98/99 and there were no such regulations but there were proposals being fought heavily at the time we went in totally solo then during off season without any groups anywhere saw less than 5 other humans now one must go with guided groups which i do not know when after that began
  i think i went there when i was 12 or 14 and did a snowmobile trip into yellowstone from the south entrance that was about 20 years ago
    yes 20 ago one could go group or solo typically only locals went solo but now only guided group is allowed one can become a non corporate licensed guide and make a max of two trips in annually i worked for a snowmobile rental back then but wasnt a guide and the gate bitch had no idea where i worked and it didnt matter sad times now im guessing some faggots got stuck
i will add that the proposals back then were to ban snowmobiles altogether the resident scientists most of whom live at mammoth were saying the noise pollution was harming the wildlife primarily the buffalo the rental/tour companies formed the blue i think it was ribbon coalition to fight it i suppose what we have now is the compromise that was reached
  they will just add usage fees to every piece of public land the various land management agencies would love that as they could increase the amount of overtime they draw
  add usage fees    charge more and more money to go outside  it all goes towards stuff to make the outdoors less outdoorsy
  dont doubt it fren    the people who work for the federal government see the outdoors as their playground you are just a temporary visitor
  this i live near one of the smallest national parks and it gets 3 mil tourists each year in peak summer every stretch of road looks like ops pic but maybe 2 of those people actually get out onto the trails its not hard to feel as though youre in the wilderness after an hour of walking
at this point seems that the solution is to give the land back to native people and let them sort the problem and decide the best way to deal with it
  one now has to snowmobile in with guided tours which means being taken to normie spots brief stop then move long    no it doesnt it means you have to go with a guide but the pace and itinerary is at your own pace you can only go on the roads anyways so your destination is likely normie spots anyways there are still very few people in the park in winter
  native people   this is not a thing all people came from somewhere else and took it from something else
  absolutely i could care less about the crowds because theyre easy to avoid but with that amount of people the nps shouldnt be begging for money from the feds
looking at ops photo all i can think is /pol/ was right again
  pol is always right
  id love to see that charge astronomical fees or outright prohibit driving through the park let them take photos from the window when they see a buffalo instead of stopping their vehicle and fucking up traffic for everyone else
  im going to invade your home but thats ok because it used to belong to someone else i am someone else ergo it belongs to me for perpetuity
  nah youll get killed doing that     its called survival of the fittest sweetheart its been happening a long long time and wont stop anytime soon 
  oh man i miss tulare county /
  this go in offseason youre a dumbass if you go during school holidays
    its beautiful country up theregood folk in the small towns knew a guy who came down from visalia for a college program i was in broski type rode a sports bike was a good dude but due to family issues and a bike crash that shattered his collarbone and totaled the bike and left one of his arms temporarily immobilized he was held back for a year or two     went back up to the sequoia national forest right before they closed that rode through to the trail of 100 giants splendid country once you get above the chaparralhills in places looked like you were back east in west virginia with the splashes of gold and red among the green road up that way chasing the kern river was amazing too way the wind blew through the mountains it sounded like the world was breathing    i think im gonna head back up that way in the summer do some car camping with the gf around balch park and explore a bit more id go back to the national park but its just too crowdedhell when i was there two years ago with my last ex it wasnt even that bad and i went on the nps birthday when it was filled by all the folk that wanted to take advantage of the free admission hordes of families with kids galore and european tourists speaking a cornucopia of languagesit was hard to appreciate nature with just so many folk around
  families with kids    children ruin everything change my mind    i cant even get a cup of coffee anymore without a screaming kid somewhere man maybe its an american thing but people just do not care how their children affect others
  trouble is the govt feels obliged to make everything accessible that means paved roads picnic areas with flush toilets handicapped parking etc things get expensive fast so more money gets spent on fewer sites the alternative is to make some roads and trails more rustic need a 4x4 to get in and forget about the prissy car campsites but then youll get sued by some ada lawyer or some geezer that cant get his bluebird bus in there    there was a small lodge in oregon i think many years ago way up at the end of a narrow mountain road but assholes with big rvs were always getting stuck in the curves so the highway department shut down the road for a couple of years to rebuild it while they were working the owners of the lodge went bankrupt and close the place
  shitty parents ruin everything  ftfy i dont tolerate my kid screaming anywhere but hes a hell of a hiker for a 3 year old
    and fwiw the worst behaved kid i know right now has british expat parents
  this    a couple weekends ago my wife and i were going to hike mt leconte in smoky mountains park driving back from asheville and thought it would be fun     get to the park entrance and there are a zillion people at the visitor center some boomer crashed his rv on the one road through so it was closed so no way to get to leconte for a day hike which was no big deal to us we just hiked elsewhere     but i did learn   the people at the visitor center were pissed this was their only weekend to drive through the park and how can they just close the road all day now they wont be able to enjoy the park at all     idiots still drive big ass rvs on narrow mountain roads at night during the season when there might be ice at elevation    on the bright side one less boomer to clutter up the place and probably killed his whole family in the process     if the parks just limited or stopped vehicle traffic fewer people would go
  i remember reading comments about the new national monument in maine and the discussion about the monuments in utah and a lot of fat lazy boomers complained about muh access because they couldnt drive their atvs or snowmobiles up to the tops of mountains    also having worked in a several national parks now fuck rvs and their drivers fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck them get off the god damn road at the turnouts when there is 20 cars behind you stop trying to drive on hairpin turns up and down the mountain and for the love of god quit running your generators at 3 in the morning
  yeah needing to carry a whole fucking house on wheels when you go /out/ is for nigger faggots anyway
would jug fishing or a trout line work in new york    is it legal    would it work for bass
from the nys dec  angling means taking fish by hook and line this includes bait and fly fishing casting trolling and the use of landing nets to complete the catch anglers must be in immediate attendance when their lines are in the water an angler may operate no more than two lines with or without a rod and each line is limited to not more than five lures or baits or a combination of them both and in addition each line shall not exceed fifteen hook points in any combination of single double or treble hooks snatching hooking and the use of tip ups are not angling    seems to me that if you had two small trotlines with no more than five hooks you could legally fish with them so long as you dont leave them unattended
  how do you figure they define unattended tho is me sitting in a boat 50 feet away unattended
  i dunno maybe call the dec ask them what they define as unattended just ask them hey if i set a line and have to step away to take care of something at what point does my line become officially unattended dont bring up specifics about trotlining just ask a general question
like going camping every couple months or hiking but not having to drive such a huge distance    preferably forested/hilly areas
  burlington vt
  40000 people is borderline not even a city    also nature seems kinda plain unless you can convince me otherwise
  fine seattle
  i like seattle from the stuff ive seen of it also seems like it has a lot of /fit/ /x/ and /pol/ peeps any others    also does anyone know which cities have the best suburban affinity or potential for gardening as in which allow you the largest amount of freedom and space 
    40000 is like a metropolis to me who in the fuck would willingly live with that many other people so near
  maybe i will adopt a more /out/ lifestyle in my later years but i have to start with babysteps because i still need to make money and small cities dont offer careers in the field im working towards    i need to weight and balance my options carefully
just pick some shit in california you seem insufferable anyway
  lol bitterforsomeunknownreason much so just because i dont want to have to sacrifice everything automatically just to satisfy your standards of what the best lifestyle is im insufferable    also ironic that you used that word since it means too extreme to bear youre the extreme one in this situation
  a city with riversmost have forested trails running the length of the citythey also make for good urban camping/fishing
  hmm well thanks for narrowing it down
  jobs  friends  dating  family  oh right of course youre going to say youre either beyond all that or live on a thriving commune with your entire extended family childhood best friend and a wife you married when you were 17 just like everyone else who says this stuff on 4chan
im currently in northcentral illinois looking to move to a more /out/ state where i can explore national forests and maybe mountains too i also love kayaking and fishing and would like to learn hunting from someone with experience    anyway ive narrowed it down to two locations marquette michigan in the upper peninsula and missoula montana     michigan would be a days drive away from family a huge plus i also love cold weather and snow so no worries there but ive heard their summers are plagued by biting insects black flies noseeums ticks and more seems prerty brutal by some accounts and i dont want the few summer months to be shit on by these things    ive done less research into missoula but it looks like an /out/ paradise surrounded my mountains and national forests lakes and rivers a good sized town too for some balance glacier national park is close by too only problem is its a 22hr drive home     any anons live in these areas id love for some first hand input and to ask you specific questions on these areas
  i will give you a bump since i cant help ya otherwise
  22hr drive    yuropoor here why not just drive to nearest airport and fly
  well that would be the play but even taking a plane theres something saddening about being that far away i have a very tight family and a young neice and nephew that i would miss very much and my parents are getting older the idea of being able to hop in my vehicle any time and drive there in just a few hours is reassuring     at the same time because of the nature of my work it would be very easy to head back and stay indefinitely if need be sorry for making a blogpost on here i guess im just caught between being a young man and going on my adventure and leaving the people i love behind i shoukd just bite the bullet and head /out/ for a year and see how things go
  just so you know montana feels pretty much anywhere in the state it can get pretty lonely there if you dont have friends or family and its pretty hard to make the former when most of the population tends to be older ranchers and native americans
  michigander here  the upper peninsula and northern lower peninsula have the best /out/ in the country imo    if you get up this way go to the pictured rocks and the leelanau peninsula    picture related me at pyramid point
  i have to say the scale americans operate on is always fascinating to me i think the longest drive from lands end to john ogroats in the uk is about 15 hours americans will drive 90 minutes for a good steak but that would get us to another part of the country with a radically different accent     family who live an hour away will never see each other and theyll site living far away    good luck on whatever you do op but those are solid reasons to stay close by you dont want the i should have seen them more when they were alive guilt
  leelanau peninsula might be a better fit than the up thanks for the suggestion im really leaning towards michigan now but i think marquette might be too remote for this point in my life i think meeting people and dating will be much easier in a place like traverse city thanks anon
  thanks theres regret in both decisions regret leaving my family and regret of not living my life and exploring while im young hopefully i can find the spot that will satisfy both of those
help me shit up your state  no and saged
  lol nice u memed
  alaska canada australia or russia pretty much   anywhere else is too densely populated
  thing with the us though is its big but its densely and evenly populated throughout   if you want big distance with not a human soul for hundreds of miles you want australia or canada
  i recently moved to utah from the est coast to get /out/
continuing from     for all your winter kit related questions like it or not winter clothing and gear isnt as straightforward as summer stuff so its helpful to have a place for newer guys to ask questions and more experienced people to fine tune their kits
  it looks like itll snow 812 inches the day before i go camping  what kind of snow stuff should i bring can you hike/climb fresh snow to summit a peak
where can i buy a good wool upper body layer that doesnt cost me an arm and a leg
  wool is best bought on ebay in spring youre paying seasonal prices now
  go to your local surplus store generally the us army surplus stuff is super cheap along with swedish and swiss wool they are all really good quality and easy to find  also people complain about wool blends   they are functionaly identical to each other people just love to find shit to bitch about  inb4 x is better than y you big dummy head insert minimal niche reason here
anyone every fuck with these before
  how well does it fare with perspiration that textile texture also somewhat bothers me its like something you would wear on a pajamas
  im guessing they run around 4050 dollars a pair for the legs alone personally id either go with under armour cold gear skin tight later with an additional layer of long johns usually chili brand or columbia omniheat reflective layer which also run you about 4050 if youre not interested in buying or shelling out that ask for it as a gift
  so they run 40 i get 20 off any order because im an emt which puts them at 32 i was also looking at some nice gloves should i pull the trigger on these       product descriptionitem no 10383831  features of the black diamond renegade pro glove  fixed lining with 100 waterproof and breathable goretex  abrasionresistant woven nylon shell  fixed 150 g fleece lining  goat leather palm and fingers  100 g thinsulate insulation  product specifications  primary lining fabric fleece  features waterproof insulated abrasionresistant goretex  weight 66 oz  glove shell woven nylon  palm material goat leather  insulation details 100 g thinsulate  product technology goretex    139 sub total   after discount   111  totals savings   3793     should i pull the trigger
  theyre 100 cotton so theyre not optimal once you sweat theyll be wet and wont be drying anytime soon i think those are more for being /out/side hanging out not necessarily for being /out/
  actually no theyre 80  cocona 20  polyester
  not these 
  these are the extreme lol coconut edition   
  literally made from garbage
  yes but before you do add these to your cart     found these bad boys and throw them under my gloves never had a problem in the cold again i since have gone reflective with every thing and pitty my past self for not finding this material sooner
  fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu well shit    now that coconut thermals are out the fuck should i get then
  johnson or pic repated are your best bets everything else is either overpriced or chinkshit with a few exceptions like the usgi korea era stuff and that which  covered

  youll want gaiters to keep the snow out of your boots and a more aggressive traction device like microspikes snowshoes are good too but if the snow isnt settled yet they can be borderline useless    minus 33 has some good cheaper merino
who here slowshoes
  just get some cheap polypro
  nope
  i slowshoe with a super old and shitty pair of tubbs that i need to replace this year took them out a couple weeks ago and snow kept balling up in the antiballing plate effectively turning it into a balling plate i dremeled the plate off this weekend and will give them one more chance before i retire them   so now im torn between the tubbs mountaineer 25 and the msr lightning ascents
  im a 34 waist so fucking close
  oof sorry pard guess its milsurp for you
  swisslinkcom has finnish military 100 wool pants that come up to a 40 waist  but youll have to wait a little while because theyre temporally shut down due to most of the california county theyre in burning down  site says theyll be back soon though
  lightning ascent owner here fucking do it man theyre so much better than anything else the warranty is also fantastic
  im looking for something in a more natural color like brown khaki olive etc im looking at the east german pants but apparently theyre rather short
  wont you be wearing gaiters most of the time that would be an issue anyway or are you some kind of freak whos a 34x36 or something awful like that
  do you like the bindings are they a pain in the ass when theres snow everywhere  i kind of like the idea of a ratcheting system too  that seems convenient albeit more shit to break
  wellies usually but either way ive found some british surplus pants that check all the boxes so im gonna go with those go with my enfield too
  theyre far and away the easiest bindings in super cold conditions to use with gloves theyre so much simpler than they look the bindings are absolutely bomber
  any tips on layering under a heavy parka like a canada goose snow mantra i just got one at an industry equipment sale for 120 and trying to fit it into my winter hiking gear selection
  parkas like that really arent designed for hiking even in 20f ive not felt like i needed a parka fleece puffy and hardshell is really all you need carry less and move faster
  i agree with you its probably to big for hiking i am just tired of feeling like i am going into exposure while hiking here windchills a bitch
  hey its a great deal though so use it as a casual jacket
  ikr its an amazing work coat the kind of thing you can just hunker down in and be toasty even when your just sitting for a while     the thick fur hoods amazing too just not having that bitter wind in your face all the time changes everything
  yep own those exact ones and theyre fucking awesome keep you super warm they dont get wet when you sweat i think because the outside is a smooth material and the inside is the actual cotton theyre not too bulky and arent very intrusive to wear under regular jeans or what have you when inside theyre just as comfortable as lounging in sweatpants    work them almost everyday in the winter over the last three years they came in really handy back when k used to have to walk two miles to work and then shovel the parking lot theyre too hot to wear inside most places though icove managed before i normally go into the bathroom and take them off roll them up and shove them on the arm of my jacket until i have to go outside again    only complaint is i cant find the matching top anywhere id love to complete the set one day
  carhart guy again     id get these for gloves anon theyre what i have up here in northern mn and i literally never have a problem with my hands getting cold anymore theyre less than 40    only thing id shell out for is a jacket ive got a yukon carhart now that does the trick but i wish i could get another eddie bauer down parka i got one on black friday when i was younger and it was legit amazing    ended up getting rid of it after the feathers settled to the bottom and it didnt work as well anymore only to find out i couldve thrown it in the dryer and it wouldve been good as new and if not apparently they have a lifetime warranty so if it ever does get fucked up you can just bring it to your local store and theyll give you the new years mode for free     theyve got a really sleek thin model they make now that looks like it would be pretty awesome id recommend that if you can afford it they normally run about 430 but i got mine on black friday for about 100    the carhart is about 140 normally but make sure you get an extreme cold one or it will just be shit they last forever though
  all the time
  forgot pic
  hmm
  bamboo thermals bought two sets and theyre great at isolation and theyre easy on the skin
  mikesmilitaria had these in a 40 waist which is kinda big on me but fine because belts and boot blousers exist cleaned em out though sorry anons smaller sizes are there though they were 30 a piece iirc

  post oc youre only proving the ultracucks points
what are some good thin leather gloves i really want to keep a lot of flexibility on my fingers warmth isnt such a big deal south england    i hear that hestra is quite liked but looking at how much they blow on marketing i wonder if theres cheaper    and what leather makes the best working glove
  do they have to be all leather i have found that mechanix original gloves are the best thin gloves out there without a doubt and theyre relatively inexpensive
  also whatever glove you get make sure you get the right size gloves like that should be pretty tight and your finger tips should hit the end of the glove i found i was a medium and not a big boy large
  bamboo viscose is just over hyped rayon its not suitable for performance baselayers because it dries too slowly
  filson stuff    is it worth it
  filson stuff    is it worth it
  some items but likely not that one no    in general their older stuff is still highly commendable
  yea nah
bought these polyester cycling pants from some chinese company and i shit you not it feels like your legs are in an oven i dont know what kind of witch magic they are performing but ive done my last two sub 30f camps wearing nothing but this and some underwear beneath it and even then i was too warm

  theyre comfy but theyre mid rise which is a bit odd and theyre cotton

do all waterproofs loose their ability to stay dry after a season or two im looking for something to wear when walking to and from work in the autumn and spring months when its raining almost 100 of the time in the uk    i have an old cycling jacket that might be a good contender its not breathable at all which isnt really a bad thing and its held its waterproofing quite well but its fairly aggressively cut meaning it rides super high and barely goes past my belly button    i have no idea what material it is to look for something similar
how much would a wool blanket on top of a sleeping bag contribute to its temp rating for example if you out an average wool blanket on a bag rated for 14 freedom units how cold would you be good for

  what is the best inflatable sleeping pad i dont care too much about comfort just need it to be very durable i plan to take it with me on a bike tour where it will be used on pretty rough ground as i usually cowboy camp i dont care about the price     for me durability  size packed  weight  price  looks
  petzl summit is sexy i have one and its very solidly built / holds its edge
  since you want max durability the answer to your problem is a foam pad or a cot    i think the cot is the way to go desu
if i dont carr about weight what sleepingbag for up to 20c is good i dont have time to go on long hikes this winter and i just go to a lake 20minutes away at least once a month to sleep away from all the traffic/noise/walls cheaper the better but i like to keep my toes i have a good sleeping pad
  cant improve upon this anons answer    inflatable and durable are mutually exclusive
  thats a technical ice climbing tool not something one would use in the whites

      the thermarest xtherm is the greatest sleeping system on this planet if you happen to tear a hole in it most experienced backcountry people say this has never happened or rarely happened due to stupid user error like allowing a gas lantern to fall on top of it you can patch the fucking thing up easily if youre not a complete retard     worse case scenario you have to sleep on the ground for a couple of nights its not going to happen but more than once in your life with heavy use that i can tell you in exchange you get great comfort and warmth and lightweight
  the thermarest xtherm is the greatest sleeping system on this planet  agree  i own one  but for cowboy camping every day on rough ground for an extended duration an inflatable has zero chance of surviving especially since there was no mention of any sort of tarp/ground cover and from a creepycrawlie aspect being off the ground a few inches on a cot sounds better than being right on the ground if youre not in a shelter/tent
  its also on sale a lot of places right now for 170 everyone who is /out/ should buy one immediately
  whats that camelbak
  thermobak 30 multicam is/was the cheapest option actually i wear a camelbak and then throw a ruck over it typically
    the entire shitpost reads like a shilling infomercial    most experienced backcountry people say    on sale a lot of places right now for 170    buy yours today
  should i cop
  arent these cotton/nylon with a leather palm  i would be interested in just how well they keep out water in cold conditions
  only if they come with the liner    not so well they could stand a waxing and oiling
  lmao
  gloves are a lot like shoes in that everybody has differently shaped hands and fit is super important i dont advise people buy gloves without making sure they fit properly    t /out/fitter
  thanks anon its hard to find 31 32 pants and ive been happily throwing money at wool stuff this winter
so ill be in 10f weather this december for about a week exactly how heavy/warm do i need to go in terms of clothing
  youre telling me you wore a jacket to the point of the material settling down and never once washed it    also carhart is junk
  depending on your activity level but insulated pants thick carhartt if not going distances or in water otherwise something like outdoor research returnia pants would be nice and a down jacket 650800 down fill would be a good idea any boots should do as long as its not some stupid generic ones with fluffy tops
  put the wool under the sleeping bag the wool will compress the down in the bag and cause you to lose loft/warmth
  northern lites or msr lightning ascents are the only answers
  i usually leave a little early on fridays for the most part i spend friday driving to the trailhead hike 510 miles in camp for the night then shoot for 40 miles over the next two days i work for one of the largest companies in the world and live in the commie shithole that is seattle i get 3 weeks of vacation a year
  my typical 1035f wearables are  nylon or similar wind resistant pants  wool socks  synthetic base layer shirt  mid layer shirt patagonia r1 is my go to but any grid fleece will do  gore tex shell  fleece liners  water proof mids  snowshoes
  fugg i wish i could come up there and do rainier/baker with someone like you got all the gear no team/partner tho    im likely going up there in a bit to go snowshoe/backpacking with my brother and his buddy for a few nights any recommended trails thinking lake dorothy/bear/deer area trying to get in 15 miles im 
  anyone have experience with furs im planning on shooting a mess of coyotes soon and harvesting the pelts thinking of what i can do with them thats /out/ related i could make clothing like a coat mittens etc or i could use them to add some comfort and insulation to my sleeping pad just how good of an insulator is coyote fur
  i should expand when youre active in the winter snowshoeing/boarding/skiing/etc you produce a lot of heat much more than normal hiking activities instead of constantly shuffling clothes i just try to keep moving and not sweat sweating will fucking kill you ive had hypothermia several times in the past few years and its extremely dangerous you basically want to lay down and do nothing and then you die so dont sweat and try not to get wet when you do come to a stop add insulating layers so that you dont lose body heat this is where your down jacket comes in handy for lunch ill add that and then drape my down quilt over my legs while i cook and eat
anyone else here trail ride sleds and camp along the way
  im actually planning on redoing dorothy lake soon myself if you want to meet up im down
  this guy mentions then so they might guess im finding out
  can you post an example of what you mean by gore tex shell
  oh god those are some fucking relics right there
  degenerates like you belong on a cross
  t city slicker basedboy  coyotes are pests
  true i genocide them on my uncles ranch and get paid for it
    hunting is the most ethical way to source meat but 99 of fur as clothing is tacky
  nigger im telling him to make the coyote hat from fallout coyotes are my favorite animal because they are so much fun to hunt
  military bags are normally rated that low and probably the best value for money youll get massive heavy and smelly though
  permission to gas me granted then carry on
who makes winter pants that doesnt look like a couple of garbage bags stitched together   looking for decent looking waterproof pants that i can take out on day hikes but still wear out on the town
  hiking in waterproof pants is silly get some uninsulated winter weight softshell pants ive got a pair of rab spires and i love them highly wind resistant and super burly fabric
  wear brown not black
  why is that have black jackets but was considering green next time
  something like this a single layer goretex weatherproof shell with no insulation
  tunnel snakes rule
anyone got experience with this one  i both hunt and hike
  aesthetic
  were the tunnel snakes
  crush the urbanite
are these a meme
  ive probably snowshoed more than anyone else in this post this year and ive never needed them theyd be convenient though sometimes the bottoms of my pants freeze if i dont wear shell pants
  its purely fashion but black clashes with stuff while brown only clashes with black i had to wear all black for a demeaning past job so i purged it entirely from my stuff
  yes they are not very waterproof but cheap as fuck very warm when dry and if youre doing shooting in the snow they rock big time
  go find out    ive got gaiters and i only trot them out during extreme cold or bad snow conditions where i know ill be breaking trail if the trail is packed you dont need them
   throw a ruck over it  youre gonna pop that bladder eventually anon
  have a pair on my 60 kamik winter boots  theyre really nice for early spring when you put a foot through the ice on a stream dry feet and no snow in your boots keeps the mud out and boots clean   only big downside is holy fuck what a nightmare to put on if your boots dont have a super solid sole dont get them theyll bend soft sole boots  buy a size up and take them off partially or fully when theyre not going to be used for a long while left mine on last summer/fall and when i got them out of storage the rubber was strained to the point it was full of cracks    still god tier for dryness
  id on jacket in top right op
  it was from a google search looks like it could be berghaus
  we have these issued to us at cif but most people just but their own gloves that are warmer and more waterproof
  that fucking smallass tent
people who buy arcteryx are the worst people on earth    hey i need to spend 600 on a jacket to show the plebs how cool i am 
  some sperg at my work lost his arcteryx challenge coin in a couch i found it held onto it for two months and then he tried to give me 100 bucks when i gave it back something wrong with these people
  the people who arcteryx is actually for either get it for free or get prodeals on it ive never met a climber that wears it that paid retail
  was issued them in alaska never wore them because most goretex civilian options are way better
  i got 3 of their jackets but always got them at 2/3 price with it to me because they actually fit and arent boxy as fuck patagucci is almost as  but is more meh mammut seems decent tho but the 3 layer goretex jackets are pricey regardless of brand
  researching and browsing the web for clothing recommendations and ideas any time i come across anything arcteryx i skip reading sure its probably good gear but id rather get another brand for 90 of the performance at 50 or less of the cost
rule of thumb for sleeping pad r value for camping on snow in temps around 100f  is 5 too low
just got some lightning ascents for 90
   tfw my regiment gave me a fuck ton of free arcteryx and patagonia and crye shit
  fucking score
  free  tell that to the irs when you get paid every week
so whats the deal with ice axe length  rei guide recommends fairly long axe  others say thats boomer shit and short axe is way to go now  some polish guide says even shorter  theres a good deal on an axe but its 66cm and im 6 so i assume its too long for me
  id stick some spruce boughs under me to be safe
  im 6 and use a 65cm ice axe
  generally longer is for glacier travel shorter for ascending/ climbing better know how to self arrest no matter what the length is 70cm is a good general purpose length
  silks and waffles are a fuckin godsend when youre stationed in co and command likes to do field exercises in winter
  axes are for walking and self arresting and tools are for climbing axes should be long and tools should be short
  welcone to alpinism its like /out/ with the armchair gearfaggotry and cancerous community but the autism levels have been cranked up to 11 whatever length keeps you safest upitty crusade against longer axes be damned
  would you say 66cm is too long for your height or could it work for beginner axe
do you need gaiters if i already have snow boots and pants with a tight velcro cuff
talk about climbing in any discipline sport trad bouldering ice alpine etc  if you can climb it come shoot the shit    climbing is an inherently dangerous activity that could cause you loss of life limb eyesight or sanity    recommended reading  ashleys book of knots  clifford w ashley  better bouldering  john verm sherman    useful links  wwwmountainprojectcom  www8anu  wwwenormocastcom    always looking to improve beta so feel free to throw in suggestions for the general  send it
bought my first trad set of cams 8 for 400 at local climbing spot made a gear sling and took it out to first creek at red rock got shut down near the end of girls and buoys due to  a lack of experience placing trad gear 2nd ever attempt at trad 1st with my own gear  b nowhere to place gear  c foot and handholds were below optimal for my comfort zone    gotta make that long hike out there and give it another shot anyone got any tips on how to git gud     pic related my cams on a rained out sunday
  is scrambling just a british thing or do other countries scramble its a super comfy way to get into rock climbing grade 1 and some easier 2 scrambles are very accessible require no real knowledge or any equipment and are tons of fun once you push onto grade 3 scrambles you might want to carry a rope and some basic gear
  us here  scramble when i need to i dont scramble for the sake of it you guys do it because there are no mountains in your miserable island banana state
  as  said i scramble when i need to in us but some mountains are just a plain scramble scrambling is fun and is the first thing that got me into wanting to do real climbing though my friends and i got spooked on a mountain and took forever to climb down looking back it really wasnt so bad    doesnt the uk have /some/ climbing though i couldve sworn yall had something     shows that ireland has more of the good stuff tho
  trad is big here  went up to stanage on the weekend
    scrambling is universal here we consider scrambling any non technical climb up to grade iii usage of anchors and some rope in grade iii is still subject to personal preference    also reminder that you can die scrambling
  looks like bouldering i consider scrambling the section of some mountains where you have to climb over rock fields for hours until you reach a steep snow slope glacier crossing or technical ascent
  it was trad albeit only 10m high i never said it was scrambling
  seems obvious but in case its not cams are good but you need a variety to make best use of features tricams  nuts can be bomber in spots a cam wont work an extra sling or two is good for rrs chickenheads    learn to focus on how the holds actually feel vs the fact that youre leading that just takes practice youre probably more stable than you think    runouts are bad when youre just learning but at some point the answer to nowhere to place gear becomes go higher if its a standard route  not hard 510 or under you can trust theres something nearby you can use
  doesnt the uk have /some/ climbing though i couldve sworn yall had something  yeah there is loads of great climbing here    here we consider scrambling any non technical climb up to grade iii usage of anchors and some rope in grade iii is still subject to personal preference  pretty much the same deal here scrambling is a great day out    2/10 but heres a you for the effort
  yeah my buddy let me use his slings and nuts on the ascent i was trying my damndest to place /something/ but just couldnt get a feel for it im probably just a puss    oh well theres always next time i should have gone higher next time im going to probably see if i can just smear a foot on the arete next to me and just pop up there like a big boy    cheers to next time
climed at cannibal crag red rock today sent mac and ronnie in the cheese 59 toprope after that led ma and pa kettle 57 sport no good pictures today though    my left big toe is hurting when i climb im not sure if its my shoes or not im running some cheapo evolvs ive had since i was a baby gym climber anyone got any tips on toe pain should i just man up my toe doesnt really hurt unless im climbing

alex honnold on jre right now    
  ayyyy hope this one is better than the first one he did alex seems to have warmed up more to interviews now too
  alex go solar and do it now honnold  the most interesting part of this podcast was discussing the czech guy otherwise it was boring as shit and i dig honnold
  honnold probably is on the spectrum somewhere desu his dad had aspbergers iirc
did some willow springs today didnt get the name of the route dont really care    fun little 55 to top out on the right side of this crack system easy top out to do some rappeling got the rope stuck and had to climb back up and unfuck ourselves my buddy recently became amga certified and did that need to learn more    how are yalls weekends starting out
going to the new to get rained on but fuck it well pull some muscles on hard overhangs
  fuck yeah bro where is the new at australia by the looks of a google search    rip it n stick it bring plenty of beer
  new river gorge west virginia
  mountain momma
  take anon home    cammy roads
    hell yeah headed out to rr a few weekends from now gonna jump on a moderate multipitchprobably birdland maybe get in some gambling on our rest day
  czech guy  adam ondra or however you spell it    anyone interested to watch climbing in the coming olympics
  jej      yeah they showed some footage of him climbing in a cave in norway and fuck me if that wasnt impressive honnold also spoke how strong the dude actually is
  right on bruh im a local so hit me up and im down to climb with you    i do mostly trad and bouldering also got a bunch of people at the local climbing gym if you need any help/shower/etc plus a good knowledge of the local dives hope you have some fun out here im sure you will    ardriseupnet
greetings from the new
  ayyyy lad what routes you guys pitching out there hope its some good stuff looks swell to me
  struggle bused up yowzah then got on lactic acid bath for shits n giggles
  those climbs look fucking killer i dig that over hang you gotta push through id like to get some alpine draws soon and use those as sport clips too    gonna try and send  along with the other climbs on the route if we have time gonna try and climb fast and hard today black velvet canyon for the first time woo    stay sendin
    if you still dont have a feel for gear placements you should be practicing placing cams and nuts while on the ground not while you also have the pressure of leading take a morning or afternoon to just walk to the base of a cliff with your rack and practice finding placements and placing and cleaning gear it definitely helped me a lot and made me more comfortable when leading because there were less things i was trying learn at once
    anon goes climbing
  lol thanks for the link
planning on going ice climbing in the winter and have been contacting guides one dude is asking for as much as 1000usd per person for a 3 day trip and that doesnt even include transpo and gear we obviously cant afford this ive found the base camp that the guy operates out of and its 5 per night to set up a tent me and a friend figured we could do the entire trip carrying most of our own gear and renting some there all in all less than 200 including food and transpo so is a guide necessary at all seems like a ripoff
  see 
  thats cute and i was expecting a response somewhat like this the difference being im not climbing alone and we will be set up at a base camp with dozons of other climbers we can get advice from hell theres even a semipermanent resteraunt there all the good climbs in the area are a short hike away and its easy to get back to camp well before nightfall
  evaluating ice is not the same as evaluating rock but you do you
  i believe that the both of us will get some training on a manmade ice wall beforehand we will be following popular routes that likely will always have other climbers on the trails paying 1 grand per person isnt an option for us tho
  if youre both following but not paying a guide whos leading
  one of us will be leading probably my friend since hes the more experienced one i meant we will be staying on the most populat trails
  ashleys book of knots maybe if youve entered a monkey fist making competition   freedom of the hills is a much better choice
greetings from seneca rocks  cell phone dead zone so this is the only picture i took from the parking lot  got to trad lead a 59 my toughest yet still a bit slow at finding the right gear  patch fell off my chalk bag sticky side of velcro became unstickified
  nice anon    thanks for the pic
i am looking for recommendations for climbing shoes for people with wide front of the foot currently have miuras that ive been using regularly for half a year the front is still way too tight and the heel is loose  the shoe actually slipped off while i was doing a heel hook  any recommendations are welcome but stuff available in europe is preferred
  are you looking for something as aggressive as the muira
  at which point does hiking uphill considered climbing
  when you consistently have to use your hands to advance
gonna go do some climbs at red rock today not sure what yet heres masters of stone 1 if anyone is bored and wants to watch it     this will only be up for a day    ircrizonnet6667  climbing  if you have any questions
  class 2
  no class 2 is just glorified offtrail hiking id say the upper half of class 4 is climbing
  something like that yes      thanks for the chart i will save it but some anecdotal recommendations are welcome as well
  just bought some la sportiva mythos cheap good all arounders i like em so far    they did not make me climb better bc i got stuck at a crux on a 510  cannibal crag last night 
  oooooh them rocks is pretty senpai theres gotta be a multipitch route somewhere all the way to the top no
  are you talking about yds class 4 or yds class 54    t european with a proper uiaa scale
  several grades are famously stiff
  a if i was talking about 54 i would have said 54  b 54 is a grade not a class
any other kentucky fags goin to the red this weekend
would you guys recommend climbing for mental health gains ive heard its pretty good for you
  yes it trains concentration mental and emotional control and problem solving
did some bouldering for the first time in awhile today only sent one v0 getting back into the groove of stuff hoping to go do some trad or sport this saturday i need to train in other ways too have a good weekend yall and climb some challenging shit
     in my opinion the best way to trust your placements and get good at placing gear/recognizing a good placement is to aid a climb on natural pro    obviously practice on the ground first and try to go out with more experienced friends/locals if you can    my journey into trad was basically just watching youtube videos about how to place gear and then soloing with shit gear plugged into easy routes i didnt really start learning/trusting my gear until i had to aid down routes i got shut down on and eventually took some falls    protip from a trad noob if youre totally freaking out its really easy to shove a big cam into a smaller constriction by overcamming the fuck out of it it might seem impossible to retrieve without a crowbar at first but depending on the placement it may be possible to individually leaver each lobe using the nut tool by wedging it between the lobe and the rock the leverage created can push the lobe further back than the handle would creating more space you can slowly work it out of the rock this way
  i definitely feel better when climbing regularly but i think that cycling helps more  climbing can be rewarding if you feel progression and find a good company to do it with a climbing partner with good rapport can be amazing even just a welcoming crowd around you at a gym while bouldering but there can be problems with sending a route or just someone rubbing you the wrong way just plain not feeling it on a certain day that can cause the mood to worsen    in comparison i found that some outdoors cardio activities can help with depressive mood and thoughts better more oxygenated blood flowing through the brain on purely physical level is good for your mental health mentally a prolonged but not too involved activity like running cycling swimming can help achieve a state of mind that is akin to meditation  just letting the thoughts flow while maintaining a point of concentration on what you are doing there were philosophers and writers who claimed that their best ideas came to them during the walks    i would advise to try different things seeing what works for you i believe ive seen a video about some climber who mentioned that going out to the rocks to boulder there is a very meditative relaxing activity
did some rap training/teaching today and sent a 510 at cannibal crag that gave me trouble last time  whats eating you fun climb had to just reach for a hold i couldnt get over and over and over again hoping to take my buddy out climbing this monday for the first time too ive been practicing anchors and leading and setting up topropes gonna have a good time all around cant wait to get back on some trad soon though    have a good vets day yall send it for the troops
  toe pain often has to do with improper shoe fitting means the toe is free to move separate from the rest of the foot and thus do most of the work that or your nails are diggin in
  nice job dude 59 at seneca is no joke have only led 54 there followed 7
  scrambling is only a mean to get to the crag
  what are 3rd class mountains
so because my gym still hasnt stocked a shoe in my bigfoot tier size im just going to order one and eat the shipping cost  are scarpa origins a good beginner shoe  nospoilersonoutalso is it a bad sign if im still on v1s after a month of climbing/nospoilersonout
  see       and just keep climbing itll get easier
some friends and i are going to japan around new years primarily for a ski trip however we will spend the second half of our trip in tokyo and kyoto doing touristy type things and i thought it would be cool to get some climbing in    i have two questions for this board    1 since itll be too cold to do any outdoor climbing and since indoor bouldering is huge out there i was wondering if anyone here has any recommendations for good gyms around tokyo    2 i think it would be cool to get a souvenir piece of gear from a japanese company to bring back and use while climbing here in the us problem is im not familiar with any japanese rock climbing brands anyone know any that make good rock climbing gear shoes chalk bags or whatever
how should i find a partner for top rope climbing my gym has no system for buddying up and i have 0 friends irl bouldering is fun but i want to do those large walls eventually
  if you dont know anyone yet dont worry there are a few ways to get partners you could make a flyer and post it in your gym or on another bulletin board there are also some forums on mountain project and maybe some fb groups where you can find partners you could also try visiting the bouldering area at really regular times and build up a rapport with other regulars there over a period of a few months and then ask them if theyre down to go climbing on the wall
lets go boys i sent my first v2    
  congrats now go get a v3 d
  ayyyy    lead a 59 sport route yesterday along with following up a 57 trad good times had by all at red rock    i really gotta start taking pictures
sent my first 7a sport outdoors yesterday feels quite nice tbqhwu
at the kneebar rest on legacy new river gorge
quick anchor set up on physical graffiti if anyone wants to check out some anchor system building    rate hate improve
  looks awesome the only difference between your anchor and the ones i make are that i only use locking carabiners even for the backups
  jfc thats overbuilt just clip a couple 120 cm slings to the bolts tie em in an over hand then clip into those
  yeah i got some more locking biners the other day i have 3 redundancies here on top of my webbing anchor which is just a quickdraw slapped on bc screw it im following why not i would use the locking carabiner on my master point and first redundancy though the more the better but lockers are expensive as fuck
  i totally get you anon but theyre worth it i use lockers for everything except draws for the extra safety
        you guys are nuts pic related is all you need and you can even drop the purple and red slings by clovehitching yourself in with the rope
sexy anchor time  1 clove in series to the lower biner first then the higher biner on the 2nd draw the lower biner on the 2nd draw will be your redirect if youre belaying off your harness for a guide mode belay see 1a  pull up the slack and belay up your second  2 the second shown with the thin rope for clarity cloves in the same way as in 1 just mirrored   3 the leader is then put on belay uncloves and the free biner is now their jesus piece except dont backclip it    strong bolts check  redundant twice cloved check  simple super check  works for swapping leads or block leading
  you got 2 anchors here  the first is the slidingx which is obviously slack so its not doing anything the second is the rope clipped to the biner straight in to a bolt thats whats doing the work here but alone it wouldnt be redundant and to top it off you have your pass clipped in      critique well its safe but its not a great setup its a bit cluttered take out the slidingx and just tie an overhand on a bight on the sling a la  this will give you a neat redundant anchor with a masterpoint and shelf the alpine draw youre clipped into the slidingx with is now unavailable for use on the route tie your rope to a locker on the shelf lose the overhandonabight method of attaching to a biner and use a clove hitch instead its much quicker and easy to tie onehanded you dont need your pas for this use your pas for when you need to untie from the rope like for rappelling and cleaning
16point anchor with real boat anchor gathered to a master point
so im teaching my buddy how to climb finally hopefully i can add a new climbing buddy to the list and get sick what would yall recommend for a new climber to get in order to be able to go out and trad climb    my list  climbing shoes that fit ls mythos are a good choice but ymmv  harness  helmet  pas points if you make yours out of webbing or prussik  2 locking carabiners  nut tool  optional but strongly recommended when following  atc guide    id like to this all of this can be gotten for maybe 300 too with a harness and shoes being the bulk of a purchase of course gear sharing is fine too    hope to see yall out there soon with some new climbers
  shoes ls finales 99  harness mammut ophir 50  helmet bd half dome 60  pas metolius 120cm nylon sling 850  locker 1 bd positron 11  locker 2 hms bd rocklock 12  nut tool whatever 1118  atc guide 30  total 285    and almost all of it is on sale 2035 off right now so the total is even less
rate my solo alpine setup  30m 8mm half rope   33m 5mm tagline  6mm prussik  atc guide  doublelength 10mm dynex runner for pas  5m 6mm cord to cut and use as needed to sling rocks if i need to bail  so far ive only gone up 55  57 routes with bolted anchors things ive noted  rapping with 5mm tagline sucks if the route is lowangle/has giant ledges easier just to downclimb if no walkoff available  should pick up some nuts  pitons and learn to use them in case i need to bail and slinging isnt viable last resort obviously  single rope raps on 8mm are surprisingly comfy
15 year old kid just became the 6th person to free climb the nose  
  way to fuckin get after it  yesterday my 3 year old scrambled up 70 of 3rd class no lie im pretty damn proud
living in a part of alaska that is currently too wet to rock climb but not cold enough to ice climb     what do you guys do to train in the off season i usually just drink and climb plastic between rock/ice season but am thinking that there may be more effective training than day drinking
  lift simply deadlifts pullups and farmers walk are all god tier climbing exercises be sure to balance pullups with benchpressing overhead press and rows add variety but you can get as fancy as you want there are plenty of books written on the topic
  fug yeah lad get em into it    my buddy got a harness and some shoes taught him belaying at the gym yesterday had a blast gonna probably go outside next weekend to send some real rock wew weather in vegas has been alright but everyone i know has been busy so its been hard to get out the past few days    stay sendin ya choss hogs
  dont really like heights but when i was younger i used to go to a sports centre with a room with a thick padded floor you could climb around that was pretty fun is that bouldering    thinking i might get in to climbing since i want to get over that fear might do some aerial tree work qualifications in the future
  yeah that would be considered bouldering a lot of people get into the sport by bouldering  you dont really need anyone or any gear to do it sans shoes and basic awareness maybe    the good thing about climbing is you get over your fears pretty quickly especially when you start learning how all the systems work together to ensure you will not fall plus you did it all yourself
    yep im the only guy at my gym who does the farmers walk single  double get lots of where tf is he going with those but seeing their pussy little forearms is all the motivation i need
got my first pair of shoes lads
  just dont lead do single pitch topropes youll have tons of fun and dont need any screws     or go lead fall and die or worse have to call rescue and be the reason why others arent allowed to have fun
  origins good choice
  yeah theyre insanely comfy way better than the rental shoes going to break them in tomorrow at the gym
  ive got a pair of those nice choice
new shoe anon is there a breakin period for shoes i wore them to the gym for the first time and had an awful lot of trouble sending anything i normally do my feet kept sliding off also they keep making this farting noise as i walk does this mean my shoes are fitting properly i thought they were tight enough certainly tighter than my street shoes i think the farting is coming from the middle of my feet   pls send help
  you gotta scuff the rubber off a little brand new soles tend to slip     also there is definitely a break in period for shoes and it is different for each model which shoe do you have
  you toprope and follow lead for atleast a season you dont just lead ice climb especially if youre just starting on rented gear you gonna die
  most shoes will take about 1020 pitches to break in farting is only a problem ive had with aggressive velcro shoes which i take off between climbs anyway it should lessen up a bit as the shoes conform to your feet but it will likely always happen
  theyre scarpa origins
any tips for getting better at bouldering im fairly new and having trouble with a lot of v3s at my local gym what do yall reccomend
  climb more      theyll stretch as you wear them you can stuff things like frozen peas inside the shoes and put weights on them like putting it under a couchs leg may work for you or you can take a shower in them and walk around in them after showering a little bit but honestly those type of casual training shoes should not be so tight that they make you uncomfortable downsizing on shoes has little to no benefit for low grade climbs
  start working v4s youll fail miserably but after a while go back to the v3s and youll float them
  climbing is as much about strength as it is about knowing how to position yourself on the wall climbing more will help develop strength no question but its also great when there is someone else who can show you how things are done especially when you start out ask more experienced friends or just people at the gym to help you see if the place where you climb offers lessons with a coach  unless you have a natural proclivity without some proper guidance you will just waste a lot of time
any good deals happening now on gear    backcountry is running some 50 off sales on clothing and gear  moosejaw has the same going on  havent seen anything from rei
  hey fellow vegas resident which gym do you climb at my wife and i started bouldering about 5 months ago were starting to really enjoy it we go to red rock climbing center a few times a week but keep hearing about how great the climbing/bouldering is at red rocks and craft boulders id love to get into some outdoor stuff but i know my technique is total garbage still    are you a brit bong by any chance
  i aint british i climb at r2c2 as well but have been going out a lot more rather than going to the gym    id love to meet you some time and climb when do you go besides schoolwork i am open pretty much all the time to do some climbing
i would be interested in cimbing but im not fit enough
  plenty of people out there not in great shape climb hard as hell bro there are tons of ways to skin a cat and the best part is they all get you fitter for the next objective    start by going to a gym or just doing some pullups hold onto things learn some knots and belay systems climbing encompasses a lot more than fitness and im sure you have those qualities in spades
injury q about 6 weeks ago i was going for a big move bouldering and ended up crimping my hand as i fell several pullies were strained no swelling or anything any anons have experience managing this
  im usually there with my wife every sunday around 500pm8pm we go a couple times during the week too around 300pm i work 600am300pm in a mill work shop but after that im usually free for whatever    im only consistently finishing v3s i can do a fe v4s but i think my technique hasnt even progressed through the basics yet and im relying on strength too much you know of any good books videosyoutube channels to get tips from     say hi if you see me around r2c2
  libgenio has john shermans better bouldering as well as freedom of the hills as for youtube channels mikebarter387 has some good climbing stuff as well as rei et al just google mountaineering techniques you will need to know them out here    for gym bouldering just do some yoga and dont rely so much on your hands the better bouldering book will help you there it just takes time i am at about the same level as you honestly    ill see you around climbing sometime definitely i might go tomorrow with my buddy ill try to see you there
  nice dude youre motivational as all get out
tfw youll never be a professional climber
  thats not what its about    tfw professional sleazeball
hey vegas bro im thinking of going to kraft boulders today if you want to go outside with me probably in next 2 hours or so ill be keeping watch on the thread let me know

vegas bros trip report    objective climb some stuff dont get skinned  outcome climbed some stuff didnt get skinned  notes overall pretty rad
  not /out/  not on teh discord
  discord is for jerrys
got a job at my climbing gym pro deals here we goooooo
  grats bruh
i didnt know there was a general here ill be visiting more newbie here at the gym how often do you guys climb im doing like 4 times a week should i go more also i dont do weightlifting should i buy some and do at home i wanna improve in every way to be better at climbing
show the state of your shoes now    on an unrelated note down here in spain we call them cats feet or just cats which is way cooler in my opinion
  forgot pic because i am retarded
  theyre beyond resoling now
  i dont climb as much as i did when i first started going to the gym but going outside is a bigger ordeal than just going to the gym    i would say you do not /need/ weights but it does not hurt to do the big 4 plus some pull ups and chins on top of it start working your core a lot imo you should just do calisthenics right now progress back to weights once youre crushing v5s in the gym or you need the extra fitness    oh and run      ive just got some mythos that are covered in sand on the bottom stupid fucking desert
  they can be resoled though anyway to be honest i never intended to resole the scarpa helix pair i ended up with much worse feelings than my sportiva finale so i am wearing the right one until i go through all the rubber and then i will send both to resole la sportiva finale those are fucking gritstone eats rubber for breakfast i wonder how contaminated stanage is and i cant even v2 outdoors lol
so realistically how long do you think it would take a new climber 29 y/o male reasonable fitness to reach the level needed to climb the north west face of half dome
  helixbro my essential shoe for plastics and bouldering
  free or aid
  depends entirely on how quickly you overcome shitting your pants from constant exposure too
    and how often to you climb outside and do you have someone to teach you to place pro and build anchors and climb it with you
  aided cimb    total newcomer to outdoor climbing    i was giving myself 6 years to learn enough find a partner etc
  that should do it if you put your mind to it
  59 c1 could easily be done in one year with focus do you live near yosemite so you can learn the subtleties of climbing polished granite cracks can you afford an aid rack or are you friendly enough to find an equipped partner    oc from the only route on half dome ive ever done and probably will ever do
  how much would a well enough waited equipped aid rack set me back as this is a long term goal i dont mind dumping 23k into equipment
  phone typing forgive the mistake
  good because it will be about 23k pic related  fucking 4channel thinks posting the link to this list is spam but i left the address in the image so you can find it easily
  also holy shit how was it and congrats
  mostly 52 cruiser super fun and mellow as long as you dont mind 90 runouts
i wanna gain some weight for aesthetic purposes what kind of exercises can i do to improve my climbing at the same time without fucking over my tendons
  i plan on doing some kind of bodybuilding/strength routine for like 34 days a week
    anything that helps core grip calf or upper body pulling strength will help climbing  gaining mass and losing flexibility will hurt climbing
anyone ever been up original route on rainbow wall anyone wanna get on it 
  well its not a matter of physical fitness because im sure your a strong dude perfectly capable  however the mental aspect of it might be more difficult at first but the biggest obstacle is knowledge and experience if you decided to take on this endeavor one might want to havea solid partner with either as much or more knowledge  also more miles with similar rock and and literally knowing your gear 100 and trusting it and the process  takin on a wall like this is something usually done after years of training and usually with a solid partner your first time  all in all though get outside and get more miles in  youll get there and send it eventually lol
  snake hike 
  yep one longass day from santa cruz and home again 21 hours iirc beat the shit out of me but fun as hell
  oh right thought they were worse than they are  and yeah stanage eats shoes i got some tcs on sale recently so they should hopefully cope well
what is the best way to belay off a thin 8mm double or a 95 single line that either has a tag line or is around a natural feature just looking for the safest rappel technique that autolocks as i understand backing up with prussiks helps with this    just wondering if the guide mode on an atc can be used for self abseil/rappeling down or if its only used on top belaying
  i figured seen as im not even aware of how little i know in regards to climbing that giving myself 5 years to get comfortable climbing finding a suitable partner to train with etc will hopefully be enough time no hard of it takes longer though
  damnit i didnt mean belay off a thin i meant rappel off a thin    derp
    i have 82 halves and ive never backed up or changed the way ive used my atc guide to rap on them they have less friction but braking is still just fine and ive never felt unsafe
  i usually go to the gym 23 times a week any more and my elbows start hurting a lot got shitty joints from arthritis  i know some people who train 56 times a week though so its really up to you i think that training too often when starting out is not a very good idea because muscles need rest to heal and develop
  cats are what people call crampons in russian interestingly enough
  rappelled using belay devices before without issues both pigsnout atc types and longer reverso types a figure eight is a bit more pleasant to use though  for selfarrest prusik is used although in my experience it slows down the process a lot there a several ways to set this up so find some materials on how to use it proper manufacturers include instructions for belay and rappel with their belay devices if there is nothing else
yer all gonna die
so im currently climbing v4sv5s and 59 at the gym and i think my current limiting factor is my general technique    i can do 18 pullups in a row have decent grip strength and in general am relatively strong my flexibility is ok i can touch the floor in front of me and do yoga semiregularly   at the gym i notice myself powering through climbs almost hamfistedly and getting tired too quickly  i want to be a more graceful climber with skills that are applicable outdoors in general being nimble is much more useful than being strong i think     i will of course just keep climbing to get better  but i was wondering what are specific technique things i should look at while climbing to apply my strength in a more fluid way
  v5  59  first you need to talk to your gyms setters about fixing their grading because v5 should be equivalent to about 512
  download better bouldering from libgenio and read it it will tell you everything you need to know  it was written by the guy that really developed bouldering in hueco tanks    as for one dirtbag to another focus on breathing and taking it one move at a time in my opinion v45 and 59 in the gym can be reached by anyone flexible or not honestly you are probably plenty strong and flexible but from what it sounds like your fingers and mind still are not there breathe take it slow and know the routes onsighting gym problems means literally nothing so do not get discouraged if you arent just chugging it just keep on giviner
  wow18 pull ups  tell me more about that 
    i know im asking to be redpilled here but ive been only indoor bouldering for about two months     i really dig it however besides my technique i feel like i could use a bit more of an athletic body should i just stick to general fitness for example stronglifts or something like that for the whole body and add some grip training into it    i know my technique will have to improve as well but i would like to work on those two aspects im not able to climb 23 days a week most of the time only once
  i used to be in the same boat as you do not go down the bodybuilding route their bodies are not the best to get a athletic and b up big ass rocks    do calisthenics do yoga smoke some pot go run    bodybuilding is neither stronglifts would probably be good to fill up in your offtime but dont go for 6pl8 diddies try to get to 10 pull ups instead    tldr calisthenics n yogurt  buttbuildin
  dont tease me anon ε 
  actually hm i know that the rating systems dont tend to be objective as they should be but are v5s really supposed to be that hard   maybe its the fact that its a gym i know that v4s in a gym are easy v2s outside
  ok anon will do thanks for the kind words
  gym grades are always waaay soft relative to outside but they should still try to have some internal constancy between their bouldering and climbing walls
    59 should be about as hard as an easy v0
  ok well that just seems silly
    thanks for your reply i was thinking about doing some lifts for about 23 months just a small beginner program to just get some more genaral strenght definetely not going for a lot of gains just want to transfom from skinnyfat     im going to try to run a lot as well just to get sharper    i appreciate the info and you think the calisthenics is the route to go
  i second that  seems a bit silly lol at that rate we should all be cruisin 10s and 11s and even 12s on gear
    opinion noted but irrelevant whether you like it or not those are the approximate equivalencies in the real world if you can boulder v5 you should be able to cruise 510
  yeah but can you boulder a 512
  yeah i stopped doing bodybuilding style workouts and started doing calisthenics then started doing climbing i had tried climbing before when i was b odybuilding i was far better when i did calisthenics i was more flexible and stronger everywhere especially core and arms    /fit/ are fucking idiots trapped in their own crab bucket be in shape and youll be sthetic trust me calisthenics running flexibility  those will get you the body of a fucking spider monkey
  yep im a pretty solid 11/12 and max out at v4/5 granted bouldering takes a different kind of strength  balance but thats way too big of a gap
on bouldering grades and yds grades this blog post is the best discussion ive seen about them      of course what constitutes a v5 boulderer or a 512 climber is debatable highest redpoint average grade in your send pyramid onsight ability you gotta be honest with yourself when considering these things
might go out to kingman this weekend and do hualapai wall rusty pipe and funky buttlovin are on the list    anyone got any beta for the area all appreciated    send
  yer gonna die
looking to start building my trad rack  im thinkin  bd cams 33  dmm wallnuts  maybe metolius tcus 14  tricams pink/red/brown
  are tricams commonly useful where you climb  cams id probably just buy bd 043 x2  dmm wallnuts are fucking tits their groove is wonderful  and finally my absolute favorite trad gear are my dmm offset alloy nuts
  theres enough horizontals and pockets around that i usually see them on others racks
  fair enough theyre light relatively inexpensive and bomber many places any other type of pro is crap so might as well
so ive recently been getting into /out/ activities camping has been something ive been enjoying an immense amount     i really want to start camping out on public lands not at a camp site where i can get a real sense of being in nature     i have a vision of sorts or an experience i keep thinking about that i want to have i essentially want to be able to drive through a small but long simple trail of some sort through some beautiful woods and scenery along the trails there are areas where i can pull off and then backpack to a perfect clearing a couple miles away     alternatively driving through and over some southwestern hills in the evening with canyons in the background until i get to a open gorge under a cliffside where i decide to park i set up a tent against my car spend the evening in front of a campfire and eventually go to sleep under an ocean of stars above my head     or driving through some forest around the base of a mountain until i come to a large lake i can park at the edge of the forest set up so that i have a view of the lake and mountain behind it when i come out of my tent in the morning before fishing a fresh breakfast     is this a completely stupid idea of what is legal or feasible are there places i can drive through beautiful public lands that lead to areas for primitive camping or something of the sort
  wtf did i just read
google state dispersed camping
  dispersed camping  thanks a ton anon i think this is actually exactly what i was looking for
  youre a hero guy
    sno prob have fun
  is this a completely stupid idea of what is legal or feasible are there places i can drive through beautiful public lands that lead to areas for primitive camping or something of the sort  the amount of public land in the us thats free for dispersed camping is larger than most us countries the majority of national forest and bureau of land management land is free to camp on for up to two weeks before you have to move at least 5 miles
  sorry larger than most european countries i need to go eat something im getting hangry
    bureau of land management blm  manages about 2483 million acres of federal lands as of 2017  united states fish and wildlife service fws  manages about 891 million acres  national park service nps  manages about 798 million acres  united states forest service fs  manages about 1929 million acres  total 6101 millions acres 95328125 sqmiles or 24689871 sqkm about 27 of the usa        seems theres only 9 countries in the world that are larger than 246 million square kilometers counting only their land area i bet theres a shitload of camping to be done out there
  where do you even live why do you guys come with your blog post question telling us of your stupid dream but you cant even include where the fuck you live whats cool in one state or country might not be cool in another you dreams are possible they tend to be in some 3rd world shithole thats underdeveloped and has access to a lot of in touch land think of south america if you live in kansaswell its hard to give you more info
  maybe some people are able and willing to cross state boundaries anon      my friend what you are looking for is the sierra eastside
  they are but most are not ive been on 21 hour plane ride just for an /out/ experience flew from wa state to japan wanted to explore suicide forest hike mount fuji mount hiei bunch of other shit to me it seems like this guy wants to take a casual car ride near by near by bring a few hours maybe even a days worth drive it helps so much more when people include details of their location how far theyre wanting to go etc i dont want to describe the most amazing place you tell me no cause its not within a 5 hour drive of detroit
anything and everything packs post them  questions current packs potential new packs    i had been sporting a yukon 48 for years and upgrades to a crown2 60 to get into more backpacking is there any reason to keep the old yukon i cant seem to find one but it would be a waste to just toss/donate a 120 pack
for heavy pack i wanna add little wheels and tow like this    ive got a alps commander freighter frame and us army molle plastic frame pack to play with    like this but with light cheap about 6 plastic wheels w/out bearings on hollow shaft    the shaft would be lashed to bottom of frame with bungie cord which would also serve as the suspension    idea is to take the load off and save yourself for the few times you really need to be hiking    im trying to figure out 2nd uses for the wheels and axle mostly the wheels lol im nuts about duel use to save weight and space    a center mono wheel would be best for rougher terrain but require better more restrictive mounting to waist to keep pack from flopping
  i just shelled out and ordered pics related last night  i always thought osprey was a meme but the thing is fucking 1lb 13oz its also much cheaper than anything close to its weight and has everything i want
  in fact its probably not the right pack for you its for people who pack lighter go further and think smarter this pack isnt on instagram because phones are too heavy and views look better in your mind anyway
  never noticed that description they used lol they really know their demo definitely not subtile marketing but the thing looks amazing plus 100 dollars less than anything else sub 2lb with a frame
    ive got their 34l for day hiking but damn if that 45l for backpacking isnt what ive been looking for it almost makes me regret my crown2 60lbecause osprey packs ride so nicebut i dont know if i can justify another 186 for an additional bag ive already got 4 bags ranging between 95125 then again i do get my rei dividend early next year and i have a dicks gift card worth 125 maybe i can sell them both off and swing for the pack
kifaru packs are expensive but their frames are so good and bear weight so well i can easily carry in 5070lbs on a backpacking trip and it feels like 30 with an osprey or gregory     this shit will last forever and if you do more than a a few days in the woods each year it will pay off in the long run     i recommend the kifaru reckoning it can expand very large but is also fine for an overnighter
whats the word on the ll bean continental rucksacks any good
kifaru is the best waist belt system and its not even close i recommend the muskeg 5000 for most people
    samefag sorry both the reckoning and muskeg are great packs the 22mag is good for day trips     i realize its outside of most peoples budget but this is a buyonce cryonce deal and yes there are plenty of good packs for half the price but kifaru is american made and has proven testing behind all of their shit
i have a gregory baltoro 95 pro its totally ridiculous but it packs down nice and id rather have the flexibility than 3 backpacks
  do you only have 1 pair of shoes too different activities call for different gear and having the right thing is waaay more comfortable i have a baltoro 75 exos 48 osprey manta 28 and rei flash 18 plus a beater crag pack a kid carrier my wife has 3 packs
tatonka lastenkraxe with lk35 pack im thinking about upgrading to a waterproof pvc bag instead of the lk but them i would need to sew drings on itor something which would destroy the waterproofness
berghaus cyclops ii vulcan bretty nice bag bros
kelty redwing 50 for me its a good size for 23 nighters
heres a question if shtf and you were driven into the woods what pack would you want to haul around and survive out of what pack would you feel would hold up to being continually abused over a period of years
  my berghaus posted above its durable comfortable and roomy theres not too much more id ask from a bag honestly i might carry a utility belt lol and/or general shoulder bag/dump pouch and camelbak so its not like the berghaus shoulders everything what about you
  i only have an old ll bean backpack and a 15 special i picked up so i was mainly looking for recommendations
  meh before i found that bag on cl for 120 dollars fuck the ebay prices i lugged a teton mountain ruck the 65l iirc i have much of the same praise for that bag and in fact if the berghaus failed tomorrow it wouldnt sting so bad because i have a great backup ready to go vice versa if i ever lost the teton for some reason i mean teton isnt tacticool or over engineered but its good quality and a good entry point buy one and you can be confident you have something good
  i saw the karrimor sf predator 30 mentioned at one point and have been debating one of those or the ll bean continental rucksack as mentioned in  there are just so many options that its all a bit overwhelming to get into from the outside same with boots really lots of money involved and buying them requires you to pull the trigger fairly blind
  its a fashion piece
bags take the bulk of my investment in /out/ equipment i fucking love bags and have a duck tone of gucci equipment     here is just my foliage hpg shit i also have an umlindi in a different colorway and a tad fastpack litespeed
  pic related
  nah man for 60 bucks you can get into the teton bag and nobody will shit talk it outside of extreme ultralighters or gear queers just go for that find out what you like about it then go from there you can check out hillpeople or the berghaus site for options moving forward from there dont go whole hog and drop hundreds into a configuration you might not like
  its just a stupid comparison as shoes are designed for a variety of end cases comfort running hiking looking good and fun backpacks hold shit the real question is is the exclusion of marginal weight worth the extra storage  price of additional backpacks for me that is no
  just got the tarahumara with the insert in foliage and trying to figure out how to run it whats your set up like
osprey atmos ag 50 used it once so far fucking amazing coming from the teton shitbag i used to tote around
  picture for ants my apologies
  nice fannypack
    nice osprey aether70 is my next bag i was just amazed by the suspension system testing it in the store
euroboss here i use boreas and can recommend deuter
  neckbeardgear
can anyone post the infographic on how to pack for a trip just got pic related osprey kestrel 48l
   gear   t ultralight fag
ctrl f osprey  7 results    fuckin yuppies
  based berghaus owner
  like what to carry in it for a day hike just some water food necessary tools small knife water filter etc a layer and your first aid kit       its the shit       pretty sure milsurp is quintessential neckbeard gear
  osprey bags are cheap af
so i had a busy measure me for my aether 60 i never even went in the store to take it out because its too far away all the measurements we did pointed exactly to a medium am i fucked or should i be good     im 58 175lbs
  fucking talk to text jesus christ i had a friend measure me
  love my crown2 its so fucking light but still holds everything with ease since its a top loader nice and rigid with good supports too though i havent taken it on more than a weekend hike/camp trip yet
who else /frameless/ based burn name a better frameless pack
  that bedrock sandals sticker    good shit i love mine
  weight on your setup whats your shelter look like anon
external framebros where u at
  haha good eye i hiked the tahoe rim trail in them to see if id like them and i did wear them whenever the going allows    current three season base weight is floating around the 65lb mark  is my current shelter 9x6 dcf tarp borah bivy bag and a sheet of window insulation film i use a dcf solomid in windier more exposed places
  its a perfect comparison as backpacks are also designed for a variety of end cases the difference in weight doesnt even enter into it its the way they pack load distribution and comfort with different sized loads theyre designed to carry the size load theyre designed to carry if you have 40l of gear its going to be more comfortable to carry in a 40l pack than a half empty 90l pack or an overstuffed 30l pack
  gotcha
    superior simple version
  thats the one i really wanted its fucking nice but i got the atmos for 139 couldnt pass it up
  im 59 178 medium is comfy as fuck for me you should be fine
    height and weight are only secondarily related to pack fit torso length is the most important
  another shot of my current shelter 
  osprey bags are cheap af  the same type of soccer moms and dude bruhs who drink pabst blue and battony chop chop im from the bay area in the woods are the same people who buy osprey
  or people who find them comfy adequate and dont care about the opinion of some autistic armchair outdoorsman best warranty in the game and theyre tough as fuck
  they are adequate for most people if you want to be a true wilderness person and spend more than 10 days a year camping the osprey just wont hold up
  nigga have actually used any of that because it doesnt look like you have
  hows that husqvarna axe treating you
  and battony chop chop  so battoning with a knife is recognized as being peak dumbassery and im not wrong in thinking so
  all of it a lot except the buttpack and kitbag which are fairly new but you get what you pay for the ute is maybe 4 or 5 years old and still looks like new only a few places where the age shows in stains and small wear and tear but at a distance it still looks fresh
  its aesthetic i tell you that reminds mebof seven years in tibet
15 backpack we offer a lifetime nononsense noquestionsasked warranty for any issues that arise with our product  150 backpack we offer a one year warranty where well repair it if we deem youre not at fault and then you can fuck off
  what are you on about
  i was looking at some more expensive bags from bigger companies and one thing that stood out was the piss poor warranties that seem to be on the premium side meanwhile my budget outdoor products backpack has an eternal warranty on it and i paid 15
  osprey just wont hold up  people very commonly thru hike the big three trails with them  to bad they arent made of kevlar and have 4 different axe holders with extra pockets for your rock collection you megautist
  this     i think people have a very skewed idea of how durable outdoor gear needs to be as long as a bag is made well its materials are next to inconsequential short of ot being made out of paper
  to bad they arent made of kevlar and have 4 different axe holders with extra pockets for your rock collection you megautist  one theory of human evolution is that protohumans gained their first true advantage by learning how to huck rocks like a motherfucker
anybody got a recommendation for a great framed hunting backpack    i have a alps outdoors commander   x pack which is great for how many pieces it is and its carry tolerances but after i got my rei flash 60l as my regular backpacking pack i got spoiled     the 95lbs that the alps pack is bogus compared to the 3lbs of my rei pack     i was told to go with exo stone glacier kifaru or kuiu     any opinions on the matter
  osprey just wont hold up  plain wrong plus they have an awesome warranty and wicked customer care
greetings from /k/
is this a good first backpack ive only been innawoods car camping once in florida    i wanna get more into camping/hiking/backpacking

   name a better frameless pack    kumo is pack endgame   i love mld though i have the monk tarp and a few other things from him looking to get the fkt quilt soon too its pretty genius
  fkt quilt  i have it and love it it is definetly not the warmest quilt in the game i have slept in it at around 30f and been just ok with all my clothes on but its a fantastic 25 season synethic quilt   kumo  doesnt that have wacky thin straps my burn has the prophet straps which are now standard i think they are so comfy   just looking at the kumo now and it does look awesome but has a ton of features i wouldnt need so the burn still wins for me as its such a simple pack  monk tarp  literally about to order one to add to my ever growing austic tarp collection
  i have a prophet and i find the kumo straps just as comfortable if not better the straps break in really nicely they kind of remind me of a much sturdier memory foam type of material that adjusts to your body    the monk is peak ultralight enlightenment a lesson in refined simplicity  when i was getting into ul gear that description actually seemed so cool to me    for anyone interested in the kumo looks like it is on sale right now they came out with a new more durable version but the 2018 normal model is plenty durable i have over 3k miles on mine
    i was thinking of the murmur when i metioned the crazy thin straps go look at them they are absurd
  i have a 9x45 tarp that i have used a bunch but its a diy jobie a friend made and while its great i dont trust the tie outs 100 my current go to tarp is 9x6 which is a great size but i would love a small tarp with mlds build quality so cant wait to get my monk
  yeah bro honestly anything will do you really dont need a wicked backpack or anything going out for a night or two or just some day hikes
  yeah the murmur strikes me as a day pack version of the kumo but i know some people thru hike with it those straps are pretty thin
  thanks man
  took crown 2 on long trail thru hike can confirm op it is a good backpack v light and the hip belt pockets are really nice for snacks
  in a framed backpack this doesnt make much of a difference unless you pack like a tard
  good luck climbing/scrambling/trail running/going to an office with a 95 liter pack
  objectively wrong
just bought a berghaus 65l trailhead pack  did i do good or am i a sucker  i remember berghaus being great back in the day but i bought this thing sight unseen with no research
  i bought this thing sight unseen with no research  then no you did not do good
  there was only 2 reviews on amazon        everything else i found online seemed like just corporate dicksucking reviews    like this dudes is wayyyyyyyy nicer than what i got   and my other choice was       the kelty redwing 50 /k/ says its the approved entry level innawoods bag
    no idea  all i see is osprey and now hill people is the new yuppy go to brand
  looking for a 40l motorcycle pack or at least something that is waterproof and can easily be lashed to the pillion seat of a motorcycle looking at the nelsonrigg hurricane but id prefer something that opens fully and not just at the top any suggestions are appreciated
  pretty basic you could get a better ruck for the same price its also a outdated design    watch  learn like a pro  
  thats a medium right wanted to get one but people on yt bitch about it in comparison to large is the chimney really to narrow
does anyone know of any good 40l packs with lots of molle webbing on them im not a tacticool fag i just like having extra pouches/addons for better organization instead of one fat 40l compartment
  whatever you can reason to justify your gearfagness
  whatever you can reason to justify having the wrong gear
  look up seek outside packs external frame and made of xpac
    ive just got the 60l for te araroa ive always found osprey packs super /comfy/ and the low weight seems perfect for my needs
  im not a tacticool fag  t wannabe tacticool fag
  i like my alps outdoor commander    us army molle ruck is fucking trash  t former uncle sam buttslave  molle assault pack kind of sucks too but lbt assault packs are good
best osprey pack around 120150    for multiple days trips

okay couldnt find a thread so im starting one    i fly drones for a living i love to do it and its the one thing i want to keep pursuing    recently i got tired of dealing with people and i want to get my self a small tent and just get myself into a local forest or big open area where i am able to wild camp    i want to film and take photos tho so i want to take my filming equipment with me    i have everything packed up and settled except for one details im trying to go around    how do i get electricity to charge my stuff solar panels are a nogo in the uk i thought about buying a generator but i cant find one small enough to take with me    i dont have any vehicle so transporting stuff will be on my bagpack only any sugestions
  also see this thread  since theres a lot of rc people in it and theyd already have methods im sure
    thank you so much  its my two major problems atm finding a way to maintain energey and looking into a light transportation method i carry a big bagpack and its heavy    right now im focused on finding the solution to the electrics
    just search for portable generators
  you might need to get a cart if youre carrying around a generator and drones as well as a tent/sleep gear
  drones  go away
    without the generator i can fit everything on a single bagpack tent included    i plan on travelling by train and get some hikes if needed but i still need some ground covering now and then    my idea is if i manage to survive dartmoor for one week without anything besides my material and some food im going somewhere even far more desolated     i really want to get away from people for a while
    someone here never camped on top of a mountain
  every method of generating electricity will require some volume if you cant carry anything extra what do you expect
car battery
  a solution      second time i get this advice thanks for the input will check out
    no nigger no no no no     build a pack using 18650 cells that fits your capacity needs and your size requirements     then again you may not even need a pack if you just bring the charged cells dispersed evenly in your pack and a power adapter that takes them to make usb
  solar panels are a nogo in the uk    what the fuck why not
  what does any of that have to do with the fact that drones dont belong in the fucking woods
  they have more of a right to be in the woods than dirt bikes atvs or vehicles asshat   hurr dis lil electric motor n spin spins gon fug up de wildniss    please die
  nice strawman faggot theyre just annoying as shit  bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  i had some cunt watch me for a good 10 minutes while i was 1600 up royal arches in yosemite
    mountain  calls a mountain woods    im not sure if you are just an idiot or just have very poor communication skills to convoy a message perhaps both    i would like to stay on topic tho and as far as i am aware this board is directed at people who enjoy the outdoor life and flying with vr goggles over a huge forest or on top of snowy mountains happens to be one of the best things i get in life
  he thinks watching tv is /out/
out of stock for now but ive been looking for something like this preferably a bit cheaper 
find a way to make a biolite on crack   use that fucker to charge your batts  burn down the fowerst to feed be bzzzz
why couldnt you just buy a few portable power banks     charge them at your house then use them as you need
  looks like an outrageously expensive car jumpstart battery thats like 100 bux it would take days or weeks for a portable solar array to recharge that what youre looking for doesnt exist anon if it did it would solve the entire worlds energy problems

300 flat tarps are pretty nice
    raise a family like you are supposed to do
  pete is that you
  gdiconyard tier how many tiberium did that thing cost 3000 5000
  that one is not my style but this op is right custom made high end boats in general are the ultimate outdoorsmen luxury item as far as gear there is a split between people who seek high end antique items corsican knife and those who are looking for the hottest tech gear scarpa boots    the real split is more at the activity level wicked rich people do specialty activities with a real high barrier to entry kite surfing paragliding helisking  in more exotic locations
  that one is not my style but this is right op
  what does a 300 tarp offer that makes it better than a tent at that cost
  ultralight

  does it also reflect heat back inside

    that tent must get so hot in the sun definitely wouldnt want to use it during the summer unless i was in a dense forest

  arent most roof racks only rated to 100lbs unless youre an anorexic female i would imagine the roof collapsing
chink shit general  tell me about some cheap ass gear
  if i ever had enough money to buy a boat like that it sure as hell is going to be more like pic related rather than a massive fiberglass boat especially if youre going to leave us waters
  my country is pretty big mates i need to explore her somehow
  that rating is just for a payload while moving
  its made of dcf thats about it its up to you to work out whether the properties of dcf make it worth the money
  this    even if they dont work giant guns like that will pretty much tell speed boat pirates to fuck off but they are cheeky fearless bastards who are betting they are defanged and ammoless so who knows you are probably better off having deranged cannons that can aim at something but not fire then crew up with the best 50cal sniper rifles and assault rifles as you can legally do i mean shit real cannons take a pretty large amount of people to make them work unless you are mounting a howitzer and then they are only good against large slow moving targets not speed boats which are the mainstay of pirates now

i am heading north of mayo yukon this winter and i havent dealt with cold like they get up there whats the best coat for the job budgets not an issue the company i am working for is paying for it
  i actually have a canada goose snow mantra parka but i get the feeling it might not be enough for what i am doing i know if i layer enough i should be fine with that but i am still on the fence
  fuck i didnt describe what i am doing i am going to be out doors a lot on a drill rig standing around not moving most of the time
  i have a snow mantra too its as warm as they come get some thick base and mid layers and youre good and pic related
  any suggestions on things like snow pants does canada goose still make those rig suits i was thinking of just getting one of those one piece suits and wearing my parka on top with a pair of coveralls over that or is that overkill
      if youre wearing this stuff at work make sure whatever you get meets the site safety regs for hiviz fr etc
  literally nigger tier brand that niggers save up 10 years to afford and show off in the hood
  well ive consistently seen the canada goose expedition parka listed as the 1 for a few years now and arctech seems to be getting popular    personal experience id recommend the eddie bauer down parka it has a lifetime warranty and works very well
  does canada goose still make those rig suits  sure      boy this is an expensive looking thread
  1000    why so expensive  brand shit
russian milsurp cunt
  you might want to to get out of the /out/ gear and more into the high viz work wear stuff maybe a freezer coat
  just to add i know really nothing about them other than they are proofed for long exposure for something absurd like 75 degree temps its real specialty stuff
  as much as they are presently a fashion house they did cut their teeth making really high end out door jackets
    just a tip dont put all your eggs in the same basket layer properly or no jacket will be enough to keep you warm in serious cold
  how cold does it even get in mayo ive kept warm in 50 just with a dickies bib a dakota parka and some cheapish layers underneath
    the point of the outer shell jacket is just to keep the elements out more specifically wind and wetness underneath you wear the actually warm stuff which usually means a base layer full body underwear of material that can channel off sweat like merino wool there are different thicknesses for different use cases if you plan to stand around a lot in the cold then choose the thickest  above you were a thick layer of isolating material regular wool usually pullovers or a thick wool jacket
  well they are a warm climate people so i can believe the ones whove migrated north are a good baseline for what constitutes warm outdoor wear
    expensive due to top end materials stuffed full of high fill power down just like tnf they started out making high end gear and still do even though they go after the mall crowd too     you can find higher fill power down used in ultralight insulation garments but there is very little of it in them
mountain hard wear absolute zero parka
  mountain hard wear absolute zero parka  sounds like an anime martial arts move
  spiewak golden fleece nyc public safety parka i bought one at a thrift store for 8 with the tags still on and holy fuck its incredible i work outdoors as a lumberjack and right now its 6c and i dont feel a damn bit of cold when im working really hard it also has vents that unzip to keep me from getting super sweaty it has fleece lined hand warming pockets deep enough to put my hands in while wearing work gloves has two hidden pockets on either side of the main zippers plural it has two main zippers as well as a button over flap so rain and wind stay the fuck out and inside pockets for more storage adjustable sleeves at the wrists so you can tighten it and either put the sleeve over your gloves and tighten around them or tuck the sleeves into your gloves theyre pretty fucking nice imo and even though i paid less than 5 of what they cost if anything happens to mine ill be ordering a new one at full price the same day
ll bean maine mountain parka is rated for 45f while active properly layering with that should have you all set
  they dont even make that anymore based on their website
  what kind of work are you doing    if its manual labour kind of stuff where youre going to be mostly active and durability / abrasion resistance is important id suggest just getting some oversized coveralls and then layering properly underneath this is how my grandparents always did it working on a farm in canadian winters    if its more delicate / sciency stuff where youre less active then something like  would be fine ive worn one of those jackets on denali and it was solid too warm for a lot of applications but fine if youre not very active
  most outdoors companies have a fairly equivalent jacket anyway so its mostly a matter of which you can find in stock / suits your budget / tastes    mountain hardwear has the absolute zero parka  north face has the himalayan parka  marmot has the 8000m parka  feathered friends has the rock  ice parka  western mountaineering has the snojack parka  patagonia has the grade vii parka    etc    personally if going for a strictly warm down parka i would buy feathered friends or western mountaineering
    i tend away from looking for one awesome piece of clothing and more towards layering     right now i wear a thermal shirt a light wool sweater a down coat and a wind/rain shell keeps me perfectly warm in just about anything
  thats perfectly good for 0f but when its so cold your spit bounces you need more
    i suppose maybe i wasnt considering quite how cold it gets where the op is goin     ill shut up  take notes now lol
  take it from someone who lived in the arctic for 8 years almost everyone wears canada goose when it is 40
  ive seen lots of arctic drillers and work crews wearing hely hansen work snow suits with lots of reflectors on them also many people using carhart snowsuits get the best pair of warmest boots you can find get good long underwear buy a real fur muskrat hat once you get up there your canada goose will be fine
are heated jackets a meme    nb shitpost as others have said layering is key wherever you go but the heavy down jacket seems to be crucial when its below 0 keep in mind that if youre on a rig you have no insulation above around or below you the wind chill will cut harder and you have nowhere to escape from it     good luck with your job fren
surplus caf artic weather parka you can find em at any surp store for around 120 cad they are warm and cover your knees the real key for cold weather is several layers of thermal underwear
  thanks thats the kind of advice i ve been looking for
  helly hansen winter parka gets me through 35c winters when layered properly
why arent you using a crotch pot /out/
  looks like it could be a chindogu
  cityout nonsense
feathersticking there is literally no reason to do it besides wasting time
  you mean they do it when everything is super dry and theres plenty of sources of dry tinder and kindling laying all over the woods all the while they have a mini gas stove in their pack
  yes but even when its raining/has rained it doesnt take long to get some dry tinder
  its not bait im just curious what other people find dumb inb4 this thread
  that really depends on where you are but you are correct since making a feather stick is a rather quick and easy thing to do once youve trained a bit on how to make it properly and have a nice sharp knife
you guys find the dumbest shit to get mad over least those /pol/ tards have legitimate reasons to be mad but man you guys are autistic
  ultralight in its entirety if you cant carry 60 pounds while climbing a mountain you dont deserve to be /out/
  you can carry 60lbs i wont and will be less tired at the end of the trip than you will be
  trying to outtoughguy people who hike for 200 days straight eating nothing but cold oatmeal and peanuts sleeping on half a thin ass sleep pad under a tiny tarp while you need 60lbs of safety blanket shit seems silly     comparing completely different forms of /out/ to each other and claiming yours is the best and only way is my favorite dumb thing /out/ does
  ultralight isnt pointless if you are doing long distance hiking hiking 25 miles a day for 3000 miles with over 60 lbs on your back will permanently fuck your joints up
      see  
  besides wasting time  didnt know i had to get a fire going right meow who cares if some one is wasting time its not your time theyre wasting
what happens if i use diesel in these rather than 1k kerosene     i like to use these indoors instead of candles for the more intense glow and lack of soot indoors mostly kleenheat costs 11/gallon but diesel is 3/gallon and my understanding is that diesel and kerosene are very similar     am i g2g
  it will go super nova and ignite the atmosphere
  will it work yes most likely it will also burn much dirtier and smell awful and if you burn it indoors will most likely irritate your throat and/or eyes
  my understanding is that diesel and kerosene are very similar   you know how i know you failed freshman chemistry
  you make a really pretty molotov
  how
  because theyre not
  just no
  my understanding is that diesel and kerosene are very similar   my understanding  understanding    am i g2g  youre g2s
knows just enough to be dangerous
  yes it works dont use these inside regardless of the type of fuel they create copious amounts of carbon monoxide
  dont use these inside regardless of the type of fuel  what about alcohol or gas lamps
  there is no sweeter sleep than the kerosene dream
  it will smoke more your ceiling will become black and nasty the glass with become completely sooted up in no time where do you live that k1 is 11 a gallon for crying out loud
any damage how have you been holding up    i havent slept since the big one the aftershocks happening every 5 minutes are really keeping me up i had been trying to make a drinking game of it yesterday but it just got way to heavy    i was getting up to go rock climbing down at byron glacier when it hit my water pipes burst and flooded my garage but managed to fix all that and have a disaster party with some friends
  nearly 200 earthquakes since friday  70 quake    well
  thats quite the pickle to be in
  just put it in 4 wheel drive and youll be alright
  this is why i pack a shovel jacks and saw in my vehicle so i can get my vehicle out of any hole or cross any crevice ive had to do so about 5 times in 30 years but damn it is nice to do so
do you guys ever take girls /out/ what do you do when they get hysterical
do you take girls /out/  yes    what do you do when they get hysterical  well im not in high school and im dating a decent human being so this isnt an issue for me
  fpbp
jus date a grill who isnt an abosolute lunatic and can handle being outside
      i have problems with this when i was with my ex i didnt want to go out to the same places over and over again and i only wanted to fuck all day in bed    i like to go out for multiple days with some goals in harsh or adventure conditions but i never understand why i would take a woman with me and a willing woman i want to fuck not go outdoors with id rather invite my capable buddies no homo i dont know why but this strikes me as very true and common sense
  this i sometimes think it would be cool to find a woman whos capable of keeping up and gets as excited about the outdoors as i do but thats not very realistic and she wouldnt offer anything my guy friends cant except being a distraction
  you could find some feral thats been living in the mountains all her life
    yes i do take them /out/    if they get hysterical  i simply dont care and carry on what i was doing at most i ask them whats wrong and if they want to go back they will go back alone cant have them spoiling my free time
  as with anything thats prone to panicking dont take them anywhere until they think of you as calm and reliable in a real emergency things that trust you dont freak out as bad
  overcompensating this hard
    i am not its the truth i like to go alone or with experienced people i would rather stay indoors and fuck the woman or not take her with me it just makes perfect sense to me i hope youre not one of those misguided fags that think to date a woman you must follow her around or show her all your hobbies and bear the burden of having her around at all times nowadays you can date online to fuck or just be clear with your partner about the things you like to share or not
  what do you do when they get hysterical  just run away from them and finish the hike by yourself in peace
  i would rather stay indoors and fuck the woman or not take her with me    why is it either/or are the 2 mutually exclusive is fucking womens only purpose you sound like a real catch
  having your gf around is a burden  only share a physical connection  gee i wonder why your gfs are all of the ex variety
  guess how i know youre a kissless virgin of the basement variety
  how is this even an issue unless youre taking them on some arctic expedition that youve failed to plan for correctly or unless its their first time /out/ and you take them for a ten day 100km stay deep innawoods in which case youre the /out/ equivalent to the /k/ommandos that think its funny to give a 12ga with a high brass buckshot to a girl who has never shot before and tell her to tuck it lightly into the area just above her shoulder not many adult women are going to get hysterical asking this questions means youve not only never taken a woman /out/ but that youve simply never taken a woman
    im assuming were talking about stereotypical roasties by reading the op i dont like roasties out a woman colleague is no problem        a roastie around is a burden i dont like to go on adventures with a gf they always warrant attention wether you like it or not its exhausting and unnecessary i would rather chill i dont see the problem with that
  sounds like you hang around the wrong women or more likely believe the r9k echo chamber and have reached these conclusions without ever having had a real conversation with a real woman my wife hikes me into the fucking ground when we backpack
  this id take my wife /out/ with me way before any of my friends
  just car camp with them or find a chick who is into the outdoors you dont have to date a girl who doesnt share the same interests as you just because theyre willing to sleep with you
i do and the only time she panics is when theres a big critter sniffing around our campsite or something at night not really issue because i bring a pistol sometimes a rifle if were in more desolate areas with not many people around and it helps her feel a bit more safe biggest issue i have with her is that she bitches and moans when we do long distance hikes because my stride is too long for her
  you take command of the situation like a man thats all theyre looking for some girls need this some dont
  never take a girl out who doesnt already have a slight interest in it    a girl i dated a few years back told me she wanted me to take her hiking because she knows how much i love the outdoors and wants to try to be participant in that i thought that was a really cool gesture so i took her    worst fucking thing ever she ewd when her converse would get wet in the water told her not to wear converse and couldnt keep up at a very basic pace when crossing small streams id offer my hand to her because she was hesitant about skipping over it she insisted on not needing your help and id sit there for a good couple minutes waiting for her to hop over a 3 foot gap    when we got to one of the larger rocks in the area we climbed one and when sitting there enjoying the nice breeze she commented that she felt that this was boring then had the nerve to ask me later if i was mad at her gee what the fuck do you think    we broke up later for unrelated reasons but at least my current gf now likes the outdoors shes really out of shape no idea how because shes not fat and does cardio when we go but she loves it
  that pic  unironically my life goal
  this guy has never fucked his hot gf on top of a boulder just off the hiking trail overlooking a valley
  based spoopy allied art student army poster    get hysterical over what  being /out/ doing dangerous things i dont understand
went hiking on first date with my now wife and she loved it knew she was a keeper
  get off my out
  in this situation the guy is the subhuman
  thats generally the problem i have hiking with other dudes everyone wants to be in charge
  this fucked my gf on an overlook in a local state park was 10/10
  i agree with challenge or adventure hikes you need experienced people but i would take my ex or friends out on easier hikes    for me theres something primal about making a fire cooking and then ravaging a woman by the fire my ex said i made her feel safe out there
ive never gotten hysterical on a hike or camping trip pretty much the only time i wouldnt be enjoying myself is when im on my period but i time trips around it admittedly i take a bit longer on hikes but thats probably because im short as fuck and taller  longer strides
  holy shit what an autistic post most females these days would think youre a psycho for even owning a fully automatic high capacity high caliber modified assault shotgun youve also never taken a girl /out/ before because if you did youd know that they think four miles is a monster hike took my ex out on an easy trail once and she did fine the first half mile but after that it was nonstop bitching and asking to take breaks even though shes not fat i was pretty pissed because she fancied herself an outdoorsy person
  where did you guys meet all your /out/ friends all the outdoor people i know only do day hikes and shit
    mountaineering clubs trying to introduce non /out/ friends to the outdoors and seeing who is interested random people on trails near home etc
  bbut muh memes
  i dont even know what to make of this post  holy shit what an autistic post   standard ad hominem attack of well adjusted anon  most females these days would think youre a psycho for even owning a fully automatic high capacity high caliber modified assault shotgun   standard absurdist anti/r9k/ response  youve also never taken a girl /out/ before because if you did youd know that they think four miles is a monster hike took my ex out on an easy trail once and she did fine the first half mile but after that it was nonstop bitching and asking to take breaks even though shes not fat i was pretty pissed because she fancied herself an outdoorsy person  standard things that never happened but i believe /r9k/ anecdote
i think this thread is a good opportunity to discuss how often people are taking bait 4chan wide lately and how annoying it is     we need to go back to telling people to lurk moar the quality of posting has dived severely and nobody is even fighting back against it just accepting it dont go quietly into the night
  you can fuck a girl you cant fuck your friends
  but half the bait is actually sincere posts by newfriends
  you know good and well this thread was not a sincere but misguided effort from a newfriend
  i live in an outdoorsy town at the minimum everyone is either a back country skier mountain biker or rock climber and everyone does some hiking and kayaking to some degree
  its the pol/r9k takeover were slowly filling up with bait threads turning into /ck/   even /a/ is a shadow of its former self these days   since the three incidents happened 4chan is full of normalfags who think its like a shitpostier reddit
  what three incidents
  nice
  3 what
holy fuck you faggots stop bitching i dont even know who you guys are its like shills but just hell bent on shitting up 4chan not even trying to convince us of anything just being retarded on purpose    op if youre not posting a gay bait thread women and most normie men generally have a different idea of the outdoors than people like us car camping is most peoples idea of the great outdoors most people wont want to walk for more than 15 minutes let alone a few hours so you either plan shit that theyll actually enjoy or dont go out with them if a woman gets hysterical id probably just walk off but i assume you mean bitches non stop and the reaction is the same just fuck off and leave them if they wont stop bitching try and talk to them and reassure them but if theyre unreasonable then drop them from your life cause theyre normie plebs

go hiking for days on end with my gf and shes great company theres plenty of men ive hiked with whove gotten hysterical constantly complaining feigning injury worrying about a lack of luxuries so i dont think its a gender thing just good and bad hiking companions     were actually planning on doing the at together soon shes even more enthusiastic than me about it
  shes gonna hike ahead and take miles of trail dick good luck cuck
  some are people ive knows since school and others ive met since joining a hiking club
  my gf isnt fat guys i promise
took two girls camping in the bush  they get in a fight when we are fishing  they take the cars and drive back to town  leave me and my friends with no food water and half our gear  two days till we can get lifted out  we find them in a coffee shop they just didnt give a shit about us    hiking  friend brings gf  hike slows to a snails pace  she invents various illnesses and tries to cancel our treck  she throws her share of the food away so her bag is lighter and she wants to go home  were two days from a road nowhere to forage   two days on half ration her crying the whole way because shes hungry    be trekking guide  three day treck  weigh bags first day talk about the treck  were staying in chalets but its pretty steep uphill  only an hour in and this woman is struggling  her bag is like 60kg wat   after i weighed her bag she put extra stuff in it batteries books jars of food  we have to carry her stuff so we are all over weight shes angry and embarrassed  she cant find something and accuses me off stealing it  turn back hike the only time ive turned back a paid trek   husband just sits there mute contemplating the next ten years of his life    never again
  fuckin hell anon all i can think about is this    
  took gf and sister on a super small hike up to crate lake like a mile and a half tops i think i told them to not wear flip flops because the trail is probably rocky im fucked anyways because all i brought with me were water shoes about half a mile in both are crabby and want to turn back because its taking too long about halfway gf stops right in front of me all of a sudden because she got scared of bears actual reason causing me to step on flip flop and break it    im a good boyfriend and give her my shoes and i walk the rest of the way up and down barefoot and she still has the nerve to bitch and moan the whole way up turns out she had her period like 2 days later so such is the life
  im a good boyfriend and give her my shoes and i walk the rest of the way up and down barefoot  i wouldve duct taped the flip flop directly to her foot
    is fucking womens only purpose    this is phrased as though it were a question but it isnt really
  i fucking hate flipflops  just use a pair if sandals if youre not on a beach
  i hear that brother
  holy shit anon whats wrong cant stand the sight of a strong nord woman but seriously why so insecure

  forget what the duh you just need to grow up crowd is saying  i took a couple of gfs /out/ prior to age 20 one became my wife from age 2124 all were univerally flaky as all hell about the outdoors and made it a real pain in the ass despite the fact that they claimed to be very into /out/ activities when they thought it looked cool on the dating resume  fast forward when i was 28 i married a cool chick who is a bit of a prepper wife likes weekends at a state park and approves of /out/ activities but is happier staying home than going on 2 weeks in the nm desert or the backwoods of the smokies i get zero shit about a couple of days here or there hunting with the guys or collecting my stuff and no she isnt using my time away with some other guy it isnt like that   bottom line dont believe the chick who claims to want to be your /out/ equal choose the chick who doesnt mind your /out/ activities will participate a bit and leave you to enjoy the longer excursions those women are a hell of a lot more real

  mate gamergate was much bigger than the fappening     also reddit invaded in 2010
   what do you do when they get hysterical   i dont date a women who feels the need to use facebook every 10 seconds
  nope periods attract bears
  10/10 bro dont let women slow you down fucking also requires you to bring more food for energy
    projecting     im very handsome and well endowed so i dont really have those kinds of anxieties pal
  feigning injury  do people actually do this why
  take gf camping in the woods  we dont make it the mile walk in the woods to a nice spot   we setup at an all right spot  everything is fine until bedtime  because the tent we had was a tiny as fuck  shes just complaining about how it isnt comfortable  end up walking back to my house at 1130 at night
  when will i find my /out/er half    you wont find peace within yourself anon
    people usually ignore me and i do undersell and undervalue myself most of the time but it is for examples like this that i dont take anyone seriously anymore and why i hate the slightest amount of bragging    ive done shit and got shit done and never spoke about it some faggots cannot shut up and are utter shit beings and performers theres just one case i know of someone being arrogant but actually the best there is on his discipline something which i approve of and respect    most people are shit
    yes because a woman whines and is useful for nothing outdoors and fucking outdoors on serious hikes destroys your drive and energy because of this id rather go alone or with capable colleagues or friends    you sound like a real catch    i am and i dont take any shit from any thot    bearing children is womens only purpose civilization is designed by men and history is written by men
  only a mile dude thats like nothing i hike 23 miles into the woods im bowhunting on foot maybe its because im in texas but most of the girls i know are pretty good about hiking a bit only know one who has decent survival skills if things go tits up but all of them can make it at least a mile

  sir is a treasure i wish hed make a graphic novel about this
  seconded
  traps have male interests but they have horrible mental health its a tradeoff
  i think the faggots have the right idea but i just cant get over having sex with a dude even a trap    my best adjusted friend is a faggot who i go over and drink beer and watch football with but instead of doing gay ads girls shit he just fucks dudes and gets wasted
  i dont understand
  it sounds like you need a friend not a gf
  my ex was okay always went underprepared though her sister on the other hand went absolutely batshit when she had to sleep outside the one time we had to camp out all together she always put up an aura of sophistication too so you can never be too careful    i just tuned her out like a toddler throwing a tantrum
  london
  i used to have a gay friend like that we would play vidya or watch football and get drunk he didnt do any girly shit i fucked him a few times but it was just out of boredom and being drunk with no girls around i guess im not gay at all he was just hot af and a great lay
  youre not missing much  it was a huge thing in 2014 and possibly kicked off or at least contributed to a number of sociopolitical movements during the mid 2010s such as the backlash against feminism owning them sjws and the like  now its just a dead embarrassment and all the people that were originally involved with it have become the same insufferable faggots they once fought against  fascinating how that cycle works
  as someone who runs i can relate when i would hike i would loose my breath even though i do a lot of cardio she just isnt use to inclines get her to run hills or do sprint exercises if anything the stair master that should help
be me  dating ex  she wants to try hiking  find a place near us  oh theres a lake out here  bring fishing stuff  walk around for a bit go on trail  finish trail go back to lake and fish   not even 30min into fishing  omg this is sooo boring anon how can anyone possibly think is fun
  t bear slayer
  she wants to try hiking  so you take her fishing  yeah its definitely her fault fucking idiot
  i took my ex backpacking in jasper and it was a huge fuckin mistake she completely ruined the trip for me i wanted to go on long hikes every day as well as do a multiday up a fairly large mountain the mountain hike was what i was really looking forward to about half way through she started getting more and more whiney complaining about the dirt and how she was tired etc toward the end she just broke down in tears and refused to do anything else and just wanted to lie around our campsite i was fucking pissed     after we went to jasper we went to vancouver and went on one of those whale watching tours she started crying when we got back and freaked out because we didnt end up seeing any i felt like a father with a 2 year old having a temper tantrum in a store
  what do you do when they get hysterical  at that point they are not going to be a viable long term partner so the best thing to do is to have some fun with it by antagonizing them the people i know like to bother newbies and high maintenance people by telling them stories of the meat wasps we always keep details vague but the general idea is that they are wasps that like meat that live in the woods scares the shit out of children and sheltered suburbanites alike    my brother dated a girl that could generously be described as prissy and she got even more histerical when we brought her on a family camping trip we just told her the story of the meat wasps and she was freaked out the whole trip was goddamned hilarious though most girls out here are either ok in the woods or unfamiliar with /out/ but willing to give it a shot    how do you even meet /out/ girls i would join clubs but i live in socal and a lot of people just find a close circle to do stuff with and dont really advertise clubs like this oddly enough people kinda retreated into a very personal word of mouth culture people without an existing group are kinda on their own the clubs i have found are mostly older people
  this you might be retarded
be me  take girl /out/  ride carousel  ostrich breaks because im fat  oh no  what do
  ive got one good gal pal i go do all my /out/ shit with likes camping  shooting so all n all its a grand time
  dated an fbi analyst for a few months and took her on a more extreme hike it started snowing and she shut down at the top we had to come off the mountain and walk back 4 miles through dead fall in the snow bc she couldnt mentally do it almost left her after the 7th time she stopped to cry on a log dumped her a week later after i got one last shot at fucking her butt
    truly an anal yst
theres now a setting option under navigation to display the full list of boards on 4channelorg  its like they read my mind    this girl i grew up with that i kind of like has wound up picking up rockclimbing and wants to go /out/ ive got a decent amount of experience to get her started and i want to be the one to bust her cherry but im broke  should i start a binder of folder of hiking trips and plans i want to make this girl mine will this help  shes a music loving hippy at heart
  but where the fuck is navigation
  its a subsetting under settings
  slow down then asshole youre bigger than her its either that or you force her to keep up a harder pace
  most females these days would think youre a psycho for even owning a fully automatic high capacity high caliber modified assault shotgun   yes if youre a retarded faggot who only dates women from the city or leftists
  date better women you faggot never had these problems
  muh pol menace  boards can just bad bad posters anon it doesnt all have to stem from one place
  thanks oddly the full menu shows up when im in a thread but not when im in the catalog
  fully automatic high capacity high caliber modified assault shotgun
  most females these days would think youre a psycho for even owning a fully automatic high capacity high caliber modified assault shotgun  nigga where do you live  most females i know shoot
  take two female friends gf and not gf hiking up a schmediumhillmountain like in the op pic  they say they want to do something easy like one of the smaller hills at the base  i say dont worry follow me  they dont pay attention to where were going  were halfway up the mountain and at an 85 degree incline with cactus below us so they cant go back by the time they realize whats happening  cue 3 hours of crying blacking out having to lean on each other and screaming before we reach the top  im never going hiking with you again    gf still has scars on her legs from the rocks and cactus  went with some malebuddies and did the entire thing in half the time with everyone laughing and highfiving over how dangerous and thrilling it was    and its not useless roasties being useless roastes one is a cop and the other a doctor  so relatively competent women
  ive been taking my gf /out/ for months now and shes been enjoying it she never was into the outdoors or hiking before but she likes it and has been sharing my enthusiasm for nature her birthday is soon and im going to get her a fly fishing rod for us to fish together its comfy af 10/10 would recommend
    nigga where do you live most females i know shoot    same it strikes me that most city chicks these days are faggots no matter whether they are lesbian or not
i have never had a girlfriend
  jesus were like the same person i completely agree with you  anytime someone starts running their mouth about all the great things theyve done or can do i think t myself why are you telling me and not doing it  of course it always devolves into criticizing others when something need to be done to draw attention away from themselves and their incompetence
  you cant fuck your friends  says who all you need is a lot of lube remember its not gay if the balls dont touch and you say no homo
  theres nothing a good shovel cant fix
  thats a shame maybe i could be your girlfriend tonight
  wow shes really ugly i understand the man
   my wife hikes me into the fucking ground  this is your brain on onions

  do you carry all your wifes shit with you she has a day pack with water and trail mix while you have everything else
  i only things i carry that she doesnt are the tent and the bear can she carries all her own gear clothes water and food
                i dont understand how everyone in this thread seems to find the most basic af women to take /out/ and then wonder why their excursions fall apart trust me there are worthwhile girls you can find who actually love it     start dating girl who says she loves the outdoors  initially skeptical but go on trip to grand canyon with her  we get to rim around noon chock full of chinks grannies and tourists  she starts getting visibly irritated about the crowds this isnt what either of us signed up for  anon wanna hike down to the colorado river i bet its less crowded down there  interest has been piquedmpeg  but anonette we would have to cllimb all the way back out in a day we didnt have any gear with us  yeah so think i cant do it  secretly think so but dont tell her prepare for the worst  mfw she zips down to the river and then marches her way back up to the rim with me the last 5 hours in darkness  never complains always encouraging each other  we tell stories sing songs to keep our pace  have amazing sex later that night she tells me she tore her mcl in her knee earlier in the year but didnt tell me b/c she didnt want me to veto the hike  mfw when it was her plan all along to hike to the river and back in a day   a year and a half later we are still together and have done several 14ers in the sierras in a day backpacked whitney in the winter    dont let all these shitty stories in this thread discourage you these sincerely /out/ women exist     bonus  sex on top on mountains is pretty fucking stellar
  this guy has never fucked his hot gf on top of a boulder just off the hiking trail overlooking a valley  this guy has never smoked a dank bowl on top of a boulder just off the hiking trail overlooking a valley  see what im getting at here
    you mean you dont fuck your guy friends
  based if true    good job anon you found a good one
in zion  gf and i climb route from bottom to top of canyon  bit off a little more than we could chew  unplanned bivy  try to make a fire bow fail  laugh about it all night and keep each other warm with cuddles  hike out in the morning    in grand canyon with gf  hike down climb far side  take 30 foot fall on technical rock climb  brokenarmexe  gf rallies helps me do eight one armed rappels to start hike to bottom  hike out the next day laughing the whole way    in north cascades with gf  20 miles to start of climb only have 2 days  hike in make it half way up bivy  both of us totally destroyed  sunrise decide to hike out instead of try to summit  18 hours of hiking laughing the whole way about how dumb we are    yall need to find some better ladies
do you have one
man i wish ive seen some folks have climbing walls in their apartments dunno if id do that but if i get a house in the coming years im gonna put one up definitely    do you got one is it everything i ever dreamt it would be
    i plan to setup something simple when i move into a new place feb some time
  no im not one of those faggots that thinks hyper organizing things will improve themselves    i know exactly where all my shit is and i dont need to make a fuckin blog about it
    why are you so angry who hurt you
  i bought some shelves they were an ass to put together but their good not super sturdy
  fake polished wood climbing holds to slip off of when i try to ascend to my room  this is so tryhard lifestyle memetier its hard to take in  no thanks
what the fuck is the point of that rock climbing wall you climb up a half a foot of the floor and you are at the top what kinda gay ass shit is that what the fuck is the point of the ones near the bottom the fuck ya gunna do start out crawling and try and climb up fuck that is stupid
  mostly for kids
  you dont need to go high or have long stretches of wall to train certain moves certain muscle groups certain hand grips etc   you can traverse climb a bit unclimb another bit train to    do difficult crouched moves and a lot of things and if you change the holds distribution wisely you can get a lot of combinations    you should try going to a indoor climbing club and youll see how this low positioned holds are useful is fun and really good for your body and maybe itll help you with your anger issues
i have a gear slash work room where i do wood working make knives and leather working
  we have a big giant rock wall with at our school only reason i thought the one in pic related was dumb as fuck is because im a fairly tall lad so seeing as i could put my hand on the top hold probably with ease it seemed really fuckin dumb
this thread isnt about rock walls its about gear walls    how are you people so dense
  looks sick anon would love to see more
  no one cares about gear wall they are gay as fuck and for autistic retards who care more about their gear than actually going /out/    so fuck off
    if you dont like it dont post in a thread about it    not rocket surgery
  i felt like posting about the rock wall dont like it dont comment on it
  i try not to be critical on /out/ but holy shit not a spec of dirt or a single scratch on a single piece of gear a climbing wall with purely aesthetic chalk wood walls despite the sheer impossibility this place in anywhere near the woods and a guy who undoubtably owns six axes but hasnt chopped wood since his cubscout leader took away his whittlin chip    shit like this is why people think were all just a bunch of larping losers
  i got a testosterone high by just looking at that wall
  yeah its called a shelf
i really want to get a yak for fishing have a float tube and its just too much damn work problem being i live in an apartment and room is tight looked in to meme yaks the kind that break down fold up or are sectionals but those things run between 1200 and 1500     is there any way i can do this while living in such small quarters or am i overreaching with wanting to get one
set it up against the wall    what the fuck nicca i have a 10ft and its in a studio apartment the kitchen is literally in my living room and theres plenty of space
make your own goddamn fuckin kayak its literally 10 worth of plastic you fucking idiot
  just hang things off your ceiling its like a whole other area thats not used its crazy how people dont hang things off their ceiling anymore
sleep in the kayak and save space by not having a bed
  can you afford a storage locker my brother keeps some of his boats that fucker in a storage locker in the burbs
  fuck you carpet bagger
  the emotion glide is a really good kayak about 9 feet 8 inches its like 40 pound
  these seem good
  you are seriously a real fucking idiot if you cant make your own fucking kayak
  this is /out/ not /diy/
  making a kayak is hardly /diy/ its easy as fuck required nearly no thought or effort
    its cheap and easy as fuck    if you dont make your own purposebuilt gear then you will always lag behind a true /out/ist makes their own shit
    so lets see yours then
  how about you quit posturing and show us how to do it then
innova twist inflateable
  hang that shit homie
    no your not overreaching the first thing you want to ask yourself is specifically what king of yak fishing you plan on doing if you wanna be able to stand up site fish and have a sense of stability id look into bonafides theyre greatly priced stable and paddle really well now if standing up while fishing is not absolutely necessarily id guide you to my personal choice tarpon 120 ive worked at a small outfitter for about 3 years now and have had the opportunity to meet a lot of people in the kayak world the tarpon is always the kayak that is highly regarded especially for its price its an awesome paddler thats not meant for standing upunless your a skinny fucker and is probably the best overall kayak i can think of on the top of my head if i were you id check out the tarpon 120 if your on the southeast coast id be more than happy to help you out
    paddlefag here this is inadvisable if you give a fuck about your boat at all and plan on keeping it for a long time     if youre just planning on hanging it by two hooks/ropes one at the bow and one at the stern over time the boat can become deformed the rocker the degree of concavity along the line from bow to stern can become more pronounced and for a fishing boat youre going to have very little rocker to begin with to help with tracking in flat water you dont want to introduce more     this is doubly true for canoes especially poly/royalex types     the only type of boat that would actually possibly be cool to do this with is a fiberglass boat because of the rigidity but even so youd really want to suspend it with lots more touchpoints along the hull     so its possible with a very well thought out rig but you shouldnt just toss two pulleys and a few eye hooks up in the ceiling joists and call it done do it right or just lean your kayak against the wall in a corner or let it sit on the floor like everyone else does
how about a packraft
  if you have absolutely no place to store it some kayak rental place or sport/outdoor shop let to store your kayak there for a fee
  got any tips or links this is relevant to my interests
  just use jewgle senpai
buy a memeyak and just let it be rediculously in the way    plus hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of injection molding equipment
    i found that but i have like absolutely 0 experience with yaks so i am just going to leave behind another question here how good/durable/easy to fix is this yak design and build its not in any way a meme yak its really just wood cloth epoxy andamerican effort
  get an inflatable one theyre pretty cheap they pack up compactly and theyre sturdy
anyone got any ideas to haul a fishin kayak on top of a car without crossbars ive seen a lot of cheap options and some expensive clamp on crossbars anything that doesnt look ghetto and is really stable
  advanced elements inflatables they hit a good balance between price and function
  
    what make/model is the car and what model fishing kayak     also how much do you care about your paint job if i were stuck somewhere and had to move a kayak with a car i didnt care about i would look under the car/in the owners manual to find out where the jack points are for each corner of the car underneath and then take some foam blocks and some ratchets and put the foam blocks on top and then hook two ratchets one front one rear to either side of the car where the jack points are     then id do a rachet pully with rope to the front/back and call it done     all of that shit is going to rub against your paint job though     desu if you do a lot of hauling of this thing and your car can be fitted with a very light duty class two hitch you could just get a little kayak trailer for it
  buy a cheap used on and leave it on your car
  make your own cpu its literally just 05 worth of silicon and copper you fucking idiot    this is what you sound like
  vibe seaghost 110 and plan to throw it on top of an old corolla and i couldnt care about the paintjob as its a beater until i get my truck repaired which i plan to mainly use for the kayak    i was curious about some of these foam blocks with a bunch of straps and bow and stern ratchet tie downs
anyone ever done a diy packraft you can get a kit for about 300 you just have to buy an iron to seal it all together and it takes like 2030 hours of work ive been thinking about it and all the cool trips i could do with it
  make canoe pale face many trees in forest stupid bucklebrain nocorn
how do i not get killed by snek in the outback its too hot to wear boots and pants so im usually barefoot and shorts should i carry a big stick and poke it around in front of me
yeah op poking the snake in front of you will really make it your friend go do it and let us know how it works out
  better to poke it with a stick from a distance then to step on it
just dont want to end up like this guy    
  too hot to wear boots and pants  prioritizing comfort in heat over protecting yourself from death and maimery
  death and maimery  theres only death in australia from snake bites its either death or nothing
    watch where you walk    tbitten twice by an eastern brown
  theres only death in australia from snake bites its either death or nothing    nah    only the coastal taipan is a guaranteed death sentence without medical support inland taipans are too rare    most brown snake bites are survivable without treatment due to the fact that they only inject such a small amount and/or their fangs are small so they dont get a good bite in something like 20 percent will die    tigers blacks fierce and so on are generally survivable
  how did you survive
  been wandering around the mojave for 50 years only time i came close to being bit was pissing while drunk in the dark peed on a baby sidewinder it was pissed
  it was pissed
    fucking lol
    1 bite i couldnt get to the hospital so i just laid down and slept it off and made sure to drink when i woke up now and again i figured if i awoke id be fine  the coagulopathy lasts for about 12 hours and the neurological symptoms are rarely severe enough to kill you    i wrapped my leg got the symptoms couldnt stay conscious and went to bed bite marks were leaking blooding i had a terrible headache but it wasnt transient and left the next day i couldnt open my left eye by about 48 hours i was symptom free    i obviously didnt get a lethal dose or a lethal dose for my constitution and body size     second bite i went to the hospital and they did all the shit there to be honest there was no difference and i recovered the same on my own    now if i was dosed higher in the first bite theres a chance you need renal and breathing support but thats usually with the big browns it was a smaller one in both my cases or multiple bites    the coastal taipan is the only one to really fear imo unless you have heart/kidney problems or it was a really big brown that gets you    both were in the garden hence why i was being silly and not watching where i walked i live in the middle of nowhere in the outback
    of course 20 percent of brown snake bites are fatal so its still not something to take lightly at all and to do the proper pressure bandaging and hospital visit
  wear 16 high snake boots shorts and carry an umbrella with nothing else on except maybe a wet dorag have a walking stick thats about 57 feet long use it for defence but dont antagonize anything just walk around instead
  20 rolls around to be 50/50 if you die or not thats never good odds
  most more likely way youll get bit is if when digging around or moving in a pile of rubbish or dead wood stay in the open on clean paths and watch where youre going not much danger there
    not the best but its not 9999 like for the coastal taipan    i think the black mamba is the only other snake that has similar odds to the coastal taipan with untreated lethality    though as i said i think the real big eastern browns the ones you rarely see would probably be close to certain death too    you generally have to stand on or attack them or be really close for them to bother you though complacency is the biggest one here as you often dont look where you walk in familiar places like around the house
  id say carry a stick and avoid tall grass if you must go through it probe ahead with stick keep an eye on where youre stepping
  i know a chick that got bitten by an inland taipan fuct her up big time weeks in hospital barely made it
    rattlesnakes bites look nasty the tissue and muscle destruction looks like itd cause quite a long recovery    ive only got some funny nerve damage in my right foot from my 2 brown snake bites which doesnt hurt
    inland taipan    thatd do it she was probably on a ventilator for an extended period of time as well as dialysis    luckily theyre fairly rare same with the coastal taipans ive never seen either out here outside of snake catcher shows
  no step on snek
    most times sometimes theyll bite if you step near them within a few feet or so but it depends on the type of snake the specific one the weather and its location if its back against something
    an eastern brown snake will crawl up and bite you for the simple reason that nobody else was
  sound advice    make a bit of noise when you walk and theyll move away    unless youre hunting i bowhunt deer in subtrop coastal qld biggest worry is stepping on a big eastern brown  as previous anons have said coastal taipans are nasty but more common further north of where i hunt    so i carry a dedicated snakebite first aid kit with two pressure bandages plus an extra pressure bandage dont have a plb yet but where i hunt has cell coverage so an emergency call with gps coordinates should see me safe in hospital within a couple of hours    gonna get me some gaiters too but eastern brown unless a big one and unless you step on it wont penetrate decent boots    tldr  anon  dont step on them and nowhere is so hot that you cant wear boots wont necessarily be comfortable but better safe
  jerk snek
    sometimes sometimes not    im the fag that got hit twice both i stood on    ive seen several that have moved with marked haste from me that were within about 10 meters
i hunt in brown and tiger territory fuck i hate tigers the cunts have chased me in the past just for being within 10 metres fucking pricks they can get narky at certain times of year  but yeh i wear knee high gaiters and have a good first aid kit usually a winter hunter so rarerly see them anyway
  just sleep it off  fucking australians baka you guys truly are a dogs gift to the world
any advice on dealing with snakes when they have a crowbar
  son gets snakebit and dies  lose faith in god  why are people so weak
  fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucking hell every part of my body was tensing as i read your comment fucking chasing you 10 meters thats my nightmare     i have such a fear revulsion for snakes that i would contemplate burning the whole forest down if it got rid of them and i love forests
    tiger snakes can be a little feisty if you get near them though they usually flee     in oz the black snakes are the most chill even though theyre quite venomous        not like i had much of a choice i could barely stand/stay awake and reading up afterwards its best to lie down as falls can fuck you up due to the blood thinning
  correct me if this is some stupid pseudoscience shit but ive been told moving around a bunch helps the venom circulate faster through your system so laying down until help arrives can make you last a bit longer
    yes it helps staying still as does wrapping the limb up with pressure as the venom goes by the lymph nodes you can technically keep the venom from moving if you keep the bandage on  it can hold out for weeks im not sure theres a specific timeframe for how long until it naturally denatures though    body weight and mass are also important as is physical health amount of venom injected too of course a small snake will kill a kid untreated but an adult might survive lots of drunken brown snake victims end up with kidney problems whereas those that arent intoxicated dont    i only fear the coastal taipan every bite gives you more than enough venom to kill multiple humans where i live or the massive browns that you occasionally see they tend to feel you long before you get close and you see them speeding away
  jesus christ anon give me a general geographic region in aus that you live so i can mark it on my map as a place to never go anywhere near
    qld    of note most people bit by browns are in the garden and it neednt be in the middle of nowhere just suburbs near some bush will do it    i live in the middle of nowhere though and i like going /out/ so ive seen quite more than most    black snakes are the coolest and theyre quite chill the red bellied ones are beautiful
  not that anon but pretty much anywhere in australia is literally crawling with deadly venomous snakes and spiders  remeber we have 8 or 9 of the top ten most deadly snakes in the world    i got bitten and died three times last week and twice so far this week but it pales into insignificance with you poor bastards in north america being mauled to death by grizzly bears cougars and wolves by your thousands each week
  anon where in qld    im near hervey bay
    get a long iron fire poker
i almost stepped on this cunt near middleton in qld this year
  only heard this the other day at work about laying down after a brown snake bite apparently the blackfellas/old stockmen after a bite would quickly find shade and lay in it for a few days and have people bring them water thought it was kinda bullshit until i looked it up
    its the only thing you can do that will give you a chance if you cant get to hospital where ventilation meds and kidney support are the biggest helpers antivenom doesnt work that well in brown snake bites unless you get it administered within 15 minutes which means you probably need to get the pressure bandage on within 5 minutes which is often unrealistic    falls can be fatal due to the blood thinning lots of people die within 30 minutes due to collapse and hitting their heads which causes cerebral hemorrhage if you lie down theres little chance of this fluids when you can helps support your kidneys naturally    the blood thinning lasts about 12 hours without early antivenom treatment so its best to just lie down the venom makes you feel sedated anyway so its not hard to get to sleep or fall into unconsciousness pressure bandage will help but if theres no chance youll get to a hospital itd best to slowly release it gradually over time so the venom will eventually go through you at a lower dose over time the instant dose might no be survivable but the gradual dosing might
the new plbs have a 10 year battery life no reason to not have one on you when you are in the bush     
    scary
    even deadlier are crazies in the woods
  rattlesnakes bites look nasty the tissue and muscle destruction looks like itd cause quite a long recovery  the best part regarding rattlesnakes is that people keep killing the ones that signal so the ones that have successfully bred are the ones without rattles so now you get no warning you just get snapped at
  the same way indigenous people didnt get bit by snakes dont fuck with them and be respectful of them and their habitat
  really old man had to have his son die to stop believing in fairy tale bullshit  youd think most people figure this shit out around early adulthood
ever thought of backing away and letting the fucking snake go
  better do neither
  i once saw a local aboriginal bloke grab an eastern brown by the end of its tail and then flick the bloody thing like a whip at a tree it was dead within a blink of an eye never seen anything like it
  some are far worse than others even amongst the same species take the timbers for example the canebrake variety down south are considered to be more lethal than their northeastern kin because their venom takes on a more neurotoxic quality in addition to the standard hemotoxin even with that though id still risk a wet nip from a southern timber over an eastern diamond back or mojave due to the sheer venom volume of the former and potency of the latter the really nasty shit lives south of the border though a rattler may ruin the next few days for you if you survive it but a bothrops will potentially ruin your life
/out/ what do you think of this idea     i have a job but honestly its hard to save up a lot of money with rent electricity internet car etc i have really been thinking about just roughing itno electricity no water make an outhouse have baths in a actual tub     i have a young wife and i would love for her to be able to stay at home with the kids we are also interested in homeschooling so that works for us     buy the biggest all season tent cabeals makes 13x27 for 1500  get a wood stove coolers other random stuff  get a land loan and basically just set up shop on a small piece of land    we both love the outdoors and dont have problems roughing it this would be a really drastic move but i think it would give us the opportunity to save a shit ton of money and live a better life     we could do this for a few years and then use the money we make to build a proper cabin or bigger land     how stupid is this idea do you guys know of any really big all season tents that could work for this besides the cabelas alaknak
ive also found this tent for almost 4k its 12x15 with 6 ceiling     seems much better quality    
i didnt make it clear but right now we dont have kids
milsurp wall tent might be worth a look    biggest hurdles are going to be institutional cps land use/zoning buying land if you dont already have it and psychological but i imagine you already knew that
  my biggest concern is probably buying a plot of land banks arent going to jump at the opportunity to loan you money when you arent going to build a house they can flip if you default on the monthly payment
does anyone have any off the grid living experience or long term camping experience     we live in the northeast so winters are real     i work at a small private school so if worse came to worse i can always use school internet and showers
  of course you could do it if your dedicated and smart about it  depending on your yearly climate and seasons it could be rough  besides a tent used rvs can be found for cheap and would be more secure than a tent
  for 4k you could build a pretty decent cabin
  854 reply  if you buy land with forest with reasonably straight trees you could always log em and build a small cabin yourself     that wadding insulation can make a place damn cozy  you really dont want to live in a tent for years its a lot of work but its worth it and once you have a small cabin suitable for living you can build extensions
  but honestly how warm could an rv be in the winter the major benefit i see to having a large tent is the wood stove i would also love to be able to chop wood
  i basically know nothing about carpentry but you are probably right the tent could be temporary while i build the cabin
  with your level of experience 0 youll wanna give up after one snowy night     youre gonna go through a fuckload of wood trying to heat a canvas tent for an entire winter it will suck and just trying to live off grid is a full time job on its own  trust me youre better off just buying a condo or something relatively cheap until you can save up a big enough nut to buy land and start putting a house on it right away
i was reading county laws and it seems like its almost impossible to build a house without connecting it to the grid or having a water hookup     thats some bullshit
  does anyone have any off the grid living experience    i do it all depends on your mental endurance and motivation youll have to face a lot of change primarily because youll work a lot for yourself to maintain an acceptable living standard without outside help and youll make mistakes that youll need to fix the good thing is you get the beauty of nature as a reward which at least for me makes up for the work you need to put into it    go with a cabin make sure it has good roofing and is dry well insulated but also well ventilated else your air will be moist and smell get an air drying to get down to 5060 air moisture or use a wood stove have the chimney work well else you poison yourself with smoke make sure you adhere to fire safety firewood costs money or sweat and needs to dry    next to heating you need clean water if there are no pipes think of getting a tank and have it refilled every so often costs money depending on the industry in your area mining fields etc you might want to avoid collecting water from the environment if the water is good for consumption get a filter berkey or sawyer are good and water canisters i work with a 1m3 outside for the garden and a 20l for the house    showers will take the form of spraying with a garden hose in the summer and hand washing in the winter with hot water and soap at least if you dont want to install a real shower with tank or a bath tub those use a lot of water tho washing clothing and bedsheets can be done by hand in hot water there is a small washing mashine called giradora or something though its not yet in production afaik
detergent can be bought or produced by yourself i use ivy and tannic acid from plants birch bark pine needles etc horse chestnut is great as well    cooking can be done on your wood stove i cook with a gas bottle and gas stove and use a generator for electricity that i also use for heating fuel has to be bought i use a compost toilet and a big pack of wood chips lasts me 34 months tho i recommend getting the humus like brown stuff since it not just absorbs the moisture but also starts decomposition directly in good conditions one week later your poo is gone    food wise if you dont grow your own food just calculate what you need and buy in bulk the cheapest and most nutritious food i can eat for a long time going 3 months so far is a stir fry of onions vegetables garlic barley beans canned tomatoes and vegetable broth its a variation of what the roman gladiators ate which were called hordearii barley men since they practically lived off barley and beans    in the winter you dont need a fridge you can use a wooden box on some logs with a ladder you can remove so bears dont fuck with your stash in total i recommend watching richard proennekes documentation he built a log cabin in alaska and lived there for over 30 years    if you have any questions just ask
    oak not birch its late here
  nayrt but you can put a woodstove in an rv     your biggest problem in winter will be the tanks or water lines freezing also most rvs arent insulated for winter there are some exceptions but they get expensive you can insulate it yourself of course dont forget the floor and storage bins if you go that route
  i think all that money you save will mean you can hire an excellent divorce lawyer
    dont raise idiots let your kids go to school and live a normal life
  normal  the prussian public education system is directly responsible for the replacement of family with state and the emotional retardation of generations since its implementation
  man i kinda want to live like that too i would get some sheep plants some potatoes hunt some boars this would be life
  its a variation of what the roman gladiators ate which were called hordearii barley men since they practically lived off barley and beans  if you already mention that  they also ate a soup made from bones and charcoal for calcium if i manage to find the link to the article i will put it here
  well that was easier than i thought here  
      its bone ash to be exact consisting of calcium oxide phosphorus pentoxide and water chemically speaking its not an animal product economically speaking it is
  yeah i was telling out of memory even crushed bones could fuck up your guts so ash makes sense    its not an animal product  bones had to come from somewhere right
    bones do yes bone ash isnt bones tho its the remains when you burn them
  i have a young wife  what does that even mean  are you some kind of creeper
    oh please homeschooled kids end up autistic stupid or both let the kid go to school and also teach them to be /out/ the two arent mutually exclusive
  only if you never let them off your property  go to social gathering with them a team sport bring them to friends
what does /out/ think of zpacks   im considering buying myself the zpacks arch blast backpack as a christmas gift for myself price tag 325  plan on using it for a thru hike   good buy or do you recommend something else for that price
  lots of shit comes into play about backpacks im assuming since youre looking into zpacks youve probably narrowed down your base weight and gear    theyre known for their odd trampoline back frame but recently on bpl forums word spread of bad stitching and frames popping out ymmv    if you want that style of vertical frames check out ks ultralight be warned his website is ass    if you want what sex is in backpack form imo look at the katabatic onni series no trampoline back but same streamlined design
  oh if you havent dialed in your gear yet unless youre a solid 10 base weight and can fit all your gear sans food and water in 2030l dont even look at zpacks its a brand for those weight weenies like me
gossamer gear kumo if you are truly ascended otherwise dont buy a pack until you are happy with your base weight
  wait someone not sucking off mld bruh that kumo is sexy too but i dont need more packs
  i like mld too just not packs
  expensive over complicated and not very durable if you want an expensive dcf hyrbid pack that can carry a decent load i would look at hmg over zpacks      zpacks packs are framed and can carry a pretty hefty load so you dont need to be too dialled in same with hmg packs      the kumo and mld packs are a different story they cant carry much of a load so you need to be that more dialled in
op zpacks has nigger tier quality control is very overpriced and marketed at yuppies and boomers you will be absolutely fine with a pack from the myriad of other cottage companies such as superior wilderness designs liteaf appalachian packs etc or if youre a yuro gramxpert atom packs etc     if you dont have your actual gear dialled down to a tiny weight do not bother do a mini thru hike first then upgrade otherwise youll end up ditching and upgrading so much of your gear that your zpacks might be way too big and substantial and all you need is a 30l simple cuben sack
    is this true are they a meme
  i have a little red midland crankthing with a light and a radio  i take it on all my trips for campfire tunes and never had a problem
  according to the source if you let it die once it stops working properly  is this true maybe dont waste your ones but do any other anons have experience with this
i imagine they break and are a hassle better to have solar but never had one
  hasnt happened to me and i leave mine in a pack for weeks at a time between trips totally dead before plugging into usb right before a trip  also if it did die its just an 18650 battery in there and i could replace it for 8
  most have solar too  its under the handle on top of the lantern in ops pic
i googled mine and its a midland er210 if anyone cares
  plastic ones are not all that great the main thing is to remember that you must crank it as a set speed and dont try to crank it harder/faster if you try you will certainly break the handle gears or actually the pcb component by overpowering them dont buy one that you cant replace the battery if it uses a battery for those that use a capacitor you can usually just solder a new one one if needed and you can diy simple stuff    as for are they are bad idea no they are not it is just that we live in an age where people pay for cheap shit that is poorly designed    if you can find one get one with a super capacitor inside and all metal construction including metal gearing the super cap will never die like a battery dies it however will never hold a charge as long as a battery when not in use but you can always charge and use it they can be charged super fast    the main sentiment of the link in the op is mostly correct dont use anything you cant rely on 100 for an emergency situation that also includes anything thats improperly deigned that isnt crank powered my main reason for not using a crankpowered device for emergency purposes is because the calories you expend in cranking may be needed to save your life or the life of someone else      according to the source if you let it die once it stops working properly  is this true    it depends on how it is designed inside if theres a battery the battery can be harmed by fully discharging it can also develop a poor charge memory where it wont charge as well as before thats just a battery issue and not reflective of the device the battery is in some battery wall chargers have a button for fixing that issue
for me its the coughlans camp toilet paper    i find the 2ply stuff i use at home is too soft to roll up properly and if it gets accidentally wet it just turns into useless pulp
i use my hand
  doubt
  i use moss
  i use the same tp as you and biodegradable wet wipes
  x
  used to have this excellent appleflavored toilet paper that would disintegrate in water including the roll but sadly my supply is gone
  appleflavored toilet paper  please tell me you meant applescented
  i know what i wrote
    a snowball is natures wet wipe
  a snowball  plen
  brand of the wet wipes
  i have the coleman stuff because thats what my wallmart had on the shelf  i like the ones with the little plastic dispenser thing though no matter the brand
i shit in the river its the best way to insure youre butt is clean
i use leaves always handy when you need them
  just make sure you dont get any parasitic fluke swimming up there
found material and bidet the only sensible option
  i get them from walmart
  ask your plumber about these hell tell you how biodegradable they really are
  fuck why didnt i think of that ive just been getting these and throwing it out when i get home
  
this is the best answer biodegradeable just add water
just regular toilet paper if youre worried about rain keep it in a ziploc     idiots
  i just shit in streams easy clean up and can save kgs by not carrying toilet paper
  thats fucked up man  please stop shitting in water sources come on
  wtf you too  see   rule number one in camp shitting is to go as far away from a water source as possible goddamn    if this was the middle ages you guys would fit right in and probably die of dysentery together

  what is this movie
  yuru camp its an animoo series that seems to be universally approved on /out/
  tell me more  ive always dream of a certain spot in the mountains ive never visited
  just one of those recurring dreams only its been over a lifetime started with this hill surrounded by pine trees during the day now when i dream about it its got a beer hall with those thatched roofs that come way down but its twilight its sort of mountainous in one direction but sits in a open area in a forest
grizzly adams    daniel boone    scouts    my best friend in the 80s he really kicked it in we gathered many guns knives and much milsurp between us tried to prepare to be the local saviors during any potential red dawn situations because no one else seemed to be taking it seriously so it was going to have to be us we also considered the first two rambo movies to be sacred scripture
no gary paulsen geoffrey chaucer peter capstick or jean george  no hemingway or dostoyevsky  meme answers in the form of animoo and a retard that managed to starve to death in one of the most plentiful regions on the planet  yall are a bunch of unread heathens    but anyway probably the biggest for me were movies like quigley down under and books like death in the long grass
  same here ive got like 34 different mountain places recurring on my dreams
i really loved luke sucking that titty milk in the new one and spear fishing too
  he doesnt know about yuru camp  oh boy youre in for a wild ride
  anon who didnt know about yuru camp reporting back   image search  sorted that shit out  watch first two episodes  oh my so comfy
  anon who didnt know about yuru camp    same ive just gotten started and am busy with other shit but im already disappointed that saitousan didnt respond with but catching them on fire and getting a burnt and blackened outer shell then blowing them out makes for the best ones proceeded by her doing so first waving the flaming marshmallow around a bit before blowing out    ill maintain an open mind for the rest though
  my dad and my grandpa
  tfw 4channel could have gotten rid of animeshit and didnt took the opportunity  sad
  chaucer or dostoyevsky /out/ inspiration  what
  welcome to the club anon

  get out of here stalker
  go back to /lit/ also nothing wrong with being an heathen you christcuck
  canterbury tales  not /out/ af  fyodor only wrote crime and punishment and not a dozen books and even more short stories about slaving away in a gulagfarm in siberia
  my late father  my late grandfather  my older brother  my late uncles  my younger cousins    ray mears  primitive technology guy  alfieaesthetics  jas townsend  steve irwin  tom mcelroy  sam gribley  my side of the mountain
  how is it /out/ walking from near london to canterbury even back day was walking in fairly densely populated area its not a hike in any shape or form neither does it serve the same function the book isnt even about the act of walking there its about the tales they talk about   being imprisoned in a siberian prison camp  its the opposite of /out/ theres so many books which are actually directly related to being outdoors but those are definitely not
  not a hike in any shape or form    what is a hike
  doesnt know about siberian prison camps  they didnt have walls or guards or any real structure because nigga its fucking siberia in the 1800s it was literal bushcrafting to stay alive much less produce enough turnips the aristocracy didnt send a company of soldiers over to bayonet you for your insolence
  thats still not the same as going outdoors specifically to enjoy wildlife and camp overnight lmao    youre stretching it m8
  welcome to the new camp comrade you can see there are no barracks you best build them before winter sets in  not who you were responding to i see your point anon but those poor fucks were ultra outdoors learn to survive outside now or die by the millions but no not the atc
  my point is that you dont read dostoyevsky for outdoors or recommend him just because he had to go to siberia and noted it somewhere in his writing his main novels have fuck at all to do with /out/doors just recommend something like daniel defoe rather than something something famous writer because they had some barely tangible connection with outdoor related activities its like saying stendhal is /out/ as fuck because julien sorel sleeps overnight in some mountains near jura in france when going to visit his friend sure thats somehow outdoor related but its not the same as reading walden lmao why are you so purposely dense
  please only enjoy things the way i tell you too   pathetic     my inspo is mostly cowboys and frontiersman but my core reason for going out is to pretend like im the last person on earth the freedom that idea gives me is amazing
  so you read crime and punishment for /out/door purposes
  its just a different perspective walden and the gulag archipelago are both amazing works and both render vivid images of being outdoors just for very different reasons both legit though

this question has been itching in the back of my mind for a while now so here it goes     its a extremely cold winter location   you dont know  region  time spent /out/  what you are gonna have to do    what would you carry with you   i want to see what some of you guys say i understand this is close to the idea of bug out bags but at the same time what do you guys think you would like to have to be able to live /out/ almost indefinitely or for at least a very very long periods of time in very cold climates    everything has to be man portable preferably 65l and no more than about 80lbs i would say the idea of a pull behind sled is good but shoot any other suggestions if you have em  also assuming you will be able to gather water and food given you have the right equipment ie rifle water filter pot ect
get a donkey
  get out me swamp
  been reading a lot about canadian voyageurs and frontiersmen lately they were actually pretty minimal packers just because they had to leave room for tons of furs on their back the base setup aside from clothes seems to have been  a couple thick wool blankets  axe  knife  tin pot sometimes a pan and/or kettle as well  matches  compass  rifle  powder and shot  super simple and hardy rations like dried whitefish bacon or pemmican  then they would just make sure to pitch camp well before it got dark so they could dig down into the snow and build a good leanto and fire now this is super antiquated knowledge these days but the basis for surviving super cold temps is there it really wouldnt take much to modernize it
  that seems like a very so id concept and i will read up more on it annon thx
  do you have any good book suggestions for that type of reading
  tales of the canadian north by frank oppel has a bunch of snippets from outing magazine that deal with the subject company of adventurers by peter c newman also talks about it some though its primarily a history book rather than a detailed description of frontier life
kifaru sawtooth with the woodburning stove they sell this is basically like a lightweight walltent and it can be 80 degrees in your shelter while its 20 outside   white gas stove like a msr whisperlite obviously several gallons of gasoline   now i can burn either wood or gas and it will work in the cold     for clothing highquality down top and bottom merino wool base layers heavy fleece midlayer hardshell exterior probably take something like the usgi mickey mouse boots if i was stationary    after your clothing and shelter there really isnt much else to figure out if i was needed to hunt id bring a lightweight shotgun with various loads of ammo enabling me to take all game in north america whether they be birds or moose throw on a quickdetach bombbroof 4x scope maybe pack a recurve bow in case my ammo ran out and i needed to shoot a deer
  this is what im prepared for i live in canada its pretty cool here in the winter which seems to last most of the year i buy mostly army gear and oil worker gear i figure if they use it it has to be good enough  axes saws and hatchet knives of course water filter mini stoves fuel etc snare wire firearms traps so many ferro rods enough to last a life time above all gear is the ability to use it improvise and knowledge of the land you are in
hardtack dont forget the hardtack
  saw  sleeping bag  sleeping pad  tarp  cord  metal container  knife  pockets full of lighters  and the correct clothing 1
bump
  quickdetach bombbroof 4x scope    you realize you lose your zero once you detach it right
  not him but the ones ive used only mattered with targets beyond 1000 meters like that fucking matters for only 4x lol anything within that were never a problem being off target due to scope problems
northern minnesota here wool everything my overcoat is a woolrich plaid one i got from my grandfather i finally picked up a pair of steger mukluks and im never going back to regular boots except for ice fishing when i camp on my 25 acres i bring a 0 degree bag sleeping pad and a canvas tarp to set up as a wind break i bring a sven saw and a hatchet for wood to build long fires with ill throw all of my stuff in a sled so i dont have anything adding to my own weight when i walk along the river    if it were a long term situation id set up camp as normal but build a more permanent shelter if the neighbors are dead id just move into their house or scavenge their woodstove and build a mud/stove room of the front of my trailer
    starting raw and isolated in the winter is a good way to die my friend plan to pack in at least 80 of your calories for however long you have winter left in your area before you take this trip that you are clearly gathering input on    that said playing into the scenario and assuming i have to take shit i own   fishing shit probably my catfish box as its mostly hooks/weights/floats of various sizes but i might throw in a couple spoons and some plastic minnows   fishing line 20 pound or so  bank line every roll i can find   axe  couple knives   my box cutter with as many replacement blades as i have left in the garage this is actually my favorite knife anyways but its not ideal for every task  rifle 303 brit 100 pieces of riffle food shotgun might be a better choice but i only have a 10ga and a 12ga and they are both old heavy pieces of shit and so is the ammo  matches   12 road flare emergency one shot beats freezing to death fire starter  stainless steel kettle   metal pie pan  water bottle i dont have an insulated one but that would be nice  camping saw  tarp   blanket    couple changes/additions in would make if i had the opportunity   410 shotgun instead of my enfield   fish net so i am not limited to set lines  handful of snares  better boots and better socks  sleeping bag and mat    im sure i am missing quite a lot bushcraft style survival isnt my forte i keep some food in the truck right next to my phone charger so i can have a nice snack while i wait for help to arrive
  410 shotgun instead of my enfield  get a 410 enfield and youre good
    i wasnt aware that existed looks like im going to put a new gun under the tree this year
  if you bring enough bank line you can build a gill net op
    net making is relatively difficult and time consuming just pack one if you have the option
  x4 is good for 500600m at the furthest at least for 556 depending on your patience
  why bother with the bow you could pack several boxes of slugs for the weight of a bow you could also consider one of those 12ga/22lr combo rifles so you dont have to waste heavier shells on small game
  you still have the weight of the bow
  you still have the weight of the bow   im advocating for not taking a bow and taking more ammunition with the weight and space saved
  i do work in boreal forest semiregularly in winter snowshoeing around and shit and snowmobiling lines you dont even really need an axe in winter the branches break really easily better to have a machete to break bush as needed or get bigger branches snowshoes are a must also id have about 50 of those cotton pad with vaseline/wax things to get a fire going and a couple of bic lighters you can also just collect birch bark to get a fire started but if you were having a windy day or something it could be a little challenging    id want a really good mummy sleeping bag snares or a 22 rifle an auger fishing line and hooks and some sort of compact tent id say 65 chance at least that i still die
  oh and of course a pot and probably some thermal bottle
  i dont have time to think of the full list but it would include calorie dense fatty foods vitamins a 3 foot bow saw a good axe and other tools to make rough lumber a whole bunch of long nails a shotgun good clothing fishing gear a pot that can hang from a hook knives reflective tarps the usual etc    the idea is to make a really solid shelter like the one in your pic but with 4 walls and moss/other stuff in between boards and logs this is why the nails are important and in my opinion always overlooked fuck having to lash everything together with rope nails should be a part of every survival kit
  the idea is to make a really solid shelter  
folding saw  savage combination gun  one box of 410 and 22  tin cup  small bag of wood shavings and sawdust  small butane torch cigar lighter much hotter than other lighters  knit wool shirt and pants  johnson woolen mills coat  johnson woolen mills bibbed overalls  box of contractor trash bags in my experience they make good blankets sleeping bag liners they can work as rope in a pinch really indispensable  31f sleeping bag  timberlands pro 10 gravel pit boots  estwing hatchet  machete or other large knife  thicque wool socks  orvis ultimate cold weather hat  i feel like im forgetting some stuff but im not sure this is usually what i take for cold weather stuff but im usually also taking some stuff for other people so its hard for me to say what i take for myself
  oh and a fishing pole with tackle
lots of woolposters can someone shill me on it over a down/softshell combo
this is k2 the second tallest mountain in the world it is located in pakistan and has never been summited in winter    a few days from now 2 separate teams from russia and poland will attempt to climb to the top and create history    thoughts
  its still autumn dammit
will everests kangshung face ever be climbed its fantasy ridge
  i remember last winter and the polish thread we had here with the nanga parbat rescue and all hopefully this time will turn better dogspeed    also does anyone know if frogs recognized the polish effort to save one of them when they did nothing
  no the frogs disowned them
  completed it m8
  my money is on the polacks
they gunna die
  slavs  creating history
  yeah polish people have always had a hardon for winter ascents
  just like in 39 amirite
  i dunno good luck i guess but at this point who even cares  i just watched meru and dont get me wrong here it was a good movie and those climbers are literally the elite what they did was so difficult  but so what i really dont find it impressive beyond an amazing feat of human durability i felt the same awe when i watched mcgregor get grappled for 15 minutes straight and not pass out what exactly are we proving anymore
  ikr lets just all just stay in bed and nothing cos was the point eh i mean fuck trying to achieve anything or challenging ourselves seems like a waste of time
i went for the first time to one today and this was the best deal there was    everything else was car camping tents and punctured sleeping pads and yuppies looking for still overpriced north face and patagucci jackets
i would never find out because you have to go to a physical rei store in a large city on a specific day i only visit a physical rei store when i have to go to a large city with someone else and i tell them just drop me off at the rei while you go do your faggotry elsewhere and therefore do not get to pick and chose the dates thus far none of the maybe 5 visits i have made over several decades have happened to coincide with garage sell days    what are you willingly entering large cities
  that is a good question i go so far as to blast around them on their beltway at 3 in the morning thats the closest i will get
  thats a real fuckin neato egg suitcase i you bought it
  i just bought one of those new for 199  wow 16 whole cents off
  no cause walmart sells em new for 199 s  they had a 15f sea to summit basecamp down sleeping bag for 100 but they said they had listed it wrong and it was actually 180 /
go to rei sale  buy punctured xlite and xtherm  inflate them put them in bathtub find the leaking bubbles patch them  saved 200      go to rei sale  buy out of season and returned clothing and equipment  kit myself out with elite level gear for 10 of the price fix any damage tailor anything ill fitting  yeah gee i wonder whats the big deal
  those jews at rei hate gun rights and want to disarm all white people   fuck em
  but they also enable white people to free themselves from the jew and attain true racial superiority by going back to a hardier outdoor life in closer touch with nature
  rei clientele  hardier  lol pic related is an actual rei ad
  still better than having them be complete urbanites at least they might encourage their kids to come along if only just to post it on instagram still opens up the vital door of going /out/ to their söychildren
  someone shop in a mushroom cloud and /out/ memes
  elite level gear for 10 of the price  i wish maybe its cause the nearest rei to me is in the nj suburbs and so its only bikefags and brand name posers i was hoping to find a ul tent or at least a whisperlite best thing i found was a 15f bag but turns out it was only 40 off instead of 70 off    and i already have a good sleeping pad kit felt no need to upgrade that
biggest irony is rei had that optoutside black friday protest and then held this black friday sale literally the next week  funny thing was it felt no different than walmart black friday except people clamoring over used coats and car camping tents instead of tvs
it sucks now anything good is grabbed by the first person in line who is usually a fat mexican family flipping stuff on ebay
got a neoair xlite basically brand new for 40 still no punctures after 4 years    best deal ever was an rei flash 65l pack someone misplaced the decimal point on paid 12 instead of 120 was something like 200 new pack was pretty crap and fell apart after less than 2 years but i was poor at the time and it was a nice entry level pack    saw some mint condition msr snowshoes for 40 a year ago but was too slow and someone else got them
  this problem is everywhere these days fighting people for deals when they only plan to resell shit online thrift stores are the worst
i got a brand new arcteryx beta lt for 150 at a garage sale original price is 575     so yeah they are a meme in a way but sometimes you luck out hard
  i find that it is only people on /out/ who even know about rei like 70 of the stores are in california after all
  when i have to go to a large city with someone else and i tell them just drop me off at the rei while you go do your faggotry elsewhere and therefore do not get to pick and chose the dates  thats a long winded way of saying you cant drive
  wanting to drive in a city
  pretending that not driving a car in the us is somehow a badge of honor
  sorry mate for a sale you got ripped off    aliexpress 154 free shipping
  those damn things only fit small eggs besides its easier to just rob nests when in the wilderness
  the rei i frequent nipped this shit in the ass by not having all the sale gear out available for the first person to grab they kinda averaged out the quality across the quantity and would bring it out as the supplies on the floor got low and anything limited in supply they had in a separate area everyone participating at the sale with a card got a wristband and a person could only pick 1 item from that area and the wristband was cut off as you left the storage area    because of that i was able to snag a used passage 1footprint for 40 and a passage 2footprint for 50 also a couple extra footprints for tents i dont own because having extra tarps is never a bad thing forgot what i got from the limited supply area though must notve ended up using it though    still salty about the redesign of the halfdome 2 btw
  still salty about the redesign of the halfdome 2 btw  this you can tell reis target demographic is casuals now    redesign most popular 2 person tent into 25 person  no regards to extra pound of weight  no option to downsizes back to just 2lbs  but i guess that doesnt matter if all youre doing is pic related 
  go for the boots and backpacks if you want them everything else is meh for the most part but i got both these boots for 90 bucks and they retail for 310 together and are basically new it isnt as cheap as it should be but there are a few things but i havent been back to one since i got the boots
  honestly didnt know that much had changed in the redesign mostly its just i think that crossbar across the top of the poles is fucking stupid
are this things legit  or are they just a deadweight meme  do you guys carry one or you are those pretentious guys that thinks that they will never mess up
it appeals to those on the autism scale    aron snyder has an excellent possibles pouch that actually makes sense without a bunch of crap

dead weight carry shit you need not shit you think you wont need and learn to improvise
  better than nothing but would you really want to trust your survival in a worst case scenario to someone else better off doing a little research and putting together your own    bonus its pretty fun
  always carry an extra spoon
a way to make fire  warm quick drying clothes  insulation for night time  water carrying vessel  navigation   minor wound and allergic reaction medical supplies  illumination    theres your survival kit aka camping gear just about anything else is pure what if larp if youre not going to be stranded on a desert island or go down in a plane in the jungle you dont need that deadweight makeshift anything tear your clothes into bandages and a sling break sticks using lever force or rocks cut things with a piece of flint filter water through your shirt etc
enough to cover the following  fire  water  shelter  everything after that is a nice plus
    two is one one is none  dave canterbury
  two is dead weight and one is one  me
  store bought ones are not recommended unless youve actually trained with them enough to be proficient in their use and they have everything you need otherwise i always recommend to make your own kit suited to you and the situations you may encounter diy ones you see online in youtube videos should only be taken as possible options and not biblical truth      immediate  first aid  communication  shelter    secondary  water  fire    c  food

  excellent      dude look at is tats guy is clearly retarded
  his
  well people with tattoos tend to be retarded in some fashion thats a given it is like tobacco smell tattoos are a good way to know who to stay away from though vapers are getting under the radar more and more
    ul is for recreational sports not survivalism you want durability and backups not paper thin gear and ceramic knives
  within tattoos there are different levels of retardation just like every other thing
in my edc bag i keep a paracord head torch flashlight spare butane lighter sanitising alcohol gel poncho spare batteries knife sharpener shitty swiss army knife usb charger fleece hat and a water proof case with extra spare headtorch batteries energy bar schokakola cotton wool and enough filters rizla and tobacco to stop me going crazy in my car i have a camo tarp ghillie kettle armacord ratchet straps paracord etool lighter emergency tobacco  filters and rizlas a couple of tins of soup energy bars 2l of waterchanged monthly but not often enough two small hip flasks rumbourbon stove and meths more schokakola some shitty survival box with fishing hooks mirrors and safety pins etc its overkill especially since i am uk and rarely that far away from help but id rather have and not need than need and not have yes my edc bag is pretty heavy not even listed luxuries such a speaker knife sharpner weed vape phone cables eye brow tweezers but im doing green laming guerilla growing 710k dog walks not the west highland way or anything
  improvise  hence bushcraft the more you know the less you need
  whats wrong with tattoos
  the same thing thats wrong with plastic surgery piercings cologne/perfume and hair dye
  which is other than offending your naturalist sensibilities that is
  youre right survivalism isnt a recreational sport its a hobby sin e sports tend to involve at least some degree of exercise and survivalists are almost universally fat fucks    exactly if youre carrying enough gear for a simple overnight hike then congratulations youre carrying a survival kit
  they are signs of varying levels of mental and social sickness
  1 says who exactly 2 what do you consider sick certainly not going into the wilderness for long periods of time to decompress so you dont shoot up a school right
  you are not one of abraham religion are you
  if you mean one of the abrahamic religions then yes i am but treating your body like a temple has many different interpretations the egyptians decorated their temples with hieroglyphs whos to say your interpretation is right
  egyptians are a people not a religion but besides the many holes in your interpretation example people who defend decorating their body are usually insufferable people to be around its your body and your money to throw away on making your body look pretty with permanent stains formed into so called meaningful patterns so fire away to fill that void you have idc i dont and dont want to know about your decorations
  the egyptians were a people that had a religion all there own and as such their religion could be called egyptian eat a dick my semanticallyenamored friend other than that the few experiences youve ever had with people concerning their body modifications dont constitute a precedent
  yes it takes days at least to die of dehydration  exposure can kill in hours  most deaths in the wilderness are caused by exposure not thirst or starvation
  youre right survivalism isnt a recreational sport its a hobby sin e sports tend to involve at least some degree of exercise and survivalists are almost universally fat fucks    
  gets insulted  aad hhhominem not an argument  top kek you bitch nigger stupid survivalists think you need two quarter inch thick knives to spend a night outside in the woods and make fun of people who actually go /out/ because theyre competent enough to not need ridiculous amounts of redundant overweight garbage
    who hurt you
  that has been a saying before dave said it
    doesnt make it any less meaningful just more recent quote someone prior i dare you
  probably want to add a water filter to that list bro
  quote some one from what i can quote ralph waldo emerson and say to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment got dave canterbury beat by over hundred years
    are you an idjit cite the right fucking quote moron
  if you mean the whole two is one thing my dad use to say that over 20 years ago ive heard people say it before him too
  people i know with tattoos dont even like to talk about tattoos with other tattoo people the whole trend baffles me
  just more recent quote someone prior i dare you  seals coined that motto in the 80s you stupid fuck
    cite it this aint grade school he said she said bullshit internet toughguy points are earned not given
  since its slightly related to the thread heres my packing list  berghaus cyclops bag  very comfy its got some decent room as well  inflating pad rolled up and stowed on top straps  knife matches excess paracord 1st aid lighters flashlight stored in top pouch  thats the possibles pouch i suppose  side food pouch contains 4 mre entrées and heaters zip lock with instant coffee zip lock with napkin wet nap and spoons stanley cook pot trangia yellow heet gsi cup  shelter pouch on opposite side free soldier tarp with pretied cord attached and ridgeline hanked as well  hatchet stowed between pouch and bag  main pouch marmot down bag with usgi bivvy  theyre not really compressed not down to packable size in the stuff sack anyway so i hope its ok to store like that  also main pouch towel toiletry bag soap wet wipes shave brush dry bag with two clothing changes  then for water i carry a camelbak that goes on my back before the ruck and a mini sawyer with a couple squeeze bags just in case    i feel like im carrying too much i only had one trip where i felt depleted food eaten clothes worn through had to restock water while out not sure what do you guys think
  are this things legit  no  the most crucial and important part of a survival kit is water and thermal blanket exposure to heat or cold will kill you fastest but then dehydration is the greatest danger any kit not focusing on this two as primary concerns is a fucking meme any kit not having water filtration is bad but you have to have some ready water in it also i like tools i like to build shit and improvise but thats really just fucking around to survive you need water    fire is a no brainer situational benefit but thats amply covered by all kits i have ever seen and it can be very compact just use a ranger band to attach a ferro rod to a lighter the ranger band itself can be used as tinder some cutting or multi tool is always found in every one of these also but can be an edc pocket knife again no issue    water motherfucker thats the hard part you need about 3 gallons for 72 hours even if you ration and hunker down at least 1 gallon per person
  since then i got the saw and the fak but still havent found unlubricated condoms im starting to give up on those and didnt get purifying tablets either thinking about a sawyer mini too but it seems like a pain in the ass you need a whole set to be useful the flask is also kind of shit thinking about getting rid of it stinky milsurp junk the canteen cup is bretty good tho i have cooked in it a few times it works i also have the stuff for a micro fishing kit but didnt bother to put it together yet
  my job has me flying overwater at reasonably low altitudes a long way from land so in addition to the gear in the aircraft i have a small dry bag in a trouser pocket with plb  the most important  and then a heliograph a knife some paracord a ferro rod with some firecord tied to it
  not in europe
  specially in europe
  mfw i dont even own a   speaker knife sharpner
  learn to google nigger ev3n if you just type the name its show right there saying the seals coined it dave was never a seal or even in the navy lets not forget that dave did lie about his military history too notice how quickly he covered up his snipers tattoo when he got called out hes a hack
  flying overwater  brings a ferro rod  not a whistle    bushcraft is a cancer
  he cant whistle  you will never going to make it

anytime youre off the beaten path it serves to carry some basic stuff with you i would never buy a kit off the shelf only you know youre specific needs for me i know that i will be on foot crossing dense forest without trails typically as a day trip biggest potential is getting turned around or losing track of time and needing to find my way back after dark/hunker down until light i dont need water treatment hunting equipment though i probably already have that on me or a tent or tarp worst case scenario i start a fire and sit by it for 8 hours until its light enough to move again i have been in those situations and its not a big deal but much better when prepared     my always kit  fanny pack  swiss army knife vic camper  bic lighter  small headlamp  compass  flagging tape  rain poncho  mylar blanket  usually a granola bar/clif bar for morale  20 feet of cord  5 zip ties    this plus some specifics ie hunting ammo gloves/hat when cold gps unit means even if its not super fun i have my basics of staving off exposure taken care of
   some stolen valor cuck   mattering
  whistling with your mouth is much quieter than with a whistle and you tire from it surprisingly quickly the sound of a rescue whistle carries for a very long distance and is quite distinct from normal bird or animal sounds so rescuers are much more likely to notice it
  i always thought a survival kit was some small as possible minimalist thing for example a ul bivy bag ziploc and water purification firestarter etc you can carry in your first line gear for example your pants at all times even to use it when you get separated from your backpack  what you are listing is just regular hiking gear i will carry anyway if im out
  theres no one answer but yeah thats a reasonable set of criteria thats why i like the small fanny pack youve got it on even if you ditch the big pack and it doesnt get in the way as much as loaded pockets
  i live in straps  australia where if your vehicle breaks down you might not see another car on the road for a few days or a week   i keep gear like that and a first aid kit in my car just in case plus a couple of days food  last time i broke down i just turned it into a camping trip
  pot lid lifter  no pot lid
  just boil it
  my pockets are already full
  as a matter of fact theres a whistle with the heliograph and goodness sweetheart maybe theres small bits of land that sticks out of water from time to time
  maybe theres small bits of land that sticks out of water from time to time  i wouldnt bet my life on it
  hence the plb and heliograph which are far more important than a whistle or a fire ive done sar from the air successfully and unsuccessfully if you dont have an epirb or plb you are indeed fucked
  the earth is fla
  then keep it on your belt my point was that a survival kit should be small and minimal enough to be carried at all times if you go /out/ if its bigger than cargo pocket size and heavy the chances of you taking it on your day hike in the mountains is small and thats the moment you may actualy need it same goes for trekking /backcountry hunting it should be small enough that you carry it with you even when your main pack is at camp having a full bug out bag styl esurvival kit  is ok for gneral disaster prepardness but you will never carry this much on your body if your out on foot
    if you are hiking/camping then isnt your normal kit already a survival kit     first aid whistle headlamp that can do sos signals and mobile phone maybe add a space blanket and water purifier on a day trip if you want to be super prepared
  i have an extensive first aid kit in my car  nothing edible in it though
  keep that golly away from your girl  they like white meat
  thats not the curvature of the earth its the curvature of a fish eye lens
  my belt is full too though
  fuck off bepis
im looking for a new water bottle or something to use when im camping/hiking any recommendations/advice
this has gotta be peak /out/
  here nigger
nalgene seems to be a favorite or you could just do a smart water bottle with a sawyer filter for lightweight
agreed smartwater is lightest and cheapest
id recommend both in pic  used them for a long time and are still great
  klean kanteen or anything stainless or glass for that matter 1 survival for stainless uninsulated so you can boil water in it  inb4 chromium poisoning retards
anything stainless or titanium or if you dont beleive in conspiracy theories are cheap and dont mind a bit off aluminum in you water aluminum
anyone thruhike or section hike any of the triple crown trails in the us im getting out of the military and plan on hiking the appalachian trail northbound this april and was wondering if anyone had any advice or stories
  i hiked the at this season just gone and ill be on the pct 2019 sobo ive hiked other long trails in the us and europe any specific questions
  how many neet bucks are you getting 40 can keep you hiking but it might just prove you are faking     what was your branch and occupation
  why would you hike an overpopulated trail like the at    it will be filled with obnoxious people awfully contaminated and filled with shit literal on the side of the trails
    pct is where its at why sobo though    id like to have a go at it nobo in mid april whats the food situation like looks like you almost have to have someone mail you replacement gear and mailing yourself extra food isnt too far fetched if the only options are bodegas and such
  nah this nigga is some bullshit ever wanting to prove something i can feel it
  why sobo though  much quiter later start date id like to squeeze a month or twos more work in the sierras build up nicely going south less snow in the sierras the desert is also cooler less rain in the pnw less bugs desu as far as i can see most people nobo for the social aspect    everyone ive spoken to who sobod last year said they had no real issues with resupply but its not as simple as noboing
  quiter  quieter    when i was on the tahoe rim trail after the at i met so many nobos on the pct and it was late on the season they all said they were behind the bubble but it looked crowded desu i got enough of the crowds on the at so my priority next year is a quieter hike

  yeeee testing out a new shelter system at the moment 9x6 cuben tarp paired with a light bivy
  about how long did it take and how much did it cost how many miles did you average per day and how many zero days did you take did you go nobo sobo or flip flop what was your favorite / least favorite part         30 but i didnt fall into the boot trap of a 40 apr mustang so im not really all that worried about the financial aspect muhreen 5831 correctional specialist i go on terminal in mid march
  marines bust be on their shit if your terminal date is that far out and you already know your disability i didnt know mine until like 2 weeks before i took off enjoy your last months in you think you hate all those cocksuckers but you will miss them a lot 30 is probably like 700 dollars a month under this new plan trump bumped the payments up
  about how long did it take and how much did it cost   i completed the trail in 101 days was set to summit k on the 100th day but it was clouded out i didnt walk that far not to get a view  i spent 5000 on the trail this excludes gear and travel to and from the trail i spent freely  how many miles did you average per day and how many zero days did you take   so the first 1/3 of the trail i hung out with some cool people and was doing 1518 miles a day for the rest of the trail i was doing 2530 miles a day i only took one zero but nerod a handful of time  did you go nobo sobo or flip flop   nobo  what was your favorite / least favorite part  favourite was the whites dont have a least favourite part but the trail certainly can be monotonous once the leaves came out the green tunnel was real
  i havent gotten my rating yet but ive torn both acls which required surgery on two separate occasions in addition to other stuff so hopefully itll be over 30 but i dont expect less than that       thanks for the reply how did you feel when you finished i know thats a deep question but ive been romanticizing this for a long time
  101 days  how do you manage to take that much time off work assuming you have a job
  how did you feel when you finished  i went to ca and hiked the tahoe rim trail i felt great ive set aside the next four to five years to complete a bunch of long distance hikes a this was just part of a bigger plan i dont buy into the whole thru hiking will change your life idea but then again this want my first long distance trail so maybe itd have a bigger impact if it was    self employed and living like a hermit hiking is my main focus on life at the moment
  ive set aside the next four to five years to complete a bunch of long distance hikes  do you have a blog     this was just part of a bigger plan  thats something an old religious person would say
  blog  i share photos with my family on insgram but i do most my blog posting here    thats something an old religious person would say  out is my church and hiking is my religion
  did the pct 6 years ago was epic did wonders for my ptsd now working on the coastal trail imperial beach to pelican state beach and fell into a way to get paid by the state to do it fire fucked up some of it but man its a hoot  stuck here smokingndrinking in a pseudo hipster commune in petrolia califonia waiting for the storms to pass in town blessings unto to you my brother oorah
  nigga u tore both acls nigga you at 70
at  pct  sobo  nobo  zero day    kys people
    also you do t even know what they will give you at this point like i get an extra 10 because my shooting side ear has less hearing just go to your exit appointments with double acl you will get bank
  go on then have a you i hope it keeps you quiet
can you thru hike if youre overweight and out of shape
  sure you wont be bashing out monster days when you first start out but youll definitely be more in shape and less over weight by the end of it
  i saw old men old women kids asian hippies doing it so sure go for it
just watched some gal finishing her cdt thru hike and fuck me if her last days near the canadian border wasnt gnarly as fuck hiking in very snowy mountains with nothing but some ul gear and clothing is impressive having in account the weather conditions no to mention she was wearing trail runners
  cdt is based
      i got spooked by the crowds too so im going to be starting te araroa in nz at the end of this year only a few hundred people do it every year and im going nobo which is even less popular    of the triple crown the cdt seems to be the least crowded but the terrain interests me less than nz
  road  if thats what you want then pic related
    theres some roads yeah it was only opened in 2011 so they havent had the decades that the at and pct have had to set everything up there used to be a lot more roads on the at too    but it is mostly actual trail pic related
  dont stay at standing bear it sucks its right after you leave the smokies get some snacks from them maybe but thats about it after making it through roan highlands go to bobs dairyland get a double burger try to avoid hooking up with larger groups rocksylvania isnt all that bad if you arent a purist do at least one day or a half day of road walking in the shannies it has some great views
  tbh the ta doesnt look that great i have a friend hiking it at the moment and some sections look great but i dont think a thru hike is going to be an awesome experience youre better off going to nz and doing a series of shorter hikes
  standing bear  i had a great time at standing bear and im not a member of the party crowd its worth stopping there for some restbite after smokies as that section is straight up hostile to thru hikers then pushing on and sleeping just before hot springs the smoking mountain diner is so so good
    im definitely going to do the south island since that seems to be pretty much all wilderness and cabins ill see how i feel once i get to the north island which has more farms and road walking
  this is a better approach the ta is definitely more suited to section hiking pick the best bits hike them and then use any time you have left to hike some of the wilderness areas that the ta bypasses
  link it
  sectionhiked pretty much the whole pct north of mt shasta over the last 67 years only doing 70100 mile trips in the summer    we always did our sections going north to south and whenever we met thruhikers doing the whole damn thing wed try and fuck with them and convince them they were heading the wrong way got a few people pretty good    if youve never done long hikes before start with something smaller than the big three do the jmt or something instead
  
  do the jmt  never thru hiked a long trail and i am going to apply to sobo the jmt in july or august   i am not even considering nobo and if i dont win a permit then ill do the tahoe rim at least there i wont have to hike out my own scat in plastic bags
  did the jmt in 96 didnt have all that bs you got there what happened
  i did a big stretch of the jmt last summer including a summit at whitney but we started way to the south outside of the trail all in all we only hiked about 50 miles on the jmt but didnt ever have to shit in a bag once    a couple of years ago on my first summit of whitney we hiked in from the portal and just did the summit loop that time i had to shit in a bag and carry it out and that fucking sucked
  probably just massive increases in traffic making it harder to get in same thing happened in the last decade or so with st helens in wa state     i dont think backpacking was nearly as mainstream a hobby in 96 as it is today but how would i know i was born in 96 also holy shit youre old
      shr  jmt
  i thruhiked the at 2017 sobo    going at it nobo i strongly suggest starting at an odd time if you can manage it either really early or if you dont care about actually summiting katahdin really late    hiking the trail nobo during peak hiking season is hell absolutely everyone ive spoken to about it was able to confirm its just a swarm of hippies stupid college kids and idiots who have no business being in the outdoors all converging on the trail in a horde eating up all the shelter space stinking the whole trail up with the smell of their frequent weed breaks and dumping trash everywhere to get the raccoons mice squirrels and bears interested in your food bag too and of course you can forget getting any solitude on the trail not while the frat party hiking behind you has their music blaring out of their minispeakers and the sorority clique ahead of you wont stop giggling and screaming    if you absolutely must start in april id recommend either doing it sobo you run into harder terrain to start but if youre already military conditioned it wont be a problem and the people are a lot less retarded or flipflop it the atc actually has been requesting that more hikers consider a flipflop specifically to combat the fact that the hordes of dipshit hikers with the occasional actual decent hiker interspersed are getting bigger and bigger every year
  i can offer some answers here too    how long and how much  i started early june and finished late november im a slow boi so i wound up costing more than you probably will all said i wound up spending around 5500 about 800 on my initial gear another 500 on replacements and the rest on buying supplies in the towns i came through and on taking zeroes    nobo sobo flip flop  sobo the forced conditioning to start was hell but as soon as i passed the whites it was smooth sailing and i was damn glad for my choice    how many miles did you average how many zero/nearo days did you take  again im slower than most and i had no set end date to boot so i took my time going through i wound up averaging about 14 miles per day and usually took one zero a week i stopped in most of the towns i passed early on and about half of the ones i passed later just because there were so damn many    favorite part  aside from the sheer joy of relaxing in a hotel and gorging on town food the white mountains south of mt washington i felt like i was in the scottish highlands easily my favorite part of the whole trip absolutely gorgeous    least favorite part  the mahoosuc notch also known as the most difficult mile on the at im sure i would have loved this place given any other situation but just north of the mahoosuc notch the mahoosuc arm one of if not the steepest mile on the at a chick i was hiking with fell and sprained her foot we thought turned out she actually broke her damn fibula wound up having to carry her and her gear through the notch because no one there could afford the 12000 air lift it would take to get her out without a selfrescue
  absolutely if you hike it nobo the trail will get you in shape as you go if you hike it sobo youll deal with about 1  15 months of hell and then be in phenomenal shape and able to pound out the rest of the trail in a breeze    the trail really is just starving yourself in slow motion as you walk for a really long time its the reason why hiker hunger is a thing youll be in much better shape by the end of it    and there will definitely be hard parts but i saw 80 year old men women carrying babies and 8 year old children all hiking the trail you can do it

  while i agree with you you misread his comment
  i didnt anon i just beat a jude playing his own game 6d chess my good ol fren
  yo goy spend all your money on shitty memegear pushed by (((youtube))) sponsors instead of having a family buying your way to self sufficiency and keeping low key pleasant time proven gear that doesnt immediately signpost that you have a house full of food and guns and ammo to be looted or that youre a fucking autist larper and probably a deranged loose canon anyway ie fuck out of my homestead group and take your karambit and paracord buttplug with you
  oy vey my good goy keep wasting time watching and saving animeshit that will make you a worthwhile member of our post societal collapse group and keep eating processed foods and not exercising either
  there is truly no hope for you its a miracle youve made it this far    yup he misread it big time    so taking the piss out of meme gear means i am against self sufficiency growing your own food cutting your own timber and working towards off grid   most of us normal folk just call than homesteading/off grid not fucking apocalypse prepping
  yet here you are on 4channel
  fuck off back to /pol/
shills shilling shills shilling shills shilling shills shilling shills
  apocalypse  nice once again adding words to fit your script i sure hope that all people who just got stranded in alaska due to the earthquake didnt have some extra food supplies no one wants you to think bad of them amrite      thats right on a /out/doors board without having for a single time going to containment boards saved a image or watched a single episode of that trash       found the chosen one
  stocking up on food common sense  buying gas masks with asbestos filters the russians have thrown out retard    am i speaking to the man himself
  gas masks  youre the one saying that i havent read one post of people clamming to do the same youre from the beginning doing nothing but shitpost and attempting to troll this tread is retarded and you should feel ashamed maybe go see if your /k/retin friends want to give you the attention you seem to crave for    also why are you posting some random middle aged gay porn actor are you that desperate for new subs
  i made this picture then you got triggered like a retard   strawmanning much
  does nothing but shitpost and troll  why u mad bro kkkkk  sick burns bro i dont know how will i cope
  on a thread about taking the piss out of bugout bags and meme gear
  asian beef strips and the asbestos mask  u ded
  exactly
  if you even know the word anime youre too far gone
  youre a fucking illiterate retard op was making fun of mallninjatier doomsday preppers not of general disaster preparedness like buying a generator or stocking up on food and water i have no idea how you could possibly interpret it as such unless he somehow struck a nerve with you you dont actually own a full set of tacticool gear do you you dont believe your 300 crye precision pants will save you during teotwawki do you
  you know the word anime even know how to spell it you just typed it out   step one remove cyanide capsule  step 2 load and charge luger pistol  step 3 place cyanide capsule between back teeth and bite down hard  step 4 put luger to temple  step 5 pull trigger
  well go out together old fren
  dont put it against your temple instead put it back about an inch or two further this way if it fails you dont end up just blowing out both eyes
  thats what the cyanide is for in case the headshot fails its the way hitler went out
oh noes you just ran into quicksand  what now anon
  realise im not in a fetish film production and continue on my merry way
      the fourthgraders were unanimous quicksand doesnt scare them not one bit if youre a 9 or 10yearold at the ps 29 elementary school in brooklyn ny youve got more pressing concerns dragons monsters big waves at the beach that might separate a girl from her mother thirty years ago quicksand might have sprung up at recess in pools of discolored asphalt or the dusty corners of the sandboxstep in the wrong place and youd die but not anymore a boy named zayd tells me i think people used to be afraid of it he says his classmates nod it was before we were born explains owen maybe it will come back one day
  i channel all the knowledge i have accumulated from watching man vs wild and proceed to die
  shit myself
  
  its more dense than water so you can just swim out of it there is really not much to be afraid of its more a movie trope than a real hazard    its a different story if it is sand pouring down into an underground cavern then you can actually be pulled down depending on the flow rate
  where do you live ill check the local news for a retard who died in quicksand while hiking
  would be a first
  this anon is right
  its more dense than water so you can just swim out of it    density/viscosity has no bearing on ability to swim in a substance
  it doesnt but dense liquids are easier to float on thats why people like to float around in the dead sea really quicksand is no issue
  thankfully it is really only an issue for retards
  it will come back one day  in the form of a sinkhole swallowing your bedroom at 3am  sinkholes are terrifying one of them ate most of my favorite corvettes one dumbass here lost his truck in quicksand on a beach but he had that coming to him he stil just walked out of it people that were scared of quicksand just remember them from 1930s adventure films
  f
  shit
  so anyone got links to quicksand porn or nah
  this i remember calculating that you would only sink to the waist in my highschool physics class
  i used to beat off to this so much as a teenager   muddy girls get my dick diamonds
  density has no bearing on ability to swim in a substance     holy fucking retard alert can you swim in air anon are you jesus     people/animals drown all the time in aeration pools at water plants where the bubbles in the water dramatically lower the density so that the water youre swimming in doesnt behave like water at all     archimedes would like a fucking word with you 8th grade science class is calling
  dont move you are lighter than mud
  make my self a horizontal and flat as possible anything else is deaths quicksand is real and a danger especially in costal areas when the tide will kill you if you dont drown in sand/mud first    
  what youve never watched youtube videos of people swimming in syrup mud quicksand pools of nonnewtonian fluid pudding or anything else crazy    also air isnt a liquid
  wow youre even dumber than i thought all of what you listed are denser than water not less dense     once again i regret to inform you that you are not smarter than an 8th grader
      also air is a fluid and fluid dynamics are a unified field theoretically if you were a nitrogenbased organism with a density similar to that of an thermal in the sky or if you just strapped a big ballon on your back you could exercise a kind of swimming in air due to the density     the very idea of swimming  buoyancy  propulsion within a fluid     no buoyancy you sink   no propulsion you stay still    and how do we get buoyancy kids     archimedes principle     archimedes principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid  fluid  fluids are a phases of matter and include liquids gases and plasmas    in summation youre fucking dumb as hell
  doggone nearly lost a 400 dollar hand cart
  people/animals drown all the time in aeration pools at water plants where the bubbles in the water dramatically lower the density so that the water youre swimming in doesnt behave like water at all    met a dude in a hostel once who was in town to do a flowingwater rescue course he said the aerated water in the rapids made it impossible to make headway as your hands just pulled air not water
quicksand hasnt been part of popular culture since the 1980s most of the kids answering the survey probably never even heard of it before  that said quicksand does exist but usually its not like in the movies heres a video of a guy getting sucked in while flyfishing in atlanta idaho 
i will do this on the verge of sinking
    youre welcome anon
  crazy noisy insects
shitposting aside arent you supposed to somehow pull your legs and change the angle of your body as if you were swimming
ive gotten caught in chest high mudit took everything i had to get out and i lost my shoes if it had been overhead i wouldve died
  alaskafag here people/animals getting stuck in silt beds is a real concern especially put on the turnagain arm where all the big rivers dump out into the sea people go out and get suck and cant get out before the tide comes in  its kind of cool when they rescue people though they get a pumper truck and a hose and pump water underneath until it thins out enough for the person to become more buoyant
a time ago in 2013114 i came across a thread about a guy talking about these creatures that he could only see out of the corner of his eye when he began to tell people about them they became more aggressive at one point he talked about how one went in to his bathroom from under the door
  
what are we going to do about mustangs /out/
  increase glue exports
huey gunship  hydra rockets  m134s       profit
    lets just bring lions back lions are just as native as mustangs
  how about vipers
  why not shooting lions from helicopters  
repeal the wild and freeroaming horse and burro act and manage them exactly like any other wild herbivore population  dont protect them from predators or starvation allow hunting/capture to maintain population control in areas where predators dont do the job adequately  but also dont exterminate them just because some ranchers are butthurt that federal land sometimes contains wild animals
as much as i like shooting things i just find them too damn pretty         this makes sense though
  im not a rancher im butthurt that federal land contains feral animals which have been shown to compete with mule deer for habitat
  import some colombians theyll take good care of the burros its basic ecology
  federal employee here that works to manage them here they arent wild animals theyre inbred as fuck feral livestock and most of the territories and management areas have effectively been ecologically decimated and turned into a mostly monoculture of cheatgrass
if were going to have wild horses then we need to reintroduce camels elephantscheetahs and other megafauna
    get  this  shit  done
  fence in areas where you dont want them  dart them  chop of their nads or remove their lady parts  wait for them all to die out because they cant reproduce  worked pretty well on some wildlife preserves out in oregon and nevada
  think its too costly to spey a horse just make a ton of geldings and thin the lady horse number
send in a pack of those carcass dildoing thots to handle them
literally fuck them
how is everyones waterfowl season coming along been pretty slow so far had a really good opener and then things died off quick ive been seeing a lot more mallards late season than in years past but they are all pretty smart by now and difficult to decoy lots of divers a few weeks ago but they were all miles out and things are starting to freeze up so im thinking they are long gone by now surprised i havent seen many buffleheads yet
jesus i hate iphones
  been treating me pretty good
  sexy gun is that a stoeger how have the numbers been for you this year
  texas gulf coast here last saturday was the first day i could make it out this season seems slower than last year saw hardly any pintails when last year i was drowning in them came home with 2 spoonbills 2 wigeons and a bluewing between 3 shooters not great no pics on me right now also it was warm as shit and the mosquitos were fierce
  tristar hunter its a poorly made beretta 682 clone    had the best early teal season ive ever had first year i ever limited out and averaged 3 birds per hunt    opener for regular ducks and geese was fucking magic had a blizzard opening weekend so i sat in the cattails on the lee side of a pothole and was limited out by 9am could have limited sooner but was passing up hens and widgeon holding out for pintail and mallards thats what these pics are from rest of season has been better than average with the colder than normal weather but were gonna freeze out soon and ill have to either shoot goldeneye on the creeks ew or drive 4 hours south
  black duck hybrid  didnt realize it wasnt a juvie mallard until i started dressing them out
  no kidding ive never seen one how do you tell the difference from a juvie mallard
  bill color and the breast being adult plumage its subtle
about to head out now pretty sure i spooked up two buffleheads on the way back to the launch last trip out would love to shoot some today but setting up on the river is kind of a pain in the ass ill probably just stick to the marsh and go for mallards
uk here more wood mallards than you can shake a stick at averaging about five per trip but concentrating on wood pigeons as they come in to roost and walking them up hedgrows  they love all the thorn berries just now been invited to shoot a few pheasants here and there too not seen as many geese as ive been expecting this year and nobody is shooting woodcock this year either around here at least
  roasted pheasant is some fucking god tier game meat
  nobody is shooting woodcock this year  maybe they finally realized they taste like earthworms    timberdoodles are neat but they taste like shit same with snipe and rails  tfw paid to have a snipe taxidermied just to be the big swingin dick that actually got a snipe on a snipe hunt  tfw even lifelong hunters have to be beaten over the head with my audubon book when they go but anon snipe arent real  tempted to fabricate a jackalope to hang next to it    teal season was fun but holy shit did the skeeters tear me up
  didnt have much luck here in central al for opening weekend     shot one nice looking woody but didnt see much on fri and sat    nw al saw alot of birds around decatur and next weekend is bringing some cooler temperatures from the nw maybe that draws them off the ms river    im expecting to have a good late season where im at
so im one of those classic guys who has been shooting literally all his life and never learned to hunt ive shot birds on a preserve before and loved it but i dont think that really counts what is the best way to learn to hunt and to catch up on the life skill i missed
first start hunting through the catalog asshat 
  if people actually used the catalog thered be zero new threads on /out/ at any one time there is at least six knife threads four boot threads and three mushroom threads
  are you saying no new threads would be a good thing or a bad thing because i love 2 month old threads with shitloads of info in them over 5 4 day old threads that are each half bullshit plus it would be easier to find the topic you want
think about it they are far less evolved than broadleafs ideally suited to tropical and subtropical areas but can manage to exist most places they all look the same they shit up areas with needles and cones etc    broadleafs are like the white people of trees highly evolved to survive colder areas with less sunlight highly diverse with many types of leaves and bark and colored foliage they make areas beautiful with flowers and fruits and fall foliage they give specific character to specific regions and so on
i think you meant to write eucalyptus
the beauty of broadleaf trees is unmatched
amen
  beautifully put anon
black locust a personal favorite
  less evolved    if i recall correctly they are more evolved than the more recent broad leaf trees simply because theyve been around far longer and undergone more genetic change
challenge accepted
i will defeat you
i will defeat you with what we in the real world call oc
  broadleafs are like the white people of trees highly evolved to survive colder areas with less sunlight  ive always wondered why really northern places like canada alaska siberia finland and scandinavia are known for their lush oak and beech forests instead of boring taiga
they run and hide
oc of an appalachian oak forest
  fukken sideways
  implying finland wasnt terraformed to be filled with pineniggas
  pines are not subject to much tempature diversity requirements they can grow in non tropical pines need sand based soil and fire     your a fucking moron
  found the 
  they are far earlier in evolutionary time all conifers are     why are broadleafs deciduous
  this  the pine at least is useful for timber
op clearly has never been blessed by the smell of the california wilderness
  which is neck to neck with juniper
  spruces are the real nigga trees they grow way faster than broadleaf trees and poisen the soil they grow on destroy whole forests with their parasites also they burn way too quickly  they have some perks but more disadvantages
op is an idiot get back to oregon trail
  black spruce da goat
  not all broadleaf plants are deciduous an enormous number of species are broadleaf evergreens     additionally not all conifers are evergreens youre conflating two different things
  based
  do you mean all conifers or just pine trees i dont think you have any idea what youre talking about typical ignorance of the scientific racist
  pine trees    not juniper or yew or hemlock or spruce or cedar or ginkgo    pine trees
what do you wish youd never spent your shekels on  for me its the heavy cover/keith canteen relatively heavy single purpose faux military larp bottle that cost me 150 holds 11l of water and you cant cook in it probably thought it would make me cool and prepared at the time did get many mires though and its a cool shape just picking between selling it or giving it to my kids     what do you ragret
  buying a donkey thought wed be chill and hed carry my gear but he just bites me when im not looking and brays all the time jerk
  not a awful knife but i quickly realised big knives are a meme and luckily its the only one i own over 4 inches
why not just get the us gi    might could paint zebra stripes on it and charge gringos money to take pictures with it
  same my donkey kept stealing my weed when i was asleep
  why cant you cook in it isnt is just a ti version of the mil spec you can boil water to your hearts content in the military canteen and those pails are for cooking
  cold steel is a meme
   you can boil water in a military canteen  you sure as shit cant in the current us ones
  pretty much everything milsurp ive bought exactly 3 pairs of finnish wool pants that are good one berghaus bag if you absolutely have to count that but everything else is memey every knife that isnt a mora big knives are a cruel meme hatchets do their work and you can get a decent hatchet for 30 dollars the 200 dollar ones are another bad faith meme theres probably more but thats the top of my head for you
snowpoint kettle no1  its good but the unlockable handle fucking infuriates me
usmc ilbe main pack was awful for backpacking with   makes for a great pack basket though
  oh yeah this too jesus christ the memes are real
  is this the mini or are water filters a waste
  cant cook in the actual bottle so you may as well get a generic plastic bottle  titanium cup for a fraction of the price and half the weight     the kidney cup is fine its just an inelegant 2piece hunk of metal just to carry 1l of water i now use a very simple very robust system of a titanium pot with a silicon stretch lid and a tough ziplock for extra water carries
  bbut i like mine aanon
  i got a scandi forest axe as a gift and love the thing to death i built some shit with that little axe
  its good but they are overpriced and not any better quality geometry isnt great misleading marketing and grind and handle needs thinned like a cheap axe anyway
  my buddy got one found out the makers mark was the womans and returned it haha
sorry guy i got one for like 15 bucks with a belt    the generator might have been a mistake 100 bucks but its a pull start pain in the ass to start
  im talking about the mini that motherfucker takes forever to fill a bottle it sucks particularly when youre hiking all day and its hot
  lol
    t doesnt know how to use a knife bigger than his dick
  t batonny backyard chop chop 3/4 tang
    cant see how any of your points would be true own one myself and have had no problems whatsoever
i bought this yugoslav mess kit that you can cook in and the bottom is enameled so you can actually wipe the black carbon stains if your cooking over wood/ash  the regret is the one i bought before this it was some stanley /out/ pot/water kettle set that was ok but the lit had a plastic tab on it i wound up drilling holes in it to try to attach a wire and shit and fucked it up  why would you ever put plastic on anything thats going to be on/in/near a fire
  picrel i bought it after my first camping trip which was shit normie tier and i thought id need it i dont     i have the same yugo one its a nice collectible but the plastic bottle just makes the water taste like shit
  feel free to prove me wrong protip you cant  
  they are not really hand forged the handles are terribly thick and absorb no shock flat cheeked geometry is not optimal bit is ground to around 225 degrees when the axe should be at 17  basically you need to spend time to get it to perform how it should just like a cheap axe and you are paying silly money for it
i bought a foldout pocket when most of my pants already have 9  only thing i ever used it for was picking cherriesin my own backyard
  same here i bought a dump pouch like that and all i used it for was woodcraft shit just collecting tinder and whatnot never needed to throw any mags in it yet
bought this and then tried to get a girl to go camping with me    that was 6 years ago  box is unopened
  i should have used my sustainmemt pouch more often now all of my pockets have all manner of shit stuck in them and are stained by berry/ grape juice
  also good for holding shells when trap shooting
  here the blades i use the most rated in several categories  bk7 by far my most used knoife  carving 6/10  bushwacking 8/10  cooking 8/10 too thick for carrots   chopping 8/10  splitting 8/10  skinning 7/10  second is my mora   carving 10/10  bushwacking 2/10 too light   cooking 7/10 too short  chopping 1/10 too light  splitting 1/10  skinning 8/10  3rd santoku   carving 1/10  bushwacking 2/10  cooking 10/10  chopping no  splitting no  skinning no   4th tramontina 18  carving 2/10  bushwacking 10/10  cooking 3/10 too long   chopping 6/10 hurts hand if tree to big  splitting 2/10 too thin   skinning no  4th is an old german 800g hatchet  carving 4/10  bushwacking 1/10  cooking 3/10 its an axe   chopping 10/10  splitting 10/10  skinning 1/10  so overall for allpurpose activities they are as follows  bk7 75/10  mora 48/10  santoku 22/10  tramontina 38/10  axe 48/10  so unless you combine the mora with an axe you cant beat a big knife for all purpose use and even if you do decide to combine the 2 you still lack the ability of bushwacking
only 30 bucks but still for 20 more i could get something that does not need a million guy lines to stay pitched and does not leak during rain
  that is gold
  mora and billhook  splitting wood with knife  carve wedges anon you can split a fuck off round with a swiss knife
  are you the anon who tried to get a hooker to go camping with him and totally not murder her
  you prove my point  just admit it big 68knives are the best all purpose size  saves time  saves space  saves weight
  no  how exactly do i prove your point show me a video of a bk7 cutting down a tree better than a axe or billhook and you can claim victory  mors kochanski says a 4 blade is the best wilderness knife and based off his and my own experience it adds up  if you are planning on doing any sort of work for more than 5 mins bring the proper tool
  my ratings already show that the bk7 is worse at axe stuff than an axe  my point was that you need 2 tools to be better than an all purpose 7 incher ie 4incher alone  7incher so if your just going on a day hike or even a multi day hike and need to cut some brush chop some kindling build a shelter and cook big knoife is the tool to go  if youre setting a permanent camp you can bring as many tools as you want since you wont be hauling them all day long
  if youre day hiking and planning to do that work why the fuck would you bring the wrong tool to save on weight but not on labor trying to get your knife to do a machete job
  bk7 is 350 grams  billhook is 600  tomahawk is 600  mora is 80 grams  for that little bit of extra weight the performance is substantially greater      if you are going on a day hike you really dont need much more than a sak
  really i have nothing but nice things to say about mine light adaptable to a lotta systems/configurations what went awry with yours
  here satan 
  tried back flushing it  t captain obvious
    bk7    buck thug    rat 7    cs bushman    need not say more
  takes fucking ages to cut through a wrist thick log    ill stick to my axes 15kg of wood destruction
im not a hardcore /out/doorsman but im not happy with my supposed to be decent quality tent i bought a field and stream wilderness lodge 6 im just doing car camping and received multiple stellar reviews and after 2 set ups the god damn seams in 3 of the corners are ripping out     initially it looks like an awesome comfy tent huge roof so you can fully stand up / have moving room to setup a mattress change clothes etc its petty easy to setup has a vestibule too so you can shove any easily stolen items inside when you leave / sleep to hopefully help reduce any temptation from shitheads and have a little mud room to get your gross shoes / flip flops / etc off before you go in the tent     now i know this isnt an ultimate quality item but i bought the tent a year before setting it up so no warranty but for christ sakes a coleman walmart tent is bound to hold up better
  22 mag rifle to bag squirrels  none sighted cant remember where or what i traded it for    all sorts of coyote calls and urine and rifles  never seen a yote    turkey calls and videos  never needed  only drunkenly stumbled into a field and woke up during an afternoon nap to a turkey flock frolicking like fools and blasted one out of dumb luck    deer blinds calls urine scent control archery equipment   fuckin fuck  dont get me started on fishing or state licenses
  i dunno i have these shell pants and theyre pretty awesome just wish they were a solid color at least when i have to go /k/ ill have them  
  i used those for years in the army in both multicam and digital theyre ok but theyre run of the mill rain pants
  i remember that was hoping he opened the door to some kind of new age hippie whoring
    i regret purchased a kylmit blow up pillow its oddly shaped and it slides around super anoying    i love my klymit static v insulated sleeping pad but i regret not spending the extra money to get the ultralight version
katadyn camp gravity filter  when the filter stays wet for more than a few hours the fibers swell and shut the whole fucking thing down cold what fucking good is a water filter that get broken by water
    sak or leatherman   carving 8/10 fun but not necessary only semirelevant   bushwacking not necessary therefore irrelevant   cooking 10/10   chopping not necessary therefore irrelevant   splitting not necessary therefore irrelevant   skinning 5/10 but im shit at it so my opinion doesnt count    big knives are only necessary for bushcrafting and bushcrafting is stupid therefore big knives are stupid
  water filter that gets broken by water  thats retarded
  devils got all the time in the world
  they are not really hand forged    they use machine hammers but the axe head is forged by people as seen in their advertising i saw a complete trip through their factory    the handles are terribly thick and absorb no shock    what kind of hands do you have im not a big guy myself and never had an issue with the handle ive used splitting axes and mauls myself as well which have much thicker handles than my tiny gränsfors bruks cant see how the problem lies with the axe here maybe you just need to work some more and get stronger so using a tool doesnt hurt your little hands    does the handle have a straight grain is it made of secondgrowth ickory or hard maple those are the two questions i would have asked    flat cheeked geometry is not optimal bit is ground to around 225 degrees when the axe should be at 17    optimal for what an axe mostly performs two tasks chopping and splitting to chop into wood you need a flat angle to split wood you need a wide angle this axe is a forest axe a bastard between a full sized logging axe and a camp hatchet intended to both cut smaller trees and split fire wood for the campfire naturally it will not excel either of its parents and the angle of the bit will fall in between those of chopping and splitting axes it also depends on what wood you want to cut hardwood and softer woods react differently to flat or wide angled bits so if you want an axe to perform okay all over the board you need to make compromises and thats exactly what the company has done with that axe    basically you need to spend time to get it to perform how it should    considering what i just pointed out that statement goes out of the window     just like a cheap axe and you are paying silly money for it    confirmed to not know jack shit about axes and the work they must perform i paid like 100 bucks for my axe and its not silly money theres a broad number of tools that cost the same or even more
  for you armchair generals that dont use products like this at least weekly    its goto be kept moist once u start using it or the fibers bind up     if it stops flowing its cause your not using it enough havent backwashed it or storing it properly between meme posting     hook up a full water bottle and let it soak for a few days to bring it back to life
  you are the one who knows nothing  video related is me  if you can do better prove it    
    the more videos you post the more i like you man
    lug at me im on jootoob    nice try at evading the points i made now you either address them and come up with a sensible argument as to why an axe thats supposed to do a variety of tasks should not be a compromise between more specialized tools for specific jobs or you can just shut it
  cant see how the problem lies with the axe here maybe you just need to work some more and get stronger so using a tool doesnt hurt your little hands  haaah god this man how to spot a trendy axe user who doesnt know how to use it red flag 1 right there
  not hand forged becuase they use massive shaped dies to do the majority of work  handle thickness covered in video  flat cheeked geometry covered in this video   22 degrees is too thick for a axe of this size not ready ground out of the box  100 bucks is silly money for what you really get    what can i say i have owned and used them compared them to pretty much every other axe on the market cut 4 face cords using only an axe this year and am getting into timbersports  i know my shit and am trying to discourage others from bieng shilled into buying into the gransfors meme    if thats still not good enough for you so be it
  ahmen brother my case of tennis elbow can attest to the out of the box quality of gransfors handles
    i work in forestry and am quite amused how many shitposters on here blame a tool because they are incapable of using it correctly just the other day i saw the webm of the guy splitting wood with a kukri knife blaming the wood for getting stuck in a log        not hand forged becuase they use massive shaped dies to do the majority of work    it is made by a person using machines that qualifies as hand forged    handle thickness covered in video  flat cheeked geometry covered in this video    write it here not gonna watch your videos    22 degrees is too thick for a axe of this size not ready ground out of the box    again its not its too flat for a good splitting axe and too wide for a good chopping axe its right down the middle its a compromise    100 bucks is silly money for what you really get    no its not your poverty disgusts me    what can i say i have owned and used them compared them to pretty much every other axe on the market cut 4 face cords using only an axe this year and am getting into timbersports    so you are playing around for jootoob videos thats nice    i know my shit and am trying to discourage others from bieng shilled into buying into the gransfors meme    you yourself are pushing shit here i work in forestry and can attest that the axe does what its advertised for its a compromise between a large poleax and a camping hatched good for both splitting and chopping when around the campfire it does not excel specific tools for either job but thats not what it was made for    if thats still not good enough for you so be it    its not youre an amateur shitposter on some board that films himself playing with tools i cut and split wood for a living without the need to film myself or otherwise make a big deal out of it
  afraid you might learn something   i work in forestry  so do i cunt
  also poverty  i got axes that are over 300  begone gransfors peasant
      short impulsive replies without addressing a point    why have i forseen this also good for you on boasting about having split not even 16m3 of wood with an axe this year you acting like thats a lot made me giggle
  i work in forestry   and clearly you dont know how to use an axe if you think gransfors handles are okay read book or account from the hayday of axe usage look at old pictures there are several accounts of the constant increase in thickness of handles to compared to when people actually used them old axe handles were often as thin as 3/4ths of an inch yes that thin and these men are the stereotypical tough guys far tougher than you or i
  split  he said cut nigger from limbing to chopping to splitting
  split 16m3  no i done the felling limbing bucking and splitting with only an axe  ive lost count of the chainsaw cut wood i also split
  i dont think this shill would know a good axe if i planted it right beween his eyes lol
    i said the gränsfors bruks forest axe does its job i am repeating this point for the third time now and so far it has been completely ignored by you its a compromise between more specialized tools for either job chopping/splitting    i actually have a copy of bernard masons woodsmanship from 1945 here that i threw a look into and i didnt find anything that would apply to the axe in question i know that quality is decreasing but thats to be expected with industrialization cheaper materials and vanishing old growth trees    again this applies to many axes and doesnt devaluate the axe we are talking about          thats still not a lot especially if you spread it out over a full year just proves youre some hipster kiddo filming himself for jootoob clicks to fix your broken ego while shitting on perfectly fine tools online        i never said the axe in question is the best or a good one even i said it does what its advertised for having to repeat that just shows how ignorant you are and dont even read what i write
  i regret getting a zippo i thought i knew what i was doing by getting it and obviously didnt
  if thatll be the biggest regret of your life good for you  i did want one as a kid then i was shocked at how quickly the fluid dissipated
      there are modern inserts that fix that problem
  what can i say i have owned and used them compared them to pretty much every other axe on the market cut 4 face cords using only an axe this year and am getting into timbersports    this line right here is where it gets interesting btw the stench of bullshit already rises up ones nose when you said you compared them how exactly where do you get a budget of x0000 to buy pretty much every other axe on the market thats an unrealistic selfrighteous thing to say    four face cords thats 4 x 2 x 18m3  144m3 for everyone that doesnt use the imperial system namely everyone on the damn planet besides some snowflakes a pile of logs thats about 4x4m long and wide and about a meter high a small ass pile indeed a couple dozen trees maybe if they are 2040cm in diameter since large trees would fill that volume even faster resulting in less cut trees    what you are practically trying to boast here about online is that you cut about 4/04x25  25 small trees 40cm in diameter with an axe in the last 11 months to put that in numbers you did about 23 weeks of worth the whole year if you worked for about 8 hours a day and im already implying you didnt work full potential    what an arrogant prick one must be to attempt impressing people with that shows what kind of people you deal with folks on internet boards and in the youtube comment section not actual loggers or forestry workers man i dont like shitting on people who are interested in manual labor but please pull your head out of your ass and think straight its clear as day youre trying to come off as someone whos hard working and experienced but that only comes from actual hard work and experience you cant play some online persona in front of anyone but clueless internet users anyone having any actual experience will call you out so please unfuck yourself
  not reading what you wrote    i have multiple times and show proof of what i mean but you are too ignorant to even watch a video and instead insist i type out a 1000 word essay i think you are the one with too much ego invested in your toy axe to handle any criticism untill you post a cord of axe cut wood you are the hipster     honestly baffled at how thick skulled you are
    tu quoque    yeah no i expect you to give a short precise argument as to why the axe in question is a regret to buy you havent given any sensible statement of that kind and im not going to watch some videos on youtube just because you are lazy you already spent so much time arguing nonsense you could just have answered my questions    the company advertises the axe as a forest axe a medium sized tool neither full sized poleaxe nor small hatchet though both versions do exist that one can take to camp and chop  split some wood when camping it does fulfill that role 100 and does both jobs equally well though not outstandingly    you say its a cheap axe not worth the money not hand forged and has bad quality handle and the wrong angle of bit all those points dont apply as shown before i am sorry that you are so dependent on your fake online ego role play that you cant look at the facts of what a product is and is not
  if your gonna call me out maybe spot some shit technique or something rather than splurging your impression
    loggers and forestry workers dont know fuck all about axes though axes havent been used seriously except for light limbing and wedge pounding in a good 60 years i can guarantee a regular person who has used an axe regularly for maybe a month can outchop the average forestry worker it does have a bad quality handle its retardedly thick for literally any purpose what youve shown is your inexperience with axes as much as you like to boast about working in forestry you have a crippling case of dunningkruger my friend you have neither the experience or theoretical knowledge to know what youre talking about and even worse know so little that you dont know what you dont know so you think your branding of working in forestry gives you some sort of clue when it really doesnt
  just no
        reflexlike denial and repetition of statements already refuted im not the kind of person to expect anything more on this website but doesnt it make you the least bit worried that you are stuck so far up your own ass that you have to lie about a product because you apparently cant use it properly or at best judge it by its ability to do a job its simply not made for why do you have to lie about a product online let alone your experience or work    i make my own firewood at home and i do use an axe for that in the forest splitting mauls and axes are still used to split big chunks before loading them you are full shit and your online rhetoric doesnt impress me the least its a damn joke that you seriously try to argue against people with experience who call you out on being a fake
  again spot anything i do wrong if you are that experienced and know better then it should be easy   or you can continue to strawman like a total faggot
  you repeat the same thing again and again simply saying i refuted you without realizing you did nothing of the sort its legitimately somewhat sad if this is the state of people itskinda depressing actually i dunno watching you repeat the same i refuted you why arent you responding to what i said hah im in forestry just makes me wonder how your life is going
  again spot anything i do wrong if you are that experienced and know better then it should be easy   or you can continue to strawman like a total faggot    are you serious you accuse me of using a strawman argument and then point to your axe technique because you are being called out on misjudging the quality of an axe that is a strawman argument yourself you dimwit your cutting technique has nothing to do with your judgement of the quality of the make of an axe the fact that you have to deflect this way is another evidence that you are full of shit and no you dont get any clicks from me on your shitty videos that have nothing to do with the topic    you repeat the same thing again and again simply saying i refuted you without realizing you did nothing of the sort     but i did and your refusal to acknowledge that could bring one to tears if it wasnt for where this debate is taking place i pointed out what the axe you shit on is for its a camping axe for small work around the camp fire you continue to bash it because you know axes that perform better cutting or splitting wood which is fine but totally past the point the fact that you now attack my person and life just shows how far off the point you must argue to have any come back at me straw grasping of the toughest sort dude
  have you considered you have two critics  i know a good quality axe from a bad quality axe and the gransfors is mid tier at a high price for instance can you name a reason why you should pay triple the cost of a similar council tool or hultafors axe  i made a post saying it was a regret buy and then you got triggered and started grilling me like a triggered libtard refuse the evidence in front of you and then resort to covering your ears and chanting i work in forestry like some demented cultist
  your hypocrisy is astounding i never once insulted your person the other person did and no you did not refute literally anything at all all you have done is repeat ive refuted that again and again
i regret entering this thread
  me too desu
    im just shitposting until the thread gets deleted or people fuck off

    you said its cheap when its not i have not once argued you should buy the gränsfors or pick it over any other axe that fits its role you are pulling those out of your ass as you go its not my point to advertise that axe i am merely refuting your criticism of it since its factually untrue even though its a complete deflection of the original point id not take the gränsfors bruks forest axe for anything than what i bought mine for that is splitting fire wood at the camp fire when backpacking for every other job id take a different axe and this has zero to do with your false statements about the product    i made a post saying it was a regret buy and then you got triggered and started grilling me like a triggered libtard    wrong what happened is written here         your claims are simply not valid the axe as it is is fine i dont know what you tried to do with it and at this point i dont even care you going off about cutting and splitting this much wood here or your technique there makes it seem like you tried to do a lot more and rougher work with it than it was made for thus making you come to the conclusion that handle and bit are not right when in fact they are for light camp fire work    completely ignoring that youre shilling your youtube videos arguing about your technique or how much rather how little firewood you made this year proves that its about you and not the product since those thing shave absolutely zero to do with it    its amazing how you lie about things that everyone can read just a couple of lines above i cant see how your issues with the product apply and so i asked for clarification then you give me those absurd faults this axe is supposed to have when they factually do not exist        i took my valuable lifetime in the hopes to clarify what the issue was since i havent had such issues at all instead i get denial and ego games about his youtube persona
  why i made a point about the fact i actually use my axes
    oh i am sorry did i bruise your ego its a fact that people who start out working outdoors feel uncomfortable with tools especially larger and heavier ones since you complain about how the handle of that axe is too thick with other axes having much thicker handles i am rightfully assuming you either have no experience or small hands you can take that to heart and whine about it but thats a neutral statement from my side goes a long way to see how you interpret such a statement tho
british dpm gaiters  way too heavy and not very comfortable only used them once decent price though  miltec rain poncho  way too heavy not large enough for a tarp  a shit ton of merino baselayers  bought only because of merino hype while merino is good for some scenarios i usually prefer synthetics for way better wicking and/or warmth  sealskinz ultra grip gloves  ultra shitty grip  miltec baselayer  shitty material shitty cut  gorkas  tactic9 gorka is complete shit splav gorka is a very good gorka but softshell clothing is superior in every way
  splitting  chopping knife ratings  wojak poster    all wojak  frog posters are the worst posters on all boards
im going to go with black diamond meme head lamps and a few others for that matter    1 the button process for locking is fucking retarded  and  2 who the fuck needs a bluetooth head lamp innawoods
  okay so you want an essay fine    handle thickness good axe handles should have a little flex like a bow this absorbs shock when chopping but is also important when you are carving for a long time i have bought gransfors american felling axe replacement handles for some old axes i fixed up and they needed to be halved in thickness when stock after an hour of chopping i developed a case of tennis elbow since thinning the handle i have had no such problem    axe geometry gransfors have flat cheeks and obtuse bit angles a thinner grind will chop twice as well and convex cheeks will prevent sticking when splitting or chopping the way the axe comes its grind is too thick and it tends to bounce rather than bite on the hardwoods the grind at the edge has very little to do with splitting performance the cheeks do the majority of the work    hand forged generally means a man working at an anvil with a hammer by hand admittedly gransfors are in a real grey area where a man stands at a big machine and turns the piece in shaped dies but its not really the skill of the smith and his hammer is it    price hultafors make the same axe for a third of the cost performance and quality are the same after about 5 minutes with a file     experience first time i picked up an axe was 12 family has always heated with wood and i have split cord after cord went to college to do landscaping so hard work and manual labour are second nature cutting those 4 axe cords was a sunday project for a few hours a day    ego providing ample evidence of my experience and skill with an axe shows i have done my research spent time learning the fundamentals and practicing my technique spending hours experimenting with different grinds and axe patterns and trying out different handle thicknesses so when i criticise something it is from experience and not theoretical i also read dudley cooks the axe book mors kochanski bushcraft to learn and compare my experience
  interesting i thought gorkas were pretty memey
  handle thickness    you are now talking about a different axe not about the forest axe anymore right if you had any quality problems with another product did you contact the company and inquire about those issues or a refund what was their answer    axe geometry    please read up on what i wrote about this its a mix of splitting and cutting capability it does not excel in either yes you can make a better splitting or cutting axe that does not mean this one is faulty in any way have you tried the axe on pine wood scandinavia is full with pine friends of mine own land in finland and grow almost exclusively pine its natural that youll experience different performance on different woods not a fault though    hand forged  but its not really the skill of the smith and his hammer is it    i know how easy it looks in their advertisement video but trust me smithing is an art even with a mechanical hammer if you dont believe me go and try it yourself if you get the chance youll see its more difficult than you think    price    highly subjective no one tells you to buy anything of course i can go out and eat for 2 bucks and be full that doesnt mean going out in a nice restaurant eating for 80 bucks isnt worth it or a swindle never disagreed that there are cheaper axes of identical or better quality    experience    cant verify any of this implying its true then why complain so much or boast about it a work that you do regularly and is normal for you isnt something to impress other people with unless you have severe ego issues of course    ego    and yet you feel the urgent need to prove yourself to some random dude online who you dont know ive yet to meet any guy worth his salt that goes off like a shotgun when questioned about a remark he makes on a product no hard feelings but you got a lot of work ahead of you kid
  random anon posting to say i agree with you gransfors is hipster meme gear that isnt worth its price you can work on them at home i have too but for 20 dollars i can get a replacement handle and flea market axe head do the same work i did to the gransfors and have a nicer axe some people just need to protect their purchase at least youre willing to put your money where your mouth is with videos your opponent is nothing so far
  you got btfo on every point and im half tempted to save this and repost it at every axe discussion so you can get btfo all the faster what a weak walkback response shameful
  forest axe suffers from the same lack of shock absorbtion carve for a couple of hours with and and tell me how your hands feel    i have used it on beech fir sycamore and birch so i have a pretty good idea on how the geometry performs on a range of harder and softer woods grind is too thick i have axes that are better at splitting and cutting due to the geometry i described look up basque axe    you can easily verify an axemans experience by his accuracy and the size of his chips ive yet to meet any guy who doesnt go off like a shotgun when some stranger accuses him of bieng a small handed hipster
    yes please save this so everyone can see what an amateurish ego loaden idiot you are its fine if you dislike a product any product for that matter but making up false criticisms and shilling your youtube channel or diverting the topic to your technique and how much wood you make is just childish its about the make of an axe not about anything else the axe is fine it does what its advertised for and your complaints are naught your need for strangers online to support your whining shows that you have the mental maturity of a 10yo if that
  wrong guy anon theres 2 of us mr hipster video man me response is trump pic
  ive yet to meet any guy who doesnt go off like a shotgun when some stranger accuses him of bieng a small handed hipster    thanks for proving my point that you live exclusively around kids with no selfesteem you can go back now to dragging a good product through the mud with your infantile complaints on this website if there was any real issue id have seen a letter to the customer support by now but of course you never gave the company any feedback    and you know why because a there is no issue and b if there was the way you act theyd have thanked you and told you good bye but who would you even be to give a renowned company any feedback on their products anyways eh just look at your bruised ego in this thread ive tried to find out if there was an issue turns out its inside your head        doesnt change much really from what i can tell you misuse the product and then complain it feels uncomfortable its not a work horse for excessive cutting/splitting its an enlarged hatchet for some work around the camp anyone who ive seen advertise it has declared it as such    in any case i wish the two of you a good night stay safe when working outdoors
  i dont use it for heavy chopping its way too small but the scale of performance is the same     my main beef is not with the company or their product but the complete katana like reverence for this magical miracle axe and the retards who shill it constantly without ever discussing the drawbacks faults in design    gransfors sell to many thanks to shills like you giving them free advertising that they cant make enough so why would they give a shit about my opinion on their axe head design and handle thickness    glad i could educate you goodnight sweet pea
pls guys /out/ is supposed to be a nice board
  the regret is the one i bought before this  than post the picture of stanley not this you cretin
buy a fiskars axe and you ladies can stop fighting
        the bushman is a bit of a trick the primary value isnt in its use as a knife its a spearhead yet even then the bushman bowie is better for it as the point is more suited for the task of impaling something so you have a spearhead where you can use it as a knife and stuff it with the screw for spear use and some paracord attached to a stout stick it gives you range
  oh the bushman bowie is also big enough to be used as a trowel if you need one    still not really a good carry given the size its among a number of bastard products that look cool but are of arguable use in practice but if you want a spear its there
  shooting gaysi like it
  to my knowledge you can cook and boil water in the keith titanium canteen so i dont know what you are talking about this pic is even from their website    i was actually thinking of getting one myself because i love my titanium snowpeak gear
  yeah just try scraping burnt food out from inside the canteen
  worst lantern ever it leaked the oil and after the first time turning it on was a fucking nuisance
  filtering water is a meme
  i already own pic related actually one of my favorite axes less shock in the handle than a stock gransfors and chops decently splits very well
    yeah the spear function adds to the regret its super memey round handle gives less control and unless you put tape on it the handle is shit for cold conditions
has anyone else ever been so tired/out of it that wildlife no longer cared you were there when i was 15 my father dropped me in the woods to man me up and when i was walking home i walked past deer rabbits and even a coyote but none of them really did anything even though i was passing within 5 feet of a few of them and i was wondering if this is a normal occurrence
  i should probably add it was a considerable hike and this happened on the latter half of it when i didnt care about anything but walking
  when i was 15 my father dropped me in the woods to man me up  he was hoping you would not make it back
  nah he was molding me into his vision of an elite /k/ worthy operator
  poor deer hunters are neanderthals deer was just minding its own business doing deer stuff and one day someone just shot it in the face like an asshole
   they could probably hear you from a distance and could tell by your footsteps and breathing that you were fatigued prey animals have very acute senses and can sniff out the tiniest cues of agressive intention you walking around tired as fuck not even looking at them or making unpredictable movements probably let them know you werent a threat its still a curious thing because those types of animals usually start galloping as soon as they see a human shape
the marmots near the top of pikes peak could not give less of a fuck when i hiked it they would stay like 1 foot out of arms reach was almost insulting but i was fat and very tired
  they were skinwalkers man
  falling for the (((propaganda))) that neanderthals are asshole cretins
  sounds like you were simply not being as weary and nervous of them as most people those animals had encountered were before and they knew you werent even going to stop and stare    i always try to find ways of walking / moving through brush noises which make deer and the like as calm as possible its hard to find a definite that works for most animals some like you just to stroll past where others need you to move like fucking solid snake
    thats because fuckin transplants from the midwest feed the god damn marmots
  i think its more a case that your perception changes dramatically when your body is exhausted
  are you saying i hallucinated it
  depends did any of them talk to you
  no it was just me walking past animals without them caring
my neighborhood has a bunch of deer and more and more are coming as land around my neighborhood is being built on on my night walks i can walk straight on the road and deer laying down in lawns will net move even when im within five feet of them
if this is a normal occurrence  happens to me all the time i even have videos
  heres a wolf
    animals can read body language very well it is their main form of communication if you seem sickly bears will even not eat you for fear youll infect them seals sometimes bring fish to scuba divers because they think the divers are incompetent at hunting
  yes but they avoid those things rather than ignore them
  deer are so tame in my forest they just stand there and you can go right up to them and make a perfect seal around their nose and blow into them so it comes out their mouth
  yeah i remember when my neighbors liked putting up plastic deer too
  ive noticed that chickadees dont mind human presence if i sit perfectly still and a flock of chickadees passes over me some of them will come right up to me landing on branches two or three feet from my face theyll be doing their alarm call but they dont act afraid at all its like theyre curious anybody else noticed this
      lmao
  are you in a town or something where people feed them that could explain it
  i tried something similar once with a female deer by putting a tight seal around her butthole with my mouth hoping i could make her queef unfortunately i just ended up with a mouthful of deer shit
  
  not him but im 100 convinced some people just dont register as humans to animals  routinely have birds land on me  i had this guy land on my shoulder inside a home depot didnt seem hurt or tired but let me handle him he eventually got bored and flew back into the rafters  have a wild fox that dens under my patio  lets me pet it and will come chill with me when im out by myself but disappears as soon as literally anyone else gets within 100 feet  routinely have deer just walk right up to me even while hunting  nothing quite like sitting in a ground blind with a doe sticking her head in through the door and blocking your shot at the buck thats chasing her has happened twice one even took a nap curled up against the side of my blind had to kick her through the fabric so i could get out have also had them up on my covered porch during storms and when i go out to see whats clomping around they just give me a look like what its dry in here and your peonies are tasty    fortunately havent had any hormone crazed bucks try to fight/fuck me yet
  no joke blowing air into someone can kill them     look up deaths caused by people blowing air into someones womb
  basically hunting on easymode  just wait for the buck to get ready to fuck and slit his throat with your knife dont bother wasting the ammo
  so should i let him nut first seems the gentlemanly thing to do    also the birb i forgot to post earlier
  your hands are so ashy that bird probably thought you were a tree
  ashy  im white those are calluses
  implying that makes a difference to a bird  it thinks youre a tree bro
  you sound like a delicate man
  its a sign of rabies so be careful
  quit beating around the bush poopbutt  tell us what they said
  when i was 15 my father dropped me in the woods to man me up  this is pretty much how i imagine this  
  thats cool as fuck where you at
tldr where can i find wild crocodiles/snakes without tourists flooding the area    im going to cozumel with my family in mid february and while they do casual snorkeling and beach relaxation i wanna go ham with wildlife my main goal is to swim with a wild crocodile ive spent 3 weeks researching and mentally preparing myself and im going to be practicing my swimming for the next 2 months i dont want to spend all my time there searching for a crocodile and leave empty handed because of some loud ass families taking up all the ocean/river waters if anyone has specific locations where i can find crocs or cool snakes without these disruptions i would greatly appreciate it
  chankanab beach park  youll have to climb a fence but i dont think its even got barbed wire  the snorkeling off the shore is decent too
    this is it weve finally found it the stupidest post ever made on /out/
  speaking as an australian that lives in the tropical north youre a fucking retard enjoy report back    he wont report back
  there are plenty of videos of people swimming with american and nile crocodiles american crocs arent as aggressive as nile or saltys and splashing at the waters surface is what attracts a feeding response if youre actually underneath the water with them youre much safer because their eyesight is incredibly poor and their natural response is to avoid the big unidentifiable mass following them theres no way i would ever try to swim with a salty
  yeah righto i wont pretend to be an expert on american or nile crocs ive done some stupid fucking things around salties  walked boats through shallow waters retrieved crab pots close by salties cooled off in the shallows when the sun is favourable to seeing 1520m in front of you etc  but free swimming is a death wish lol
  my main goal is to swim with a wild crocodile    if you want to go for it theres a good chance youll be attacked but again if you want to    i feed crocs on the beach here in n oz i throw them hog meat and they love it but i dont want to actually get close to them im no steve irwin
    american crocs arent aggressive  i want to swim with them
  steve is the inspiration watched all of his stuff ever since i was a kid however swimming with a croc does not mean trying to tussle with it im not completely braindead i just want to share the water with and follow one even just for a couple seconds there are vids of people swimming beside them and even a couple of this one model in nothing but a bikini face to face with a couple of them who appears to be in no immediate danger some diving vids with nile crocs show the divers lifting or even latching onto the end of the crocs tails but i dont think id go that far with it
crocodiles arent really that dangerous
