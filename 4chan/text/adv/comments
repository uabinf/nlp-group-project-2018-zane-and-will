i wonder if i will ever have a friendship that i dont destroy with my paranoia selfhatred and boiling rage    how do i overcome my borderline personality disorder most people i have casual interactions with think i am a very sweet and normal person but those who get close to me eventually learn that i am in insanity in its purest form i am the face of madness i am a poison that corrupts everything it touches that turns all to dust nobody not even the kindest saints i have ever known have been willing to stay by my side nor can i blame them
how to be more empathetic and think about others more im kind of a dick but want to have friends again i feel like i miss emotional cues easily and cant read rooms well
i got a speeding ticket in ohio for 135 bucks at 90mph    what should i do lol
think about your actions and how dangerous they were i dont care about how clear the highway was its slippery out this time of year and thats just plain too fast to be going regardless why do you think its funny are you dumb you should see if there is an option to take a drivers training course online to take the points off your license i got 2 for an improper left turn and was able to get rid of them after taking a 35 online course you probably cant do anything about the ticket itself but thats the recourse you have
  it was 65 and sunny usual traffic fast lane
  i knew youd come at me with excuses and i already told you i dont care neither does the law thats too fast
  sorry i just dont agree with you this isnt the 60s    i was in complete control of my vehicle with nobody in front of me
  tell it to the judge  and hell laugh your ass out of traffic court
how about you just pay it like any decent member of society would
thats 150 km/hr for metric folks fight it in court op if you think you can win
    pay the fine theres no way youd win in court
  slow down kek    be glad you did not kill someone its not that you are not this awesome racecar driver with flawless reaction time and handling but the other drivers might not be    racetracks are for driving that fast not public roads you should have lost your license
  lol 135 is nothing just pay it off

be me  work in sports bar basically a bus boy  still not a bad gig  make 8 bucks an hour and around hot girls  four of us were trained when we opened  two immediately disappear and get fried after randomly showing up to work  hire three new guys five total  hours get cut go from working fridaysunday to only sunday  feels bad manpng  other guy just quit like last week for some reason   also asked for more hours  apparently we are booked a couple times for big ass parties so theyll need me   talking to servers sunday  they thought i left because i now show up once a week and i usually spend time in the back prepping for kitchen   they tell me 2 of the 3 new guys suck and dont do as good as i do  feelsgoodmanjpeg
i recently got into photography how do i use my new found hobby to meet girls
you dont photography is the lowest of the low and if you manage to get a girl to pose she only wants her photo taken women are attached to much to their ego photography is the worst hobby it will change your point of view to match the bigger picture i think you should get into drawing chicks love drawings and if you draw the picture instead of capturing that will change your eyes for the better because you pay attention to every detail and truly appreciate whatever youre looking at
    ignore this  faggot offer cosplayers to take photos for them or offer to photograph wannabe models etc  they all love to get their egos stroked two scumbagtypes i know do this with great success
  drawing is superior only takes 30 secs to take a photo then what it only works with confident people otherwise awkward af for both parties
  take pictures of women when they arent watching then bring them the pictures works every time

whats the most practical and effective martial art without theatrics and chinese hindu mystical pseudospiritual dumb cunt bullshit
boxing
  look at any of fighting styles of the top mma fighters these guys can fight however they want but the top contenders always seem to have similar styles ex brazilian jiujitsu which says a lot about the practicality of those styles
boxing unironically    the entire sport is about learning how to throw a punch and learning how to take a punch    thats pretty much all youre going to be doing in any fistfight that isnt pants on head retarded the entire fight will last 30 seconds and it will all come down to how well you can throw a punch and how well you can take a punch even more importantly youll find that boxing is pretty much the only martial art where most of the training is full contact training youre not going to spend 18 months doing drills moving up through belts and learning to recite mantras about how youll never use your knowledge to hurt anyone youre going to spend your time hitting and getting hit
    krav maga
  gun
    in a real fight fight where everythings allowed eg mma a boxer would get boxed assuming the same weight class
wrestling     in a street fight a punch to the head and bam all the marital art styles goes out of your head and your on the ground trying to put each other in a head lock
  in a real fight where everything is allowed a boxer isnt any more restricted to the rules of boxing than his attacker    the point is simply that the training is the best training around as a practical point of interest you can go into almost any gym other than ymca and find a boxing ring where you can find a boxing ring you can usually find someone to spar with or at least someone willing to hold the punching bag for awhile if youll do the same    and youre still going to know how to punch and how to take a punch when the fight happens beyond that bring yourself a knife or better yet take shooting classes and get your cc if you want to survive a real fight you should have no qualms whatsoever with cheating and blowing out someones kneecap    but boxing is still the most practical you can learn it anywhere its simple to learn its all variations of four different punches and learning how to move how to take a hit and when to strike and it provides a great base you can always take up meme mma on top of that if you really want to get the hell beat out of you and lose a bunch of teeth on cable tv for the general amusement of an audience and no appreciable gain over as many hours in the boxing ring with some gloves on
something that trains well in the clinch and in takedowns seems useful judging from the fight videos ive seen on /gif/ and /wsg/ thai boxing is cool but watching a fight and seeing how frequently they slip and fall when throwing a kick turned me off of it i guess a plain mma gym would be the best i wouldnt know from experience though i was in one fight ever i fractured my hand on his head and luckily it was broken up before i got thrashed
  boxing or krav maga anything that can teach you to throw a proper punch and gives you the chance to spar and experience what its like to get hit so that it doesnt shock you so badly in a real fight is sufficient really
ive been doing krav maga and its a very fun and practical martial art they teach you realworld solutions to problems and situations things like getting out of chokeholds and pins attacking when youre down moving when injured dealing with multiple attackers and stress tests that train you to respond faster i highly recommend it
  contrary to popular belief mma is probably the least advisable type of fighting to learn strictly from a self defense perspective go for stand up style fighting like others have said such as boxing or krav maga the reason being if your mode of defense relies solely on taking an opponent to the ground in a non sanctioned non refereed fight things can easily go bad for you and if you become overwhelmed and youre on the ground its harder to defend yourself or flee the situation when youre dealing with multiple attackers that goes without saying you are royally fucked if you try to take someone to the ground when there are two or three other guys trying to hurt you   krav maga was specifically formulated for quick self defense scenarios and you will learn easily how to incapacitate an opponent boxing while not as practically effective for self defense will still teach you how to punch and throw more devastating punches fighting is as much mental as physical and if someone goes up against a guy who knows how to punch its gonna make them think twice about continuing the fight the second they take a hard left to the chin both of these styles also emphasize stand up fighting this offers you the advantage to keep distance from your opponents and allows you to have a better chance at fleeing should you become hurt or overwhelmed by your attacker
  if you want to survive a real fight you should have no qualms whatsoever with cheating and blowing out someones kneecap  really good advice except for the above if youre in a life or death situation and you have to draw your firearm you shoot to kill period if you are calm enough to be able to accurately kneecap someone and that person survives the piece of shit is going to file criminal charges against you and theres a good chance you could be legally liable in civil court to pay for the guy who attacked yous medical bills as well as possible prison time its happened before because our legal system seems to love to protect criminals also the general rule of thumb is dead men tell no tales it sounds counter productive but believe me if youre in a life or death situation its more legally advisable to kill the person than not
  when youre dealing with multiple attackers that goes without saying you are royally fucked if you try to take someone to the ground  that still goes for standup fistfights
boxing  made a really good point    if you are solely focused on self defense though and live in the us just learn to carry a gun
definitely mma been doing mma for 3 years and although i am below average physique i am fully confident in my ability to defend myself from normalfag
    mma doesnt allow everything they dont allow biting or nut shots or blind techniques or kicks to the head of a downed opponent or small joint manipulation or eye gouging        it depends entirely on your circumstance you expect to apply it what say you op
  yeah but they allow everything that isnt cheap boxing is more restricted so its less practical im assuming op doesnt want to fight dirty
tai chi
just a reminder that the most effective martial art by far isnt physical and people will hate to hear it but its moneyfu    work as hard as you can get loads of money/status and get people legally the only people it doesnt work on are people who have very little to lose no one attacks you if they know theyre gonna lose their job friends and most their money fighting legal battles and other high status people very rarely physically fight or get annoyed
  yes but the idea is if you know how to box you know to keep distance and more importantly be on your feet to run if things turn sour
  well im not planing to act like a retard and get myself into fights    i started working out recently and getting into fitness and i thought i should also learn some martial art as a compliment to that    im still confused by the answers and cant decide although im leaning towards boxing and krav maga    does anybody know what they teach in the us military or navy or special ops
  i meant us seals or the marines
  jkd or krav assuming you find a club that has someone accomplished running it and the club makes you pressure test what you learned and includes moderate sparring    if you want to learn how to throw a punch asap take up boxing most fights ive been involved in end up in some form of clinching or go to the ground going to the ground is generally shit because they might have a friend who boots you
  they use something really cool called guns the fuck is your intent   cardio jiu jitsu muay thai judo boxing kickboxing sambo and whatever else is used in mma effectively  self defense get a gun or run away or both if someone wants to fuck you up they probably will nothing stops them from knowing martial arts and then some  beating up your bully probably boxing and wrestling
expanding on my post   the most practical self defence is what jkd teaches from the get go assuming youre not at a mcdojo which is something along the lines of  eye jab/throat jab  to make the opponent learn their body lack  kick to the genitals  to make them fold in half towards you  elbow to the back of the head/hook/whatever you fancy    but you will also want to know a bit of grecoroman wrestling ive covered bits of this at jkd clubs because what if someone tries to rugby tackle you you throw your legs away from them and push down on their body keeping yourself at an arms length to wrestle them on the ground or escape    you will also want to learn your ground game if youre having a fight with someone and you both go to the ground youre fucked but you might be less fucked if you can get a rear naked choke in    you also want to learn weapon defence i covered these in jkd as filipino martial arts is a big part of jkd and theres a lot of stick/knife fighting just keep in mind that no matter how good you are you are probably going to get cut using common sense will keep you out of 999 of those situations    you want to learn from an accomplished martial artist because they have put the time in and can tell you what works and what doesnt  you want to pressure test what you learn in sparring because you need to know what you are capable of  you need to do sparring at least moderate sparring meaning your partner wont go for the knockout smash when they see it because they pull some punches because it will give you an idea of what being hit feels like while still allowing you to learn what to do and what different people can do      ebonic gentleman approaches  lucky for me i had my loaded gun in my hand ready to defend myself from anyone who approaches  i also walk with my back against the wall everywhere  no guns are good for home defence you probably cant draw your weapon and use it in time if someone nearby rushes you
  old /asp/ie here the answer has always been boxing/muay thai  bjj/judo but if you want the easy yet effective way pipebomb    stay away from krabby magoo it only builds false confidence and techniques that isnt too effective against people who are overflowing with adrenaline
  you probably cant draw your weapon and use it in time if someone nearby rushes you  a firearm works at any distance even when theyre right on top of you if you didnt have any situational awareness didnt practice using your weapon and walk through the shittiest part of town then of course it wont work but just as boxing isnt just throwing a punch wildly guns arent simply point and shoot you need to have an attitude toward preservation and deescalation to make any form of selfdefense work and guns are extremely conducive to that    if you dont want to spend the money get some other weapon whatever you do dont prioritize martial arts for selfdefense theyre good to have but they should never be all you have
  who the fuck is attacking you dumbasses move out of the hood first and foremost second if someone attacks you itll be with a weapon boxing wont save you from 26 stab wounds
kick boxing muay thai boxing judo bjj sanda krav maga and kapap are solid choices  basically everything hard full contact and/or with grapples can be considered as a good choice grappling can be a little controversial since its no good against more than one opponent  why are you asking
isolation and drugs are finally taking a toll on my mental health madness paranoia and anxiety turned up to eleven   i feel so fucking caged like i have no control over my life and where things are going amusingly my dreams are joyfull and sweet lately which makes waking up even more depressing  i am really trying to get back into society i got myself a shitty job and im hitting the gym twice a week but i feel like i will never be able to really connect with a person again i have zero ambitions and im too tired of pretending that im not broken  i cant find words to descripe my feelings without sounding like a shitty linkin park song  how can i unjust myself fellas
looking for the same guidance
i feel this way i have no advice but lets talk
youre not alone in this and you can definitely connect with others again isolation can really mess you up so just know that it can take a while before you feel comfortable enough with people again    think hard about what your purpose in life is there must be something you dream about or at least think about every now and then any real interests
same except alcohol is the only drug i consume now my dreams are so damn beautiful it make reality a tragedy to the point i get unprofound suicide ideations as for advice i dunno but whatever i dream about i feel as if i can turn it into a tangibility and not an abstraction like i dreamt about this girl i have a crush on at work a couple times we went on dates and whatnot so i feel if i can get the chance to talk to her then maybe i wont feel as isolated as much but if she ignores or rejects me thats it i may stay isolated even further and hope the alcohol kills me this time around i think thats good enough advice as is turn whatever your dreaming about into a reality
  i also feel this way    for me sleep accepting of myself and reality getting a job and exercise are what slowly helps me out of this pit
to all anons in this thread do these things at least 5 try to do all of them and your life will improve drastically it may take time but it will    therapy  psychiatry obtain antidepressants  quit drugs and alcohol  gym  quit video games start getting meaningful hobbies this is an absolute must  eat leafy greens and vegetables  meditate 30 minutes a day minimum  join social clubs  use bumble to find friends  once you make friends make friends with their friends and just keep going  dont worry about a gf for awhile fix yourself first  figure out what you want to do stop fucking procrastinating with your precious life you only have one once you figure out what you want to do begin taking realistic but firm steps towards it    and finally    consider seeking jesus christ pray for forgiveness then ask for a sign when i did this back in 2014 i was given one
its been six fucking months since the breakup of a short term relationship we dont talk since three months he lied for a long period of time and never committed with me or his actions he is conscious of the emotional damage but he doesnt care i dont want to give a shit for someone who is worthless but when i think of him in his negligence and vacuous words i start to feel numb and sad i cant concentrate sometimes i cry  its harder because we study on the same campus he ignores me but fortunately winter break is coming i want to get over it and focus on my self development and career i have been talking with new people hanging out and going to therapy but he still in my mind maybe because hes the only person i feel i ever had a connection with but now he cant make any good in my life  what can be recomended to think less about a significant but harmful person  pd sorry for my english
    i dont know what to tell you op i grew in a dysfunctional family and im basically emotionally scarred for life     how do i cope with this i live my life whats done is done already no point in going back to the past theres little time left to live your life life isnt very long 4050 years are nothing    go live life op its the only life you have
ok so im a little cornered up  im gonna start a short technical career 3 years long im not sure if the degree is equivalent to a bachelors or associate degree since i dont know much about yank education the thing is im equally interested about mechanics electronics and chemistry chemistry is the one i like the most yet theres not much job offers for it electronics looks nice though id like to know more about what an electronics guy does at work theres an enormous demand for electronics technicians where i live at mechanics is the most balanced of them all although im not 100 interested in applied physics machining and metallurgy look pretty neat and if i were not split between these options id probably take up short courses on related trades like lathing home appliances repair also linked with electronics smithing and electricity fixing shit and knowing how it works is something im quite interested at plus theres a relative abundance of job offers  since im still figuring out whats my true vocation i thought that i could even study two of these although not three since 9 years of studying short careers are a bit too much and they would be better spent at an engineering career    tldr dunno what to study chemistry mechanics or electronics    as a request id like to know sites or youtube channels that could give me valuable information about these fields or that talk about career choices of course opinions from professionals or students from any of these specialties are more than welcome

  wwhat about the last part
 be me   went to restaurant with friends   waitress grill 11/10 my type   told friends i liked her when we got out   friends said go back in and get her number but was too chickenshit and didnt come back   deeply regretted my decision the next morning    what would /adv/ recommend me doing the next time i come back to that restaurant
  get her number failing is better then not trying i know its a meme answer but thats literally it
  tell your friend to be your dating coach
  dont harass the waitresses
watch the movie office space and watch how the guy does it
first make peace with the possibility she might not be interested she doesnt know you and you dont know her    might help you if you could read her response to you before you ask but also understand shes in the service industry and has to be nice to you ask for her number if you wanna chance it but dont be forceful    nothing wrong with trying but just be mindful of boundaries good luck maybe someone else can give tips on leaning your chances over to a yes
   waitress grill 11/10 my type  who cares if you are her type or if she even noticed you right
do water flossers actually work
  bump thinking about getting one
  i have pick related and at full power it blasts hard enough to make my gums bleed so yeah it works pretty well
  yeah they do make sure to get one that plugs into the wall and use it at max power the hand held rechargeable ones tend to be weaker
  max power     rip your gums
  1st year dental resident    depends on how you use them youd be surprised how many people use them wrong and end up with all sorts of problems    one person used it twice a day and their gums started receeding because they got really irritated then he stopped using it and his exposed roots began to decay    so yeah for an every day thing hell no use regular string floss    but for a once a few days kind of thing have at it
  eh no thanks floss picks plus electric toothbrush does enough for me the cute dental hygienist also comments on my clean teeth and cleanings take no time at all god i love when those big tits rest on my arm as shes cleaning me
  god i love when those big tits rest on my arm as shes cleaning me  i swear these sluts know
what can i do about my guilt    its preventing me from moving on in life as i cling to it and use it to tell myself i dont deserve to be happy or succeed in life    the reason for my guilt is largely because i posted some unkind comments about two debut writers on /lit/ a couple of years ago and im afraid they have each read these negative comments and felt hurt by them and in one case figured out that it was me who wrote it one of the writers is from my state and i am from that state too and have had a couple of stories published online with my name and some details that might link me to one of the negative posts where i mentioned that the book was mediocre    any advice     i feel like a corrupt sinister sellout and have done for some time
nobody cares stop posting this spam
  can i ask for some advice at least i will stop posting if i manage to receive some advice or something sorry for being annoying
i need help with my ugly girl mentality and low self esteem i was bullied by my close friends about my looks and people used to call me weird all the time i had tons of maledominated interests was into anime and tried to make friends through fun memes and humor i was just a strange awkward girl who wanted to make friends and have fun the guys i asked out either ghosted or rejected me and girls talked over me or treated me as inferior     now im 19 and have grown into my features i have become cute and pleasant what one would describe physically as wife material yet i have crippling selfesteem and deep hatred one guy who ghosted me is now into me and i feel fucking sick seeing the difference in how people treat me     how the fuck do i get over this the more i observe the world around me the more disgusted i feel
  my life turned around and i look great this sucks  go to therapy
you could have sex with me that will give you a big confidence boost
  man ill hate to be cute  sucks to be you
welcome to early adulthood in a nutshell life is going to feel like this for you until youve got a career path and some form of stability    physical looks only go so far in life what counts op is who you are on the inside your temperament how you react to your environment and how motivated you are to live a happy life i would focus on those things    my advice/wisdom is to stop focusing on physical appearance and relationships and put some time and effort into finding what you love in life the self esteem issues will vanish by themselves if you dont focus on them find a hobby work on your education and continue doing you    best of luck op
  the more i observe the world around me the more disgusted i feel  the end    seriously you just have to put up with it most people are 2faced like that  if you know certain cases like you described where the guy didnt like you at first just avoid them  try to make new friends but allways keep in mind that they might just like you because you look nice    thats one thing ugly man have going for them if someone likes you you know its genuine
  be the chooser disregard anyone trying to choose you
  cant imagine someone who has cripplingly low self esteem could call themselves cute or even wife material
  i didnt view myself as that but has been given to me by my friends and strangers i think the term wife material is a bit too strong but i just wanted to describe that i have characteristics of being positive warm sunny etc       ive always been the one chasing after guys tbf i would initiate messages get crazy into their interests etc etc but youre right about this i feel disgusted when a guy tries to chase me now i dont know why they want me and i have a strong dislike for guys in general       yep i agree with you regarding your last statement is pretty true i really treasure the friends i made when i was ugly especially my extremelyfeminine and only male friend im sure ugly guys feel that way too or fatturnedfit people      thank you for the advice ive been struggling to do all that self love and all i find it a catch22 we are affected by how society views us i was someone who did not conform much to societys feminine roles found somewhat of an identity but at the same time was rejected now that i am conforming i am losing my sense of self it truly takes a strong person to really establish a life they love
9/10    please post bobs and vagine
90 of everything is shit including people if you dislike everyone its your problem and not theirs    19  you are attractive for the next eleven years spend them wisely
  describes herself as wife material  you arent as good as people tell you you are and not as bad as you tell yourself you are i wouldnt call a woman who has crippling selfesteem issues and feels deep hatred towards whom a wife material remember that interior is important too i once dated a very beautiful girl who was a wife material cooked cleaned made me drinks was incredibly optimistic and sweet most of the time but sometimes she would get insanely jealous and paranoid it was a huge turn off worrying too because i wanted to marry her eventually see a therapist or psychologist if you cant combat these feelings on your own but dont ignore them
  things didnt work out with stacy and now chad wants me after making me wait in the cuck shed for my best years  you alone know how male incels feel    the more i observe the world around me the more disgusted i feel  youre definitely wife material to me  im in nj are you nearby  they met on the aspergers support forum 4channel  wed always have a good story to tell
  share a picture of yourself
dear /adv/    i want to kindly ask you about where and how can a person meet people with interests in fields of comic books animation modelling video games and such prefferably overlaping this is kinda tricky for me to figure it out since while i do like mentioned things im aware that most people who enjoy those hobbies tend to spend time alone instead of outside with other people    im pretty much lacking any social experience began seriously working on fixing those things about year ago i did made huge advance compared to how i used to be like being able to actually held conversation on specific topics with shop clerks attend lectures or meetings like board games evenings without running away in fear but im still pretty much afraid of closer contact yet desire to have somebody to call a friend i already messed up one case being too afraid to ask for contact one person before she moved somewhere else and thus losing the chance forever and i dont want to continue to fail    im kinda tired of hearing way too much general advices like go outside or just go and talk to people for example online dating is bashed in my country central europe by the way with enlighted people claiming that its better to meet other people in person  by going to parties or just outside  i could ask  where then its like telling others that you dont know how to swim and hear just swim im pretty well aware that i will never form serious love relationship or if im even capable of loving somebody or what love in general is  who would want 28 years old guy without any kind of social experience yet i really want to at least find a friend  and i guess best startpoint is somebody with similar hobbies    so where could i find people with such interests where could i start looking how to meet such people irl any kind of advice    sorry if this thread is supposed to go elsewhere and thank you for any kind of help
  same situation but im 25  i accepted that ill never have a social life everything is not for everyone and the social life ship has already sailed by this point in life  if you didnt get the experiences and friendships at the right time then its better to just accept it  its also what /adv/ told me when i made a similar thread  tldr you cant make friends and experience social life after a certain age
    thats not the answer i will accept people both younger and older participate in events related to for example anime and manga such as conventions thinking that 25 years old cannot meet anybody else than he or she already know is pure absurd    love and marriage can have age limit but friendship doesnt have boundaries if society as a whole would accept and claim so it would be essentially doomed everybody have right to and deserve to be accepted by somebody else    what you described is giving up one of most important things i learned from my psychology consultations is that you only truly lose when you give up
  theres no events and conventions where i live  and its not just about meeting people its about having the social skills to make friends  i met alot of people when i stopped being a hikkineet and went back to college but i couldnt make any actual friends cause i never learned the necessary social skills on time  everyone expects you to have these social and romantic skills by your early 20s and if you dont it means theres something wrong with you and they steer clear
    you really live in sad place then or meet wrong people personally i dont reject people just because they arent some sort of top chads or extravert masters and refuse to believe that im the only one
  its not about rejection its about being able to have a more meaningful social interaction other than goodmorning did you see last nights sportsball match bla bla and then not talking to them again for the day  im more goodlooking more well dressed less fat than alot of kids in my class  im not a turbosperg either  but girls always hug and get physical with the fat greasy but social dudes and are always distant and respectful towards me  it doesnt bother me because ive already accepted it but it is what it is
  people with interests in fields of comic books animation modelling video games and such  so literal children
    then what are adults into watching tv and complaining
    what exactly is more meaningful so called small talk is one thing picking up and holding topics is another did you watch last match could end up like this typical small greeting it could carry on  does they like that sport how about other whats their opinion on that or this what i learned during this year is that its really about friendly talk like this not some weird theater with strict norms like i imagined before i still have to work on that since im sometimes still absorbed in worrying how others would react what to say or how to avoid being wrongly understand  but when i dont it works wonders its about intentions and actual intelligent people will tell you if they dont want to talk or if you should avoid certain subject if not then its time to seek others    social experience is what it is  experience you wont get it from books or careful analysis something i thought i could at your age it only comes from actual tries i know i can fail l but it doesnt mean i shouldnt try if you try there are two outcomes  success or failure if you dont only one  fail    dont give up
  this sounds absurd but popular cons are a good idea hell of you save up you could bang a hot cosplayer idk
    cant do the last part  where i live cosplayers are usually 1621 rarely above it doesnt mean that i cant do photos actually asking for and then communicating during photoshooting was great training so far but only maintained some sort of contact with two of such cosplayers after con both professional but friendly it was great experience overall however
  well liking those nerd hobbies is popular now so reach out yo

its it dangerous like sure you can put a rubber on but you cannot do most things an the rubber does not really protect you 100 either
  what the fuck are you talking about you can do anything with a condom on
    you cannot do most things an the rubber does not really protect you 100 either  if you look at it from this perspective almost everything you do in life is dangerous you could leave your house now drive 10 miles get into a car accident and die does that mean you should never drive a car i think you should    if you have sex with a random girl and you use a condom imo its worth it sure there might still be a very very slim chance you contract an std or knock up the girl but if this super small possibility prevents you from doing it you might as well commit suicide because you wouldnt be able to doing anything in life that forces you to leave your house because who knows what could happen right
  cant do oral and a broad array of fetish things basically just relatively vanilla sex    but as to op yeah some people live dangerously for that strange puss
  women like the trill of fucking a stranger   men fuck anything that looks good enough     this life my man you learn this when you date a lot
  enjoy herpes
  eurofag here  i fucked a mexican milf 3 or 4 years ago  so drunk  and without condoms i fucked up really bad and getting an std was my worst nightmare she wanted to fuck again the day after  i saw her at a bar again in longbeach  and then i asked here if she has any kind of std but she told me no and she also told me that shes a mother and dont want this to happen to her kids  her son was a marine haha best experience in my life and first trip in the us  i get checked when i was back in faggotland and nothing happens so im lucky
  putting a seatbelt on doesnt protect you 100 either but i still have to drive to work either way    and speaking of which there were some studies done and it was discovered that people are more likely to get into car crashes with a radius of their homes and familiar places because in their mind they know the place like the back of their hand and its all routine and theyre more prone to being careless when you drive out to somewhere new youre twice as careful cause you dont know whats around the next street corner    its a lot like that with fucking when you fuck a stranger youre going to be super extra careful when you date someone and you get into a relationship and everything thats when things get sloppy and whoops    ive known people who had to get abortions rather have their girl get an abortion and 100 of the time it was with girls that they had been dating for months if not years never once did a random hookup call them up and be like o hey im pregunta do you wanna kid or should i get rid of it    my personal experience is dumb luck cause ive been with dozens of girls and literally only ever used a condom like 3 or 4 times absolutely dumb pure luck thats why i never win at anything else
  oh hey im pregunta  kek grande
i cant make a good impression or fit in i physically dont have the energy to be upbeat and likeable in fact i dont even know how to be likeable    i cant really talk about myself i have a healthy relationship with my boyfriend and with my brother thats about it my dad left when i was 3 and my mother is completely batshit insane and has fled the country three months ago to cheat on her husband of 10 years abandoning my little brother its been a really shitty year    i have a small group of unreliable friends i find social situations in work overwhelming so i just dont bother i retreat like a wounded animal    this wouldnt normally bother me but my world is getting smaller people i meet seem to all know each other they all have friends and support systems and they managed to master the whole being pleasant thing i wish i could muster the energy to get on their level but i just cant i wish i could just do my thing without bumping into the same people again and again without having to worry about bonding with each person i meet but i feel like its inevitable that ill develop some sort of irreparable reputation that im some horrible bitch when im mostly just quiet and occasionally moody    end vent
haha funny pic    my advice is to just be urself  if that dont work fake it till you make it
is /pol/ right or just plain retarded
i dont care anymore if its right it aligns with my pessimism and my hatred of the world
not only completely fucking retarded but self fulfilling i had a generally attractive dude friend go from an 8/10 to a 4/10 because he suddenly became self conscious of his height 5 3 suddenly starting using his skin tone as one of his best features and started being so fucking negative all the time he literally went from a pseudo chad to an incel in like 6 months
from my personal experience it turned me from a positive fun person to hang out with to a recluse who started to hate everything and everyone not blaming it directly but it doesnt do anything positive for me so i cut it off
  53  chad  no you just have awful taste in men
  this lmao you cant be a chad unless you are at least 510 feet tall desu
/pol/ is alt right last time i heard
  510 still a manlet     you misheard it always not alt i believe thats how the meme goes
  both thats what autism does to you
  what and a straight male knows better      says who dudes a chad is a dude who is unbelievably attractive grabs women without effort and everyone likes being around him thats the point if you think theres any physical attributes then thats your preference tbqh
  a dude who is unbelievably attractive  attraction is purely based on our genetics and being 53 is objectively shit genetics so i guess the keyword here is unbelievably ah that makes sense carry on
is an echo chamber full of bitter losers a good place to form political opinions    nah doesnt mean you shouldnt question the man but its not a great rabbit hole to go down        can you faggots stop shitting up this already shit thread
nothing is 100 right an echo chamber like that never is no matter the ideas they present approach it like you would something scientific realizing that it will never portray the full truth but can contain some and then use your damn head
  so you are a dude trying to decide what makes dudes attractive if youre straight this is weird that youre trying to act as if you can comment if youre gay perhaps its that gay men like tall men but unfortunately im speaking from a womans perspective     women contrary to popular opinion cannot see you dna that means we cannot see if you have weak genetics those of us who arent explicitly interested in tall men will see short men with other characteristics such as good face nice beard good hair strong morals good personality etc and this will play into the whole rating    this guy 5 3 was an easy 8/10 my preference out him was just short of 10 honestly you dont have to believe me but that doesnt make it untrue
  pretty much all of the lookism/blackpill followers are latent homosexuals youre arguing with a faggot
  i mean it does appear theyre far more into what men look like than what i am which is pretty weird ive always be fascinated with the self destructive logic tho i cant help but engage with them
women back in their place as servants and protectorates of men   nonwhites removed or neutralized   gays  other freaks sterilized and committed to psychiatric institutions   degenerate art and media eliminated   christianity restored to its former glory    i cant actually see the downside here
  there was an attempt
  yes
  autists are even more ostracized and perhaps more unlikely to get a gf than in currentyear  lets not go back
  pol is just angry stormfront faggots and huffing post warriors    its good for laughs
  if its on 4chan its probably because it was so wrong and baseless and vapid that nowhere else on the internet wanted anything to do with it  while theyre on the right track upper echelons of power are corrupt and need deposing theyre also complete spergs about it and since theyre on 4chinz they tend to cause more problems than they actually solve
/pol/ is not one person newfriend its the politics board not stormfront
bump
replacing your population with 3rd worlders doesnt make your country better /pol/ is right
/pol/ is mostly correct also the 53 guy shit has to be bait
   art and media eliminated    they say while posting on 4chan
  i see that being posted all the time about them but in reality its like 98 nothing but frogpost politics that circlejerks around a red pill and maybe like 2 dissident voices that are there to try and break up the echo chamber a little bit
  its retarded very very retarded
  mostly right from an objective standpoint of modern immigration not adding anything positive to a country  it is a globalist plot    but regardless if you dwell on the negatives of society like some of the great philosophers of the past ie diogenes your life will begin to suck as you realize the futility of any attempt to change the system because the brain washed cattle even when presented with objective proof mk ultra vietnam false flag cia drug smuggling fucking bilderberg lusitania federal reserve race crime stats average income via tax from a racial group and expenditures via welfare for a given group they will ignore what you say  then you realize that it is hopeless unless the normies are punished via some mass tragedy such as another vietnam war great depression etc and become a hermit
  goebbels was autistic as fuck  just by nature of being a high functioning autist which was less common back then because not every shy kid was diagnosed with mental illness mind control such as vidya wasnt perfected mass media etc you probably were the smartest person in your village for specific subjects
  k ultra vietnam false flag cia drug smuggling fucking bilderberg lusitania federal reserve race crime stats average income via tax from a racial group and expenditures via welfare for a given group    the average /pol/ retard supports like the first half of those things
  fucking this retards with simple views that probably are afraid to talk to people in real life    pol is literally a safe space for alt right edgy autists that present no viable solutions to current problems and think some people are more equal than others
  you probably were the smartest person in your village for specific subjects    they didnt have wikipedia back then chief if you were too autistic to complete a general education you were sent to a loony bin to get your brain scooped out or maybe you worked as a chimney sweep until you died of natural causes at the ripe old age of 15
  i love how much they use the npc with absolutely no selfawareness of how they all use the same pictures and the same language and the same memes and all think the same way    its like theyre all running off the same script  if disagree ur a sjw
  very few modern autists are too stupid to complete general education because aspergers no longer exists  there is now little to no differentiation in the psychology textbooks of labelling a 150 iq autistic genius savant and a 50 iq useless retard  currently the modern psychology industry pseudoscience with conflicting theories likes to diagnose people with mental illnesses for basic things like being sad about your job and then drug you instead of recommending a new job they diagnose shy people with autism hyper people with adhd/add  this used to not happen and someone who was smart yet shy was not mentally ill but a common sort of person or at least common enough for stereotypes to form which are based in truth
  i love how much they use the npc    the npc meme
  if you ignore any of those things you are a retard  fact is 3rd world people  3rd world society keep them out  intellectual elite of the 3rd world are in such small number and dont use regular immigration channels anyway so theyre almost irrelevant to any discussion as no one wants to restrict the chinese millionaire from coming over
  aspergers no longer exists    yeah when did that happen
  like 10 years ago in america  maybe a little less
  i didnt say anything about ignoring any of that im saying that the average poltard thinks its great when the government goes out and kills people and abuses its power and ruins lives  as long as it triggers the sjws  one of their favorite memes is the helicopter ride for fucks sake
  well youre wrong    it still exists as part of the larger autism spectrum disorder    its like saying hiv doesnt exist anymore when scientists figured out aids
    haha still triggered by the npc meme
  is /pol/ right or just plain retarded  all you have to do is take a quick appraisal of your average /pol/ user and ask yourself whether or not these people are really the picture of functionality and mental health
  i dont see how people can see the viewpoints of /pol/ and think theyre dumb or whatever they make a lot of sense theyre just really unwanted and divisive truths
  post em truths
  in what universe are you from its the left that always lacks facts always talking about their feelings as if those two things are the same /pol/ might be overkill in some regards but theyre mostly right there are political problems in our countries the sysyem is flawed and intruded by corrupt politicians who much rather sit on their assall day than do problemsolving luckily at least in my country there has come an almost competent rightwing party that i would almost vote for they make a difference the difference being daring to adress problems that were unspoken or a tabboo to speak about they shine light on it and im glad to hear a different view on topics if it wasnt for the treasonlike immigration policy of the left and some other small things id probably be a leftwinger
  having extensively argued with /pol/fags there are two major issues for me  holocaust denial  grandpas uncle participated in it so i dismiss people who say it flat out didnt happen  weird value system  a recurring thing ive noticed is that they hold preserving the white race or some similar thing as a virtue in and of itself and value it above morality itself like in a game theory sense theyre concerned only with the strategy that most effectively continues the white race and morality is only valuable as a tool for this end
  where are you from
  the netherlands why
  nice conspiracy
  holocaust denial    why do you think people deny it though having something illegal to speak about in public is so suspect not having numbers that match up is suspect no evidence of giant ash piles is suspect the fact you cant even look into this shit without breaking laws is evident to some underlying lie     i dont think anyone is saying the holocaust never happened theyre saying that it didnt happen in the way its depicted     weird value system    maintaining the potential for western civilization and the phenotypes and traditions of white people are what theyre concerned with i think its on the basis that morality is a luxury under the circumstances you wouldnt have to worry about preservation of tradition and culture granted they play the game like its in the final stages but theyre just very preemptive i guess
  a recurring thing ive noticed is that they hold preserving the white race or some similar thing as a virtue in and of itself and value it above morality itself  basic tribal instincts something almost all groups practice
/pol/ is a waste of small minded regressive people its full of teenage edgelords who are all fucking thrilled theyre being contrarian but are drawing in legitimate crazy fucking people who think theyve found a safe space    that aside i cant believe theres people out there who legitimately think preserving race religion or culture is important in their own useless tribes when we share lives on a tiny floating rock that can be traversed in a single day
    hits bong  weeeeere just a tiny floating rock maaannnn  dude nothing matters lmao
  post on an anime imageboard  im an elite aryan superhuman preserving righteousness and christianity mannnnnn  dude youre all degenerates check out my frogposting kek
  /pol/ is always right
  facts come from deductive reasoning  from our ability to understand the universe  from our 5 senses     so use your own senses and brain to understand the ideas posted there gain a confidence in your own reasoning skills then youll have the answer to this question
as anyone with a brain would imagine they are the retardation /pol/ is unironically just a bunch of whining delusional babies who only respond emiotionally to arguments like the trash unable to argue they are  those with high power level are just a bunch of retards who post studies already been debunked plenty of time and when you prove them wrong they sperg and throw tantrums  a bunch of sad shutins with nothing to do lack of intelligence to succeed lack of social skill to live an ignorant but happy life
  communists arent people       morality is only valuable as a tool for this end  thats precisely what moral systems dothey provide a framework for a society with an underlying goal anything else is just yelling your arbitrary personal preferences and do note that the societal goal is also arbitrary at least without god but it isnt undermined by individual dissent into a tube and that doesnt help anyone if your morality exterminates itself in a few generations you have a shitty system    morality should focus primarily on two things and you are prefer that society values something else happiness/contentment and sustainability the former without the latter is selfdestructive hedonism and rampant materialism we see today whereas the latter without the former is a totalitarian hellhole that would make 1984 look like the libertarian party platform by definition if you cant preserve the composition of a society the white race its not sustainable and also note that this is on a societal levelsustaining every life to the point of immortality would also be unsustainable in light of the inevitable population growth from it
  i didnt say i support hate speech laws just that i dismiss people who deny it as cringey edgelords  as for the other point morality is the sole metric by which actions should be judged so calling it a luxury and saying you can ignore it is ridiculous  also stop pretending that youre just playing devils advocate youre allowed to believe what /pol/ spews but dont patronize me with these games
  too bad i dont think any of that i just think youre a retard that dismisses other peoples values on completely arbitrary nonsense such as we share lives on a tiny floating rock that can be traversed in a single day
  /pol/ is unironically just a bunch of whining delusional babies who only respond emiotionally to arguments  yeah leaving aside the baseless assertion and accepting it for the sake of argument im going to hit back with a tu quoque /pol/ has no shortage of lunatics and walking logical fallacies but dont act like this is tied to any particular viewpoint mind you i argue with /pol/ on the exact same subject i do here and when it comes to the whinging degenerates theyre on both boards      bivariate results suggested that delaying sexual involvement was associated with higher relationship quality across several dimensions the multivariate results indicated that the speed of entry into sexual relationships was negatively associated with marital quality but only among women      i find that premarital sex or premarital cohabitation that is limited to a womans husband is not associated with an elevated risk of marital disruption however women who have more than one intimate premarital relationship have an increased risk of marital dissolution      both structural equation and group comparison analyses demonstrated that sexual restraint was associated with better relationship outcomes even when controlling for education the number of sexual partners religiosity and relationship length
  by definition if you cant preserve the composition of a society the white race its not sustainable     too bad the white race is not a society
    theyre covering their asses scientific racism is pseudoscience collectivism is cancer anyway even if they are right
  morality is the sole metric by which actions should be judged so calling it a luxury and saying you can ignore it is ridiculous  this is a recurring theme throughout all of recorded history in times of war the law falls silent morality goes out the window when its either dying smugly or ensuring the survival necessary to continue being moral     you can try to hold yourself back but that very much is a luxury rather than an inviolate ruleyou tell me how long a no first strike nuclear policy would last in a country about to be invaded by ten times as many soldiers as a country has citizens
  stop watching lauren videos    
  morality is the sole metric by which actions should be judged  why and which system of morality
  fact is 3rd world people  3rd world society keep them out    people outside your border arent apes you fucking idiot you should be kept out
  exactly its analogous to social issues nobody would be advocating for gender pronouns in a time of serious war
  correct white and i use this for the new world onlyeurope should strictly be of nations is an aspect of society a certain demographic group making it up nobody here has claimed that whiteness is the sole determinant of society far from it it just happens to be the subject of discussion at the moment since its so heavily under threat  also as far as social pillars go demographic homogeneity is extremely importantwhereas culture and politics can change rapidly and reversibly blood endures even more so with the reduced pressures of selection over time and can never be recovered once lost those who would trade permanent demographics for transient fiat funny money or an extra seat in a rubber stamp legislature are either selfrighteous fools or literal demons      posting worst lauren
  people outside your border arent apes you fucking idiot   they could be apes or unicorns with revolving dicks i dont care so long as they stay outside the border
  everyone is disagreeing with them surely they must be right  what kind of mental illness makes a person think like this
  there was nothing in his post which suggested what you put in your meme arrows
  it just happens to be the subject of discussion at the moment since its so heavily under threat    its not
  you post this as if american jews dont also identify as american  couldnt help but notice a vast majority of those people are male too why are males disproportionately represented over women  inb4 muh biology  if were following that line of reasoning i guess youre implying jews are biologically superior to non jews
  too bad you dont get to decide that
  having something illegal to speak about in public is so suspect  ah ok so threatening to murder people over social media is probably a virtue right after all why would they make it illegal
  the picture is evidence to support the claim that jews are disproportionately in positions of influence as well as their nepotistic nature       completely unrelated and an absolutely idiotic thing to compare to
  you can try to hold yourself back but that very much is a luxury rather than an inviolate ruleyou tell me how long a no first strike nuclear policy would last in a country about to be invaded by ten times as many soldiers as a country has citizens  how convenient for /pol that they try to make everyone believe theres a culture war going on now so they can justify their lack of morals
anons remember no matter how pseudo racist science they spit or how well they choose their cherrypicked pieces at the end of the day even though we are hearing a strong rightwing cry all around europe and america the left is still gaining more and more power let them do damage control all they want  they know very well themselves where we are heading and cant do nothing bout it
  care to actually address what i said or are you just going to repeat your claims and pretend youre arguing with me
  governments are openly and actively trying to destroy homogeneityfrom the uss programs that ship hud projects into white communities to democrats gloating on national television that a big brown wall will keep trump out of office to blairite officials declaring that they would rub the rights nose in diversity before opening the floodgates to half of western european capitals having a minority of the own countrys natives white nations everywhere are on a demographic cliff it is an absolute fact dont give me the white people arent being killed line either this is about whites as a group and white group expression is openly and constantly vilified pic related too    the simple statements keep england english or germany for the germans would instantly be labeled farright hate speech in those countries and could even get you arrested       american is a meaningless identity its nothing more than a branding you would put on cattle albeit less permanent than a branding and more damaging to adopt      and      its not that they dont have morals though its simply a question of priorityif your group is destroyed it has no capacity to be moral or immoral since it no longer exists and its a completely honest assessment that whites as a demographic group are under threat  you know this i think youre just playing around semantically for the sake of a sound bite
  morality is often not a winning strategy if the game youre playing is anything but the be moral game however thats objectively the only game you should play
  stop watching lauren videos here all your claims debunked  https//myoutubecom/watchvvubxvfsqtt8    but you are going to dismiss it with nothing anyway culture people races arent something stale and are doomed to mix change and evolve that you like it or not and it wont bring to anything bad expect some /pol/tards going full terrorists for ideas from another time sustained by delusional conspiaracy theorists here sad
  this its ridiculous how much /pol/ has lost all self awareness
  again you have to define what morality is if its simply the blind following of whatever personal preferences an individual happens to have then its not only meaningless but also a recipe for societal chaos  as a structure morality is best served in ethnocentric terms as it eliminates both the free rider problem and protects the group from being dominated its fairly easy to understand that humanitarians will always lose out to those who take but never give to those outsde of their group and am i calling ethnocentrism bad of course not i want it   the fact is for humanitarianism to even have a chance at working which is suspect anyway you would have to destroy every last viable group on the planet not just ethnic groups but families too all of them would be in the way of the single encompassing identity of human          i have never watched those videos to begin with but the video you posted is a mixture of going for lowhanging fruit civnats like lauren ever desperate to avoid being called racist contort themselves into indefensible positions by agreeing all possible motivations for their views are wrong and the guy is saying precisely what i told you not to do replacement has nothing to do with physically killing whites     anyway culture people races arent something stale and are doomed to mix change and evolve that you like it or not  this is no more an argument than the oil shills handwringing about climate is always changing thats not at issuethe rate and manner of the change is in the right conditions species can persist for millions even hundreds of millions of years with little change doubly so for a species which is so able to shape its own environment rather than the other way around   something tells me you dont share the same vitriolic opposition towards environmentalism
  also at the end of the video about 27 minutes in the guy openly says that demographic change is occurring which is exactly the point i made to begin with
  why  if you keep asking why long enough youll eventually find out that everything is based on nonsensical arbitrarily decided axioms such as if a  b then b  a when youre choosing a hierarchy of values you need to already have one by which you judge the rest that which is morally good  that which you ought to do is in my opinion an axiom that all other values not fundemental in their own right stem from    and which system of morality  alright this is gonna be even more pretentious so bare with me  the same way you assume objective reality exists because you experience it you can assume objective morality exists because you experience it however we know our experience of reality isnt always reliable so we negotiate amongst each other an approximation of what we think objective reality is with the knowledge that this is only an approximation its important to note that not all opinions are considered equally in this process  same goes for morality so while im pretty sure objective morality exists im aware that my experience of it is subjective   that said id say the west and far east have the best approximations of morality yet developed
  the shit youre spewing hasnt been a valid method of societal organization for more than a millennium
  go ahead and explain why hard mode do it without using youre dumb as an argument its literally the opposite where this way of thinking is more necessary since its no longer a given    last time i checked nationalism has only been a concern in much more recent times as the stability of groups has become more suspect in an age where the vast majority of people died within 20 miles of their birth obviously youre not going to be worried about demographic replacement on the scale we face now  largescale migrations in ancient times were very rare and were almost invariably destructive on a massive scale
  ok so you are going to paint on shaun the idea he thinks great replecemnt means phisically killing whites all right    the manners things are chaning are finee a lot stems from wars refugees demographic change is fine im italian and my country recieved a lot of refugees and immigratns in ther last years the right approach to this is integrate the foreings and let them bring their culture to ours i hope all people who got here from war decide to stay and build a future here   in some years the face of europe may change probably going to and its fine you conspiracy theorists are taking us back
  as societies grow in size and complexity it is impossible to segregate them by ethnicity as has been seen from pretty much every world power that emerged  it has been proven that combining groups with varying backgrounds cultures and upbringings leads to increased creativity and effectivity in their endeavors  as a social animal hell as an intelligent being it is in your best interest to interact with and expose yourself to a variety of different beliefs cultures customs traditions media etc no group be it nation race religion or society has ever maintained success by valuing isolationism segregation and purity of blood it is a blatant fetishization of stagnation to believe that maintaining a pure race free from different ideas will ever succeed or thrive
  this reality is leftleaning as much as rightwing groups pop up and seem to constantly be on the news the world has never been more peaceful and prosperous and it has everything to do with the average person being more open to cooperation
  so you are going to paint on shaun the idea he thinks great replecemnt means phisically killing whites  he said that about halfway through the video along with a glib remark about white privilege you cant debunk something thats actually happening so you simply have to shift your focus onto something which can be debunked in other words a straw man    the manners things are changing are fine  highly highly debatable the patterns of movement are not only destructive in and of themselves at the risk of waxing philosophical italy wont be italy without italians but they are perversely aligned with multiple other processes like the recent trend of leftists across the west simply importing more voters to ensure electoral success refer back to the big brown wall thing dont pretend they dont realize this all with the complicity of nominally rightwing industrialists who are too happy to gobble up the cheap labor    a lot stems from wars refugees  theyre migrants nothing more they crossed multiple national borders for welfare checks not safety    let them bring their culture to ours  something has to give thats either going to be yours or theirs in the long run perhaps both under the boot of consumerism also the physical presence of outsiders let alone political presence or even dominance of them is hardly required for cultural exchange while mozart was composing his operas about the turks i can guarantee you the suggestion that the ottomans be brought into vienna would have been laughed at not exactly the same conditions of course but the point stands that their physical presence isnt necessary by any means    in some years the face of europe may change probably going to and its fine  even if it necessarily destroys the composition of the society this isnt a question of reality which is firmly aligned with what conspiracy theorists think but a question of value
  right about some things completely wrong in other departments race realism and rampant feminism are worth discussing holocaust denial and false flag shootings are fringe lunatic ideas men are literally chopping off their dicks and becoming women nothing is off the table in 2018
  you really have no idea what youre talking about or perhaps it would be more exact to say that you have wildly divergent ideas about reality than a majority of other humans  cultures are not immutable they change constantly what was considered acceptable behavior in america in 1800 is significantly different than what was considered acceptable in 1900 same for 2000 and it will be significantly different in 2100 cultures are a living thing they grow or shrink evolve absorb and above all else change not only do you fetishize a culture that most likely was far obsolete before you were even born you cling to the hope that you can somehow preserve a culture at one point in time effectively killing it
  combining groups with varying backgrounds cultures and upbringings leads to increased creativity and effectivity in their endeavors  all of which can happen internally within a demographic groupbut crucially with the bonds such a group allows parents and children see things differently from each other but they are bound by the family different classes and occupations are similarly bound within a nation and no this isnt a question of de jure citizenship if you let somebody pay a few dollars to get a certificate of coparenthood then you dilute the meaning of the bond and family unit in the first place    obviously different ways of thinking will increase the creativity of a group but then one must also ask how that creativity is defined and what use it has to begin with not to mention that in the long run if we take your assertion that ethnic isolation is bad for creativity youre doing the one thing that will ensure it by advocating mixing of separate peoples and cultures into one amorphous blob     no group be it nation race religion or society has ever maintained success by valuing isolationism segregation and purity of blood it is a blatant fetishization of stagnation to believe that maintaining a pure race free from different ideas will ever succeed or thrive  id like to know how you reconcile this with the fact that easily 80 of scientific breakthroughs in history came out of a small area of europe where there were either no nonwhites or mixing with them was outright banned this is pure hogwash as is the notion that protecting and valuing your own group somehow rules out cooperation with others while i have my issues with the motivations and result of it the fact is that europeans dominated the planet while adhering to their own ethnic identity    have you ever heard the saying good fences make good neighbors  having a stable demographic composition in no way fetishizes stagnation
  they crossed multiple national borders for welfare checks not safety    i think  and  said verything i wanted to say in much better way i could ever put  i think these points stand after your response   something doesnt really have to give even todays italian culture is nothing but the result of many different influences everywhere   do you think im an ancient romanian italians are the people living in italy who are integrated in our society if you think there are some kind of pure blood you are delusional italians in the sense you mean already don t exist but no philoaphical question comes      they crossed multiple national borders for welfare checks not safety    this was really low and disgusting
  id like to know how you reconcile this with the fact that easily 80 of scientific breakthroughs in history came out of a small area of europe  i can reconcile it with the fact that that statement is blatantly untrue the fact you use such a ridiculous argument in the first place is a such a detriment to your credibility that i wonder why anyone including you yourself takes you seriously
  i dont give a flaming shit about nebulous culture in comparison with the physical reality of blood and the fact of the matter is that the existence of certain types of societies is threatened and it can be prevented   we already try to preserve animal species regardless of the inevitability of change or the objective economic and environmental uselessness of some species in some cases even from hybridization but somehow that is cut off instantly when you suggest groups of humans be preserved as i said it is far easier to reverse a change in culture than it is to reverse one of blood    cultures are a living thing they grow or shrink evolve absorb and above all else change   so this hardly says change is a good in itself and some changes have been both irrational and disastrous for societal wellbeing but culture is much more malleable as an abstract creation of the human mind blood not so muchit changes far more slowly and for a species which has the capability to change the face of the planet with its efforts managing the pace of change is well within the realm of possibility arguing that we accept change here simply by virtue of the fact that it would happen given enough time without intervention is the ultimate appeal to nature fallacy     i dont think i need to remind you that if inevitability were an argument against resistance to change murder wouldnt be a crimewe all die anyway so why fight it and then youll give me something about but they didnt want it an infringement on rights while conveniently ignoring the same applicability to blood thanks but id like to keep my society intact for at least some time
  the blood that is being threatned was already mixed and its mixing right now  society isnt collapsing  your blood isnt pure  go hybernate yourself
   even todays italian culture is nothing but the result of many different influences everywhere   my main focus has never been on transient culture although if you want to go down this route more ill indulge youeach and every society which used to exist in italy no longer does as a result of this mixing    italians are the people living in italy who are integrated in our society  when everyone can be an italian nobody is an italian it becomes a label no more valuable than the stamp on happy meal leftists of course love this but the cost to the society itself is grave as it atomizes individuals by severing inherent connections    if you think there are some kind of pure blood you are delusional  pure means different things to different people but there is absolutely a genetic cluster for identifiable areas the more you increase the area of that cluster the more you dilute the bond between members of it    this was really low and disgusting  spare me the moral outrage you farthuffing subhuman they did and everybody fucking knows it do i blame them no they were invited in to take more than they wouldve gotten elsewhere but the idea that they had no other choice is a pure absurdity you had migrants storming borders from turkey to greece to bulgaria to serbia to croatia and hungary all to get to germanys or swedens welfare thats not fleeing war and anybody who isnt a selfrighteous leftist or duplicitous leech will realize that      what is the renaissance  name any major scientific field and there is a very high probability that its modern foundation originated somewhere in europe my point isnt to browbeat anyone over a pissing contest of superiority i dont care about that and for that matter jews are vastly overrepresented in many areas of science despite being confined to ghettos it is to tell you to take your unsubstantiated bullshit of mixing being a necessity and to blow it out your ass
  the blood that is being threatned was already mixed and its mixing right now  doubling down on the it is natural therefor good fallacy i also dont think i need to remind you that even when the genetic differences involved were much smaller ie germanic invasions of rome being between two indoeuropean groups the change was slow bloody and disruptive whereas now the changes are rapid deliberate and involving vastly more disparate peoples    society isnt collapsing  define collapse the lights stay on but morality erodes people become increasingly isolated from one another public trust declines and so on in any case this is hardly a prerequisite for caring about something    your blood isnt pure  no but nations should be
  when everyone can be an italian nobody is an italian it becomes a label no more valuable than the stamp on happy meal leftists of course love this but the cost to the society itself is grave as it atomizes individuals by severing inherent connections    being integrated isnt easy you need to understand the language and the culture its not easy but its possible and thats the way it should be and it is in most eu     pure means different things to different people but there is absolutely a genetic cluster for identifiable areas    no it doesnt you were just stupid for thinking that there were pure bloods here    mixing is good not only because its natural but also because people uniting together regardless of the background is going to wipe all of the pieces of shit like you out   and thats going to happen have fun not being able to do anything about it putting your mind at ease and stopping being retatded wouldnt hurt though sadly you seem way too deep into your delusions
  you need to understand the language and the culture  not even that in many placesbe it mandate multiculturalism or the american practice of having no official language and at any rate the government actively pays for the migrants to possibly learn that after they already flooded in which leaves aside the point that they never will be italian    no it doesnt  excellent argument in some cases we can even pinpoint a specific cluster of villages with a reasonable amount of certainty by genetics the only one defining monolithic ethnic groups as purity is you    mixing is good not only because its natural but also because people uniting together regardless of the background is going to wipe all of the pieces of shit like you out   and here we have it youre not uniting anyone youre just celebrating a future where everybody doesnt give a shit about anyone else but equally so we are already seeing this in hard datainterpersonal trust and communal feelings have been steadily decreasing and while this is due to multiple factors shitting on common ancestry is certainly not helping what kind of unity do you really have if you openly admit you want to breed your opposition out of existence the absurdity of these universalist pretenses is so glaring that its almost amusing to see anyone act like theyre tolerant in any way shape or form   have you noticed this thread i went on record stating that i dont care what other groups exist or what they do while you the open and tolerant enthusiastically celebrate the destruction of those with different values wherever they may be its repulsive    also nice job literally flaunting a fallacy even after it was pointed out  good because its natural  so is killing ones competitors at least you have the unintentional decency to realize the intractability of our differences
  most people on /pol/ actually delusional the worst mixture of misinformed beliefs toxic ideologies and trolling
   and at any rate the government actively pays for the migrants to possibly learn that after they already flooded in which leaves aside the point that they never will be italian    yes theyll be if they choose to stay in order to go on and get through with everyday life theyll slowly for sure but they will and so theyll become italian many have kids too and those kids are going to grow up italian   theyre not going after the money you fake news spreading idiot    excellent argument in some cases we can even pinpoint a specific cluster of villages with a reasonable amount of certainty by genetics the only one defining monolithic ethnic groups as purity is you    im saying you thought that was the case anyone i already gave you my defition of italian it has nothing to do with clusters and ill say it again even tho you think its cluster the italians as you think do not exist theyre not specific clusters they come from everywhere even if theyd ne specificic clusters as generations pass they wont be anymore and no one is gonna have philosopical questions    while you the open and tolerant enthusiastically celebrate the destruction of those with different values wherever they may be its repulsive    ooooh the poor nazi who called me a subhuman wants the cuddles ((( sowwy i shouldnt have uwu    you are fucking retarded you are repulsive you know very well what you think and what you stated is a lie so fucking twisted literally hitler    public untruts stems from racism which is what we are fighting against btw    anyway the only important thing is that you realize where the world is heading and that you cant do anything about it
pol is satire and wrong it is okay to admire your heritage but dont drink their cool aid about certain shit cause the sheer aspergers worse than reddit
  theyre not going after the money  of course they are subsaharan africans had plenty of places to choose from besides their own countries in the first place     even tho you think its cluster the italians as you think do not exist  you dont know what i think speculation on either end is unproductive because its unfalsifiable  theyre not specific clusters they come from everywhere  this is simply false regional dna clusters together significantly and while you can debate the origins of those clusters all day the fact is as they are now they are identifiable groups with observable geographical boundaries i never claimed that there is an italian gene but there is certainly a genetic region that corresponds to italy and within that distinct clusters for tuscans venetians sardinians and so on the larger the differences you introduce the greater the loss to cohesion and group feelingsthis is something we implicitly acknowledge by feeling closer to a parent or sibling than to a second cousin the differences between africans and any italian dwarf any gap between regions of italy and as such the cost to society is increased  as generations pass they wont be anymore  and thus whatever used to exist no longer will    the poor nazi who called me a subhuman wants the cuddles   please i dont particularly care how you treat me the infuriating thing is the obvious hypocrisy of leftist viewpoints    public untruts stems from racism which is what we are fighting against btw  racism wouldnt exist if you didnt import foreigners in the first place youre essentially creating a problem and then declaring that a foundation of society has to be destroyed to fix it go ahead find one instance of a sweden complaining about blacks before there were any blacks in sweden it is an inherent mechanism built into us to discern between groups on instinct and if you want to use the appeal to nature guess what tribalism is natural too
the ultimate failure of a sincere poltard is that they honestly believe that they run shit or that their wishful thinking would actually matter when in reality its no different than the socialism idealouge its just another replacement for religion a cult if you will
  of a sweden  of a swede sorry
  youre not a genius just give up and enjoy life
  youre not a genius  i didnt claim to be one  just give up  no can do  enjoy life  id probably be miserable even if i lived in an allwhite 18thcentury europe
  thats a shame i guess you may have some form of autism maybe i just seems so tiresome to get worked up over idiots
    of course they are    yeah you should see how some of them live here luxury    this is simply false the fact is as they are now they are identifiable groups with observable geographical boundaries i never claimed that there is an italian gene but there is certainly a genetic region that corresponds to italy and within that distinct clusters for tuscans venetians sardinians and so on        italians they do not exist this is just a geographic aggregation we have different genetic identities linked to different histories and backgrounds and not only to those explains davide pettener anthropologist of the department of biological geological and environmental sciences of the university of bologna who created a bank of dna samples to trace the history genetics of the italians together with donata luiselli of the department of cultural heritage of ravenna and collaborators    what you think used to exist never was   we already are mixed from all over the world and thats fine in a few generations our identity will evolve even more language will change and we will keep going peacefully letting people build a future here    please    im not hyprocite im not letting nazis act like their ideas are even the least worth taking into consideration       racism wouldnt exist if you didnt import foreigners in the first place youre essentially creating a problem and then declaring that a foundation of society has to be destroyed to fix it     that problem is called freedom  you know human rights and all maybe you actually do not know    im doing this for the lurkers but this is so tiring
  /pol/ does not have a homogenous set of views and opinions so that question is null
  no just neuroticism and rigidity    yeah you should see how some of them live here luxury  its still better than what they had in the shithole they came from hence why they never leave again even if i want them to go back i dont personally blame the migrants that come for a better lifei blame the people who allowed that choice to be made in the first place      i appreciate you giving a source  this article at least the translated version of it is restating what i saidthat there is no unified italian group as such but several distinct groups on the subnational level if anything youre lending further credence to my point which is that we can quite clearly pinpoint ancestral groups from which the current batch of migrants is about as distant as possible unless the australian aboriginals decide to set up shop in florence    we already are mixed from all over the world and thats fine  thats patently false there wasnt even the proverbial drop of american native subsaharan african or east asian in all of western europes gene pool until extremely recently and even now its present in a tiny portion of the population italians are a mix of indoeuropean groups neolithic european farmers and a small proportion of moorish in the south in particular    you keep repeating and its fine when i cant help but think of that meme with the dog in the burning house its something people are indoctrinated to believe to shut them up and keep them passive resettlement is not a new idea when it comes to pacifying peoples and regionsthat idea is older than rome and its no different this time around
    im not hyprocite im not letting nazis act like their ideas are even the least worth taking into consideration  im not a hypocrite if i do the opposite of my professed beliefs as long as my opponent is a nazi  ah the good old paradox of tolerance  this is circular reasoningyou dont have to listen to nazis and theyre nazis if you dont want to listen to them ethnic identity is something that is not limited to nazis in the slightestand for that matter i think you should come over to the us to browbeat the natives can you believe that they have blood quantum laws which give tribal benefits by ancestry they literally claim to ensure the survival of their people the nerve of them    that problem is called freedom  you know human rights and all  laughable coming from someone who undoubtedly supports the welfare state and literal thoughtcrimes this isnt about freedom in the abstract which you decidedly dont care about nor do i at least not above blood this is about ensuring your beliefs are pushed through and enforced on others you know politics     human rights is a meme  something hidden behind by subversives laws can and do already cover the structuring of society which includes the wellbeing of its members all these nicesounding platitudes do is provide cover for someone who wants to work outside of society   the left does this a lot calling whatever arbitrary or harmful thing they want a right to make it semantically difficult to argue against  it is my right to your stuff  you dont support rights you nazi    im doing this for the lurkers  as am i
  i blame the people who allowed that choice to be made in the first place    i praise them europe is very powerful and letting people die in poor shitholes is a crime when we can save them thats why im proud of italy   you keep repeating and its fine when i cant help but think of that meme with the dog in the burning house    i keep repeating that because i dunno many words in english and its very hard for me to argue in correct english    ah the good old paradox of tolerance    im not doing the opposite of my beliefs im following them what you pursue is an act against peoples freedom and thus isnt tollerable i do not tolerate nazis or fascists i do not sustain anyone whos protective of their race or blood as in race mixing is bad but when it comes to white people doing this im sure you can think of an istance where things escalated maybe get a boner from it too    human rights arent a meme thinking     this is about ensuring your beliefs are pushed through and enforced on others you know politics     no its about freedom for all people people fleeing from other countries arent pushing any political agenda whats built around them is political and you thinking no one should move to another country just because people are idiots and the outcome is racism is silly  its obvious the right way to go is to fight racism so anyone can have a better life      this is tiring someone give me change please
  europe is very powerful and letting people die in poor shitholes is a crime when we can save them  except european altruism is what caused those in the first place by pumping them full of aid and letting the population explode when the country cant sustain it     what a great life they get to live as a virtual slave to fatten the pocketbooks of a few greedy oligarchs and all it took was the destruction of a continent maybe two you want to help them build up their countries where they are if a neighbors house collapses from disrepair you dont just give him half of your property until that collapses or you kick him out you help him maintain his own house because for every immigrant you take in at great cost there are 10 more born in the shithole he came from and eventually youre going to run out of room    what you pursue is an act against peoples freedom  as i said hypocrisy you only care about freedom where it suits you but are perfectly willing to crush it where it doesntdoes a welfare state give economic freedom to those who dont want to contribute no is there freedom of conscience where expressing nazi ideas is a crime no     people fleeing from other countries arent pushing any political agenda  actual refugees no but these arent refugees and they dont leave and the people inviting them in absolutely are doing so for political reasons the left gets walking votes and the right gets cheap labor    thinking no one should move to another country just because people are idiots and the outcome is racism is silly  they shouldnt move to another country because it isnt their damn country im simply saying that racism wouldnt happen if they didnt move which is true  its obvious the right way to go is to fight racism so anyone can have a better life  this implies that theyre incapable of building a better life themselves and moreover that its our responsibility to give it to them both are false
it doesnt matter if you love us or hate us you cant stop us and we will win
      build up their countries where they are if a neighbors house collapses from disrepair you dont just give him half of your property until that collapses or you kick him out you help him maintain his own house    this exemple doesnt make any sense you cant seriously compare it to the issue at hand  the eu has the duty to help because here life matter and dont worry europe is big enough     as i said hypocrisy you only care about freedom where it suits you    you seem unable to understand what freedom means  nazis and fascists ideas endanger all people freedom so i dont tolerate them its not so hard    they shouldnt move to another country because it isnt their damn country im simply saying that racism wouldnt happen if they didnt move which is true    nowadays your latter sentence is probably false anyway they should move if they want because thanks god freedom exists     this implies that theyre incapable of building a better life themselves and moreover that its our responsibility to give it to them both are false    it doesnt racism is good for no one when a population is heavely racist it means theres much ignorance around defeating it would be better for everyone    it would be better for everyone because people have the freedom to flee and move around and also because sometimes the circumstances lead to it inevitabily
  this exemple doesnt make any sense you cant seriously compare it to the issue at hand  of course i can its the same principle bringing in foreigners decreases quality of life for the place they go to by definition by driving down wages and straining welfare developing the country they wanted to leave in the first place improves their conditions and keeps the negative effects away from your own by giving them reasons to stay    you seem unable to understand what freedom means  for christs sake id make more progress with a subway urinal go ahead and define freedom for me so i can tear it apart when its obvious you dont give a damn when it conflicts with your leftist sensibilities hard mode youre not allowed to say not nazi    anyway they should move if they want because thanks god freedom exists  i think this combined with your stubborn rejection of even basic logic is enough to conclude youre an automaton at least on the matter of nebulous freedom     when a population is heavily racist it means theres much ignorance around  literally how ignorance is a lack of information while racism is an opinion or behavior the two arent directly related and anyone who claims that a racist is necessarily ignorant is either lying or ignorant themselves    defeating it would be better for everyone  again how even if you accept the nonsensical assertion that one must be ignorant to be racist by definition you should be focusing on ignorance rather than racism itself since thats the root cause and again you are equating civilizational suicide with helping othersyou can have a virulently racist country that supports other countries without issue and there is already historical precedent for this  we already have the statistics showing a decline in interpersonal trust and whether you bury your head in the sand or not is irrelevant when the fact is you can reverse that and help others by allowing ethnic organization
  i got to go anon   racism isnt an opinion its ignorance based on pseudo science already been debunked     bringing in foreigners decreases quality of life for the place they go to by definition by driving down wages and straining welfare    i dont like to say this because we are talking about people but immigration is a long time investment but obv your fake news pieces wont say this       anon the interpersonal trust is declaining because of racism   defeating it would be better for everyone    ethnic organization brought to genocide    i have to go this gave me an headache one month ago i turned 18 and promised myself i wouldnt ever open 4chan again i spent hours arguing with a 12yo who calls himself literally hitler damn    i seriously hope someone will hop in and debunk all the points you are going to make its not hard guys even though   and some other posts made by the well spoken anons before already cleared all up really     you called me subhuman but i shouldnt have went on and insult you im sorry i dont think its your fault for being like this given all the fake news and the medias today   i hope youll get out of it and understand peace  goodbye
hey fellas no dental insurance and i need 4 cavities filled and one tooth in the front had a filling fall out i also need a tooth removed but that can wait i work a loooooot so taking time off is a bit of an issue already because i know they take like 3 appointments to do anything is there anything i can do to lower my costs im 18 and i work for like 8 an hour in nc in the middle of nowhere
  there is medicaid dentristy in some states its actually good
  yeah but whats the waiting period to use it
  dont they make card things for it
youre 18 unless youre living on youre own you can afford to miss the work and trust me solve it now i wish i had itll only get worse without treatments even if you take good care of yourself
medicaid is a good but if that isnt an option see if u can just make an appointment and get the work done then just dont pay shouldnt hit your credit too hard it will go away in a few years anyway
  i do live on my own and i can get off a day or two but that bullshit ok full day looking at your mouth come back later tgen they end up making 4 appointments and taking months to do any work and drain my wallet
  in my state as soon as youre approved
  that sounds like a terrible idea
almost two weeks ago i got brackets  the first day one of them fell apart for some reason a few days ago i went to the dentist because of it and he said that he would change it in my next appointment today one of them got loose should i go to the dentist early to get them replaced  or should i wait until my next appointment which is the 12 
call and ask the dentist
i deeply disdain women for judging me by success in capitalism    how do i get over this
  men are judging you too you just dont care because you dont want to fuck them    try not giving a fuck about women as far as they will or will not fuck you youre insecure as hell    also get better at capitalism youll enjoy having money to do shit you want to do its unsurprising that the more money you have to do things you want to do the less you think about and worry about what other people think of you
nobody gives a fuck about a nobody like you
  i earn around 60k a year right now freelance work    i just hate being assessed on this terms and it annoys me when men do it as well
  stop being a commie faggot
long story short a little girl has a crush on me how do i tell her to fuck off without making her cry
  channel the spirit of dan hymen divider schneider
one of my students had a crush on me depressingly one of only two female humans to have ever done so and the best thing to do is just leave her be but obviously dont reciprocate at all kids get weird obsessions when theyre just starting puberty and they often pass as quickly as they began
  tell her that it is inappropriate to further your relationship beyond professional/casual/acquaintanceship
  unzip and show her your hairy gnarly penis she will be traumatized for life and run away screaming
  talk to her about it and try to message her if you do less just straight up cut ties with her dont do those idiotic things some douchebags do and mention how many girls youre fucking or something 
  this guy has it right never mention it never give it any response dont treat her any differently than you do any other kid little girls have lots of crushes growing up its nothing unusual and shell grow out of it eventually

what can i even do with a political science degree i feel like an idiot the only thing i have is im in the military on my first contract should i get another degree im so lost
once youre done with the military become a cop they dont care what degree you have and will likely pay you higher if they dont require degrees
  write salon/huffpost articles on stuff like the new face of white supremacy how cis white men are spreading toxicity in collaborative mmorpgs    lots of shekels in that i hear
  work for the shadow government
  i was thinking about that and then trying to become a us marshal
  im pretty conservative
  then give us some juicy headlines to put in our infographs  bonus points if you have a pen name ending in berg or stein
  yeah i mean law enforcement is a pretty sweet career dude always in need of people and honestly theres a lot more to it than youd expect so if youre thinking about it talk to some officers go on a ride along attend a community academy its some fun stuff     working smaller departments is a lot more close and familylike in nature but lacks a lot of action shit still happens but not nearly as often as in big departments just branch out and check out as many as possible small cities big cities sheriffs deputies state troopers/highway patrol then decide if you really want to join or not
  that sounds good i wish i could work in europe but it seems like it would be impossible at this point
  cops make a pretty okay salary depending on where you live and youre usually going to work 3 days 12 hour shifts with like 1 long week every so often where you work a fourth shift to bring you to that 40 hour mark   thisll give you some ample time to go on vacations id say my buddy travels fuckin everywhere but he has no kids and works a lot of overtime when he can so keep that in mind
  its obviously a good basis for law school or a career in government but even if you dont use the things you learned you can sell yourself on the skills you developed while learning them    you are better than most of the population at reading critically absorbing the essential points of research developing new ideas based on previous work presenting your conclusions in effective writing and other things you take for granted without realizing that even a lot of college grads in other fields can do them    think creatively how those skills can be applied to the business world and youll see that very few fields would be closed to you
i need help should i spam gay korean porn or some other porn    or and other suggestions
not your personal army
  you have to be 18 to post here
  are we all really that predictable
  yes   reported for underage
how do i break up with a girl
you tell her we should see other people then be honest but if shes abusive just leave health first
  hard mode how do i break up with her if i dont want to hurt her
smack her ass and say the final booty slap for we shall no longer be together its not you its me then if she cries do not cave in
  do it in person i hope you have already talked about the issues you have been having and its clear they cant be resolved breaking up with someone for a reason they have had no idea about short of abuse is a dick move
  if she doesnt want to break up as well its not possible there will be tears and shit be a man get over it maybe shell try to convince you not to dont do it tell her goodbye delete everything you have related to her
  not op but i was depressed and needed attention and dated a fat chick who i ended up finding absolutely repulsive of course i didnt wanna tell her this so i just randomly broke up with her    was this bad
  it was not bad you are just fucking retarded typical frogposter
  hm probably better than telling her that you find her repulsive
  it was not bad you are just fucking retarded typical frogposter  is this supposed to be a joke cause its not funny
  make her break up with you if you catch my drift start acting differently or being unattractive the only caveat is that it only works half the time and you have to dedicate yourself to it and you cant just do a halfassed job otherwise you basically just wasted time and ruined your dignity for nothing
  it was bad you dated her while not having any real interest in her and did it solely for yourself its actually a good thing you broke up with her if i were seeing someone who was only there for their own self esteem and attention i would want them to break up and stop wasting my time
after being a neet for 6 years got my first job bagging groceries and putting back carts any tips and things i should look out for dont wanna get fired
dude i loved working at a grocery store it was my first job i really fucking miss it anyways yeah make sure eggs and bread are on the top of the bags dont be a whiney faggot when they tell you to clean the bathrooms and just do whatever they say without giving them any lip its easy to move up in a place like that
dont be late to work
  second this always be 5 minuets early i used to get to work 20 minuets early and sit in the parking lot for 15 mins
a lot of people dont want their freezer food with their cabinet/dry storage food dont completely fill a bag unless the customer asks you to or unless the items are very light

be talking to hot gril from work dont directly work together but weve been snapchatting and texting for about a month  she goes to school about an hour and a half away  she invites me over for her birthday to go out to bars  she has a really hot friend thats there  end up vibing with her friend better than her  girl 1 randomly disappears every now and then sometimes see her talking to other guys  say fuck it and dance with friend she seems genuinely interesting and fun to be around  been talking to girl 1 for a month though so go home with her especially since shes the one who invited me in the first place  end up fucking  next morning hanging out and it hits me just how vapid and annoying she is  thinking about her friend and how she actually seemed to want to get to know me rather than talk about herself all the time  is there any way i can salvage this and start talking to her friend or did i fuck that up by sleeping with girl 1
  i think you kinda fucked up by sleeping with the girl from your job considering that you seemed more set on her friend but give a try at having some sort of relationship with her friend anyway the main concern is girl 2 finding out that youve slept with girl 1 because even if youre quiet about it if girl 1 sees you and girl 2 getting closer together she might fucking blab so figure out wether or not youre gonna be honest with girl 2 and tell her about it or just do your god damn best to keep that a secret while you pursue whatever it is youre trying to get from her
  honestly girl 2 probably already knows theyre really good if not best friends id be open about it anyways just like girl 2 way more than work girl
1 tell girl 1 you like her as a friend   2 date her friend  3 profit    if she gets angry over you wanting to just be friends than she is worth associating with
  not worth associating with
my girlfriend is a little bit jealous and has some confidence issues and i dont know how to fix that weve been dating for almost 5 months and lately shes been feeling inferior and worried i might leave her shes been making remarks like why do you even with me or flat out saying youd be better off with someone else there seems to be two main issues thats bug her me being more successful than her in terms of career and the fact i can cook better than her shes been trying hard to learn to cook lately and i tried teaching her but progress is slow i dont know why thats important to her but it is bugging her  what do i do about her also shes the younger sister of a friend from uni should i consult with him seeing how he knows both of us well or is this going to make things worse
  i have the same issue man i dont think anything can be done about it just keep supporting her and saying nice things it will pass eventually     do you ever feel like youve done so much for her more than other people have
i might get back together with my ex i broke off a 3 year relationship because i was hurting her with destructive behaviors caused by childhood trauma and i didnt know how long it would take for me to sort that shit out if i ever could sort that shit out she didnt want me to leave but hoped that id fix my shit and that we would meet up again     its been three months since then ive been seeing a therapist and have been making some progress i talked to her we are planning on getting coffee in about a week what should i expect probably nothing right ive never been in this situation before but i still love her and when i left her she was deeply in love with me    btw both in our early twenties seniors in college
  you can give it a try but most certainly she will not take you back women change their mind pretty quickly one day they love you til death the next day theyre bored and the next they dont want to touch you with a 10m pole
  incels please leave
  she already has a new dick dont try
  people posting the word incel pls kys
  what are counterexamples
i could be labelled as a pretty irresponsable person i am always late or in a rush i hate responsability i procratinate as a sport am always tired or in need of a break etc etc    recently i was told that i just seem to have symptoms of depression and i would understand why    but i am starting to wonder if i am just using depression as an excuse for making my life a shitshow when i am just a lazy fuck    i do worry about a lot about stuff and i do wish badly i could be and do better i just cant seem to muster the will to do so i feel i could put more effort into stuff but i just dont i feel like i am just going to a dead end    is it because i am really depressed or really irresponsable and lazy
  guilt tripping yourself for being lazy is pretty common when you have depression if you have low energy and motivation theres a chance you might be depressed get yourself checked
  /thread
    it could be both    just be honest with yourself as you explore it otherwise you wont address it anyways
  laziness as a personality trait that just exists is a flawed concept what appears as laziness is always a result of some issue usually with lack of confidence difficulty in handling stress or lack of a sense of purpose/motivation
friends never respond to messages when i ask them to hang out or they make excuses constantly     this is really really starting to frustrate me is this people low key telling me they dont want to be around me because it sure as fuck feels that way this has been happening for far too long and im about ready to give up on people entirely and i already halfway have
  is this people low key telling me they dont want to be around me because it sure as fuck feels that way  probably
  dont take it personally man they probably cant be arsed to go outside or just lazy as heck
  it can be hard to tell if theyre cutting you or just being stupid about responding try making specific invitations  not who wants to hang out but im going to the new star wars movie on saturday whos coming with me
  sorry bro i already made plans /  next time tho
so i got myself into a very long distance relationship and i have mostly been happy with it until recently     basically now i think about the future i realise i cant see us being together irl even though i want to and she really wants its because moving to a country that is foreign to both of us would be too difficult with language barriers and whether our respective educations are accepted there whereas if we move to one of our countries that means one basically gets to live the life theyre building while the other has to throw it all away to be with them    i dont really want to break up but i just dont see us being together forever so is it just wasting time am i leading her on
have major anxiety issues intimacy issues and emotional turmoil that makes me treat people in a hot or cold manner where i pull them towards me then push them away or abandon them   capable of being extremely hateful and verbally abusive because i feel so vulnerable and threatened and i become rabid because i feel i have to go on the attack to protect myself   girls think im a cool devilmaycare badass    i dont get it they see a bad boy but im just an emotionally broken person who lashes out because im scared of people and of intimacy i feel weak and defenseless not cool    how do i get girls to stop fetishizing my pain and realize that im not nearly as cool as they think i am
  oh anon try to get some professional help or just have a candid talk with a very close friend try to open up to someone you can trust start with small things and go from there and having intimacy issues is still not an excuse for acting like a dickwad so work on that as well
im the kind of person that wants to see results of weight loss immediately but dont want to be constantly checking the scale and worrying any input from others who have lost weight
  honestly its never fast you start seeing real progress after a month id say concentrate on the feeling of relaxation after working out try to derive pleasure from that
  create a meal plan for a day that meets macros and has a 500cal deficit  eat the same three meals everyday   i mean every day  start going on long walks   after a year youll see results for sure
  wants to see results of weight loss immediately  hahaha i guess youd better try fasting then  cause dieting fucking takes awhile
  if you put as much effort into losing as you did as making this same thread everyday youd see results for sure
how do i become populat in school i live in india  i drive a cool car like a fiat but it doesnt help
cool car like a fiat
  cool car like fiat    elliot rodger was at least a 5/10 wore nice clothes and drove a fuel sipping daimler benz coupe and a bmw he wasnt popular either     how about getting hobbies and talking to people    im 21 drive a chiptuned slk 200 and am not popular either since im too shy
  the first step is stop frogposting
a cool car wont help you with shit    the most awkward and friendless of my classmates in high school lived in the rich wasp neighborhood and drove an expensive car bought with daddys money but because he was an awkward spastic with a learning disability and also super conservative and religious he was the definition of uncool     i kept getting random phone calls from him after graduation telling me i was his only friend in high school btw which i didnt really consider myself so thats kind of weird
shes my first love been together for 6 years now  for the last 4 years it was a long distance relationship since i was at uni and she was at home 55 hours away  things got really bad at the end of it we were very distant and at the same time she met her ex at a party which led to them texting   i know all this because when i came back home and graduated i saw her text a blank contact and delete the text straight away i copied the number and went to send a message to it and since its an iphone it said maybe his name  i confronted her about it i was fuming but she broke down and told me she was talking to him out of loneliness since things were really bad she assured me that nothing happened and i was even getting calls from her cousin and mum saying they were really worried about her and that she did nothing  it took a while but i started to look past it i agree that things were really shit between us and i trusted she didnt do anything so we started to move forward  that was about 5 months ago but this morning at hers i had a horrible dream about it and when she left to go out with her dad i went on her laptop and searched his name on imessage  i found one text to her female friend which basically said  i really have to decide what to do here im worried im going to end up sleeping with him  that was a month before i found out anything about it    what do i do my heart aches im constantly paranoid and i dont know what to do do i confront her and admit to searching through her messages if she lied once shed lie again how do i actually find out and get closure  i dont know if you can even help but i needed a place to open up because im really hurting  thanks for reading the blog post like upvote and subscribe
tell her what you feel and that you want reassurance that nothing happened and if she cant you would like her to be honest and let you go
  it sounds so easy when you write it like that should i tell her about the message i read  i think im more scared of the answer i love her with all my heart but the thought of someone else makes me sick
  do not do this if she really didnt cheat this only serves to push her away it will cause a world of doubt selfdoubt  there is no good outcome to this you either trust her or you dont op break up with her or stay
  you can you needed answers and went for it since she wouldnt provide what i said was just summing it up if she lets you go then thats probably because shit happened
  well you have been in a relationship long past where a girl and her friends expect an engagement ring     of course shes going to start looking around
imagine you dont say anything how will you feel in a couple weeks if you think you cant get over it then you must have trust issues with her if you cant trust her or be confident in what she tells you you shouldnt be with her
  well this just adds more confusion since i see valid points in both  i dont want to make things worse and i wish i never read that message now so i could have carried on living in ignorance but i dont know if my head can take not knowing      were not shy about discussing that or our futures together but were both young and ive only just left university theres never really been a point where i could buy a ring and we could move our relationship forward like that
  his trust is already broken he needs answers
  the past few months after it first happened i really had moved on from it and we were in a good happy place of course i thought about it from time to time but i knew that letting it take over our relationship would cause it to die and no good from come of it  its really the fact ive seen this message which makes me think theres more to it than what she told me
  theres never really been a point where i could buy a ring and we could move our relationship forward like that    so why does it shock you that she needs to find someone that can
  if you even suspect this its already beyond salvaging
  this its over
  because as weve spoken about it weve both agreed that it wasnt the time but it was always our intention to be together through it all i mean how could we be engaged if we dont even live near each other let alone together  the plan was always that id graduate this summer and then by january once i had a job and was back to normal wed move in together and build from there  do you really think thats the problem that things are going too slow for her i cant help that i went to uni and she didnt so her life went on hold what was i to do
    you think i should end it regardless  the idea of being without her makes me sick but so does the idea of her betraying me like this and the constant doubt  like i said its my first love so itll be my first heartbreak i dont know what im doing
  engagements can last years but is does help establish a solid commitment
  i really have to decide what to do here im worried im going to end up sleeping with him  realistically you will never trust her again no matter what youll end up searching on her phone or laptop for signs of cheating and it will always eat you from the inside
  i only fear that its too late now fuck  the whole premise seemed far too rushed to be engaged in my early 20s i just never felt this would happen      ive searched her phone when i first found out and then this morning after that dream i havent wanted to do it again because thats the first start of a toxic relationship  but youre right i dont think i can just forget and i fear even if she tells me she did nothing i wont believe her  this is it isnt it
imagine you dont say anything and how you would feel if you cant be confident in what she says and you really cant trust her you dont need to be with her
  i think if youre even the slightest bit suspicious something happened yes you should end it even if its a hunch alone and you dont have any proof the fact something feels wrong is signal enough i would rather end things with someone based on mere suspicion alone rather than potentially risk taking the chance of staying with someone who cheated lied or seriously disrespected me in anyway
  op if your gf of 6 years rekindles shit with an ex from that long ago your relationship is over already hes her bf now and you the ex
  you are a pathetic little bitch     no shit she is cheating on you     you are little children and live almost 6 hours away     stop being a whiny little piece of shit and grow some balls     stop talking to her you pathetic fuck       see what happens when guys dont have male friends or an older brother to guide them they act like you  pathetic     you are opening up on here and hurting because you dont have friends and you are either to young and inexperienced to understand how pathetic your actions are fuckgrow up you bitch     she lied to you and is fucking her ex and you are on here whining how hard your life is how sad you are fuck you     i wish i was there id hit you in your little bitch mouth and kick you in your sorry ass     6 fucking years wasted on dating this bitch pathetic you make me sick
  jesus anon take some valium
this girl i fell in love with feels the same way about me but is extremely scared of relationships and commitment we were exclusive and talked every day for months but she never called it boyfriend/girlfriend she broke up with me because i tried to take it to a serious place yet she still hangs out with me goes on dates with me and talks to me as often as i reply as if i was her boyfriend i want to give her a chance to understand what shes doing and that that its obvious to me how she feels but she always denies that she wants to be with me on that level despite her actions always going against her words i think because her first boyfriend was a real piece of shit that it just ruined the way she looks at things and makes her think that if we were to date she would have to be there for me constantly and she would have to forget who she is as an individual because thats what he made her do she would say she wanted time to herself and he would say that she should feel guilty for keeping him away from her and that he doesnt trust her and then she would submit and allow him to come over whenever he wanted to i think that situation makes her defensive about giving up that level of vulnerability around someone but i dont think she has the level of self awareness to control how she feels about me and every time i give her space she always finds her way back in my arms one way or another    im planning on giving her an ultimatum where i explain my perspective and tell her what i think is going on give her the choice of dating or walking away but every time we have this conversation she gets really defensive and it pushes her away from me again and i have to start at square one what language do i use to make sure that i dont make her feel uncomfortable so that shes receptive to my perspective
are you both 16
  21 her first boyfriend was high school age
  very funny tho
it sounds like she never saw you that way cut your losses and move on seek other girls if she actually likes you she will come back to you let her be the one to seek you out not the other way around dont give her any ultimatums just walk away from her as if you never were a thing in the first place
  no youre misunderstanding ive done that multiple times already and she comes back to me every time she talks to me everyday she is jealous about me being with other people she tells me she likes me shes attracted to me shes attached to me and that i am a big part of her life if she didnt constantly say those things or if she didnt constantly say that she finds finding someone else extremely uncomfortable i would agree with you every time i say okay this is a boyfriend girlfriend thing then she gets really defensive and then distances herself from me until she eventually comes back
  the ultimatum is a bad idea its going to end in a bad time for you both if you corner her and force her to date you that also makes it seem like you were only friends with her to date her you should stick to being friends for the mean time maybe take a break from her and look to another friend and broaden your horizons talking to other people wont hurt because you arent dating after all
  i cant let her control my emotions like this if i dont make it clear to her the opportunity she has i worry that shes just going to string me along and give me literally everything a boyfriend would receive until she just finds someone else i want her to respect and understand that with these kinds of feelings if you treat someone this way and ask to be in their lives in this manner that youre going to have to call it what it is or put some effort into the situation to show that it isnt just about convenience for you i feel like anything else is dishonest and keeps us in a toxic place where friends have sex and go on dates
  also heres how i feel when you say what youre saying tell me why im wrong if i am    if you force her to date you  i wouldnt force her to date me i would just tell her that if she treats me like a boyfriend admits these feelings being very deep and continues to give me that energy that she has to take it seriously and she cant be flippant with it     only friends with her to date her  we were never friends it started out with sex and turned into us being exclusive and talking every day     maybe take a break from her  i still have sex with other people now that we are no longer exclusive i understand my worth as an individual and i dont put all of my effort into her it doesnt make me miss her or want her any less however and it just leaves me feeling like i havent left square one
  if youre not having sex then you are not a thing
  but we are
   i wouldnt force her to date me i would just tell her that if she treats me like a boyfriend    how is she treating you now from what you said it sounds like she just refuses to label your relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend if thats a really big deal to you date someone else theres no point in trying to force this situation if she is really against the thought of a relationship    we were never friends    what makes you say that do you not consider her your friend most people are friends with those they talk to every day    i understand my worth as an individual    thats very healthy of you to do and thats what you should continue to do
bump i want people who reply to understand that she and i are sexually active we talk everyday and she tells me that were more than friends and that it feels like im her bf but she doesnt want to commit but she stays in my life and keeps that energy around and it made me fall in love with her and its extremely painful every time she gets upset with me acknowledging that were essentially boyfriend and girlfriend she says stuff like she wants to be open for other people which is fine as well i dont wish to stop her from doing what she wants but then she needs to stop coming back to me in this way
  spot initiating contact and replace her as quickly as possible the moment she realizes shes lost control over you shell do everything in her power to get you back i promise or she will let you go proving that she never really liked you in the first place
    how is she treating you now  well she just talks to me everyday she says she likes me a lot and is attached to me but that its likely that in the future shell find another experience thats more like what it was like when her and i started which is not very intimate she wants to be open to that but then she talks to me everyday and tries to stay in my life on what feels like a deeply romantic level    what makes you say you were never friends  well i agree were friends the last time we clarified on this though she explicitly said we were more than friends
ultimatums always fuck things up
  i agree but ultimatums force things to change the op clearly wants change so this is the quickest way to do so
  without the labels boyfriend  girlfriend she could easily start dating someone else and claim you two were never a real couple despite what youre doing if youre looking to find someone youll spend the rest of your life with shes preventing you from doing that so you should give the ultimatum if she doesnt go for it end ties with her and stick with it after that either she will contact you saying she will give it a try or you will find someone else who wont string you along and want to have a lasting relationship with you if youre happy with how things are now and know there is a higher chance of it not lasting then keep doing what youre doing
  perhaps the ultimatum could work you could just tell her that you love her and want a serious relationship with her but that if she doesnt want to ever get to the boyfriend/girlfriend point then even though you love her you think you should make the painful decision to try building a romantic relationship with someone else and stop seeing her as often as you do so you can get over her emphasize that you really want to be with her but you cant go on chasing a serious relationship with someone who doesnt want to be in such a relationship with you  also make clear what you mean to counter those worries you think she might have tell her what you mean by boyfriend/girlfriend or serious relationship and that youre not asking her to be there for you constantly or forget who she is as an individual    however say that she refuses you explain the situation and she says that she really doesnt want to make this a boyfriend/girlfriend thing and if you feel that this means you need to start dating someone else then you should  what will you do then will you then take your defeat or will you keep trying to chase her i guess what im saying is that you should only pose this ultimatum if you think both alternatives that you make her choose from are actually better than the current situation and you will follow through dont create the situation where you have given her an ultimatum she makes her choice and you dont actually follow through with it
  stop being a pathetic beta orbiter she doesnt want a relationship with you and shes using you as an emotional crutch
just give her the ultimatum and please for the love of god just fuck off forever when she tells you she really doesnt want to be in a relationship with you and never talk to her again because trust me she will

is breaking plans with friends because youre tired from work unacceptable adult behavior
  its lame as shit since literally everyone is tired from work but you can do whatever you want you can also stop talking to them all together to cut out the middle man and be lame without an excuse all togther
  lol sounds like an insecure bitch that cant handle someone wanting to take a fucking nap after work instead of hanging out with your faggot ass
  this post was made by nap gang
  yeah the entire reason adults make plans is that they are tired from work and want to relax if you really dont think you have the energy dont agree to the plans from the beginning and give your excuse then
  yeah the entire reason adults make plans is that they are tired from work and want to relax  that simply does not happen with my brain chemistry i like hanging out with friends regularly but theres an element of obligation in it for and i somehow get much more rest and stimulation on my own
  yeah most people feel like that thats why people plan these things you say yes if you think you can get more out of it than alone and you say no if you think you cant its that simple in other words stop agreeing to stuff that you do not want to do you are an adult now no one is obligating you to do anything
say im having a lighthearted conversation with somebody  eventually i have to sleep or do something and she always has responded last but i read it and dont respond  then later well strike up another conversation but on a different train of thought  is this normal i mean we arent talking about any ground breaking stuff  or is it rude to just drop off like that sometimes i do this intentionally so i dont seem clingy and wanting to talk 24x7 but mostly this is just how i am for me talking to someone this much is unusual and a getting to know each other thing    also do people constantly text their friends and family about random bullshit i never have convos with friends unless its making plans or saying happy bday and its always a one off back and forth that ends there    i know someone will say im overthinking this yeah kinda im just curious how other people do it if my autism hasnt driver this girl off yet i guess im doing ok
i do this too and have been told its rude with my male friends it doesnt seem to be an issue but several females have called me out on this exact thing sorry m8
i usually tell people if im going to sleep but if its irl shit i usually just apologize and explain why i hadnt responded in decent time
  depends if its a slow conversation then just leave it be if were really chatting then i just say that im going to sleep
coming from someone trying to learn how to hold a conversation over text i usually tell my girlfriend that im going to go to sleep wit a little heart or somethin
having long conversations and making eye contact feel overall intimate to me so i avoid people all the time i can usually be distant enough around members of the same sex that i can find the other oddballs without feeling overwhelmed what the fuck am i
ah i figured as much usually its a slow convo because i take 20 min to an hour to respond and she does the same occasionally well go back and forth more quickly but then i fuck off for an hour before responding and goes back to slow ill try saying if i have to go do something  i just dont want it to seem like we have to chat all the time   what did you have for breakfast  tier conversation
  oddballs  why are you fondling their balls
  eh you know in the days before the internet small talk was something that was appreciated good way to kill time and get to know how a person thinks a bit better you can create a lot of interesting little memories and situations with those shitty little conversations
  even after the internet i used to hang out on aim all day and   brb  if i was going to be gone more than a second  i feel like smartphones facilitate communicating in more places but less back and forth because you dont have a keyboard and it always becomes a secondary activity    im not saying i dont like chatting but i can always take it or leave it apparently its off putting to people
  because i might be a little gay
  its rude to drop the conversation like that you could at least tell her youre going to bed or the next day say something like sorry fell asleep before picking up a new subject
did you guys know that if you cut your nails too short you cant use them for certain things like opening pakcages or other things  just a little piece of advice for my friends yes you
so anons in diagnosed with psychotic depression i constantly hear voices telling me to kill myself my dog and sometimes other people i have violent urges all the time and if someone manages to get past the suppression barrier im putting on my emotions at all times i become a absolute monster attacking them in ways that hurt them the most    its like i have two separate personalities one thats a complete monster that wants to destroy everything and one who genuinely wants to be good and is trying his best to rein the monster in ive done several things to try to control it after losing half my friends during a alcohol binge i gave it up completely and the only drug i do right now is caffeine and prescription meds for psychosis and depression    can i still be a good person despite this monster i have in me at all times im working everyday to suppress it and not let it run wild the fact that it feels seperate from me does that make me a good person i dont know im kind of just venting but advice would be appreciated
  yeah its possible i have the next level of what you have schitzoaffective disorder depressive subtype take whatever meds the doc gives you go to therapy and patience with yourself it will get better
        also are you me like seriouslydoes your name start with b
  yes my name is bitch just like you
  maybe your anger can get to a point where its not so terrible that it needs to be surpressed anger has roots in feeling unsafe for example so maybe if yoi felt safer there would be less anger    you should probably be in therapy if you arent psych meds can treat symptoms but they cant hold your hand through the journey of selfgrowth and they cant directly teach you anything
     yes my name is bitch just like   youjust what i wanted you to say
  all of us have that monster in us not everyone encounters it and entangles with it though a human being cannot be a complete individual or achieve individuation until it integrates its shadow theres no need to try to consciously suppress it acknowledge it and continue on with your life     if youre interested in this view you can look up carl jungs philosophy which deals specifically with the shadow self
my friends have teenage kids who are athletes going to the olympics is it safe for them i hear the olympics village is hotbed for sex and debauchery where there is no parental supervision should i discuss this with my friends

    why is penis size so controversial and important or do women use it in their advantage
  penis size is only crucial if you have a micropenis
  it differs by culture in what exactly it represents but its obviously going to be connected to masculinity and social selfconfidence regardless women dont have much if anything to do with it for mostfor example the penis panic in singapore was entirely restricted to men who were so convinced their penises were going to shrink into their bodies that some even used hooks to save their dicks  the bottom line is a big dick is what your reptile brain equates to genetic capability    also unless you have an actual micropenis or got a transplant from an elephant if a woman is able to comment on your dick size odds are shes a whore

holyshit my mother thinks i was raped and that im some pedo    i was brain damaged from a past of binge drinking alone in my room and recently got better after psychotic episodes    she had loads of sex parties with abos and strangers when i was a kid and abos would constantly come into the room i was playin vidya games to tell me how much of a good kid i was for not doing the wrong thing like al the other kids  they sat around crying for ages and it was annoying    i displayed loads of anxiety and clingy behaviour in my teens and i was taken to a psychiatrist who randomly asked me if i was raped or not and i was like wtf    i got into violent porn becuase a random person online showed me links to weird hentai and i think my mother was looking at all my history oh boy    she also made me take care of my brother and sister while she looked at conspiracy bullshit on facebook    she randomly accused me of being a pedophile when i was going theough psychotic recovery    what do  just stay quiet    im getting an eye test to find out if my lazy eye was caused by her hitting me in the eye when i was 4 or not
she would have drunk parties all the time and freak out if i had bruises yelling at me to tell her where they were from but she kept having the sex parties
  youre beginning to get boring you were told several posts ago to report her to your doctor and to seek counseling for yourself to help you recover from being victimized
i was talking to some girl from a class of mine earlier this month in the hopes of eventually asking her out the problem is that other than greeting each other here and there i havent actually spoken to her since then this has a lot to do with both my indecisiveness and a family fiasco involving my parents  living situation issues happening shortly after i started talking to her ive been pretty stressed out as of late due to it but now i actually have the time and mental energy to pursue her again but im unsure since i think that i put it on hold too long what do you think
  bump
  always go for it you fool
  talk to her first have a conversation before asking her out
    thanks also checked
where the hell do i find girls who are ok with my kind of weird sense of humour and are at least willing to try entry level shit like watching obscure films or popular anime    i dont have too much of an issue talking to girls or going on the odd date but i just feel so disconnected from what they enjoy that its hard to get an actual relationship going and we usually just remain aquainteces who wouldnt mind fucking
  i found mine by taking my time and not focusing on dating  the problem is the girls are like insects and can only be found nearby sources thereof mentality nerds are everywhere  nerds have also slogged through a slew of guys who want a piece because she likes my hero academia or final fantasy or skyrim and tons of guys these days are equally out to put girls down for gaming and enjoying their own hobbies on their own time
i am really good at finding girls like you describe i would say be yourself maybe im not shy about my interests and it makes finding people with similar interests easy also do things you enjoy if your city has some kind of film event or something go to that     if your in college join student groups that are for your weird interests i made a lot of friends that way
  currently in late highschool my hope is that the whole uni/college has more like minded people meme is true my school is really racially divided and me being white instantly makes me an outcast to 80 of the student body so getting involved socially is pretty hard i tried joining the anime club awhile back but before i had the chance to make any friends it got shut down due to low attendance    i used to know a lot of girls / guys into shit that i enjoy but they all seemed to grow out of it by 16
  i know deep down this is good advice i think part of my issue is the social situation i am in back in middle school/early highschool when i was more involved socially i had no problem meeting girls i genuinely liked i was just too much of a pussy to act on it now im just in the opposite situation where i have the confidence but im a social outcast at school most of the people i talk to are friends from my old school who i rarely see in person

hi /adv/  do you think love exists i think i was in love once but the older i get the pickier i get    im with a girl now who is beautiful loyal great in bed and supports me at all times and i still feel kind of empty and that urge to pursue other women    is monogamy something were shoved down our throats but that make you feel miserable in the long run    tbh im considering living a singles life i have type 1 diabetes so it feels kinda shitty having a kid that might suffer from the same bullshit anyway why even settle then     tldr is one pussy forever actually enough
shameless selfbump cmon you faggots i want to hear your input on this
tldr is one pussy forever actually enough  for some people yes for others it isnt and it sounds like for you it isnt or at least the girl youre with is not enough
  i think it exists but i think more people than there really should be force themselves into relationships because they think they cant get any better and feel like they have to be in one    it sounds like your girl checks some of the boxes but is ultimately pretty boring you need someone who complements your life and adds some spice into it not just someone who sits around and is loyal sure you want loyalty but if unequivocal loyalty and support are the only things shes filling in your life get a dog
  yeah im good looking and relatively charming dont think ill have much trouble getting girls then again i might be wrong and commit a huge mistake that is going to leave me miserable for the rest of my life    anyone else wanna chip in their 2 cents
  i might be wrong  yep  welcome to existence     if youre not happy try something different you will also inevitably change over time and change what makes you happy    im okay with commitment but thats just me and thats just right now ill likely stay this way but who knows i might be wrong too looks like we are all stuck in the same situation on a rock orbiting a ball of fire and not knowing what we really want
  i mean pussy is pussy i can even get men who are willing to offer up warm holes    the point is to find someone you get along with sexuality is usually a bit more flexible than personality hangups
  looks like we are all stuck in the same situation on a rock orbiting a ball of fire and not knowing what we really want  indeed im 5 months in with this girl shes 28 and im 27 and i think im just enabling this because i hate breaking up seriously makes me sick to leave someone hurt because of me    any suggestions to do it smoothly
what are wanting from the relationship passion companionship will having other women bring you more joy status you can do whatever you want but just be honest with yourself and those around you
  well pain is the necessary function of vulnerability in the face of the future so if she is hurt theres a good reason and it cant be avoided doing it smoothly just means doing it in a way personalized for you that accepts and understands her feelings and takes them seriously while trying to lessen the blow for her as much as possible and just being nice    it really depends in your situation on what you want
do quadroon kids have the same/worse issues as mulattoes im a half negro and proposed to my gf that isnt of my race im not one of those freakish looking ones with huge black features on a pale face i have a caucasoid nose and wavy hair would our kids be fucked if we decided to have them
  what race is she also they might look fucked up
  white anglo irish and french
who cares if you love her have kids and raise them to stay in shape and dress properly with the right instilled values theyll be confident despite their looks
  lmao dude lay off the /pol/ if you love her and want to have babies with her then have babies with her dont worry about if theyre gonna be ugly
  would our kids be fucked if we decided to have them  no shit    burn the coal pay the toll
  dont sweat it man the whiter the person is the more normal treatment they get as you already know racists arent always keen on mixed people but fuck them if you live in a degenass area full of white supremacists or belligerent niggas then you need to move before having a kid    the freakish people youre talking about sound like albinos or people with vitiligo
  irish   ah shes a mutt baby anyways have fun
  white supremacists  these dont exist  at any rate odds are about 5 to 1 op will be divorced and his identityless kids will be raised in another broken household
  literally retarded dwvvldyqwrt
  with your mentality most likely as youll subtly and passively install your insecurities into them
  kill yourself    damn its a bait thread isnt it theres probably not even a black person here just broken autists shouting into the dark
  your kids will just look white and nobody will tell 
  why would i divorce if i have a stable career and i dont pick fights
  most likely yes they will experience racism when they grow up otherwise they will probably be fine
  would our kids be fucked if we decided to have them  yeah the african will pop out eventually and its bad try being light skin skinny blue eyed white girl with big lips and kinky hair i was teased unmercifully and hit on constantly by gangster black guys and its gross
  the truth is that in bmww marriages its usually the white women that divorce their black husbands for the most petty and mundane shit     black husbands abandoning their mixed kids is a meme     realistically the type of black man to marry and have kids with a white woman is going to be the urkle/white washed type of black dude with a stable job and a head on his shoulders only black men with sense marry out the rest are too stupid to realize theyre worse off with black women     would this black man really say lol nah fuck this white bitch and leave no that doesnt make any sense thug black men almost never get the opportunity to get in close contact with suburban private school white girls thats a meme     the type of white woman to marry a black man most of the time is one of those free spirited lah lah lah liberal flower types these women suck at handling hardship and commitment these are the type of flighty girls that will bail over bullshit hell they might even be bbc sluts that will cheat on their black spouse with another black man just go get her rocks off       thats why the divorce rate between mixed couples is so high the white woman will almost never view the black man as an actual husband to submit to will she see him as a lover absolutely head of the household nah muh feminism
      you also might divorce because her parents will cut her off if she marries you and has kids with you     if she has a job and brings in her own cash this problem should be minimal desu but it will put a strain on the relationship     alternatively if shes got /pol/ type cousins and shit theyll probably threaten you with death    white male family members will try and tear your marriage apart if youve got any black women in your family the result will be the same     if you go through with this my advice is to move to a middleupper class black/diverse neighborhood and buy a gun     dont fall for the i want to be accepted by her family waaah shit tell them to fuck off and start your own mixed race army
  pretty much any dude of any race would find those features very attractive you either live in a shithole podunk town or youre fat
  anglo  just have the kid its already doomed
  skinny and tall they thought i was attractive to hook up with but not to take out on a date and have everybody know come on anon you know how viscous we all are as kids even you right now tried to call me fat
  it is possible to inherit all of your look from only one grandparent however most common is a mix of the looks of the parents    mixed people are generally more healthy and better looking than any pure race less inbreeding even on a large scale where some unwanted features always become common in a closed small population    from a social standpoint there are always people and places for whom and where your kids would be the wrong race the solution is not to not have kids the solution is to abandon the fake notion of race arbitrary fluctuating subset of a species genepool altogether and focus on teaching them a positive uplifting humanist perspective to life
  do you live in the south or some shit     like i know countless white black asian etc who would kill for a mixed race waifu with your features ive got mixedrace female relatives who have to turn down dick 24/7 just like every girl out there and are either in ltrs or married with children     youre not telling us something
  inbreeding  hybrid vigor i says  anon please tell us more about your knowledge of genetics
  the following advice applies in the us  are you brown enough that your parents had the talk with you about cops  if yes and if any of your children are within a couple shades of you be sure to also have the talk with them as well  if no they will probably pass off as any other slightly browns such as mexicans arabs and indians    as to looks  caucasoid nose and wavy hair  doesnt mean they wont end up with nappy hair especially with mom possibly inheriting crazy irish frizz hair just be aware that they might need to use some ethnic hair/skin products depending on how they turn out  so no they shouldnt be fucked  and on the plus side theyll have that slightly exotic look thatll attract whites

a person from work invited me to his party last saturday night  it was ok i had a nice time   i had three drinks and played some ping pong and monopoly with my coworkers and then went home  on monday morning i was talking to my boss and i told him about it  tell him that people from our office were doing drugs they were i saw it  tell him that i saw them doing marijuana and possibly some other drugs but i couldnt be sure about that some white powder either meth or coke  his mood changed instantly  i told him that he didnt hear it from me  he thanks me and goes into his office    did i do the right thing the whole thing kinda slipped off my tongue
lol they extend an invitation and you nark on them
holy snitch no you did not do the right thing that boss knows youre a snitch now
hey  im a middle school student  i dont to be a male anymore  and i want to be a female  i told my parents about it but they dont agree it and said they will never let me enter the door again if i change my gender is there anything i can do thanks
unfortunately not anon you have the choice to do what you want or what they want    obligatory 
  f
  this but unironically
  whats holding you back from being a female right now
  be carefull with what you want to do  try to think why you want to change and think about what it would solve or if your desire to change comes from something else    
  life doesnt get easy if you become a girl  your still a man on the inside
you should kill yourself you mentally ill cunt
  youre a male you cannot be a female
i left university in my 3rd year without telling my parents to work at a startup they had always wanted me to complete my degreei finally had to come out and tell them the truth after they found out that i wasnt on the schools registered graduates website they rightfully freaked out at me for lying and leaving my relationship with my mother has gotten better but my father is still very upset they were really proud of me for finishing my degree since i had difficulties in the past in university they finally thought this would be the time i finished they had already told everyone back home that i had graduated and are so ashamed that they have not told anyone the truth even my little brother doesnt know    i really want to make things better with my father but im not sure how to approach it ive apologized to him multiple times but at this point he just doesnt seem to care about anything i say he has forbidden my mother from talking to me and doesnt talk to her about the situation    it has been 2 months since i told him the truth and i want to slowly start talking with him again somehow i visit home once a month so i should try to take advantage of those periods somehow
bump
just wait until the company you work for starts getting results then try if it goes under youre fucked
  i already left the startup  i currently work at another company making decent pay for someone with my experience

fuck me man im so tired of putting myself out to girl and admitting my feelings to them and getting rejected i feel worthless and unwanted im an offcampus uni student so i cant meet anyone and even if i could thats not mentioning my strict parents    all i want is to find a girl whos an intellectual and emotional equal to me so i can spend my time with her and give her love and affection is that so hard
  mbti is bullshit
  how so
 it takes time care and dedication to find the person you love instead of putting yourself out there focus on living your life and waiting till someone comes into your life    this is how you can find someone you truly love and truly care for playing a game and find someone whos cool talk with em    same with real life go ahead and if a relationship kind of feeling grows inside you then maybe go for it    dont feel so downed by these people rejecting you someone else will come as long as you make yourself available and talk with people with a nice smile    you get the jist of it
  ignore him mbti isnt very useful for science or prediction which what youd want to be able to use a personality test for but the four key traits that it tests are well established personality characteristics your mbti type is sound its just that it has no or very few real world applications
so heres the quick rundown  lately ive been having a stinging pain in my prostate region directly after ejaculating for about 10 seconds to a minute  i think it started when i got into edging for several hours i couldve been doing it wrong  i doubt that its prostatitis as the other symtoms dont apply to me  should i just stop doing it for a while did anyone experience something similar  also for the record im 18 years old
  i think it started when i got into edging for several hours  maybe stop doing that  if it continues see a doctor
its the edging  i dont think it can cause any permanent problems aside from benign shit like cysts but itll cause problems while youre doing it constipation/impactions are among them
    thanks for the advice anons  ill stop doing it for the time being
how do i keep content being single for the rest of my life 
by fucking lots of girls or guys if thats your thing
you cant not possible

married and miserable seen many happy marriages no im living a shit show was perfectly happy before now instead of going after a flirty cute chick im stuck with hyper emotional bitch stay fucking single
  masturbido lotsa lotsa masturbido
  get out of that marriage you cuck
  you do realize that the quality of relationships decline over time right yes they start out well but i guarantee you things will go down the drain faster than you can think of my mom and dad hate each other but they dont divorce and are still together because they know the divorce will have a negative impact on me
im a 45/10 58 slightly chubby depressed socially anxious virgin and socially retarded male my social life is almost nonexistent i only have a few acquaintances all male that i meet up with every three months or so    lets say i were to make a tinder account by signing in with my facebook account i literally only have two solo pics in my profile from 23 years ago both with about 50 likes i also have one life event in it being accepted into med school again with about 50 likes and the rest of the posts on my wall are a few birthday wishes from previous years thats it so bearing all that in mind what chance do i realistically stand on tinder    i live in eastern europe if thats of any help ive already made a chadfish account and ive come across several female colleagues from my uni including one from my own group the group i attend practicals with
why are you asking us instead of trying it out yourself
  you stand little to no chance sorry friendo at best you might score a landwhale
i have a pair of earrings that were my moms who irritate my piercing holes i dysinfected the earrings with alcohol but it still gets uncomfortable   theres a way to properly disinfect them or i better throw them away  always used cheap earrings before and never had problems with infection
  are you sure youre not allergic to material in the earring its not that uncommon
are they slightly bigger or heavier than you are used to are they made of something that you are allergic to or is irritating in general

here you go anon  
have asian tier middle eastern parents who sacrificed everything to bring me to this country just so i could get an education and become successful in life  pick meme stem course in college thats going to be oversaturated in a few years because i didnt know what to domy real passion is history and geography but thats a meme degree that has little to no job opportunities  fail classes last semester  get financial aid cut for this year  will probably fail classes this semester    i honestly dont know what to do i dont want to become a worthless wageslave loser who gets constantly berated by his parents for failing at life i feel guilty and i dont want to be known as that worthless loser by my extended family and friends what should i do
what stem course
  economy
  thats not stem lol but you can find some decent jobs with it if you know your maths of course so learn that shit ideally you should learn some programming too look into actuary and risk analysis jobs they pay pretty well and have decent schedules
  why do you care what your parents think
  devaluaing extremely valuable things on the basis that they are memes  el goblino    just stop going on 4chan and you should see a marked improvement in your mental and emotional wellbeing i guess that might lead you to make better decisions in your life because youll be more focused on reality and yourself than dumb bullshit which caters to your incessant internal bawwwing        dude    op are you still in like freshman year switch to something youre interested in worst case scenario you can find good employment in something not directly related to your degree or at least thats what a person worth being proud of would be able to do your idea that someone worth being proud of behaves like a robot to serve everyone around him isnt even compatible with western culture
  did you not read what he wrote they went through all that just for him to fail miserably he wouldnt want that for them
  but yeah both cultures involve some degree of sucking up to your parents until youre of age to be considered legally emancipated the age for that is also going up about as fast as im aging so fuck
  all this fail miserably shit is just in your head and maybe your parents heads sadly its not a real thing real concerns are more concrete and specific like am i choosing the right major for me
get a real estate license     sell homes   
  they didnt go through anything just for him the reality is they wanted the status of a successful kid it doesnt matter if he fails if hes happy flipping hamburgers it doesnt sound like he cares about anything except what others think of him because of his parents the pressure put on op is obviously too much and unnecessary to the point he feels like he cant have a life he wants
  approach a military recruiter to see if you could attend a rotc university or war college and start a history of war or geostrategic military study specializing in the mena region you get to study what you want get the disciplined structure of the military which will prevent you from failing from lack of attending classes/studying and will solve your financial problems this option will also be considered admirable and honorable to your parents  rectifying your other concerns of disappointing them
get out of my country freeloading bastards
i feel like your situation is better than mine where my parents actually sabotaged my college experience its like they were trying to make me fail
what is good career for someone who doesnt like dealing with people wants to work by themselves and is only about 40 hours a week bonus points if it is something that can be done at home    nurgle is always related
  i am also interested in the answer to this question
youd have to get lucky and write a popular book or something to remove human interaction from your life entirely  that said there arent really careers where you dont deal with other people just ones where you do it very seldom programming is one you just have to be concise with extracting what your employer needs from them
  cyber security/intelligence often allows remote work pays well you are often an individual contributor  heads down working with technology or intelligence if you pick the right job and company there is no overtime or oncall type hours eg dont pick incident response or security operation center type jobs
    anything a little less involved sounds like way too much work plus im not really good with computers
i am applying to grad studies in math but my grades are bad and i can barely get one of my professors to write me a letter what should i do should i do another year of undergrad switch schools and start all over should i work for a year i feel like the faculty at this university really want to just be rid of me    it has been hard to stand out because i am a really sketchy guy i miss a lot of class and dont hand in things the few professors that actually know me a bit say i have the mathematical ability but that i will fail in grad school due to my academics i really want to continue to grad school it would be nice to talk about this with someone
  sounds like your actions and words arent lining up  show up like this shit is important
  yeah i dont know whats exactly why im like this but i want to fix it i have add and really low executive functioning anyway ill have to check back in a few hours
  why are you applying to grad school in a field you cant get good grades in and havent impressed any professors
im also apply to maths grad school this year i did really bad on the subject gre but hopefully that wont matter too much since i want to focus on applied work whats your gpa and do you have any research experience id say possibly work for a year or two in a research oriented job hopefully you know python or some coding language then reapply
  im a solid 32 gpa i think most schools in my area are asking for applicants to have at least 33 with successful applicants having higher i have done a little bit of research with my number theory prof but my gpa disqualified me from any kind of summer discovery grants to get that experience
  in general i struggle to get good grades its not so particular to the subject i would say my grades in math are a lot better than in other subjects    i dont have respect from my profs but fellow students tend to respect me because i clearly understand material better than them and dont look up answers on stack or grease an answer out of someone else when i write my assignments most of these brainlets do lol its cheating but they get better grades than me so maybe im the brainlet
  id say that if you can afford it apply to some lover level grad schools that still have solid research and if you dont make it in work for a year or two so that you can improve your coding abilities and show grads schools that you have a solid work ethic then try again what do you want to study in grad school id say to focus on applied work since making it after grad school in academia is extremely difficult but id deff go for a masters/phd in math bc thats where all the cool jobs are at
  machine learning is really big in industry right now and from my experience my math and physics experience has prepared me very well for understanding it you would just need to learn python which most people going into physics/math grad school should do anyways but python is really easy to pick up as you go
  why do i need coding for math im also graduating with a major in cs as well so i got that whole code thing down plus i know a bit of macaulay 2
  ive been meaning to learn more about machine learning i already know python so would that take me to a job in data science then
  but yeah ive had similar problems with taking forever to do homework since i didnt want to look up the answer as well as being antisocial and not connecting with my professors as much as i should youll be ok tho dont give up on grad school even if you dont make it in initially a 32 is a really good gpa for not cheating on hws it sucks how competitive everything has gotten these days to the point where people feel pressured to cheat so they can get straight as
  yeah i think it would really improve your odds esp since machine learning is suited for people with a maths background vs a computer science one and after working for a little bit you would deff get into a bunch of grad schools and you could try to retake the subject test if you didnt do well during that time as well thats my plan at least if i dont get into a grad school i want
  oh damn youre a double major in cs i think you have a good chance at getting into grad school you should ask one of your cs professors to write a letter of rec if you have good connections with any of them but yeah cs is super important for grad school in math bc all applied research these days requires a lot of coding
  i guess i was doing that already but i didnt think it would help since i want to study pure math
  i havent taken the subject test but i really want to so that i can apply for schools in the states
  if you are a cs double major youre perfectly prepared for applied math research i wouldnt study pure math since you struggled in some of your math classes and you needed to be a god tier mathematician to make it in pure math since the only funding and opportunities after grad school are in academia well i guess what you mean by pure math but id say to look into the research beening done at grad schools youre interested and focus your personal statement are how your cs experience can help certain research groups
  professor in a different field writing here    32 gpa is very borderline remember that grad school applications are dealt with by the department not the general admissions office the committee will look at your grades in specific key courses and then give a lot of weight to the quality of your recommendations those have to say something specific about you not just he was in my class and got an a but he showed particular talent for _____ as evidenced in an individual project on _____ in which his original thinking about ____ was particularly impressive    if you havent found professors to write recommendations its because they cant say anything like that and know anything less would not help you    it might be worth waiting another year taking a couple of grad classes most universities will let you take a limited number without being formally accepted and developing the kind of connection to a professor that will lead to strong recommendations
  this is my fifth year already will it look poor if i take another year
how do i get a girlfriend    id like to meet potential partners but i never seem to meet anyone that clicks with me the standard advice seems to be geared towards extroverts and people who want an extroverted partner im currently working on the parts of that advice that apply to my personality communication skills and the way i present myself but i dont see myself going out to bars and events to get a date that just isnt how i am and i feel like id be cheating a girlfriend if i got one like this college doesnt seem to be a good place to look either     is there another way or did i just not understand the advice
i want an answer to this too i want to meet girls my age but they seem to be completely extinct whenever i go outside walking around my neighbourhood everyone is over 25 and im 20   unless i go to parties or something im not gonna meet anyone i tried tinder but that shit never gets me anywhere     do women even exist
i met my two last girlfriends one of them my current at a psychiatric facility
plenty of fish if you want short term shit or matchcom for something more serious  pic related this is the current roastie im fucking around with from pof
  interesting do you want to talk about it      thanks for reminding me anon shouldve mentioned i dont want anything shortterm   im 19 i dont think matchcom is right for me even if it is id rather do things irl ive heard bad things about online dating
  sure i dont mind i was admitted for sleep disturbances and hooked up with girls there
  not really sure what bad things youve heard it takes all of the pressure out and you get immediate feedback on if theyre interested or not  id go for it even at 19 especially match youll find plenty of anxious like minded people if your city is moderately sized
  same 20 and dont party ive tried talking to girls from highschool that are near me but u dont like it and it never works out want to meet new people just not sure where suppose i could try and make new friends again but its hard when you dont see them often
  i guess but i think id still rather do it irl online dating just doesnt sound like my kind of thing at least not something i want to try out now thanks a lot for the advice though      cool
  bump for advice on offline dating specifically for a long term relationship i should have mentioned both in the op my bad
  long term relationships are just something that happens over time you dont enter a relationship expecting it to be long term you just gel with the person and it happens  if youre struggling to meet new people find new hobbies or events with mixed genders in a social setting with planned activities that offload some of the burden of conversation like softball or dodgeball or something more hobby related like cooking or art classes  if youre in college and you cant meet people youre just not trying
i need an advice there is a girl and i feel she want something with me but im not sure about dating her because we talk a lot and she tell me almost all her problems and i feel she isnt okay to date for me never have a gf before but i dont know if i take the risk and date her or not because sometimes i feel she isnt my type or try to be the kind of girl i would date and sorry if i sound like i have highly standars i mean she body is okay but is more about her personaly than i feel something wrong    should i try to get in a relationship with her as a practice gf
  if youre struggling to meet new people  not really but im struggling at keeping them interested in me       if youre struggling to meet new people find new hobbies or events with mixed genders in a social setting with planned activities that offload some of the burden of conversation like softball or dodgeball  i explained why i think i shouldnt be doing that in the op is it really a good idea     or something more hobby related like cooking or art classes  ill try that out thanks
  ahahah are you fucking shitting me    cross poasting      feminists both the male and female kind really are starting to piss me off    look ive been a nasty little beta for a long time im always shy around girls i dont think they owe me anything and i cant handle rejection so i dont even try    but assuming i do try and then i try to get help for it when things go awry    what did you do    oh i hit on this girl at the gym    what the fuck dont you know girls hate that shit its so annoying theyre there to work out not be a piece of meat    bbut i thought the advice women always give on how to meet girls is to get a hobby so you can bond over a common interest    no they hate it trust me    then i read things in other threads on advice where girls are complaining that guys are ignoring them and theyll be kissless forever    i even had a professor who was taken aback by the culture where i live in which he questioned why the hell the boys werent asking the girls out in the area and making it sound like boys were scared of girls in order to comfort some girl that was feeling blue over that no bf feel    like what the fuck    its like you try to do the things youre told to do by women to meet girls and then youre doing wrong you ignore their advice and youre also doing wrong    so much for internet advice from women on how to meet girls
i worked out what all my major problems were and now i just need help regarding solutions    what is a good punishment reward system  if im not making friends and im doing hobbies should i just do more hobbies  with making friends/connections should i focus on making really strong connections on a few people or weak connections but on a lot of people  if i cant even find opportunity to talk to people in my regular life should i start talking more online/make virtual friends like join forums and make friends online in games and shit like that ive been on 4cunt at least 6 years and probably posted less than 50 times
  the few strong connections is the objectively right answer but the other things wont hurt and congratulations on actually lurking unlike me i larp nonstop
why is it so hard to stop caring about what others think
  its not you simply have too much free time to think about stupid things
  wtf do you mean
  youre supposed to care what others think thats how humans were designed were tribal beings     the problem with you is that what people think about you is often negative possibly because youre not physically attractive and you have bad genetics thats the way i see it
  because its in your genetic code to do so  what you need to do is to stop caring about what people that dont hold any significance in your life think of you and stay true to your own values  you are supposed to care what your girlfriend thinks you are not supposed to care what some random person in the street thinks  and if people think something you love is dumb or anything like that then you say fuck them they dont matter they are not worth my time  its not about stopping to care its about adjusting to what is important to you
they only exist becuase their family is fucked up so how can anyone say the bpd person is treating their family badly when their own family treating them badl is how the borderline disorder came to be
  doesnt matter  theres no way to rationalize behaving the way they do and 999 of the time it is destructive in some way  i wish a treatment or cure could be found but as it stands bpd people are a scourge on the rest of us and should seclude themselves from society
  the idea that its their familys fault is psychodynamic bull the diagnosis of bpd is clinical bull the idea of victimhood outside of a legal context seems overrated imo    id just abandon this whole line of reasoning
  if i diagnose you with bpd will you an hero
  i dont understand this image thats all bpd is
  you treat your family badly because they treat you badly and they treat you badly because you treat them badly its like a pile of shit everyone just keeps dumping on the same place at what does it matter who takes the first shit when nobody makes any effort to stop shitting there
  also i want to clarify lots of people are traumatized and maladjusted because of their despicable families i just dont consider it a mental disease      if you get your info on life from 4chan pics heaven help you
  inflicting suffering upon others is not excused by having had it inflicted upon you in the past it doesnt matter what chain of events made you this way if you do bad things you are a bad person
  bad things happen to everyone everyones family is fucked up in one way or another but we are all responsible for our own actions and choices most of the worst people who do the worst things in the world are influenced by some trauma or tragedy in their past i can sympathize with someone like that but i would prefer to sympathize from a safe distance understanding the source of a persons problems doesnt mean i will allow them to be a destructive presence in my life i have my own problems to deal with
  as a sperg everyone seems fucking borderline from my pov
  spergs are supposed to freak out easily too just for different reasons lots have ocd and social anxiety
  im saying if they are around their family they are being abused by their fucked up family  how can they get better if they are around them
bipolar reporting ive treated bad many people and feel ashamed of it    mental disorder are not excuses for anything they are explanations why people behave they way they behave the notion of good and wrong is foreign to this
  are you stupid bpd is the most treatable of all personality disorders a large percentage of people diagnosed in their teens and 20s no longer fit diagnostic criteria by the time they reach their 30s/40s dbt works and it works well
  i meant with regards to  intuitive unlike you  feels hurt and in pain easily unlike you  experiences stronger emotions than you    and most importantly  more empathic than you reads the emotions of others unlike you  being sperg it seems like this applies to literally everyone apart from me i do my best to be socially competent and learn that shit but theres no instruction manual and im always shooting in the dark    i agree with the social anxiety thing to some extent but cant really describe it cant comment on ocd but i know people have a tendency to self diagnose that shit like mad
  they have to cut out the toxic people in their life if they want to get better or at least go low contact
  it sounds like youre taking the image as factual i wouldnt do that the cult of dsm diagnosis is very stupid    proffesionals not us who subscribe to the dsm put people in theoretical categories so said people can be labeled for insurance and for other people who dont really know them    for instance when i agree with you that youre aspergers something not even in the latest dsm im actually agreeing with you as a layman that you have some kind of issue relating to other people because why would you make that up however this is really me trusting your interpretation because i dont really know a thing about you so you can see the act of me calling you aspergers is really just a social agreement based on very little fine detail or concrete fact    i know people who self diagnose ocd like mad  its more arbitrary stuff some people are more genetically predisposed to address issues by organizing things and maybe compulsively tending to them its called a disease when anxiety pushes the thoughts or behavior to the point that its bad who determines if its bad obviously someone who washes their hands off is not doing well but what about the gray area
  im just some britbong who was diagnosed with highfunctioning aspergers when i was 13 personally im still salty that my mum made me go for the diagnosis as i feel it was more her selfishly wanting to scrape look how hard having a mentally ill son is points than actually caring about what the fuck i want alright it may give some people some closure but personally im sceptical of the whole thing as you seem to be and either way i think i wouldve been happier if i still thought i was like everybody else  not one of those cunts who wants special treatment or anything id rather just suck it up and figure it out on my own but at the very least its fuel for the selfdeprecating joke factory and i can see the symptoms in myself to a degree    like i said its mostly just not picking up on nonverbal or some of the lessobvious implicit cues in communicating with people a lot of the time i can make pretty good guesses but im reluctant to act on them because ive made bad calls in the past and want to eliminate the chances of fucking up as much as possible    the best way i can express it is by saying how i wish real life were more like skyrim  can quicksave before opening dialogue  can quickload back to start of conversation if something goes wrong  can see all the conversation options laid out in front of me  have a quest log to keep track of objectives quest markers to show them clearly on a map  thousands of forum posts and walkthroughs to explain clearly how to achieve a certain thing with almost guaranteed results  straightforward progression and levelling systems  people dont mind repeating themselves if you forget what youre supposed to be doing  its pathetic i know but gotta have something to hope for i guess

  it would be good to know if i actually had the same brain defects people with autism do except not as severe maybe one day science will get to the point of being able to find biological markers because that would be useful concrete information its like with ocd only the people who are moderate to severe can be definitely said to have it    i usually get spergier the more anxious i am i can be very personable when im in a good mood which seems to resonate well with people but then i do have really obvious social blunders either way its hard to tell if the blunders are because im inexperienced with socializing or due to some brain issue    sorry if your mom does that thing where the problem is given a label and somewhat dismissed i think all people are more similar than different even if the ways were different are very stark
  if real life were elder scrolls id probably just use the command console and testing grounds hopefully there would be some kind of system to select which out of the hundred billion objects or sytles of nonplayable characters i was looking for at least there would be some gold jewelry to pawn
    my sister is borderline our family is fucked on the parent side but i have a good relationship with her and my brother it wasnt always like that but its hard to act like an adult in the face of borderline or any other affront when you have no adult role models and are a kid     now she gets help for it and we have a great relationship because i dont take certain things she does personally out of her illness even if it would be extremely frustrating if it was done by somebody else who didnt have bpd     the way you wrote your post makes me think you have bpd  which is okay and yes trauma can aggravate it even though its not certain what predisposes/triggers certain things similar with other antisocial spectrum disorders     though its okay to blame some problems on other people when they create them you have to live with yourself when it comes down to it and should focus on working through issues you have in certain interactions regardless of how you percieve the people in your life treating you i know from experience people with bpd have a hard time recognizing the two way street in relationships and being self critical of their own actions
  no im autistic sort of my mother has munchausen by proxy is what i mean
  im really confused by this thread and this response in particular
  yeah dude these fuckin subhuman normies wont let me loiter
  you think were on r9k
bpd arent human they should be culled as soon as they are diagnosed
  i really fucking hate how bpdemons will call them selves victims right before they start screaming at a supposed loved one for three hours just because that person looked like they were about to start thinking of possibly wronging them    just look at this image it perfectly illustrates a person with bpd doing some olympic gold medal mental gymnastics to justify their atrocious behavior
  jesus
my best friend married a bpd girl in like 6 months of knowing her  disaster right  two and a half years now holding steady    is it possible that he tamed her i dont want to say hes autistic but he has a strict set of rules he lives by and wants everything to fall into line  hes very patient and kind could that herd an anxious bpd into line  there was one time they were dating they went to a restaurant and she stole a knife she said she wanted to kill herself with it he just calmly took her knife and said that she would not be doing that    is their seemingly stable marriage an illusion
  yes your friend should also be convicted for bestiality bpd arent human so hes an animal fucker
made the mistake of french kissing a prostitute while having protected sex yesterday what are the chances i might have oral herpes she used listerine mouthwash beforehand not sure if it lowers the chances
zero just move on if something happens go to your doctor
  very low take lysine and get a good nights rest if you are worried though
oral herpes is fuccin nothing bro you probably already have it from childhood ive never really understood the stigma most people have one minor outbreak and then never again or only with provocation like stress not to mention there are tablets your doctor can prescribe if you want to avoid the chance whatsoever
  aids for sure complete and trusted diagnosis you has it you gonna die
you go to the walk in clinic and take a 5 minute free test to be sure unless youre american lmao
  prostitute patron making fun of americans  oh the irony
hello    3540 degrease scoliosis guy here been having it for like 4 years just because i was unfortunate to grow too fast too much the only time i dont feel pain is when i sleep cant walk too much or play sports with my friends i tried a lot of things to make me feel better but in the end i cant think of anything else other than the constant back pain also surgery costs a ton for my current state any advice   and if you think im a pussy or some shit just move on because i dont care
  find a gonstead chiropractor if there isnt one in your area think about taking a 3 week trip out somewhere to see one
  thanks a lot ill look into it
  medical marijuana
  so instead of thinking about pain ill think about marijuana and basically become addicted
  if you are a person who gets obsessed or addicted easily yes
  lol you must be sheltered you can get addicted to coffee before you get addicted to marijuana
  why would anyone think youre a pussy constant backpain doesnt sound very fun
  im 100 not going to be addicted but ill need it unless i want more backpain
  because sometimes i think about other people that are in worse conditions like not being able to walk at all and it makes me feel like i should stop crying about it
  im 100 not going to be addicted but ill need it unless i want more backpain  this is the absolute stupidest post ive read all year  i shouldnt medicate my chronic pain  because then i would have to medicate to not have chronic pain
  once you begin using medical cannabis it is likely that you will continue using it for the rest of your life  dont really want any of that
  what the fuck is thread  you need surgery  you dont need to smoke weed   fuck
  wish it were that easy
  its suicide  how is this a fucking option  your spine is folding like a man with a shitty holdem hand  there is not a well well just deal with it situation   youre going to fucking die
  i know that but its not my fault i was born in the middle of nowhere in eastern europe where money is shit and and doctors are bad whatever im done have a good day/evening thanks for your time
  if i saw you in person id grab your hand and give you a solid man to man hug   we shouldnt die young     travel west  if fucking parasitic syrian can do it so can you go west get into germany or at least austria   davai
  spasibo anon been studying programming cuz thats the only thing actually being paid here might take 2 more years

  the last presidential election was socialist revolutionary vs rightist one trump vs bernie sanders  it all failed  shit didnt changed the ratio of money between people and the rich is not even 1 any more its 01 and growing to 001 theyre fucking us and elections dont matter    france is doing it now the news isntreporting it all 100000 are protesting and yet cnn or fox has zero stories about it makes you think  fox and cnn working together  hmm
  thats been happening here for more than 30 years but most of us just leave the country and dont care about it the president and primeminister milk money from us
  oh yeah youre right quit bitching fucking pussy
  people continue you using it because it works youve got to be smarter than this
as a kid/teen my dad often emotionally abused me it never got physical but he very often shouted and cursed at me hurt me threatened me and basically just bullied me im still living with him at 18 but i have plans to move out next year when i start uni  anyway the thing is that ive noticed that ive slowly started to forget all the bad things hes done to me but the cases i can remember are all pretty serious as a result of it ive started to become a lot closer to him he is still abusive but something serious only happens every 12 weeks this is giving me a lot of stress since i cant figure out my feelings towards him 95 of the time hes a good dad 5 an abusive piece of shit every time he does something abusive i swear to myself that im going to spend less time with him and seek out his company less but i always forget about these promises which leads to me sometimes randomly starting to act distant towards him   theres also the problem that i have a huge interest towards older experimental music/prog/dad rock hes a fan as well and i can never share this interest with anyone else since nobody else i know cares about it thats just one of many reasons why distancing myself from him rarely works because we share a lot of hobbies and interests    what do  and thanks to anyone who read the whole thing
  abusive fathers tend to mellow out when they get older because they start fearing death and loneliness thats why they alternate abuse with  sometimes  being accommodating or even pitiful remember that the damage he has done to you still persists in your subconsciousness    t son of a narcissist
im thinking of trying to become a lesbian i definitely would want a partner that was more feminine than butchy i think i could be emotionally attached to a woman but idk about sex that thought doesnt appeal to me but maybe if i fell in love with a woman it would be different what do you think
  i was always taught that homosexuality was not a choice that youre born this way but recent years on 4chan ate starting to show otherwise you can definitely train yourself to become trans gay or submissive idk about lesbian    report back with results
  its definitely a choice   will do
i think i am in the same situation ive been feeling kind of weird around a coworker of mine but she is not really my type or sexually attractive to me i have dreamt of her and i feel kinda nervous around her but i think sex would still be better with a man ive only had sex with men so i dont really know myself
  we get it boys dont think youre attractive  you think lesbians will but heres a hint they probably wont either if you have that attitude
  honestly its more of a choice for women men seem to have far less of a choice     women seem to be far more fluid in sexuality and men seem to be far more rigid you often hear about women deciding to be gay/stop being gay but you hear the opposite of men  they try very hard to be straight if theyre gay to no avail havent really heard of a straight guy trying really hard to be gay though     trans is a separate issue its a mental disorder i dont say that derogatorily i think any real serious trans person dealing with it will fucking tell you its a mental disorder those who dont are the attention whores
  but recent years on 4chan ate starting to show otherwise  yeah maybe you should get off this website and live in reality for a little  and this anon is right   if youre just doing this because you cant get a bf then dont getting a gf is way harder then getting a bf  if youre not into girls sexually youre probably not gonna have a strong relationship would you really be willing to stick your face in a vagina   girls like you seem to always over romatize lesbian relationships its not a cuddles and girl time in fact itd be harder than a straight relationship  go for it if you want but remember  your dating pool is much smaller  most girls will expect you to initiate   most will want sex and will want you to touch them  with femmes especially you dont know if they even like girls  domestic violence     i mean i wish i could date men it would be easier to get laid but i know my own sexuallity and i know i could never be attracted to men
im not a lesbian but i let some fat dyke eat me out once and i never cummed so hard at least experience that
  im thinking of becoming a pedophile sex with children doesnt appeal to me but i thought i might try it anyway    sexuality is not something you play at at the very least be aware that there would be someone elses emotions involved  someone who unlike you is not just being a sexual tourist
i tried posting this in /a/ but they are gay fags  i only ever really liked pic related  dbz lupin the 3d one punch man trigun cowboy bebop  i find naruto to be gay couldnt get into aot other than the first few episodes couldnt get into bleach sao is super faggoty minus the first episode  whats some anime im missing out on thats like pic related
this is  not /adv/
  if you want the good shit then look no further than trigger thats not a show its a studio just watch everything they have produced if you want to just jump into the good good shit immediately then    tengen toppa gurren lagann in spirit this is trigger  kill la kill  little witch academia    they also made darling in the franxx and it is complicated but they made that anime bad on purpose
  this
thanks fren
  try to watch mediocre shows so that you can still enjoy other things if you watch all the greats it is harder to enjoy shitty shows
  mob psycho 100 its by the same guy who created opm i personally think its even better try evangelion and berserk as well and ghost in the shell
  you can always enjoy the shitty shows by forcing someone like digibro to watch it and then watch the couple of videos he makes about it you get more fun out of that 10minute video about the shitty show than from the 12 episodes of shit
  just google /a/ wiki  i have no idea why that shit isnt pinned
  not him but i would also say jjba and fotns for some good fighting shows
  gitssac  miyazaki/ghibli  evangelion i guess not a fan myself but worth seeing given its influence  i liked lain a lot too but thats very hit or miss for people  like pic related  oh never mind then
  hunter x hunter 2011    it has according to quite a few reviewers and anime enthusiasts one of the greatest arcs in shonen history since basically the freeza arc in dbz    rurouni kenshin   is from the same era as trigun with a lot of the same cheeky and lighthearted moments punctuated by some extremely serious bits of brutal intensity if watching dubs be sure to avoid the sony dub which i think is up on hulu and was bad enough and so awkwardly cast and directed media blasters ended up redubbing the entire first segment recasting a lot of the same voice actor to completely different roles watch out for steve blum spike spiegals va as the main antagonist of the first arc vastly superior choice to the prior va who got demoted to a minor bad guy    yu yu hakusho   is another anime that hails from the 90s era along with ruroni kenshin and trigun that takes a decidedly more dbz route with an ensemble cast lead by a protagonist thats prone to absurd power ups kicking reluctant bad guys/antiheroes who turn good and with increasingly powerful villains that pop up out of nowhere in retrospect yu yu hakusho is kind of a giant rip off of dbzs core mechanisms under a different premise which is funny because flame of recca was basically a rip off of yu yu hakusho    samurai champloo  this is the much lauded return of cowboy bebops director shinichiro watanabe this sits in the much more zany spectrum probably sitting closer to lupin the 3rd than cowboy bebop but it does have a lot of the same genre mixing and narrative structure and stylistic flare you remember from that show about space cowboys except theyre now samurais rocking out to hip hop and rap instead of jazz and bebop
  heres a good recommendation image of anime i liked i liked everything you listed so you might find something you enjoy
  wait why is dragon ball gt on there and isnt bible black straight up a hentai series there was a battletoads anime what is this list
  sorry i made a spelling error so i deleted my original post    give them all a chance theyre all entertaining shows with a lot to offer
  its a meme list what did you think
death note kaiji fullmetal alchemist brotherhood hxh 2011
  ergo proxy berserk mushishi darker than black claymore kaiji jojo
  black lagoon a girl protagonist is less homosexual
  this guy gets it i mean a straight up nearly outlawed show is on the list /
  try outlaw star    i find it somewhat soimilar to cowboy bebop    maybe space dandy too  cant go wrong with space dandy
good anime    psychopass  deadman wonderland  berserk original and berserk 2017  madoka magica  revolutionary girl utena   arslan senki  kamisama kiss  panty and stocking with garterbelt  c money of soul and possibility   wolfs rain   my little monster  darling in the franxx
  berserk 2017  darling in the franxx  disregard this guys opinion he has shit taste although deadman wonderland and berserk are good
  flcl its soemthing different but its not for everyone

fuck i love everything about trigun    you might enjoy big o    i feel inclined to mention magic kaito because it has that sort of feel detective conan unfortunately sort of drowned in its own fillers and ended up dumbing down the characters for my own liking    desert punk might not be a bad choice either its pretty unique not quite the same feel though
  trigun  shit taste
  full metal alchemist brotherhood is a very great one
  i dont recall asking for opinions but thank you for sharing your feelings with me anon    i like the show i feel its pretty unique there arent really a low of shows like it and between the artstyle transitions and songs i feel its pretty solid there are few shows i feel the same way about as trigun    what kind of shows are you into do you buy into that whole monotagari group    i cant really say ive found myself able to appreciate that series so much as the rest of the community there are very few things the series has done that have resonated with me which overall just gave it the feeling of an wellexecuted animation that needlessly obfuscated its own subpar plotline to attempt to seem better than it actually was    i bring that up because thats what ive found a lot of people to use as a baseline when comparing anime so to save time im just letting you know that i cant really appreciate it the same way    other examples are welcome though my power level isnt too massive but i shouldve seen the majority of mainstream stuff
  cringe and bluepilled

  agreed on psychopass but the sequel isnt necessary nor good stay away from the sequel
jojos bizzare adventure
  just watch trigun again holy cows i fucking love trigun
my dad is a piece of shit extremely abusive traumatized me enough for lifetimes of pain randomly packed up and left when i was 14 contacts me 0 times in the past two years now im 16 and he gives me a really heartfelt apology and wants me to see him i fucking hate him and i told myself id grow and be successful and happy without him but i deeply crave a healthy fatherly relationship being deprived of it my whole life what should i do
if you dont want to meet up then dont you dont owe your dad anything especially with the way he treated you shoulda wrapped it up if he didnt want a kid    if you want a father relationship just befriend a 40 year old man at your future job or something
  move out on your own
maybe you should accept that he apologized but set boundaries and move on i would not accept it if my father was abusively he was never around anyway but to hold onto it could cause you pain in the future im not trying to say forgive him but accept it happened is all
  but i deeply crave a healthy fatherly relationship being deprived of it my whole life  in this case id say stay away from him     also question how much you really crave that considering the best relationships defy labels and material things like what sex a person is or if theyre immediate relatives
had similar situation in my life no dad figure he just left when i was rly young have seen him while he was back home for 35 weeks and gone again for sevral months/years just gone noone knew where he was this happend like so many times couldnt remember one time he come back wanting devorce from mother he get it no prob but hit him hard when i told judge that i dont really know who da fuck he is but not father figure for shure after half year or so he wanted to see me me being 16yo shy fag agreed he was not a ashole so we get along eventually i forgive him but never forget that he left now 26 yo bos engineer got my shit together no worries meet him if hes dick just say meeting is over and go back home apply this tactics sevral times if hes still abusive i think its ok to tell him to fck off
  why even bother what kind of animal fuck bullies his own kin
  you are 90 chance right but seen people change 180 degree sevral time in my life but yeah if hes dad just looking for boxing bag that he will knew after 1 max 2 meetings best thing would be to cut contact and set yourself reachable goals that in your opinion will lead you to your overall growth
  ive seen some dads improve because they were drug addicts or something personal like that if the foundation of the relationship was the dad just bullying the shit out of his kid thats another story and i dont think someone like that even deserves to be patronized
i deeply crave a healthy fatherly relationship being deprived of it my whole life what should i do    probably best to seek that elsewhere unless you have very good reasons for believing hes changed  i suppose you could try meeting up with him to feel out where hes at right now but  extremely abusive traumatized me enough for lifetimes of pain  sounds pretty damning    in my case i had very good reasons to believe that apologies were shallow and meaningless and that meetups or even email correspondence would not only be pointless but harmful to my mental health    depending what point youre at and what you think you can handle it might be worthwhile to meet up even if you arent expecting anything good if only just to alleviate your nagging doubt and remind yourself that its a bad idea and will not work
he used to be a drug addict and i know that he left and got better i know hes changed for the better its just he would never quit doing drugs for my siblings or my mom he left and got a new girlfriend and changed for her so i just feel like he doesnt really deserve my forgiveness because 1 he couldve not been a piece of shit for my whole life before and 2 he didnt really change for me anyways
  makes sense
i occasionally play online video games and since i play games with shit communities i usually get into arguments with people the problem is almost every time someone starts shit with me i end up just going full retard mode my voice starts to shake i stutter my stomach feels like shit and i just come off as an absolute fucking moron i know it isnt really the grown up thing to yell at kids on siege but to those of you out there who blast shitters every day how do you do it maybe it just doesnt come naturally to me
u just gotta shut the kids down using the shit they say against them and theyll shut up the whole game if u rage they just gonna keep poking also try not to take everything so seriously
  then either stop talking in your games or just dont play at all
dont want to share my problems with friends because theyve got their own  dont want to share problems with my family because theyll just tell me im fine and forget about it  too much of a fucking coward to actually kill myself  distract myself with video games and masturbation to keep myself from feeling terrible  tfw currently too aware of how awful i feel to just ignore it
take solice in knowing youre not the only one who suffers everyone is just trying to get by dont be afraid to reach out to friends and family people can be very helpful and understanding if you give them the chance
  i never understood this it doesnt make me feel any better that anyone else has to feel just as bad as if not worse than me plus i dont think anyone can convince me that i can live a happy productive life so id rather not waste anybodys time
    hey op i am in the exact same position and dont know what to do either the problem is even if you say  i dont think anyone can convince me that i can live a happy productive life so id rather not waste anybodys time  what else can you and i really do that literally means the only options is to end it and since you already said you and i are a coward and wont do it were stuck  i guess the hard part is convincing yourself to actually go on because there is literally nothing else you can do
  its just that theres not an alternative its not that its hard i live an empty meaningless existence that i definitely get enjoyment out of sometimes but thats not going to last and even saying well just enjoy it while it does doesnt stop me from 1 feeling like absolute dogshit when im not enjoying myself and 2 analyzing my current and potential future positions and wishing somebody would fucking kill me already
    i feel like you two since were here what are your problems have you pursued therapy at all
  i can relate to explain my live currently exists of sleeping eating cleaning playing video games masturbating going to the doctor to get a bill that says im unable to work rinse repeat   while i play video games i talk to a friend my brother and i very much enjoy my time with these people and the games i play but during everything else i have time to think about what i dislike about life and what it still has in store for me at some point i will run out of money thus having to get a job that would actually sustain me which brings me to the actual crisis of mine i have extreme social anxiety just thinking about even going to the doctor gives me cramps in my stomach sometimes i am surprised i even manage to go grocery shopping  but what can i fucking do at some point it literally means either get fucking over it or just fucking end my shitty life   i live with my brother he is gonna be fucking devastated when i die my mom will be so sad i dont even want to imagine it my dad probably the same the rest of my close relatives will probably fault my mother and brother for it how could i ever do this to them  just thinking about it makes me cry i am a pure failure and i hate myself for it but i feel powerless to do anything about it i have talked to a therapist for a bit but i didnt make contact with him again just because i dont feel like i can over myself     anon please i dont know what to do either but i just cant do it to my family      tagging because you wanted to know
    mainly the fact that ive been sheltered my whole life and cant even fathom taking care of myself especially because i majored in what i was passionate in and basically require a masters degree if i want to get a job anywhere i can make a livable wage not to mention i dont even think im cut out to even earn a masters degree let alone pay off a loan for one im graduating in a week and im not even remotely excited about it side problem is that i think i have the most mild of sexual trauma so im 22 and still a virgin because im terrified of sex
  basically require a masters degree if i want to get a job anywhere i can make a livable wage  sorry buddy   but no     minimum wage is a livable wage even if youre in nyc or silicon valley you can pull it off if youre savy enough    other thing is you dont even need university to make a good wage like i never went to uni and i make loads like top 5 income bracket loads     so drown those excuses and take charge of your life i know the feeling you have like when i was 18 i couldnt imagine taking care of my self but i ran away from home at 18 and never looked back you wont believe how fast these fears and ideas shed off of you ask anyone whos done it these fears only last while you dont start living your life     give it a good think
  journal  it helps a lot and talking to my dog just get it out somehow
  i shouldve clarified i meant doing what i want to do working in museums and shit it just seems like a really lofty goal that im not really capable of i dont know where or how id get to confidence to convince myself otherwise but its something i struggle with even then i dunno if id be happy i have a habit of doing things i think might change my behavior or outlook only to get severely disappointed in myself
its literally killing me ive been a habitual masturbator for over 16 years multiple times a day longest break was maybe four days my scrotum has cysts in it from strain my right ball has a hydrocele my cock is densitized and cums when soft i cum in thirty seconds tops when fucking a girl i have erectile dysfunction i feel like shit about myself    i want to stop and cant bring myself to i can pray i can make myself stop for a few minutes/hour at a time sometimes i can avoid doing it twice in a day but i still need it once a day and that one time completely fucks me up all day    my hormones are all fucked up and my energy is low im depressed and anxious and i no longer know if my excessive masturbation is a cause or a symptom i just know that this is wasted time id rather spend doing other things    i want to stop    how do i stop how the fuck do i make it stop
try to cut it into just 1 a week and go from there ontry to block out porn sites from your browser and delete any pornography you have in your computer
im facing a challenge right now in my life and its bigger and meaner than anything thats come before it i genuinely dont know if itll drive me over the edge and make me lose my mind    im young and naive right now it feels like im not doing this for myself but for everybody else does that mean im societys bitch or does it mean that im learning to become selfless i dont think the reward for this challenge benefits anybody but me and yet i dont want it its only other people that want me to want it    at first i wanted to complete the challenge to appease everybody my parents my grandparents then i could chase my dreams afterwards but thats not enough to motivate me evidently im fucking going mad do i have a duty to see it through how do i know    i want to work in the entertainment industry but it feels like im selfish and ungrateful and childish because of it my parents have sacrificed a lot to put me where i am why cant i just see it through i feel so alone right now
can learning acting improve your interpersonal skills
yeah kinda mostly itll improve your confidence but thatll still help
  yes and some major acting schools like the royal academy of dramatic art in england offer courses to civilians for just that purpose if youre in university and have time take an introductory acting class
  ok act like a guy who can talk to women  hey bby  my names chad champion wanna fuck  are you autistic  no you cant fake interpersonal skills you either have them or you dont  look at any youtuber talk about their school videos when they were socially awkward and when they wrote a script for someone normal to act out the conversations dont ever look normal because the writer didnt get social skills    you learn interpersonal skills by talking to people understanding the levels of communication  1 ritual cliche  eg hi how are you  the safest way to start conversations or acknowledge people  2 facts and information  eg discussing the weather very british  discussing what is immediately observed  3 ideas and judgements  eg i love this song  sharing your opinions works well once you have established a basic level and rapport  4 feelings and emotions  eg that was my exs favourite film/i love the snow i reminds me of christmas with my dad when i was a kid  very personal conversations reserve for friends not acquaintances and colleagues you must have covered all of the above at least a few times on different occasions before you share feelings and emotions  5 now you have peak rapport youre friends
there is nobody who will ever accept me i am too weird too socially stunted too ugly my friends arent real we are just socially bounded out of obligation     i dont have a single friend who shares the same interest as me i pretend to have the same interests as other people to become friends but i dont even care about their lives or hobbies after some years because they never listen to me at all anything i say is always ignored why why why why why why     but even then i dont want to die i just want to draw and draw and draw and escape from this world i actively knew escapism is wrong i put myself into the world ive asked out friends to go out and been rejected numerous times they say people will ask you out if they like you after all actions speak louder than words     what the fuck is wrong with me why the fuck is nobody ever asking me out for fun why am i always making the first move am i such a pathetic human even the most awkward people have friends who ask them out for fun     this doesnt feel right i feel so fucking sick i want to delete all my social media delete all my contacts and exit all my chat groups i want to isolate myself forever if i had more rage i would want to fucking kill all my friends and everyone around me
clink clink  ahhhhemmm aheemmmmmm    fuck niggers
how old are you thats not a derisive question or an insult i had the same problem when i made the transition from high school to the rest of the world you sound like an observant person if you were friends with people just because you were crammed in the same building for hours then yes those relationships are usually fake and shitty when my set of teenage assholes abandoned me i grew real friendships based on mutual respect and interests in their absence please hang in there
  i feel the same most of the time i feel like theres some pheromone that i secrete that just makes people register me as subhuman and i just cant help it somewhere along the say i developed a lot of selfconfidence and i feel good about myself but other people stubbornly percieve me in a negative way even the people who call themselves my friends
i dont want to have sex with my girlfriend anymore shes really pretty i love being with her and think shes really fun but when it comes to sex i just dont really feel like fucking her anymore id rather jack off sometimes does anyone else have this problem this is the longest relationship of my life so is it something that just naturally happens in a relationship
  you should go gay
  i enjoy having sex with girls a lot i just havent wanted to have sex with her specifically in a while
is it too much effort for you i mean jacking off is easy you know how to make yourself cum faster but it doesnt mean it feels better all the time does she turn you on too or is it just comfortable to fuck her now i dont feel like fucking my bf because of some problems in our relationship so i dont want to spend my energy making him feel good it is also the longest relationship of my life have you guys tried new things new positions clothes toys maybe its just the spark being gone
  are you otherwise happy eg not depressed
im 30 yo grad school  im late i know   my wife is 35 and wants to have kids    i understand her but i dont want kids yet i feel like i am not ready since i dont even a proper job yet let alone graduated yet    i dont know what to do     on one hand i like her much and would never want to hurt her feelings on the other hand i feel like maybe it would be better to partways and that i focus on my work for another 10y before getting kids and stop wasting her time
  lmao poor woman
  we met when i was 20 and she was 25 and have struggled quite a bit with life and never really travelled anywhere nor have many friends i dont even know if i love her but i do miss her a lot if shes away for a week or whatever
  not sure if i love my wife  wow  is right
  sorry anon but you are a bit pathetic  the question is not are you ready  the question is is she the mother of your future children  if yes than have kids and have them now you have 9 months to become a man and get your shit straight generations of men before you did this and at way younger ages than you  but if not you should indeed let her know and dump her asap   she only has a couple of years left 5 years is a stretch after that you literally get over 1 of down syndrome chances and perhaps a couple  of other minor retardations and such its immoral to do it well into the 40s    so man up either way let her know where you stand wherever that may be but for god sakes shes your wife you should have pussied out a while back
  we met when i was 20 and she was 25  you feasted on her youth and you wont reward her with kids  poor woman indeed
    so basically youve wasted a whole decade and now your wifes clock is ticking tough situation op  theres a chance she will divorce if she really wants kids
get her pregnant right now you asshole you made a deal
  i had things going well for me in my early 20  then failed like 5 years in a row in getting into school since competition was insane and i could only apply to one place once a year got burnout and depressed got sick multiple times a year    decided to move towns with wife to somewhere where i could get in wife graduated meanwhile    applied to work in new town while in college for 4 years in a row could only get a janitor job     i dont even know what i feel  if its just cause i feel like a total loser i dont see how i can take care of a baby when my wife is taking care of us in the first place im legit omegaloser in life
  dont have kids nigga
never used 4chan before but wanted to tell someone had a girlfriend before and stuff but broke up a while ago and recently been talking to this girl for over a month now and weve both been flirting non stop really getting to know each other and she was really leading me on until yesterday where she said she doesnt want a relationship and we should just be friends we were never going out but i think we both had feelings for each other and i actually feel destroyed inside and we wasnt even going out but this is a million times worse than a break up and i cant make her like me and i dont know what to do
best advice is just to move on as cliche as it may sound time heals all wounds i find comfort in knowing how many women there are in this world surely there has to be one that im compatible with also read models by mark manson it really helped me understood this reoccurring narrative of women just wanting to be friends
should i be working while doing a bachelors in maths in the usa doing an as before the bachelors probably going to get in at most 16k of debt for the entire associates if i dont work at all less than 35k for the bachelors  i think that maybe not working would allow me to get better grades to get a scholarship for my bachelors and to get into better schools so i get paid more when i graduate  my end goal is a masters in comp sci or a phd in econ
just work a bit but not so much in order to sacrifice your grades at this stage grades  low salary rates    with a bachelor of maths and master of com sci you have a great earning potential and employability assuming youre not fucking retarted
  i cant find any jobs offering under 20 hours a week i might just work full time summers and not at all during the school year
  yeah just do that the last thing you want to do is fuck up your grades because that may hinder your future employability potential    also are you living by yourself or with your parents because if you need to make money to live then you may need to take a different approach  ie working 20 hours a week but being able to but dinner on the table
  most universities counsel no more than 15 hours a week work if youre in school full time less would be better  just enough to give you pocket money your university will have an office devoted to finding parttime jobs on and offcampus for students
hey /adv/ lately ive been feeling a bit paranoid and afraid that my parents are gonna die spontaneously sometimes i think in my bed at night that someday my parents will go to sleep and never wake up again  and that there will come a day when ill be woken up and told the bad news     my dad is 64 and survived lung prostate and thyroid cancer throughout his life he seems well doesnt do drugs or smoke and drinks beer lightly my mom is 52 and seems healthy too i guess there isnt any overt health issue i should be worried about but i still fear that my dad will pass away to a sudden aneurysm in his sleep or my mother from a sudden heart attack or something     my question here is is this a normal rational and common fear to have is there any reasoning behind having such a fear how can i mitigate this fear i know that nobody lives forever and i think that im sort of preparing myself mentally for that day to come but i dont think ill ever be ready when it happens       pic somewhat related    thanks in advance
  how severe is your dads cancer
  if youre expecting it it wont really be unexpected now will it
  i think hes cured from it he just has to take a few pills and do some body scans is all
  i know but its the paranoia behind it like how a parent worries if their kid will come home from school safe
  from what youve said i think its unlikely he will die because of cancer anytime too soon
  i have so many people around me that are about to die its almost all that i think about anymore im having trouble justifying anything long term because i feel like death is going to take me soon the deaths are crushing my soul
  my mom died of a stroke right in front of me with no warning while talking to her 6 months ago so you should be worried
same situation here op mom died a few years ago from cancer and im somehow anticipating the death of the rest of the family too i feel like im going to die with them too somehow its crushing me with anxiety and misery because i have these random flashes/thoughts of finding them dead in their bed or not coming back home or being given the news of their death and i almost get a panic attack    youd think this prepares you for it but if it fills you now with paranoia and stress it could prepare you for when it actually happens or it will crush you i dont know what to say op i know what youre going through i think its rather exaggerated and irrational to fret over this like we do    i cant make long term plans because the constant thought that things are gonna change for the worse is plaguing me and i cant spend more time and enjoy them because its like a validation of spending last moments with your loved ones its driving me crazy
  i guess we are alike i always feel like every word my parents will speak to me are their last words so i always feel bad when im listening to my headphones and they talk to me which i no doubt cant hear so i take them off just one example of my paranoia manifesting itself im beginning to make a habit of taking pictures of my parents more so that i would have something to remember them by morbid aint it
  i feel bad for you man no one deserves that of all things      i think its when we grow older and more mature we begin to realize the sanctity of life our our lives and of others and we grow more paranoid or hopefully more grateful for each others continued health  in thoughts and action too bad i took the paranoia route
kinda similar situation i have this incessant fear that im just going to die in my mid 20s and it makes me terrified to plan my life out or make any concrete decisions started when i went to my friends grandfathers 80th birthday i just have no clue how to see myself living that long does anyones know how to combat this
is 26 too old to start going to graduate school    i ended up traveling and starting a few ultimately failed companies after school and i want to get back on a proper career path is it too late to go back to school i would have to apply next october and wouldnt end up getting in until im like 28 if i get a phd i wont be out until im almost 40 did i totally fuck up my life    should i have just gone straight to grad school like everyone else what do i do i want to end up getting a good tech job always loved machine learning last two companies based on that but there seems to be a ceiling you cant get above without a graduate degree
  is 26 too old to start going to graduate school  dude are you fucking serious
  no i cant believe how ignorant you are people go back at all ages for post bachelors education many people are middle aged in their field and need an masters or doctorate to continue rising in their field my cousin is mid 30s in an mba program originally industrial engineer and he says hes on the younger side of people in his class
  im 26 and going back to finish my bs im going back because i wasnt happy busting my ass to make 45k as a field technician if you can find a job that you like and pays the bills with a ba/bs then do that if not then get a masters or phd
  if i get a phd i wont be out until im almost 40      and how old will you be then without the degree    which you would you rather be at almost 40
a phd takes 12 years
  why is she pouring beans there
  im 25 and planning on starting an undergrad degree next or year after next
  she
i was with a group of people a few i knew a lot that i didnt i said jewish media outloud and i got a much stronger reaction than i thought that i should have     one girl i did know goes whoa as though i just whipped my dick out or something    another guy i didnt know goes what do you mean jewish media im a jew i dont know what youre talking about    then like two other guys chimmed in and were like im getting out of here    i was like holy shit is jewish media really that bad then i just fucking bolted not sure if im ever going to go back to that     ive been on 4chan more than usual lately reading all the france shit but it made me wonder how does everyone else on here not let that shit out in public    based on the reaction i got that is not the kind of phrase you can just pull out anywhere    i feel like such and idiot and then just immediately taking off just adds insult to injury anyone else experienced a similar event
those who go out arent retarded so they dont say anything and the retards stay in
  kek i dont have a problem with it i got super drunk at a festival/campout last year and blacked out woke up in fear of having said some /pol/ shit but it didnt happen     idk what to tell you watch your mouth i guess
you basically criticized jewish influences in front of jews    if they are cool jews they will laugh it off if they are the sjw type they blow it up to the moon that youre a hitler type    i wouldnt even bother trying to apologize their reaction tells you that youre better off dissasociating theyll just hate on you going forward
  never mention the jq in front of normies  if you go back just dont mention it again and play it off as a joke if it comes up if they dont know you they either wont remember or will stop caring as long as you dont repeat it
  thats pretty cringey how can you not know to never bring up /pol/ talking points in public
  i didnt think jewish media was that bad i know the really bad stuff shouldnt be mentioned     well now i know jewish media bad     it was the worst kind of cringe face beat red froze solid     theres one girl there im close with i know shell let it go i didnt really know anyone else there i was just a bit stunned by the push back
  keep it up anon call out the jew people are indirectly redpilled when you say stuff with confidence be sure to be able to defend what you say
if they take something like that that hard i wouldnt want to talk to them anyway people get off a superiority compley when they tell others whats not ok to say it has nothing to do with actually bettering the world they just like to pretend they are while ganging up on people like that     in general you shouldnt be saying anything that starts with jew or similar in the real world but people need to chill and laugh at themselves     a few weeks ago after a few beers i said send it faggot in front of a couple friends and they were caught off gaurd but didnt make a big deal of it just said i habe no idea the last time id said faggot prior to that which was true and that was it
jewish media  kushner must die
  you need to get better friends anon i can say that shit with most of my friends and wed laugh about it can you joke and say this stuff around everyone obviously no but its nice to have a group of people who you can it sounds like these people were more acquaintances than friends
  just dont hang out on those boards going to /pol/ or /k/ or whatever is your own fault
  not op here  i say faggot on the regular  i remember i said it at a party once before this whole pc thing exploded and thought nothing of it thought i upset a gay guy asked him if it bothered him he said no and i continued on with my life i realize now i gotta be more choose when i say that shit but its a damn good word
  actually anon they cringed because youre so bluepilled everyone knows the media is under irish control
  they didnt find it hard to lead brainlets such as op with paranoid personality disorders to blame jews while continuing to rule from the shadows  pic related    but really in all serious if you scoffed at either of these posts just realize this is how the fuck you look to normal sensible people
  im not jewish and i think every second you spend being a pseudointellectual nazi retard is a waste of your pathetic existence
    it all makes sense but i just realized    im partially irish    its too late for me boys they got me but keep up the good fight against those damn potato slingers
  oh wait are they not posting these to make fun of those people    i thought that was a meme insulting the people that make these elaborate conspiracy theories about jewish people
      they dont get the joke they think theyre here for real critical knowledge
  i thought that was a meme insulting the people that make these elaborate conspiracy theories about jewish people  correct you can take a collection of facts read these old quotes by people who hated the irish look at all these media elites with irish blood and look at these pictures of presidents celebrating st patricks day and weave them into an insane narrative      how embarrassing  you may want to actually read the post you responded to
  i grew a reputation being that guy who says curazyyy shit so i have a free pass among my friends and everyone else assumes i am high/drunk just call me diogenes
  i dont think you understand what diogenes was trying to accomplish
how do stds actually work i keep on reading that you can get hiv by having sex with someone infected but is it possible to be infected and not knowing it say me and my gf are both virgins do we have any risk of developing something
  stis live from skintoskin or bloodtoblood contact
    they live in the hosts body and transfer to other peoples bodies once the host makes intimate physical contact with them some live in the host forever while others can be eliminated
  bloodtoblood stis are usually transmitted from needle drugs and revecing anal sex from a male some transfer from stool    you can get warts from shaking hands you can get warts and herpes from kissing
  hiv is a retrovirus that cannot survive outside the body and not infectious the only way to catch hiv is through intercourse or dirty needles where the virus penetrates into the blood stream you are rather born infected with an hivpositive mother or you acquire hiv through contact into the blood stream seeing your new to the sex game talk with your partner about the situation use protection with any partner if you dont know because i would rather spend 10 on condoms than raise an 18 year old i wasnt ready for that or if you didnt use protection you definately just want the kid
  stis are diseases that are sexually transmitted meaning you have to have sex with someone with an sti to get it     however some like hiv you can get through other means like blood to blood contact or some types of fluid exchange like sex many people dont know they have an sti because theyre often asymptomatic and people dont get tested
  hiv is no longer considered grid as it has been seen to transfer to males or females there is no sex stereotype it came from an siv variant
      so the only way of getting infected is by getting in contact with someone already infected right    so my gf or i would know if we had one provided were not hiding it right
  you would know you have it because you would have no cd4 cells which are your helper t cells in charge of activating your cd8 cells and macrophages during an immune response hiv would make it harder for you to have an immune system once it infects all your cd4 cells through the ccr5 receptor you dont have immunity and can die from easy infections if your immune system is working for both of you and your both not taking antiretroviral medications than you should be alright
  thanks anon this is the answer ive been looking for ages
  1 get an std screening  2 get a series of hpv vaccienes  3 only have sex with monogamous partners who are honest and get tested after they break up    note you might still get herpes because lifes a bitch
  antiretroviral medications  my partner takes thyroid pills do they count as such
  very basically yeah
  no op if youre worried if you have hiv then get tested you can have hiv for a while and not know or ever feel anything
  no problem immunology is something i love to study 
why do you literal retards ask these easily googleable question on this board i understand questions about relationship/ life advice something with a human input you know but asking this shit instead of googling it is like asking hey when did we land on the moon or whats soandsos birthday they are substantive issues that have a fixed answer especially when you want sex advise why ask these fucking virgins instead of reading what certified professionals have to say on this topic are you afraid it will show up on your search history
  its not homosexual to have a guy cum in your ass if youre a woman is it      google
    from what i read you need a screening only after having sex yet both gf and i are virgins so i guess were safe im not really worried about having hiv i believe i should be in the clear rather about getting it    been googling for the past few days everywhere it talks about hiv as if it appears by magic and i have yet to find a link explaining what i wanted to know
  no but just because it was first discovered among men doesnt mean its a homosexual disease men can fuck women who have it and still get it
gf and i want to have unprotected anal and vaginal  both virgins   how much do we risk
  google  very useful thanks
  my doctor told me not to sweat it
  you shouldnt and taking medication for thyroid disease can shouldnt get you scared because she probably has hyper/hypothyroidism or some shit like that
    he said receiving anal sex from a male not receiving anal sex from a male while being male  you can get it from nonanal sex and as giver or receiver but thats a lot less common
im trying to think of something to make my girlfriend for christmas but im very bad at this she likes miku stuff what could i do
  make her cum for once
  burn
  order her vocalohistory  a tons of miku songs that made history in the scene regarding vocaloid buying makes sense since its not easy to find hq uploads     or the magical mirai 2017 albums a few songs but really good       if you know the names of the songs she likes you can check if they made a figure out of that songs miku
  sorry vocalohistory link here      its a bit pricey tho
what does she mainly like about it the music the designs  etc    imo you can either  1get her one of her favourite voicebank if she dont have one and is interested    2get her an album of her preffered artist    3get her a nendoroid/any figures     and well thats all that i can think of my head atm it really depends why is she interested and what kept her really engaged
  has anyone ever gotten her miku shit before and how did she react   sometimes they like to pick stuff out for themselves
  why do you need to make it are you broke well if youre good at drawing you could make a japanese style greeting card with miku on it
i have a pretty bad case of ringworm on my groin call it jock itch may be and i am way too embarrassed to go to a doctor at this stage i could genuinely use some advice on meds or any other measures i need to take
  visit a pharmacy ask for the best anti fungal cream
  see a doctor    you shouldnt be embarassed did you know  hospitals have very frequent objectremoval operations due to sexual accidents    doctors have seen worse than this and are paid to handle the case professionally they are the one that can help you with this
  go to the doctor dumbass ringworm can literally sterilize your balls if not treated quickly
  infected  knows what it is  refuses treatment  natural selection
its literally just ringworm i get it all the time at wrestling stop being a bitch boy
  just go to the doctor if youre too embarrassed to go to a local where they might recognise you go to the next town over or something    at the very least go to a pharmacy like  said
  see a doctor its that simple
broke up with my girlfriend this morning and we unfortunately live together i gave her 60 days to move out but having to navigate her around sounds so awkward thankfully its a house so i can at least relocate to another room any advice how to handle this kinda worried shell break or take my stuff when shes upset
why did you break up is the house yours is it rented with your name on the contract
  i hate to ask but what was the break up about you make it seem it came out of no where
  60 days  shouldve been like 2 days max
  its a weird situation but we basically live in the mil apartment attached to my parents house felt guilty about it being my turf hence the 60 days the break up wasnt really over anything shed done just dont feel it anymore figured its better to call it off than go the passive aggressive way of forcing her to do it or hurting her etc
  eh in this case id say theres not much else to be done wait for her to leave in the meantime treat her as youd treat a normal housemate if she breaks or steals something kick her out immediately
how much better are oral anal and vaginal sex compared to masturbation
its masturbating without doing the work yourself
fapping feels better to be honest
  yeah i lost my virginity recently and i think the same thing is this the way it is or is there something wrong with us
  virgin myself but what i hear is that the orgasms from sex arent really any better aside from the not doing it yourself part the real ecstasy comes from the emotional intimacy of a woman who wants to pleasure you and whom you want to pleasure
  yea the mind games are definitely more important than the act itself  eg a blowjob is boring and doesnt do anything for me but getting someone to do it is really cool  it is like the most beautiful thing is taking something pure and making it perverted
if you are not having sex with different women every time than masturbation is as good as oral anal or whatsoever
  objectively much better in every way sex is not overrated like so many people virtue signal its the fun of jacking off and contact sports combined theres a reason guys who have to deal with dead bedrooms never say its overrated
  ive only been with escorts  the orgasm itself doesnt come close to a topgrade fap you know the one when youre horny as fuck and youre blindly clicking on your sadpanda bookmarks and end up on one of your favorites those are the best  but if theres at least some chemistry between you and the girl id rank it between a godly fap and a regular one
anyone know of a social media site which has high value for a anonymity
  chans dont xount
  anything on the deep web sounds like you are ready to make the leap
id say mastodon
ill be leaving university this summer  i feel one occupation i could stand to makes loads of money from is creating an online fetish video store since retards love to part with their money for sexual content they can find for free and i wish to take advantage of these vulnerable fucks the fetishes i plan to include in my clip store will be feet soft object crush and ideally pov femdom  on the surface it seems straightforward once youre up and running and relatively lowmaintenance cranking out a 1000 camera or two once or twice a week and then editing it together but how does one    find models who will participate in your clips  ive never found an explanation for this maybe cl personals a few years back but now thats no longer available especially stores that have 3 or more regular models    get established  i feel that for a while my clips will be straightup overlooked and ill lose money for the first few months or so how do i promote my business and get a customer base as soon as possible    in addition how much money could one typically expect to make in a year from around 50 clips produced in said year im aware that my models would probably have to be contracted which will give them a set percentage of each sale and that i might have to arrange transportation as well how much tax can i be expected to pay each year
fellas do you think its possible for you to develop sexual attraction for a girl if you havent had any for her before     have this friend met a few months ago very quickly became very close friends  hes quiet and bad at showing his emotions and he appreciates how open i am with my own over the course of these 3 months he has opened up so so much    we talk about absolutely everything i think he knows me better than anyone ever has before   he has seen all my bad sides and i his and yet we get along so well that neither minds the others     i do find him attractive and stuff and i think hed be just the perfect partner with how well we get along id love to bone him at the least     i dont think hed be against dating but he agrees that theres just no spark theres nothing but platonic interest between us two  ive tried minimal things like flirty talk but he writes it off as me just being an open person normally im used to guys responding at least some way to some of the things ive done so far     he rates me as 7/10 on a good day when 5 is the average girl on the street i have a better body than face that he hasnt seen yet because its winter     he often compliments me on my laugh and stuff laughs at nearly all my jokes etc we hang out every day in call he lives an hour away so cant hang out much especially with finals week we have gotten to the point of bing able to sit comfortably in silence when working and feel great about it
  i just have anecdotal experience ive backed out of a ldr with a literal soulmate because my other ldrs failed and i didnt want to fuck up that friendship we awkwardly stayed friends she eventually found a boyfriend and we lost contact anyway its one of my biggest regrets if youre attracted to him just date him if he agrees or you will have regrets about it as you eventually grow apart but thats my two cents
i dont know theres a girl ive known for a little more than a year but only recently noticed i grin like an idiot whenever i talk to her but i cut that shit out as fast as i could no point in crushing on a girl after that long
  yeah it has happened to me once i knew this girl that was kinda ugly for years and i had nothing for her but years later we started being much closer and then suddenly i really wanted to fuck her
  i know he wants to hang out with me he always laughs at everything i do and like i said he says he loves my laugh hes not much of a pushover yet he always agrees to try new things together and play games together
  what made you realize that how do i make him realize that
  well you have to realize that there is nothing complicated here the penis is basically on autopilot 24/7 i was a horny teenager and suddenly there was this yetunfucked girl in my inner circle however i now that i think about it i remember that we used to talk a lot about sex horny teenager shit i guess it was more that i got horny a lot when i was with her and then penis did its thing so i guess your solution is to start making him horny around you
we have talked about it and he says he doesnt feel any spark for me at all yet he adores my company and loves who i am as a person and we are just so perfect for each other our personalities are just ideal for each other we match each other intellectually so well and we talk about everything and get along so fucking well
  as in we didnt talk about dating per say im the queen of dodgy questions it was something like what qualities do you think are important in a relationship and it escalated from there he said why he couldnt see a relationship with me that it had nothing to do with personality but more that he didnt feel a spark i awkwarded out and was like yyea me too
  he said why he couldnt see a relationship with me that it had nothing to do with personality but more that he didnt feel a spark  eh if theres no spark theres no spark try dressing sexier that can change a mans mind a nice dress
  thats weird i remember that with my current girlfriend when i started i wasnt like that sexually attracted to her i thought she was cute but the only reason i started dating her was that she played an obscure video game i played too and that made us basically spend together half of our entire day every day for many weeks but i guess that was because i was already at a point in my life where i wanted to find a girl who i had a lot in common that was my top 1 priority his priorities must be somewhere else when it comes to sexual relationships he may be looking for partners he can just fuck and keeping friends separated from that but who knows you should ask him
  no as he described it for me he doesnt get people who date for fun to him dating is somebody he would consider marrying in the future he doesnt feel a love for me i guess love is important for him although hes never been in a relationship before he is pretty bot feelings wise hes not used to expressing them and doesnt have crushes or attaches easily we both moved a lot so i guess he deals with it by freezing off from people i deal with it by attaching easily but not being bothered when people leave
  i could do we will have a sleepover on the 21st
  he might get pissed if you try to kiss him or some shit looks like he established a boundary with you
  oh yea for sure his boundaries are super clear i wont try to kiss him if he keeps showing his non interest obviously just need him to give any sign at all that he is hes just so innocent earlier today he said yes baby and a jolt went through my body    he hates anime and would never watch it but now were both watching second episode of boku no hero right now 
hes already clearly told you that hes not interested so i would just give it up
  its just i have a hard time seeing how two people who get along so well and adore each other as people cant spice it up to be sexually attracted to each other   hes never been with anyone before and is super cautious he doesnt show feelings period doesnt mean he as a teenager cant have them     its not like hes not interested in me as a person
  are you sure you would want a person this emotionally stunted as a boyfriend
  i help him grow in that regard personally i dont mind he shows me enough emotional intelligence and enough feelings our personalities judt compliment each others so well im super open with feelings so he can express his with how sincere i am i dont even think its a flaw of his
  dont date people with the intention of changing them
  have you tried asking him if he wants a blowjob
  oh no i dont mind him at all like this he himself wants to change this about him i genuinely couldnt care less but he practices opening up as he calls it and says its super helpful for him
  yea he said hed rather do oral to somebody else than receive just asked
  stop communication red flag
  i think you should look for another boyfriend this one is hopeless or closeted gay
    how come
  no sane man would refuse a blowjob unless its from someone absolutely hideous which you are not
  iv never refused a blow job period id let any bitch suck it but fuckin ya not so much
  no he didnt refuse the blowjob it wasnt me asking him if he wanted one from me he basically said in essence wouldnt refuse one but wouldnt expect one it was when we started talking about fetishes and stuff i dont have the balls to just ask him straight up like that and if i did he would think its a prank anyway
  alright you made it sound like you straight up offered him sex i dunno anonette this guy seems rather emotionally stunted and he might be problematic as fuck in a relationship see how it goes when you have the sleepover try to get closer to him maybe hold his hand lean against him if you happen to kiss then he might still try to distance himself from you because if insecurity and shit youre not guaranteed anything just keep testing the waters
  hoenstly ive met people that are worse he just doesnt attach he never per say talks about his feelings randomly but he has no problem explaining them if i ask   why do you say it would cause problems in the relationship what were you thinking of    i dont really want to ruin our friendship either desu we get along so fucking well
  reverse rape time
  i dont really want to ruin our friendship  if you really want him as more than a friend you gotta try or it will bite you in the ass in the future      what were you thinking of  i think people who are more open are healthier and simpler to be with for many reasons
  wow pretty much same as me  nope polar opposite
  same as me again
  you know i nearly shat myself thinking maybe youre him so thanks for that
  but he is super open i just have to ask d he tells me anything and everything
  what would make you more sexually interested in a girl anon
  smiledesu i dont really care about anything elsejust how pretty is the girl when she laughs  and this boydoes he hate his own photos being taken
  please dont do this to me   where are you from anon got anybody you could think could have made this thread
  yea actually if i fall for someone her every thing spoiler every fucking thing she does /spoiler makes me wanna make love to her be it stupid arrogant shit doesnt matter
  yea but he didnt fall for me d im trying to make him
  not having a sleepover with any girl on any date
  and i love anime  weebjpg
  why you gotta be so cryptic man d   not having a sleepover what does that mean
  thought you were have one
  yea but are you saying you wouldnt have one
slightly related i feel like when youre just getting to know each other its reasonable to expect the guy to make the first move but if youve been friends for a while then the onus should be on the girl to make a move if she wants something to happen since guys are explicitly told not to ask out their friends
  he flat out told me he doesnt feel a spark   i feel that tho he doesnt eyeball me or anything doesnt do anything really we talk and he loves my company but just no spark
  i was just saying im not having a sleepover with any girl on any date so i definitely not the same guy
    wtf is wrong with my sentence building
  maybe hes secretly gay
and also does ya boy hate detest))) his guy friends
  stop bein cryptic and tell me what country youre from     no he doesnt i mean ehh a little bit doesnt hate them just tries to kind of ghost them one of them anyway not both
  this girl has definitely asked him this question most probably jokingly
  aye anon relax jus tryna find similarties b/w me and him
  not from n/s states or europe  definitely not the guy you looking for anonette
  oh yea right as we just met he said that nah never in a million years just shy  i asked him if he wants a gf and stuff and if he wants to experience that because he hasnt before and he said ofc and stuff he said he wants to make himself presentable beforehand he works out a shit ton he can lift me without any effort its hot   my guy is a slav doesnt live there but a slav i bet youre a slav
  me slav nah never in a million years   does he have other girls he talks with   if not i dont see any reason you shouldnt go for it  remember a guy like that always have a crush on a girl definitely there is a girl he wants to be with
  for the sake of comprehension lets call the guy i want to date anon  i think he just has really low self esteem anon and i were playing games the other day and some guy added me on steam and we kind of talked and stuff i told him my boy knows me irl the other guy who added me in game asked if anon cute i said yea hes alright and ended up mentioning this to anon later on and he went like lies
  nah hes in a stem field so his surrounding is mainly guys     there is a girl he finds pretty at uni he said he wanted to talk to her and stuff
  anon is sweetheart no homo    if anon is interested in that girl hell try to get away from you first due to guilt
  well hes not trying very well then because he just keeps wanting to spend more and more time together     theres no way he would sacrifice a friendship like ours for some random girl   hes smarter than that
  is someone else in your friend circle anonette he wants to invite over frequently to hang out with  yea as you can tell im a pessimist
  are you asking if theres somebody in his or my friend circle  well he knows i have a lot of guys orbiting mei have a lot of friends and im social     he doesnt have anybody no hes not a social person aside from me he has two friends he hangs out with but it ends there
  was asking if there is any girl in your friend circle he wants to hangout with
  dont have girl friends that hes been introduced to d
  and back to the original question yea definitely can develop feelings for someone who i wasnt interested in for years just after a couple of months of regular chat with her and her fucking adorable smile and laugh
  keep it that way _
  he does like my laugh he keeps saying its wholesome contagious     the problem is that i think we got the feelings part down personality wise   i just dont think hes sexually attracted to me
  i dont think so sexually attraction means much for him even if a 10/10 babe approaches him hed back off just cuz he doesnt know her personality  i too aint sexually attracted to her but wouldnt mind picturing her naked once in a while
  he said he wont date anyone unless he feels it
  not sure anon is waiting for the right one or melting the ice to 0 bw you two
  maybe if im more earnest about my feelings he will feel the same the more i open up the more he does
  yea the time you two have spent together might not be enough for him  i fell in love with my one after 45 months after being in regular touch
  and with that i take my leave anonette would wish happiness for the path ahead of you im an atheist btw  would check later on if you post a update and will try to reply if thread survives doesnt know how 4chan really works
if he doesnt feel it he doesnt feel it dont waste your time chasing people who are iffy about you or outright not into you i dont understand how someone can look at a person whos not interested in them and say wed be perfect together no he doesnt even meet the minimum requirement for being just okay together which is to be into you in the first place
  cya nice chat anon d       we are perfect together logically our personalities are perfect for each other he adores me as a person he just didnt instantly jump at me and think of me sexually and we just kept making a friendship     i strongly believe that love can be developped over time its the spark to want to jump each other thats missing maybe because hes shy
  only if her ass looks fantastic
  cant change that one his cock likes different kind of girls
  my ass is beyond amazing my best asset      he hasnt seen me without coats yet d   he hasnt seen my body my best asset is my body  its been wintger
  fellas do you think its possible for you to develop sexual attraction for a girl if you havent had any for her before     from personal experience yes    but he agrees that theres just no spark    however it sounds like youre beyond that point    that kind of shit only tends to work out if theres basically an undiscovered chemistry     ive been in a situation before where i girl i sort of knew wasnt really that attractive to me before but then one night we just started talking one on one and everything just sort of clicked and we realized we had insane chemistry that doesnt sound like your current situation though    whats going on with you kind of sounds more like what happened between me and my best friend weve hung out long enough that i more or less knew who she is and the truth is i just cannot see us at all working out because the things i like about her as a friend dont necessarily have anything i do with the things i like in a relationship we even have a minor bit of chemistry and became fwbs for a little bit but i just know as well as we get along and as much as we enjoy each others company her as a serious partner is not something that would check out in the long run    hes never been in a relationship before    oh never mind hes just an emotional dumbass  have at if you want  if it fails at least you tried i guess
  anon why do you not see her as a partner why do yu think it wouldnt be able to work tell me how a person that spends every waking second with me and who i just get along with so well wont see me as a partner    literally all thats missing is that he doesnt see the sexy part of me     but hes too awkward to respond to my intiiations of flirting so i cant do more
  well thats a bad thing then if he isnt trying to dive into that ass as is there isnt anything else to do  he just isnt into who you are for whatevrr reason
  i dont know you i dont know him  i only know what i know about my friend and all i can say about her is that what it comes down to is that we just want and need different things out of life    not in terms of material things but in terms of what makes us get up in the morning in terms of the things that give us warmth and make us feel fulfilled in terms of internal philosophies and how we view life and in so many other small areas that seem minor but that i also know would eventually lead to internal conflictsbecause weve been friends long enough that i know a lot of that shit i can let go as a friend even as a best friend that i see on a daily basis but as a partner i just could not    i love my friend but not in the same way ive come to love my girlfriend with whom i do share all those qualities with    it takes more than things just being pleasant or easy for a relationship to work
  not in terms of material things but in terms of what makes us get up in the morning in terms of the things that give us warmth and make us feel fulfilled in terms of internal philosophies and how we view life and in so many other small areas that seem minor    the reason i say he will be an amazing partner is because we align on all of those   we get along so fucking well same goals same values same work ethic same flexibility to people there isnt one thing i can think we can have conflict on he views life exactly as i do     im an intolerant person yet i dont see a single fault of his as a fault based on who i am
  there isnt one thing i can think we can have conflict on    then maybe that in itself would be a problem people do like to be challenged thats actually where a lot of that spark comes from when shits just too easy you tend to overlook it and take it for granted    that being said theres a point where you obviously conflict his standards for relationships are not the same as yoursor else he wouldnt have discounted you    maybe hes just an inexperienced dumbass whos too caught up in his idea of the ideal to realize what he actually needs and wants but as long as the status quo remains and he continues to believes that youve more or less got no shot    the only thing i can say in those regards is that most often in life to change a deadlocked status quo either requires some sort of blunt trauma or serendipitous force majeure    its a low of the universe though that any force applied is never completely vanished and it mormor less applies towards human relations too so if you try to muscle things it may work in your favor or it may do the exact opposite
  were similar but im not sure that would convert into long commitment well  i can say why you would be good and bad in general i guess but not sure about direct answer like that  right now its more of a gut feeling  to me dating would i think mean that you would accept the idea of possibly marrying that person some day  big i know xd  i really cant pinpoint no matter how long i think why i wouldnt really consider that with you  i dont think im one to date just to have security/stability in life would do if it is something that could lead to further  i dont know man why do people of different sexes stay friends and dont date  i feel like its this unique attraction thats impossible to describe really
but he agrees that theres just no spark theres nothing but platonic interest between us two  as a guy whos been in the same place most of his life have you considered the possibility hes one of those people who would always assume something is just friendly unless explicitly told otherwise  i remember as a teen i was literally cuddling and holding hands with my crush and i didnt take it any further because i no joke thought we were cuddling and holding hands as friends  my bet is hes that and in that case the best course of action is to be very clear about your intentions and the way you feel  he rates me as 7/10 on a good day when 5 is the average girl on the street i have a better body than face that he hasnt seen yet because its winter   dont underestimate how easy it is to make a guy feel sexual attraction i disagree with people who say guys divide girls into girls theyd fuck and brag about and girls theyd fuck and keep it to themselves but its so close to the truth it might as well be the truth  if he says youre above average than he is attracted to you fact    bottom line is i bet hes just insecure clueless or both be very clear about your intentions and dont worry about how do i make him sexually attracted to me if he isnt now because he is
  what do you think of   anon
  it might be the hour or the esl but i cant understand what this post is referencing is this a quote from him after op brought up the possibility of dating  op didnt mention she did that
  yea i didnt ask him directly we were talking about relationships at one point i told him that since he knows me well enough since he knows exactly the person i am id like for him to tell me if he finds any faults in me that would make somebody avoid commitment   i tried to play it cool d
  that gut feeling is pretty fucking important when it comes to mentality in a relationship    if you doubt at the start very rarely do you forget that that existed and that tends to have repercussions in the long run    a few years back in college i remember having a conversation with a friend about these two girls he was in class with the first he was really attracted to but wasnt sure he could actually attract the second was very attracted to him and he believed that even though nothing currently existed on his side he could build it because being the conservative responsible and religious individual that he was he believed concepts like love were things that could be manufactured over time and she seemed like a stable choice who he could build a real future with    i remember sitting in the car with him for nearly two hours as he basically tried to talk himself in to believing what he was telling me but i could see it in his eyes that his gut feeling was to go the other way to go for the prospect that excited him he truly believed he was different and i despite my reservations i kind of did too    fast forward five years and the thing i was about exactly happened he never got over that gut feeling he had that first day and he just couldnt settle down like he wished and believed he could becuase somewhere in the back of his mind he always felt like something was missing    and thats not the only friend ive seen this happen with some to equally neutral ends some to incredibly explosive and ugly ones    thats being said given his inexperience im not sure how much stock to put on his gut feeling maybe its pure naivety but id be inclined to repeat what i said prior    as long as the status quo remains and he continues to believe that youve more or less got no shot    either take your shot in the dark or dont youre not going to subtly change this
  yeeeup and if you spend time appreciating it you may find more and more to like  i also like to point out that building on personal sex appeal is entirely possible    of course romantic and sexual appeal are based on more than just one or two features of a person or even just physical features
  i would like to clarify in advance it is entirely possible he really doesnt see you as more than a friend  look that does sound like he might not be attracted to you but thats only right now  it could be he hasnt considered you as a partner but might if you clearly and directly make your intentions known  it could be he has considered you as a partner but is basically lying about how he sees you to keep things from turning awkward  and yes it could also mean youre just not his type its possible  but i also think you miss 100 of the shots you dont take if you dont be very clear with how you feel about him nothing will happen if you are than something might happen but it could also create tension in your relationship that will most likely be irreparable    if i were you id give it a shot regardless people who think they can preserve a relationship by keeping their feelings hidden are morons they cant theyre already into that person and that in and of itself will reflect in their behavior and create a strain in the relationship that will erode it  you either eat the cake or leave it whole and if you leave it whole youll just end up hungry while you watch the cake slowly rot or youll watch it eaten by someone else with great enthusiasm right in front of you with you feeling guilty for wanting to eat the cake while expecting yourself to just be happy for the cake    how youd go about doing it is a different discussion all together from the few lines of text you used to describe him id say hes clueless and you should straight up animu confess to him but if you want to test the waters first by going on a date which you wouldnt call a date and he would never think is a date which is of a more romantic wearing more attractive cloths thats also an option    cont next post because i write walls of text compulsively
  the bottom line is this if you make your feelings known you might lose him but the truth is your feelings alone already create a strain on the relationship maybe consciously definitely subconsciously so you get to choose between maybe losing him and maybe having him make sweet love to you or definitely losing him slowly painfully but surely  pic related is a realistic depiction of me giving out relationship advice from my dark room
  i thought of maybe on the sleepover putting on some rock pump it up music getting drunk and forgetting my shirt so i wear his over my panties    if nothing changes after i will give it up yea the spark is there or it isnt
  so many mixed opinions in this thread d   i dont really want to ruin our friendship ive never gotten along with somebody as well as i do him /     we have a sleepover and i might  
  as the other guy writing walks of text in this thread i pretty much agree with the sentiments of this post    but ill also add that women actually tend to usually be better at moving on and continuing friendships in situations like this than men are    but then again what the fuck do i know im probably still halfway in denial about wether my best friend still has moved on from having feelings for me or not and i just willfully choose to take her at her word that she doesnt even though im pretty sure both she and my girlfriend have round about hinted that she hasnt      lifes messy and confusing enough as it is    just do the shit you think will leave you with the least doubts and regrets
  forgetting my shirt so i wear his over my panties  see the problem is girls do this shit platonically and then act surprised when the poor guy gets the wrong idea im not blaming you specifically but this is where misogynists come from
    when my best friend dropped the relationship bomb on me i turned it down the reasons i listed are basically the gut feelings i verbalized to her but were still friends and have remained so for the last half decade in fact i think we almost become closer friends after it of course there might be complications that are underlying     but just saying shit doesnt necessarily have to end if things go south
  and so you asked him to try on you right
  i dont really want to ruin our friendship ive never gotten along with somebody as well as i do him /  but you already think of him romantically and in terms of p0n0s in vag00 thats already putting a strain on your relationship at least from your side if you keep it bottled up youre just going to be miserable and sooner or later it will begin projecting itself on your relationship as a whole  i thought of maybe on the sleepover putting on some rock pump it up music getting drunk and forgetting my shirt so i wear his over my panties  ok having a sleepover as friends sounds an awful lot like some shit id think of as a clueless teenager op are you sure you two arent teenagers because in any adult environment it sounds an awful lot like a thinly veiled code for screwing each others brains out like filthy jungle animals  however if there was ever a bridge between the so called friend zone and a relationship its alcohol  not stupid drunk mind you but just liquid courage drunk 100 behind that idea  with liquid courage coming into play touch him playfully maybe cuddle up next to him try catching him in eye contact and kiss him do not wait for him to kiss you he is dense initiate  bonus points for being on the pill    just do the shit you think will leave you with the least doubts and regrets  this living with a what if doubt is far worse than living with the oh he rejected me disappointed being rejected is a wound that heals what if is a wound that wont stop opening for years to come    but just saying shit doesnt necessarily have to end if things go south  no they do not and i regret not saying this myself earlier but if he rejects you it will be much easier for you to come to terms with it you might stay friends and you might even be okay if he meets someone that isnt you  but will cross that bridge if and when we get there right now we need to get that guy to stuff you like a turkey
  why dont you just suggest that you do sexual things together to practice youre having a sleepover which is kind of weird for platonic adults he might be down for sexual play if he thinks it will better prepare him for future relationships and maybe hell look at you the way you want afterward
  oh weve been drunk once   i asked him to go out randomly one night he said he wasnt feeling it at first but went fuck it after spent an hour getting to our meetup spot   think he wanted to go out more than anything though    we drank two bottles of wine in a park   started evening off by asking each other personal questions     i dont really remember what we even did for the 4 hours we were together i remember not being able to stop laughing i kept falling on the wet after rain ground because i just couldnt keep myself up from laughter    kept touching him on the chest kind of pushing him eventually he was like you keep touching my chest     eh he lifted me up a little bit kept daring him to he was like why do you want me to lift you up    even with so much alcohol in our minds there was not one sexual thing from him he didnt do a single touchy thing said a single lewd thing    anyway evening ended with nothing happening he carried me home basically and then ended up passing out and throwing up all over himself continuously i took care of him and cleaned up after him and he was really sorry about things after     he did say i was dressing like i was gonna mug somebody / its winter how can i show my nice sides if i have to dress warm
  i dunno man cant dynamite everything
  he might just be absurdly aloof for all we know he said theres no spark to see how youd react because he cant imagine you being interested in him like that maybe hes asking why you want him to do things because he wants the honest answer that you like him and it turns you on when he effortlessly lift you up    orhe finds you completely unattractive im rooting for you hopefully hes a natural and fucks your brains out on the 21st
  1 you got stupid drunk maybe get less drunk  2 its all about the situation and the circumstance youre going to sleep together literally that is so youre alone in a nice cozy house physically close to one another with no need to worry about how you might look to strangers or how youd get home because its a safe intimate environment  im not surprise autism incarnate over here wouldnt try anything out in the open regardless of how he feels about you this will not be the same at home because outside is cold public and you have to worry about how to get home  inside its warm cozy safe and secure so give it another try but again dont get stupid drunk just get to that point where you feel it working but your motor skills are still the same  and also in the warm cozy house you dont need to dress for the cold you can dress however you want and as youve already guessed this plays in your favor
  sometimes i get overly sincere with him i tell him i adore him and all that he always responds with something like thats pleasant to hear dont do this often     how can he find me unattractive if im a 7/10 7  and hes not one to sugarcoat per say   maybe a little bit but not much       his house is pretty massive and he has a spare guest room for me rage
  how can he find me unattractive if im a 7/10 7  7/10 is good you dingus if he sees 5 as the average girl than you are above average fucking you has crossed his mind just as all men think about fucking their notnonattractive female friends not actually considering doing it but yknow fantasizing about it  his house is pretty massive and he has a spare guest room for me rage  so you bring a movie you watch it turn off the lights for bonus effect share a blanket haha you know as friends and do yo thang  him being clueless sucks but it can also be your secret weapon because you can get very close physically to him without him thinking anything of it  i didnt expect you to actually share a bed but thats not where the action starts but rather where it ends
  i dont actually think he finds you unattractive i think hes in denial he might really want you but be afraid of ruining things maybe you both have the same end goal for your sleepover let us know how the sex was afterward
  its going to be a long time till the 21st to keep this thread alive d
  just make a new thread and quickly summarize the previous thread well remember
  this i need to know the end of the story
  i dont believe that a man that has any attraction will show that self restraint there will have to at least be subconscious things that he will have to do like look at me more often or try to look at my tiddies sometimes i dunno    he said 6/7 out of 10      cool sounds fun for the movie   haha you know as friends  lmao gottem     he jumps back from every little action i do though he questions me on everything  hes not entirely clueless really he will pick things up quickly i think just low self confidence    like he doesnt believe that i think of him as highly as i do  or this 
fellas do you think its possible for you to develop sexual attraction for a girl if you havent had any for her before   i didnt read the rest of your post but the answer is unconditionally no   i get it thats how women work thats great and all but its not how men work attraction is very physical and detached from personality a man knows how attractive a woman is in under 2 seconds there is science on this and it stays like that     just answering your question do what you want with it
  yeah keep us posted im rooting for you anon
i asked him for fun how high he thinks his self restaint is and he said   mediumhigh  because i want to do a lot of bad things xd    he is a very proper disciplined boy from a very well off family and in a very good school basically goody two shoes
  define bad things that might be your ticket
  i asked him what he meant by bad things hes gone off to do his own shit atm     i feel like if i ask him right off the bat more personal questions about him he will realize im writing threads about him because he already basically guessed i was writing about my feelings on anonymous threads hes scary smart    but then again what do i have to lose if hes dense he wont think at all that im writing about wanting him to lift me against the wall and fucking my brains out
  how could he have guessed  genuinely curious
fuck fuck fuck fuck i hate you people    like stealing  high restraint there  anything else  probably what i say to people that i dont know well  youre capable of hating people  youre so neutral  you do have big restraint for people  for your emotions  yea  for people yes  i act neutral and polite to the best of my ability  maybe not enough good shown either  what about people you do know well  i relax more but its still not easy to relax completely  you think theres things youve hidden between us  i comes very rarely or with alcohol d  each time you ask that it seems you want to hear something yet i dont know what  could it be related to that forum secrecy  i post an emote its an inside joke to when i dont know what to say  xd  is that a yes shark  me post a sun  yep thats a yes  emote again     but since you dont tell me what it is i cant talk about it only so many things i can deduce  you wont guess theres no way  i think you have low expectations of me d  but i promise when you do tell me i will let you know truthfully if i guessed or not  its not something important anyway  doubt x    what the fuck /adv/
  ignore this larp
guy from the walls of text starting in   i think were going in circles a bit you know what you have to do and why and weve given you our input  relax chill go about your days as usual and well see how things turn out in the 21st  my last two cents are that hes a blatant awkward man not saying autistic buuuuut so when he asks you what the things you do mean like touching him and shit at some point you should tell him outright its because you like him not before the 21st obviously  in most people itd come off as irritated and cold but from the image ive built in my mind about the kind of person he is i suspect hes genuinely asking this because on a subconscious level he knows he needs straight and direct answers    was actually going to write something about this quick reflexes
        
adv im blatantly lying to him at this point because i cant just come clean
  alright im willing to believe that sorry for the larp accusation  well your dude might be following this thread with a lot of attention haha    dude calm the fuck down nothing good can come off of hasty lies either  a hes caught up on the fact that you shared your feelings about him on the internet  or  b he hasnt  if its a the ill is already done and lying would only hurt you if its b youre going to come off as weird
      if this is actually op who if i were in her place i would adopt a tripcode than allow me to tell you what i think in caps lock because caps lock is cruise control for cool  he knows you like him  he knows it he knows it he knows it  what you two overgrown teenagers are doing now is wait for the other to spill the beans dancing around the issue with the grace of a brick in kristallnacht  dont blame this on us its you who cant go 10 minutes without going well how would you feel about say hypothetically me nnot that i like you or anything but just tell me if you like me not that im saying i like you just you know  at this point you have no real reason or way to not come clean its kind of teenagerish to confess your love through discord but hey that ship has already sailed didnt it  because i cant just come clean  this is where youre wrong not only can you come clean you pretty much have no choice because this topic is already out there and the tension is so thick i can drink it like soup  you could have kept your cool but whatever thats irrelevant now    the jig is up op confess if all goes well youve got a one way ticket to dicksville if not hey rejection happens and when it happens the healing process begins
  i played it off i told him my thread was about my paranoia in our friendship because i didnt want to keep bothering him and hes like if something bothers just ask  what a fucking cunt
  confess  dont
  sure its not ideal but its already common knowledge between the two of them everything after that is just postponing it and that aint healthy neither for the relationship and her own well being    i wouldnt believe it and i bet he doesnt believe it either but if it lowers the flames fine sure  its fine if you can stay calm until the 21st when you go like well what do you think about me in terms of relationship its asking for trouble if youre not ready to make a move  chill dude
  whatd you guess  other stuff   what is it   about your relationship with another friend of mine who has no significance  im calling your bluff  wheres the shark icon  youre a smart guy and im an open book    i dont have it in me to say it at this point in time  why not what do you think will happen  my own insecurities    keeping you updated adv 
  that obvious fishing  mate youre so fucking him on the 21st
  you two are fishing each other for a confession seriously consider breaking the cycle  did i use the word teenagers already because i feel like i didnt use it enough  how old are the two of you
  19
  except for this one hidden thing  what could it mean  op i started off sympathetic but now youre kind of pissing me off
  we both know its fine its implied   i cant do it not after all the disinterest hes shown in me like holy fuck    anyway i said im quick to jump the gun and youre not  he said youre quicker  and then said its better to let it go for now and just go to bed so that is what we are doing     glad i could take you on this adventure adv
  the saga that keeps on giving  you two are a funny duo you better not forget us and report back after your definitely strictly friendly sleepover
  i cant do it not after all the disinterest hes shown in me like holy fuck  whatd i miss what disinterest  are you referring to when he said he had trouble seeing you as a partner because given the character it could very well be lying to hide his feelings
  also how he didnt do a damn thing when drunk at all     i feel bad now i think im rushing him into it i should have let it develop more welp    whats done is done
  gotta make him miss you to realize your worth if you both get along as great as you say
  just because hes drunk doesnt mean he hands the control to his dick  he wasnt sure how you felt about him even if its deadly obvious if theres a tiny bit of doubt a guy like that will not risk it and he wasnt sure if it was appropriate while you and him were drunk  thats why im saying alcohol is a great tool at your disposal but you should definitely be less drunk than what you described there dont enter territory where puking is an option alcohol is a spice that means its fantastic and a game changer if you dont add it by the fistfull just a tasteful sprinkle    anyway go to bed you fucking rascal you
      ill keep you updated friends   i doubt anything interesting will happen next few days   if this thread somehow dies while im alseep    definitively wont forget to report back on saturday 22nd ill use the same grill pépé  set a calendar reminder and all  im pretty autistic too
      im a teenage girl pretty much in the same boat as op i get along with this guy great to the point where after knowing each other for only about a month we know so much shit about each other that were comfortable in saying anything were like best friends we have so much in common and when i dont see him i miss him and he genuinely likes me a lot as a friend but theres just no spark when were talking i guess  he told me about girls hes liked beforeand that hurt like shit and about this other girl who likes him and is super jealous but he finds her super annoying he mentioned that she sat on his lap and he was about to get a boner so he told her to get the fuck off of him so i know that i cant just do some shit like that because itll be super obvious and hes the type of guy to get aggravated by that  its safe to say he doesnt like me and i dont wanna make it awkward because i see him every day on the commute to school and we talk for like 45 minutes but i really wanna make this more cause hes perfectly my type  im also pretty sure he doesnt know i like him but maybe he just probably hasnt registered me as potential partner in his mind  im hanging out with him next fridayhe offered outside and idk what to do  if i keep these feelings inside theyll just keep hurting but i dont want him to know if he doesnt like me because itll strain our relationship and possibly ruin the closeness we have  were just so perfect for each other its a shame he was talking about some girl he liked and how he felt they had so much in common but the stuff he mentioned was stuff we had in common toowhen i mentioned it he was like wow really it just kindahurt i know i cant make a too obvious move because if he doesnt like me he wont like it and i just dont wanna lose him  pls halp i feel hopeless
  if he doesnt like me he wont like it  youre too funny as long as youre not doing anything outright creepy like grabbing my junk its flattering even if i dont feel the same way the only exception to this is if i think youre being insincere  stop worrying
      the unique poster count on this thread didnt change from these two messages /
  its almost like ive posted replies to ops problem and decided to reply again
  who is the lurker with the same problem as me d lurkers reveal
  just low self confidence  like he doesnt believe that i think of him as highly as i do  this is the point hes paranoid about your advances because he cant rationalize that you might actually be attracted to him
  my husband of 5 years has refused blowjobs after i refused sex for a while because fightinh too much tried doing it anyway talking about how much i just wanted to please him etc he was cheating op this guy has a girlfriend and wants you but doesnt want the guilt and wants you to do all the work stop find a better single guy there are plenty if he says he isnt dating or seeing anyone else and wont let you give him a bj hes lying
  jesusyou both want to fuck the shit out of each other and youre both afraid toim sexually frustrated for both of you
  damaged goods theyre teenagers you monster dont project your shitty relationship on everyone else theyre both afraid of their own feelings and scared of being hurt you were just in a shitty relationship
  i have many times the human mouth disgusts me and you can never tell what some one has
  thiskindanot being a disgusting slut doesnt make you gay
  lmao dont project your mommy issues onto older women     this thread has gone on too long and op should stop posting and go sex up the guy or fuck off anonymous has given you as much insight as possible
  hahaim probably older than you but ok hun also i have an amazing mother who i respect and adore what else you got
  uhmm you just have to seduce him he likes your personality already and you say he thinks youre a 7 so just start being sexy/cute around him wear a winter dress try cloths in a store and send it to him you need to give him clues that you want to date him touch his arm if youre alone put youre head on my shoulder this does it for me pretty sure my gf did this trick on me when we werent a couple then
yes when my first gf and me started dating i wasnt that attracted to her she wasnt my type but i liked spending time with her soon she grew on me and started turning me on doesnt hurt that i taught her how to kiss
  now im really attracted to her btw
  lol
  if i keep these feelings inside theyll just keep hurting but i dont want him to know if he doesnt like me because itll strain our relationship and possibly ruin the closeness we have  after a good nights rest im ready to say the exact same thing i said to op even if you dont tell him it will strain the relationship maybe more slowly but definitely more painfully and less productively  once you decide youre going to try taking this forward its your choice on how to move on i suggested op should be very direct with her guy but that wouldnt necessarily be the answer with your guy  it could be he hasnt thought of you as a partner it could be he has thought or is thinking about you as a partner but is keeping it to himself because hes afraid of misinterpreting to awkward teenagers like i was and sort of am to this day if theres the tiniest doubt i might be wrong about a persons feelings towards me i will not pursue it or maybe hes just genuinely not interested in you    from this short post i suspect he might genuinely not be into you what with him talking about other girls but its also entirely possible if we assume his character is similar to ops guy character which are similar to my character that hes interested in you primarily but decided it wouldnt happen between you so hes allowing himself to talk about other lesser crushes  maybe hes just trying to see if it makes you jealous    you will not have a clear answer unless you give it a shot and yes rejection is better than keeping it bottled up and missing your opportunity living with that what if feeling
  hi welcome back to my thread the guy seems a little distant now im cool with it though maybe hes just sleepy and confused ive gone through this a hundred times and this is his first
  it may take a long time but if hes not seing anyone else then its just a matter of time for him to come to his senses maybe he has never dated before and doesnt know how he is supposed to feel in any case just keep sticking around and eventually he will change and come to you
  oh i think now i realised whats happening i dont know if you realised or not when he says one hidden thing thats him talking not me
  in regards to this post 
test
  yeah innocent i was like that thats a tough one he may be into you eventually but he probably has no idea what he even feels for you he probably just expects love is like magic or something you will know it when you know it anyway he might be a lost cause but if youre willing to work on him for a long time it could work out on the other hand he might just not be attracted to you
  no no i understood that i was getting pissed because its the single most obvious hint in the history of relationships  i might be projecting or something but go damn
  are you europe long wall text anon why you up d
  its noon right now and i took some days off to study for a test  look let us know if something new pops up really all this is now is going in circles

please please stop getting angry at me im trying my best despite everything im trying my best despite my mental illness despite my financial limitations i exhaust myself to meet your expectations to try and stop you from getting mad at me but you do so anyway im terrified of approaching you regarding this    you said you were worried that i saw you as i did with x that you were treating me like x you are you are at least x would get moody over whatever and take it out on me unlike you who does that as well as get angry directly at me    i thought i was going to be safe with you but i need to leave where would i go i dont know i really want to die
  you will never know
  possibly who youre talking about which country do you live in
  then its mutual 
  finland aka where the sun never shines
ill follow your lead you always know how things should be i trust you
  ah i got the wrong person then im sorry anon
  where are you from anon
i hate that i cant really trust my gf we have been together for over a year but she tends to be a little on the weird side like shell tell me about people she finds cute and what not i want to think that shes trying to make me jealous and that she wants to be loved which i dont know what else to do we spend tons of time together to the point that i sometimes need a little me time but still i give her the time she needs how the fuck do you show someone you love them i make sure to tell her to give her affection and attention still it feels like its not enough we have sex plenty we do stuff together and still in not good enough    i just want us to be happy why is this so fucking hard
listen i would never write to you of all people but i have to get it out into the universe ive known respectable _____s you have a wife and several kids an apparent cocaine addiction and hired someone to tell me how to do my job who shouldnt be in that position im fully booked i answered out of courtesy from our good rapport i realize you have a lot of pressure but sort your shit out before you lose it all that chip on your shoulder is a virus spreading throughout the company your reputation is bad i say it because for some stupid reason i care
  guess
  what thats all one desires
  thats a you problem son
i want to ask her out but maybe shes just being friendly i dont want the weight of rejection make me fall down
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckk if i dont get it together this time im just gonna kms for real
anime i finally told him i loved him we arent going to be together but fuck i feel better i feel sane again ive been here posting about him for a year and i feel released finally like the world makes sense only because he knows i feel better  if any of you love anyone tell them tell them so you can sleep knowing that they do know
  why is it so fucking hard to get my shit together i can handle being scum but i cant handle being btfo by these fucking motherfuckers shits just fucked man im just gonna fucking fully fucking wing everything from now on and hope for the best because no kind of fucking foresight or planning is going my way
  yeah the darker side of that is unrequited love to where you cant sleep which evolves into loss of interest in everything so all you do is want to sleep your appetite starts to wane you spend all your time with things only for the sake of dulling your thoughts of that person for awhile all the time the thought in the back of your head is they will never love me i will never have them it becomes like a disease you cant focus on anything you think about changing your life completely but you cant bring yourself to do it
i think i should break up with my gf we work fine enough together but why do i have this feeling that she will only regret being with me later sometimes i wonder if she would be happier with someone else  i love her and i want to keep her but i cant shake this feeling  i feel like shes secretly miserable with me that she needs me but not wants me like if we were codependent on one another  this lack of confidence will fuck up what i want i see it coming but changing the course if things is hard  why is this eating at me so much she tells me that she loves me that shes happy to have me but something keeps me scared it wasnt always this way
its been so long since weve had sex and masturbating until i physically cant anymore is no longer working i know im a hypocritical bitch for this but if he ever mentions jerking off or if i catch him im going to fucking lose it
my sisters boyfriend is better than me in every conceivable way and i resent him for it despite knowing that there isnt much i can do about it hes taller better looking more sociable funnier more confident harder working smarter and just an overall better person than me
i hate my sisters boyfriend all they do is fuck and fight loudly   im stuck living with her for a while and i just cant fucking stand it i cant complain either because its either this or the street   but all they ever do is lock themselves in their room and loudly fuck for 6 hours and intermittently yell at each other i can only assume meth or coke is involved how the fuck can one man screw for that long    i truly hate this i want to leave but until i get a call back from a job i cant
  we all know that men love to have sex/orgasm as much as they can   have you considered asking him like directly   he may think that you would not be responsive if he made a move so he doesnt try
  im just gonna fucking fully fucking wing everything from now on and hope for the best because no kind of fucking foresight or planning is going my way  dont do this  i fucked up my second chance at college because of this attitude i passed and with pretty good grades but i could have been the best i coulda been a contenda old reference for you kids out there
    this is cruel of you to those of us you just want to walk away from our love interests
i pimped him out
  i appreciate you for reminding me of this i saw the scene ages ago but not the full thing
i dont know who this guy is thats writing me love messages how does he know me it must be from a site i used to go to because there are constant references who are these people
  i know anon i know my best friend cut all contact with me because i said i wanted to start a relationship with her after i realized my feelings were more than platonic really seemed like hers were too after a month of not talking she called me on monday wanting to talk face to face i was heading to work at the time so i asked to hang out on tuesday i havent heard from her since what the fuck am i supposed to do its all i can think about i fucking hate this
  you should feel good unless hes gay then feel bad
i feel so disconnected from you i knew this would happen one day but it hurts more than imagined
i dont think ive never wanted anything more than for you to want me i dont think ive ever craved anything so desperately and i know youre in a relationship so thats never going to happen but i also dont want to feel differently i dont want to have feelings for someone else
im gonna keep at it as long as it takes im no longer going to try to manage my time cut my life i pieces this is my last resort
  how did he react
i want snugs mother fuckers    you dumb fucking bitches love me already holy shit
i want to move to the mid west work a shit job and become a drug addict and hopefully od and die soon afterwords i dont get what the fucking point to living is anymore i dont wanna live here    why did this bullshit happen heres some fucking advice never tell anyone in this world how your feeling from now on im keeping it all to myself until the day i die
  he said he loved me too and we finally opened up on communication about some things that we hadnt talked about before we cant be together because our mental health is both bad and we are both the type to just indulge in our symptoms and substance abuse if we started dating some one
  suffocation no breathing dont give a fuck if i cut my arm bleeding
  would it be wrong would it be right if i took my life tonight chances are dynamite
  iktf
  yes but apparently you didnt
  losing my mind wishing someone would tell me im fine
gotta say i feel ahead of so many people in this board i think i suffered enough to feel fine with life i wont say im perfect or anything but my mental state is pretty peaceful all the knowledge and wisdom ive gotten over the years has been useful maybe im full of shit but thats how it feels    keeping shit simple and not caring goes a long way
please god help me forget him make this pain go away
  thats exactly it  as you grow older all that bullshit becomes almost nostalgic  all the fucking teens here will think no im the exception ill feel this way forever  ok i understand we felt the same
i will never be interested in womanizers never have never will when i was 13 the most popular goodlooking guy in school liked me he went through a lot of girls i rejected him and it sent shock waves through the school i wont put up with stupid guys like that
    im not even close to being a teen some people have no empathy and cant understand that others maybe lost family members maybe lost their job are disabled etc etc you have no idea
  nothings all right nothing is fine
    you are baiting karma now good luck with that
now i wont be able to sleep
i want to beat his face in i want to see blood on my fists
be me  high school  i had a dumb joke with a girl that whenever i would pass her in a hallway wed say what up in a funny voice  eventually i decided to talk to her   after becoming good friends she revealed to me that she wanted to be trans and that she had tryed to kill herself  she showed me the scars on both of her wrists  me being shocked and not knowing what to say spurged out and said sideways for attention longways for results  she was taken aback by this and walked away  she stopped talking to me after that and whenever we did talk it was always awkward   towards the end of the year she became even more defensive and closed in and eventually she stopped coming to class    i never saw her after that and some people said she moved to another school but i still dont know what to think i still think of her daily and i always remember what i said to her
  only an idiot thinks they matter and change peoples lives
i love you v
i dont know you but i want you to know that i love whats in your heart
i think im already in love with you actually just please dont be him    i want to forget him
  bitterness and regret lol
  im turning 30 in a few weeks no bf no kids i need to find a good man and reproduce asap what do    should i just have a onenight stand with a nice guy when im ovulating im quite religious and i pray that gd forgives me but im at my breaking point
i hate my friends and myself but also enjoy myself is there something wrong with me or what
im obsessed with a girl i dont know at all and have only actually seen about 8 times not spoken to just saw around town she works at a grocery store thats close to where i live i avoid going there at all anymore so that i dont become known as that creepy guy who stares she may be the most attractive person ive ever seen so id imagine shes seen her fair share of creeps and i want to avoid becoming one of them i know posts like this are common on this board but im worried i may be actually mentally ill
  i know youre a meme fuck off
  look for a husband youre not getting any younger
i have a borderline irrational distain for sex promiscuity and everything surrounding it i even told a guy that i hope he dies and burns in hell when he was bragging about hookups he had    nothing else repulses me so much that i just immediately hate the person with passion     of course its compounded by the fact that this is most people so i utterly despise almost everyone and will never meet a girl who feels remotely the same
  i like you
im not going to delude myself into thinking you want me to talk to you no matter if you make it seem that way  ive deluded myself enough regarding you if you wanted to talk to me well we wouldnt be in this mess right now but i suppose i cant say we either as you dont care so i guess its just me in this mess i love you you make me ill
  i do but i dont even know who you are    i feel who you are but i need to see to believe
  i feel like everyone is always watching me and everyone knows my thoughts
just let me go please     stop this nonsense
  have you told them this
you made a mockery of me     im not a bimbo im not an animal
you changed everything to mock me
  j
  tfw have bimbo fetish  pls talk more
    too bad
ive had sexual dreams about a coworker recently and try to avoid all possible contact with her because of that
  no i actually have no idea who they exactly are theyve hidden from me sorry for rping
    no im not a j
  how did he make a mockery of you
  pump and dump is a bad idea for all parties especially the child a baby isnt a plaything
youre a fucking whore for telling me you loved me while you were talking to another man behind my back
     i dont talk to anyone
  talk 2 me bb
im about to start a career that i am excited about but i cant help but feel im giving up my dream to do so only maybe not really the short of it is ive loved filmmaking since i was a preteen i made countless silly backyard movies with my neighborhood friends and cousins and i always wanted to make a life out of it so i went to college for it spent 8 years getting my 4 year lol and enjoyed myself i got to make some cool films meet some great people and even work on some actual hollywood stuff along with tv and netflix stuff was a lot of fun but i always loved the indie scene     now that ive graduated i have an upcoming job at a community college teaching video production and filmmaking in addition to of all things a ministry job that i also love and have found much meaning in i am very excited about teaching my passion to others working with video etc but i just cant help but feel like im giving up my dreams of making movies like really making movies producing films that get people to feel emotions tell stories that resonate with people and that i can be proud of even maybe especially independent stuff  low budget simple stories all that artsy fartsy stuff     i also recently came out as gay and thats been kind of tumultuous not to mention having the postgraduation blues missing school campus the people even the shitty parts of it im back in my parents house for the time being and i miss my shit apartment that smelled like the vietnamese couples food cooking downstairs and the pot from the dude next door the view from out my bedroom window that looked out on basically just a bunch of trees but they were my trees seeing my friends often and exploring my college town    i feel like im content and im happy and very fortunate to have a pretty decent job doing work i find meaningful but also i feel very sad and melancholy like theres so much i want to do but that i just cant do it
our current trajectory suggests that well never end up talking again you chose this and unless you do something about it the next time our paths part will be the last a sullen last goodbye forever but without the goodbye
      no you called me a whore
      okay bye
  bye ill always remember you
    great thanks
anyone who loved me wouldnt do this to me
    what happened
i wish my cousin didnt have to die he was too young its been 7 years
im getting bad and obsessing again this girl i matched with on tinder was clearly into me 2 years ago i kind of have a loose association with her in real life but dont know her personally outside of tinder my obsessive side tells me i should send her a facebook message but i know thats weird and creepy i just wish i knew a way to get these obsessive thoughts to stop any tips
  they could if you hurt them
    he humiliated me in public
  im sorry man
  how be more specific
    send her a message and be done with it
    comparison to dumb bitches and animals
  but thats fuckin weird dude i wouldnt even know what to say or how to justify it
  that doesnt explain anything
  what nonsense
    just comment on a post and go from there
  me an you kiddo
  just comment on a post  oh were not friends on fb id have to message her directly
girl i was pursuing has a boyfriend  if im not getting rejected or left on read then its this i just dont know anymore if its the guy i think it is at least attraction isnt all about looks so from that angle i have some kind of chance someday
in my entire life i have never felt so alone i have never hated myself so much i have never believed so little in what im capable of achieving and i have never trusted so little in people i love and care for as i do right now     i have so much inside that cant be transformed in anything productive and im afraid of what happens when someone loses their perspective completely
jesus christ looking back ive been living life like an asshole no wonder i have no friends
  there will be other women
    oh right i havent used it for a while well you know her from around town if so just say hi you look familiar do i if she says no joke and say you wouldnt remember you eitherand take it from there
its strange how when he is not doing good i am and vice versa
  yeah plenty of fish in the sea means little when youre shrimp
  well you know her from around town  from tinder i mean i did see her at my work back in like march and apparently we went to the same middle school together because i was looking up a teachers name in the year book and she was there but i dont know if that gives me enough justification to message her
  me at like 25  fuck being a teenager
i want to fight the asshole my sister is fucking now  i am drunk as hell i am reduced to listening to them rut like animals slap flesh like beasts echoing in the apartment  ive never seen his face if i ever did i think id straight aattaack him and i think my sister knows this she hushes him into our apartment in silence its ironic that he comes inside quiet but comes inside her like a bellowing fucing animal    i want to fight him i want him to make him eat his fucking own fucking sounds
every time theres a woman i really dig which is not often but still every single time in the last 11 years it turns out shes a lesbian    im cursed i really want to talk to that friendly sad looking girl who works at the gas station but im scared that if i do some mysterious force will travel back in time to her early adolescence and make her gay just to piss me off here in current time
    do you want to fuck your sister is that the real problem
why does it always have to turn out like this im tired of the drama
you ever realize that youre just not cut out for relationships or sex how do you deal with that
  fuck off retard i want to see my sister happy  and shes fucking this up shes too old to be this stupid     i want that asshole to contront me and i want him to baet my glass into his head tell him to fuck off and never come back
  im 29 now i realized that a few years ago   i feel happy about it women are not rational emotional    i live my own life with no one else having an input
  i mean most people are somewhere between rational and emotional i dont have a problem with that
  was your post meant for someone in this thread
  most people are somewhere between rational and emotional  thats true  but with women youll find out just how far that goes  i had a dream you had sex with another woman  i couldnt find the canopener you were hiding it from me   im ugly arent i dont respond i know youre lying    dont deal with women you will understand me one day if you do
  itll never be good enough  thats the truth
    i give up dont worry about it
  buy a sex doll  keep women at a distance acquaintances
  i have a sister and a mother i know how women can be but at the end of the day theyre all just people people who dont want to date me
    same with me all i get is hate from the world im done
  buy a sex doll  dont think i could live with the embarrassment maybe prostitutesif they legalize them here  keep women at a distance acquaintances  thats probably wise
  treat people how you would like to be treated
  i just keep people at a distance i dont get involved with every situation that happens if it doesnt concern me and i keep my social circle to a minimum less people less drama
    i treat people the way they treat me
    i dont let anyone in anymore i never will again
  which came first the chicken or the egg
ive never seen so many pathetic guys ever in one place as i have here at 4chan of course girls reject you when youre angry grumpy little trolls only wanting sex from them it shows
    if someone comes at me i will put them in their place not too difficult to understand
  you should get a trip code instead of putting an empty line before typing replies
  trip code    its our way of communicating only we do it
  its our way of communicating only we do it  i dont know what you mean its your way of communicating just that i pick up on it unless thats what you meant
  i hate living knowing im a accident child who failed his parents
    its how we id each other
  no its how i id you from one larper to another theres no way for you to id me
    i dont larp     i communicate with someone else who does the same thing this has nothing to do with you
  your parents failed you
there was a casanova movie that i saw as a child where i believed that the girl had a penis when i watched all of it a few years ago it turned out she was just wearing a fake dick which was disappointing to me in a way
hes really nice but i dont want to take advantage of that    you didnt realize it at the time but you just told me everything there is to know about you im glad i never asked you out
  this they failed to raise you right not the other way around
its time for me to end this once and for all i need more willpower i just have to do this
in this day and age is it almost flattering to have a stalker id be happy if you were waiting for me at the train station when some days i am waiting for you
my dream turned into a terrible nightmare 
youll never be able to figure it out dont bother
i feel like some people just want to be down like its some drug that feeds their loop and i so very much wish that i could find the right sequence of words to shake people out of that predicament
  what did you dream about
  give me a hand
fuck i lost your number i deleted it last night while drunk i think pls text me
well what are you mad about upset that i want you to come to bed with me after i had a horrible day goddamn just sneak out of bed once i fall asleep if you want to be that irresponsible
  im not the person youre talking to but perhaps you can ask the person to just be with you a bit in bed before you fall asleep instead of insisting that the person stays until you fall asleep etc
  im hitting 30 in a few weeks as well   no gf no kids im in  maybe well get along well as long as you are nearby working as a security guard but still working on my ee im good with kids kinda handy fixing things around the house can cook and do my own cleaning i just want some fuck and maybe a family
  tell me this directly then and ill let you go
so proud of you and happy for you o why and how are you so amazing why did i have to meet you sometimes i wish i hadnt just to escape the knowledge or feeling of life without you youll be great already are but more so
  op here its dumb probably not gonna do it
  well what if i wanted love  silly fucking idea i know but i cherish when someone shows loyalty or at least a level of dedication to me while i do the same for her even if what i give is mediocre in comparison to what she tries to give me    but that doesnt matter because im holding onto a past from years ago  i got laid in another town and i try not to look back at my dumbass self but back then i was serious
i feel like a horrible person ive been so busy with life and having a real social life that ive been largely absent online i havent forgotten about them and i still very much care about them i just havent had the time to play video games to talk to them it makes me feel like a shitty friend and maybe so

my depression has gotten to the point where im constantly gritting my teeth out of stress they hurt i cant leave the bed its become too hard and ive got nothing meaningful to do around the house maybe i should start playing videogames again just so i can pretend im using my time
  dont grind your teeth my dad did that and now all his teeth are fucked up and he cant afford to get them treated
  i wanna
  good do it
  i cant help it its automatic
/pol/ jew conspiracies have a kernel of truth to them but targeting an entire ethnic group based on the actions of a few is very dangerous and will lead to innocents getting killed     that being said jews do have a suspicious amount of influence and power relative to their numbers and they tend to support liberalism and globalization which makes sense because conservatism/nationalism is inherently against them as outsiders but i have no idea how you can address this without veering into dangerous rhetorical territory that can end in genocide as not every jew does this but an awful lot do i dont want to think this but i cant really help seeing part of it
i regret showing my affections  i regret being cold  i regret everything
i really wish my insurance werent tied to my employment     i really dont want to be dependent on people who scream at and threaten me for no reason just to keep my health
  i love 4chan i love sfw and nsfw boards theres a lot of evil and i love it   i love the mods and jannies and the admin and i love moot and the saga of camwhoring across the ages and namefags and tripfags and newfriends and oldfags and meme currents and free speech    i love you and youre my culture more so than anyone i know in real life     i would rather be friends with a /b/tard than a normie irl all other things remaining equal although finding someone like that is very hard
  in the end he couldnt even triforce correctly
  thank you anon
  you have to how about you grind your teeth against your lips
  12 years and i think ive only ever triforced once    more sayingit    i dont drink alcohol its ok that you do and ill chink glasses with you but i hope its alright with you that my glass only contains water or juice because im just not into alcohol it hurts my mouth and makes my head feel funny maybe ill change i used to be a druggie so that might have something to do with it no hard feelings        indigenous people deserve respect anyone whos taken psychedelics will tell you this any anthropologist will tell you this anyone whos spent more than 5 minutes with a person from an indigenous culture will tell you this     as a person who loves /pol/ its right about intelligence but its wrong about worth        there is spiritual truth there are paths which can lead the individual to total fulfilment provably anyone whos spent more than a year meditating once a week will tell you this not because theyve experienced total samadhi but because they intuit that its out there        the goal of politics is peace there is no politics beyond it but looking into etymology the study of the polis and of its polity is of value also /lit/s work on technics is absolutely fantastic        im boycotting pop music because its exploitative not so much of the person but of the musical idea you have a personal style and they stripmine it underground music while underpaidfor is made of love there is good music out there        i like cats better than dogs if you like dogs better than cats we can still be friends          i like when people play games of noticing and didtheynoticethatinoticed there are love people who say that that isnt the way things ought to be and that really you should just focus on making sure to love everyone whether they noticed that day or not but i think its lovely      but if this is what it causes then that makes me sad
  oh biting my lip works thanks
  what terrible formatting im sorry about that  is there a way to predict how something will look just from the tiny reply box    more sayingit    just because /b/ is mainly evil and porn i dont see why 4chan should be so broadly discouraged and naughty the secretclub thing is predicated on the following paradox    i have to use the iword the selfreference to refer to things which apply to me the poster while not giving out such information as would help others to figure out who i am but so often more of who anons really are comes out here that before their friends actually having given out everything about me apart from my name over the time ive been here ive very very rarely been called out for breaking this anonymitynorm so its a lot less finicky than people usually think but over the course of 18 billion posts one for every 5 people on earth it adds up to quite a difference in how people feel about each other and i think the fundamental thing is this that if i cant identify you the other poster as different from me in any significant way which relates to the post at hand then i cant shouldnt typically wont call you out on what you said unless i disagree with the content and substance of your posts of course    i dont know why i like this state of affairs but something in it pleases me it calls to mind what js mill said if you disagree with someone dont hush them up let them speak and ridicule the falsity of their ideas in a public forum where all and sundry can see why theyre wrong because otherwise it comes to be regarded as true in secret   so translated somewhat the idea can be restated it doesnt matter who said something you have to go on the merit of the post in order to discern whether it tells you something you should take on in your own life which is why post numbers karma etc that happen on other fora occlude the kind of discussion this board brings out
  despite our elitism that just means that 4chan has a unique role on the internet github lets people post code others can edit soundcloud lets people post music without limit 4chan lets people shitpost without getting called out for anything other than handing out their names
ive always wanted to kill someone
you dont love me  you want me to love you and thats it  when have you ever just asked how i was feeling and what you could do youre always thinking how you feel in a situation and how i feel towards you and making decisions for both of us you have never just asked what i wanted at this very moment and accepted my answer    you really arent brave enough
i guess i gotta move on
je why did you have to lie you were honest with everything else and i let all that slide but you lied about who you were sleeping with and having them so close well thats why were not together i need some work to be a decent guy but you need to see what you want in life and not be afraid to find it and actually work towards it i really wanted to start a real relationship cause i really liked you oh well ima use this to get better as a person laterz lady
  hey s its been 2 and a half months since you killed yourself since then things have gotten pretty weird in my life i wish i could catch up with you about it now im dealing with another suicide scare but this time ill learn to be more attentive about it unlike i was with you i honestly reckon that if you kept fighting your demons maybe at some point life would of gotten better for you but i dont blame you for what you did even though it deeply hurt me and many others    i wonder what life would be like if you stayed in c with us but i know its pointless to think about it and i will just have to deal with the fact youre gone i still think about you pretty often but im learning to deal with the fact that youre no longer here with us i hope at some point we can meet again you meant a lot to me brother    rest easy bro ill miss you forever  k
  hah were both already taken im just a loser spreading love into the darkness
workload increases  mind begins to fill with casual suicidal thoughts  ive run out of ways to intellectualize it now there is no religion that will save me from this pit nor system of belief nor unexpected moment like a beautiful girl walking into my life the truth is im mentally ill  i know what i should be feeling but i just cannot feel it my brain is functioning wrong at a very basic level in plain terms its like im already dead and living as a ghost if i am still like this in fifteen to twenty years i will consider suicide because even now i only go forward out of obligation to prevent my familys suffering
im not gonna change  i cannot change  ill always be this worthless piece of trash  not even in sleep will escape from this truth  not even in selfharm find solace  not even in creating my very own world inside my mind  it doesnt matter what i do  it doesnt mattee if i even try  just a failure
  you poor soul there is help but you do not see it
  sure  whatever you say pal  wanna some invega  maybe abilify  perhaps a dose of lithium salts  i got them all  none worked  so sure there is help but thats no help  and even then i knew some fucking asshole like you was going to post such bullcrap because its easy to say such a thing behind a curtain of anonymity
  i hold no grudge towards you i hope you find peace in this life
  next time save that worthless and stale i hope you find help for yourself
  what is it that you want
  i will not because everyone needs to hear it and someone will appriciate it
fucking normies want to lower me to their level and have a conformist life they will only drive me to suicide if they keep doing this
  youre a failure but youre human humans are failures    we all suck just try to be the best version of yourself thats all you can do im not telling you to rest and to be happy im telling you to keep trying even though its too hard and its disgustingly impossible you have to keep on truckin    t the most disgusting person ever who still tries to be a little better every day
  not that anon im in the same situation but i keep enduring in hopes that maybe i will find the right doctor and the right medication
  you have to find the right you my man
would you just leave me the fuck alone already it would greatly benefit the both of us if youd just fuck off and stay away
whats the point of doing anything i dont enjoy anything i will never be happy i dont think its an attitude problem anymore because i have indeed forced myself to try new things and to enjoy them  dont tell me that meme that the people i see outside are not happy either because they are at least happier than me or at least they dont feel like they dont enjoy anything and they dont think of suicide so often  i went to therapy but all the guy kept saying was that i should try new things and have sex
  i dont know if you dont look at the world and see wonder and amazement then maybe its not worth living
  whats so wonderful and amazing though we dont know anything else so basically we shouldnt expect less from the world besides the world is full of cruelty
  if we let love in we also open ourselves up for defeat this fear of being ripped up inside which you have already experienced tells us that it is better to not feel anything day 1 maybe you just think it a second day 1000 maybe you have started believing it day 2000 maybe you have thought it so many times that you believe your own words love isnt for me i cant feel
  everything sucks and everything is awesome    i dont know man i just like living enough that i dont want to die i like breathing and feeling and being its hard but its cool man
  i liked that like living breathing and feeling and being thats all we need no
  what else could i want sure the world is cruel but im not perfect either its cold but i can get into my blanket and relax sometimes i have to go out and stomach pain but thats life
dont waste your time on me youre already the voice inside my head
  fucking hell anon who are you  fucking literally me  lets hope the principal doesnt kick my ass on next monday
why do girls bother flirting if they are gonna get mad when you ask them out what do they expect
  they believe they are being friendly and you come off as aggressive
  is there a way to tell if a girl wants me to ask her out for sure or should i just ask out any girl that shows interest and assume that randomly one will be genuine
  look at the body language it tells you a lot does she turn her body towards you does she speak in a higher pitch with you twists her hair or give you glances giggles   these are signs she likes you but some girls might be very friendly towards people so check if this applies to only you or others as well     then ask a small date at first grab a coffee or something alike dont jump straight to wine and dine but dont underestimate a good party make her laugh and show her a good time
my ex gf oneitis is getting married today wish them the best but im full of regret and cant get past it
i cant even eat a single plate of food now without my stomach upsetting please someone kill me incapacitate me i dont want to do this anymore
  go on a few day fast
  have you tried soup
im so tired of being me no matter how i try im still a fucking piece of shit disappointment for everyone around me im too fucking stupid selfish and lazy to get anywhere in life and i dont care enough for my future to make any kind of change i wouldnt deserve a good life anyway
thinking about the girl im in love with 24/7 yet knowing that she hardly thinks about me sucks
i cant say anything to you im too ashamed i cant get over you i dont even know if thats what you want i want to run away from everything
after years of telling you we need to do things together and pleading for you to pay me some attention you dare tell me that i wont ever leave and that if one is together with someone you should never have to put up with doing something you are mildly uncomfortable with for the sake of the other you motherfucker
if any of you need someone to talk to know that i am always here    godspeed3152
  im always zero energy i cant do anything
  get some rest listen to invigorating music drink coffee or ingest caffeine not too much though and try to do at least one thing you want every day    do you know the cause of your low energy is it work home life or something else depending on if you can pinpoint the reason or not solutions can vary
i keep making mistakes  i dont think ill ever feel love
  this (((jay))) guy must have a fan club lmao ecksdee
  im just overwhelmed with responsibilities
    oh hm i didnt think i would get a reply because it wont be anything but a coincidence from someone elses wishful thinking but if it helps you in some way     i want you to reach out to me of your own volition and just say what you are too afraid to say because obviously you have something to say if you havent let me go if youre still holding on regardless of your situation it took a lot from me to open myself up so many times and to let you open up to me but i cannot mentally go through these kind of situations again  i can only receive what you want to offer if that is mentor like kindness if that is friendship if that is love even if you have nothing to say you should still reach out so that i know you are even there i dont ask for anything else from you all i want is to know you are there
    k
  in the same boat as you pal learn from your mistakes if you make the same mistake twice it is no longer a mistake you just need to keep on learning from your mistakes and keep on living    in terms of feeling love if you want it badly enough and create opportunities for yourself youll find someone eventually in life sometimes you must create your own luck      i have a friend who says he never has time for friends or anything yet he works out draws plays games all of that the truth is he has no time for the things he doesnt want to do if you want something badly enough you will make time for it it sounds more of a mental drainage than physical so music may help you feel more awake and active take some time out of your day maybe 5 minutes every hour to just sit back and relax take a breather collect yourself then jump back in to whatever you were doing i know sometimes i just have to put my phone down and step away from life every once in a while for 5 minutes just to collect myself its okay to feel drained what responsibilities are troubling you you neednt answer that if you dont want to i can understand it may be a bit more personal than youd be willing to admit to
i have nightmares of you giving affection to the man you stabbed me in the back for i want this all to end
  did anyone even listen to that song before i posted it
  j is a woman that some guy is in love with here hes always here it seems
  i dont know if i should i mean there is alot
  j is jess oknow we know
    its just a common letter for names  i love a j too  i see m and r a lot as well sometimes e every thread these letters but never any others or rarely
ive given up entirely on him there isnt even a small part of me that holds any hope anymore
  fuck it   i had the misfortune of being smarter of something like 99 of the state and being placed in advanced classes until they cut the funding i would go to school every day and be beat spat at called names and have false reports filed against me i would then come home and have sister beat me blue she would choke me till i nearly passed out the dog wouldnt allow stuff like this and would bite her ass so she always put him outside to chase squirrels or something i now remember the reason i got so emotional when looking at my plastic soldiers earlier this semester as i used sacrifice my green army men as makeshift catropes to prevent her from sneaking in my room in the dead of night to bite kick and choke me the grandest irony was i always tried to be nice to her in hopes that she would magically stop being baphomet incarnate and turn into a nice person treat people the way you want to be treated i gave up and tried to avoid her the best i could     she only got worse after the divorce as dad took her cat winston churchill and took it to my grandmothers dumpster fire of a house where her nearly starved to death because the alway forgot to feed him she naturally this out on me until at the age of fifthteen when i finally hit my growth spurt and went from pillsbury dough boy to lumberjack after then she just gave up later on there were incidents that led my stepfather remove all the ammunition from the house and hide it in the garage since she would get physical with my mother to surmise she is one of the many violent psychopaths i have met in my life and its not a stretch to since she actually took joy in hurting people she laughed when doing it
  she laughed as she strangled me as she killed my pets as she wrung my guinea pigs neck as i discovered she had taken a knife from the kitchen to decapitate my goldfish as a morbid decoration for her barbie sets kitchen as she kicked my teeth out and she laughed as she molested me     she started touch me when i was ten and started to initiate sexual intercourse at when i was twelve i can say that there is no worse way of losing your virginity than your sister strangling you as she tried to get off while on her period     i guess this might be why i have never been that interested in sex or chasing women this is the also the reason i had trouble making any meaningful childhood friend i had a few but i only ever had them over once since i believed she would try to stick things in their anus my friends soon got that vibe themselves as she acted increasingly sexual around them she flashed one and was caught masterbating with a hairbrush by another she also bashed my face in with a cello while i was playing halo 3 with one of my friends while he was over i wanted to tell someone but i was afraid of her for the longest time besides how do you tell your parents that your sister is molesting you how do you tell anyone that later i never brought it up because of the chaos it would cause in the family so i forgave her forgiveness doesnt make the memories go away no matter how hard i tried to forget
  likely the same person posting again and again
im sorry i hurt you for so long and wouldnt give you time to heal i never meant to make your heart so unhappy i just couldnt bear to be without you but now ill never speak to you again and my heart died the day i burst out in anger and you stopped talking to me for good i know i deserve the misery im going through and i hope youre happier now that youve banished me from your life ill never forgive myself and ill always only love you please forgive me
  i am pretty sure this why i have nightmares to this day     the nightmares i have always had terrible nightmares they occur almost every night even if i dont remember them i can tell when ive had them though as i wake up in the middle of the night tense and sore once my roommate had the misfortune of waking me during one of these nightmares this was one i remembered too i was in an abandoned building i recognized it was the local abandoned mental hospital the building was completely abandoned and decaying animal bones in the conners water damage the asbestos falling out of the ceiling the whole shebang really it was dark yet strangely well lit you may be saying this is the part where the axe murder jumps out proclaiming that he is going to rape me well no i wandered around this building for about an hour even got up on the roof to look at the sky no stars which was normal since the ten day forecast where i live often included rain rain and rain when i went back inside i noticed something odd a whole host of objects lying around in one of the connecting rooms were missing books animal bones chairs stuff like that as i went along i noticed more stuff missing and a change in the air pressure i felt a breeze too as i went further down the stairs floor by floor to the lobby weaving in and out the broken stair ways entire walls started to be missing as if torn apart that slight change in air pressure felt like an anvil on my shoulders and whistling wind turned into a maelstrom as i started to hear voices in the wind whispers when i reached the first floor i could barely stand then i saw it a table flying towards my face i hit the deck to get out of its way then i felt something grab by my foot i looked back to see a tendril made of smoke or mist trying to drag me away i braced myself and eyed the exit as i tried to win the worst game of tug of war ever devised
   i was slowly losing ground as i tugged and clawed at the earth with all my strength i kicked and screamed at the malicent limb trying to free myself the entity seemed bored as this games as it grabbed me with a second tendril and yanked i was dragged through the hospital slamming into walls as i went then i laid my eyes upon the heart of darkness a black mass of mist with clutter swirling around within it it looked at me with the animal skull and without making a noise started to envelope me it tore at my skin scratching and tearing my flesh with debris choking me with smoke and strangling me with a chain the whispers had turned to hateful screams and shouts clear in tone but garbled in language piecing my ears they say your not supposed to feel pain in dreams but i felt like i was being torn apart it felt realas i was starting to blackout i woke up and saw two black figures beside my bed i nearly gave my roommate a heart attack as i kicked scream and tried to leap past him out of bed he asked me not to do that again i asked him to never shake my bunk while i am sleeping again that is one of the many i remember
  you should tell someone else then seek help she sounds like she has a mental illness and was molested herself
the thing i need to the most is to fuck someone else the physical contact will make me forget him forever i really need this
there is a man i love but hes a lot older than me he loves me and i havent given him a fair chance never once has he hurt and betrayed me he is always there for me
  itll only make you feel more empty
  that statement is wrong i will likely fall in love hard
  whores are easy to please such is life
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  i feel sorry for you if you consider that being a whore 14 year old virgins opinions dont count im a mature woman this is what adults do child
  jesus christ get some help yo
  why whats your problem about me reporting what i see here
  no its what degenerates do you dont much like being called a whore do you all it takes for you to fall in love and forget is for someone to penetrate your used up cunt i feel sorry for you
  i wouldnt sleep with anyone i didnt really like and yes sex bonds people you must have a lot of problems in life out there with all those sexual hangups sound like you were raped maybe you wrote that post about being raped by your sister seek some therapy
  heh youre grasping for any insult arent you whore youre the peak of modern degeneracy and youll always know that youre used goods you know in germanic society they would drown degenerates like yourself in mud so i suppose count yourself lucky where dishonorable behavior like yours is accepted
despite we have been talking for 2 godamn years i still dont understand why is shes just too freaking austitic we used to talk every goddamn night on fb im sure that she considered me her only friend and even so i knew if i suddendly stopped talking to her she wont say absoultely anything and so it was   im so fucking glad that i stopped reading her stupid complaints and her jokes over and over and over again  shit but i still dont get it what the fuck is wrong with her absolutely no personality no delicacy and doesnt take anything seriously  she is not a trash person but looks like the result of bullying a girl for 10 years im very curious to see what will happen to her maybe ill talk with her again in 2020
why cant you love me what did i do wrong im so lonely ive never felt this low before i love you so much but its clear you only see me as a fiend or you wouldnt have sad no i can see that now but i dont want to how do i let go i want to stay friends with you but i dont know if ill ever stop feeling this way for you i just wish i could tell you get it all off my chest but i cant im a coward its all falling apart and i dont know what to do i cant sleep nothing excites me anymore i want to go back what do i do
ive wasted so much of my life that i feel like screaming whenever i think about it
  he does have a lot of anger it seems and no respect for women he does sound like he was raped probably by his mother and sister tragic
  its hard to come face to face with ones own degeneracy but it has to happen sometime its always the same story they justify it in their mind they lash out with baseless insults but at the end of the day theyre still the same old uncontented shell of a human
  yeah we dont live in 1382 things have evolved look i genuinely care for your wellbeing you seem damaged to think about what healthy normal adults do this is troubling i guess to you your mom is a whore with a used up pussy from childbirth i feel bad for you
  yes he desperately needs therapy oh well what can you do if someone wont get help
  t literal incel
    that anon was right you guys really are trying to justify being modern degenerates this is sad
they were involved in the production     
mmmmmmmmmmmm boy i sure do love arguing with faceless strangers about justifying my own life choices on the internet
  yeah pretty obvious isnt it now hes trying the same fagging bs like we dont know lmfao
  nice samefag incel
  maybe trolls and incels need to wake up to their own life choices they are everything wrong with this world just a modern schoolyard bully
  throwing insults around isnt justification slut
  i dont even know what t stands for so that would be pretty weird dontchathink
i cant wait to feel him in me sweat between us panting him watching me moan     things that incels dream about but wont admit
    maybe you both should act like adults rather than shaming one another live and let live pointless drama and mudslinging towards one another doesnt solve anything you two dont have agreeable lifestyles the fact that neither of you can be above insulting the other instead of reasoning with them says more than your insults to each other ever could this is a board about helping one another not arguing besides what are you trying to prove to one another
i am making a lot of headway with my issues its not that i did anything wrong but i now better understand my anxiety as a mixture of low self esteem need for validation and selfexploitation i am actively working on changing both my outlook and the way i engage with other people this also changes the way i miss you  its less desperation and more like a nostalgic sadness i hope you manage to work on understanding your issues as well id very much enjoy catching up with you miss you lots
  shut the fuck up nigger
  never change faggot 3
  also wish youd start writing again its always great to read that mixture of nostalgic mystery with your personal diary thats your style
  yeah lmao imagine getting this mad over such a small literally pointless thing    shut up nerd no samefagging here
  stop samefagging slut
  boring narcissistic same fag troll     quit complimenting yourself being a troll isnt a life accomplishment
  shut up child
  stop samefagging you 15 year old whore
  in case youre confused im neither one of those in the argument
  jesus christ we arent the same person just stfu and get a hobby
  uh huhthats why you wrote         you couldnt be anymore obvious
  then stop replying you absolute retard lmfao get a life
 meant for    
  get a life     you lost fail
  you do you i just hope you both live happy lives and are content with where you both are today
im just bored of everything absolutely everything i have 29 years old im tired of life i cant imagine how i would be if a reach 90 years old like my grandmother i dont think that i will reach that age though nothing has any sense anymore im just finished as a person totally psychologically destroyed forever
i cant wait to fuck him to forget about my ex
  let epic fail xd you lose  underage
    why not save your money then sell everything and go on world tour or build an off grid cabin
  where are you from
  not even close thanks for playing please try again
  okay kiddo
  initials
porn has ruined all men
  why not save your money then sell everything  ive been selling everything i can to have some money for when i live on the street    and go on world tour  i dont have remotely enough money to travel    or build an off grid cabin  yeah where do you know that all land has his owner the best thing i could do is to buy a tent and go live in some beach until police come and kick me out
  video games and the internet has ruined million of peoples lives
  i bet this is what my love is thinking although i know she doesnt love me anymore i threatened her out of anger and its all over i feel dead
  okay then be miserable and complain its your life to do anything you want with including being a failure no one wants to hear your complaining no one is going to help you man up and do something
  this
this is it weve broken the ice now im finally going to talk to her and maybe get her number  shes out sick for three days  have absolutely no other way of contacting her    welp lets see what monday brings
  what did you threaten her with
  it doesnt matter i made the mistake i know she doesnt waste her time by browsing this shit hole so i have no way of telling her anything im blocked on all fronts because i went frantic at the end out of dispair and desperation
talking to crush from school on snapchat  work up the courage to get her number  continue talking to her on snapchat  realise the whole endeavor was pointless  nice
  did you tell them how you feel and get rejected hurts _ especially when theyre still your friend
  well then i guess youll have to get over her and accept shes not coming back to you
  theyre the result of single mothers raising them who are even a bigger problem to society
one thing i have learned from my mistakes is it that i only have myself to blame life really is what you make of it and if you have a loser mentality you will lose selfsabotage is very real
  ive accepted it ive just died inside
  which goes back to porn that teaches boys socially and through pavlovlike associations from a young age to be promiscuous cheat look for something else rather than what they have
  actually guys at an early age are raised through disney movies to be nice to women and respect them but reality hits them in the face quite quickly when they realize its not what girls want so they change their behaviour and mentality towards women completely
  i am nervous fucking mess i can barely sleep now i swear i have started to see things in the corner of my vision now things that shouldnt be there   i just want this to end i would give my left nut if it meant i could sleep and function like normal i feel like my mental and physical health are going like i am falling apart   i have dreams were everything would fall apart machines buildings people
  id like to reassure you that the void goes away but it doesnt i think it just lessens a bit over time im currently in a place where i know i have to stop looking him up and obsessing over him time to move on for good it seems impossible but i need to do it i have tohe is no good for me
  you need meds to go to sleep sleep deprivation does horrible things to your mind it happened to me as well i went bonkers when i couldnt sleep
being a floppy junk food addict is not feminist every time i need an extra push to exercise or cook a meal instead of ordering out i read body positive cringe your jealous bitter tears are the best supplement ive ever had
  god no im far too much of a pussy i asked her if she wanted to meet up and both times several months apart during which we became really close friends she said she was busy and wouls love to next holiday its taken a while but ive finally taken the hint _ thanks for asking though 
  also be gentle to yourself treat yourself like you are caring parent calm loving protective
  what does cooking have to do with feminism absolutely nothing
  i take melatonin along with my clonidine to help me get to sleep it helps me get to sleep but staying asleep is the problem i often wake up in a panic at 2 or 3 am
    your thoughts are racing everything is on overdrive ask your doctor for something else for now you need to reset your brain once you do youll be okay
i dont understand why she doesnt date me im the most interesting guy shes ever met
  thank you anon  i think thats a good idea
  maybe its your narcissism   
  youre welcome youll be ok take care buddy
  i dont believe in narcissism because people are supposed to love themselves first
  i argue that this society would prefer women to be soft lazy pigs suckling a corporate teat cultivating fitness and feeding yourself properly is more feminist than cramming yourself full of sawdust burgers and claiming that runway models circa 1995 are the current beauty standard
  best of luck to you i hope we both find another love to fill our lives with hope and happiness until then im a ghost just moving about business as usual
  i dont believe in narcissism because people are supposed to love themselves first
  i dont think you have any idea what youre even talking about
  great then love yourself just dont expect others to love you too the world doesnt revolve around you in fact you will likely be forgotten about in a few generations if your career was spectacular and you become famous youll still just be a footnote in a book in a 100 years
  whatever you need to tell yourself tubby im mostly in it for health benefits anyway
  what are you even talking about ridiculous   im not tubby either i eat better than you i guarantee that
  i think you replied to the wrong person dude i was mocking the narcississt too _
i have everything i need already dont worry i dont need a relationship with you ive wasted far too much time trying to chase you down and in the end i cant say you were worth the effort its time for me to do things without you on my mind you are just one person on this planet im sorry that i felt the need to write again i said i wouldnt but soon i will purge you from my soul i can feel it happening
  oh sorry yes i did       this is for you   
  its two years i keep trying to make new friends and having more social interactions but nothing it feels like im the toxic guy who no one wants around even though these fears have been proven wrong by all of my closest friends    it feels like a waste of life at this point im in uni 2nd year and got 2 friends there over 32  might consider quitting at this point cant better myself
  try harder
its been 2 weeks since i fucked up and theres been no communication between us everyday has been harder than the last i hope youre doing well and that your new man is making you happy i love you always
i believe that 4chan was started to corrupt youth to divide female and males spread hate make people depressed and pessimistic about the world
the worse he treats me the more i want him the more controlling he is in bed the more i love it if he was good and kind id have lost interest or maybe its just that this is what i deserve hes not brutal hes not abusive hes just beautifully strange and terribly distant i get close but ill never really feel him but when i see him slowly taking off his clothes and know ill have him soon the happiness is something id like to freeze in time i will get enough of him only these slow drops of sweetness i live for
im ok without you dont worry
  i believe you might be correct     at the same time i think this place is what the real world has become or was it always like this im old enough to remember a different thing but was it always really like this
  its okay i know you are
  maybe were just more aware of the corruption in the world now so our perception has changed     i used to view the world through such a wonderful lens i want that back its no where to be found around here depression trolls suicide corruption  none of that makes a nice life
  stop coming here then find something else in your life to take your time
  if the devil is real he lives here
  thats the plan but its a place from hell      indeed
i dont need you im going to exercise read and work to become a better man so the next woman in my life can depend on me sorry i dragged you through the negativity in my life i hope youre happy with your new beau
  i know that im over him because when i read this pretending its him i dont care what he does thanks anon
when i think of him marrying someone thats not me it doesnt even bother me     i must be free finally
  being over someone and not caring about them is different i still care deeply for the woman but i have to let go and let her be happy and achieve her goals if im not a part of her plans then so be it shes a grown woman and im a grown man it hurts but it has to happen and im going to forge ahead like a man
  for me it means that they dont exist in my world anymore at all i just forget them good luck anon
  youre a strong woman to be able to do that i wish you best of luck as well
if you would just open up a bit this would be much better for both of us im sick of waiting make up your mind
its always one step forward two steps back with my life every time i think im finally crawling out of this shit i end up getting dragged back into an even more depressive state than before
what the fuck were you expecting you led me on once already why would i pursue you again i liked you a lot and still do and might even love you but i cant do this bullshit
i get tired of dealing with people in the work place  for some reason its always one extreme or the other people are either on my teams level where they can greet each other with what do you want now you crazy bitch or theyre hyper sensitive and i cant use the word slaves without it being misconstrued i dont flatout dislike people from either end but its fucking exhausting especially when im going through some shit and im trying to kind of fortify myself for it     i feel like a pussy but its all so stressful am i working hard enough is this girl into me is my mother ever going to fucking stop being a depressed bump on the log i bit back a little hard at my boss is she actually mad at me bills are due car needs tire work i havent been to a doctor in a really long time dentist is calling wondering where the fuck i am my sister walks to work and wont wear a coat when its 10 degrees out im sick i dont have energy after work theyve had me on full time for a fucking year and still wont give me a position because the director is currently fighting with my boss over who gets me im working a weekly split shift that really really sucks and people act like its normal    id go drinking at a bar if i werent so worried about money
i guess youre really doing this
  love you too
  howd you know
  because i dont want to be doing this larp
  then please dont i need you
  i need you too but i cant see a way out of this
  just stay with me
  we were never together i guess thats my larp over
  were not together
  why cant you be with them
  so many reasons i dont care if were not together i just want him in my life
  if at a minimum you just want him in your life then go out of your way to keep in touch via texting/social media if you want more from him to be together then do things together
i just gotta let it go man because right or wrong theyre laughing it up while i suffer if its bigger than me i should just let it go and move on no more degeneracy man this shit is killing me
jesus christ every fucking time i think its over it comes back harder than before    i miss him so fucking much and i want to say so much and just share all these moments with him but i fucked up when i had the chance and now im all alone on this goddamn planet with not a single soul who cares
  tell him
    you can unfuck things

i paid for tinder gold when i was drunk and irresponsible  google wont refund me so im stuck with it for 6 months  how do i make the most of this
s e x
this reply requires a 4chan diamond account to view
  if youre not a chad dont even bother with tinder    just take the hit and learn from it it will be a good reminder over the next 6 months not to get so drunk
  the point about blowing money is a good point but while im no chad im not completely hopeless i already have a date lined up with a really cute girl though this will be my first tinder date this isnt going to be easy street or whatever but i think im good enough that if i learn how to work it i can get something out of it
  how do you get a 4chan diamond account  i only have 4chan gold 
  why are you lying trying to recruit members into your incel cult
anyone hear have a weightgain fetish but also trying to lose weight shits rough
ive got about 2k left on my student loan and more than enough money in the bank to pay it off im wondering if i should let it ride the monthly payments until paid off 69 or pay it off in the lump sum    pros further builds credit current score 749 more money i can throw at long term securities to grow  cons small interest payment of 6 less money in the bank
  a little bit of both
i hate myself im the fat and ugly girl here btw
  then improve yourself
let the man sleep you fat insecure bitch
you literally had a whole thread of dudes telling you that you look fine cease your faggotry
be roastie  have to do only 1 thing in order to succeed in life not be fat  get fat anyway  lmaoing  you
roastie whores are the worst type of people on this planet an islamic terrorist is more noble
you are both horrible at communicating with each other i hope you are underage because adults cant be this retarded
lol me roastie havent even had sex over 3 times this year
  being fat and cutting hair are things that are repairable you can work on not being fat and wait for the hair to grow  and dont do stupid shit again at least confide in your partner before making big decisions
  wtf do you even want from your bf he was reasonable throughout the entire conversation and you kept ignoring him he showed remarkable patience btw i would have stopped talking to you way sooner i recommend getting a therapist
this outbreak is not about him thinking youre unattractive its about you thinking youre unattractive and youre seeking validation    if this is a big problem for you seek its solution commit to bettering yourself
  why do you people write like utter retards
  loose some weight and lift weights then you wont be ugly
this is insufferable to read you both write like teenagers
  write sigh one more time and i will fucking slaughter you with a dictionary
  so why did you cut your hair why did you get fat are you counting your calories  also i dont think he meant any harm but on the slight chance that he didive seen guys do this on purpose to upset girls for a thrill but thats because i dated a sociopath  anyways better yourself for you if you do it for another person you wont get far
  stop being fat
is that english or some other language i have never heard of both of you should learn how to write in intelligible english before asking shit
  ive 0 sympathy for fat chicks complaining about being fat lmao if you cant muster the willpower to eat healthy and exercise for the benefit of increasing your attractiveness by 2 points or potentially more even the act of trying will make guys more attracted to you
i think its more concerning that you write like a retard and have no self esteem even ugly or fat chicks can be fuckable but only if they have really stellar personality and arent complete brainlets
  wouldnt say so chief but i do keep an eye out for fat chicks on the gym who knows
man im glad i dont have a gf after reading that shit
dating you sounds emotionally exhausting lmao no wonder hes so distant and unwilling to engage with you when youre being a sad fuck he probably cant take anymore  idk why youre victimizing yourself when refusing to let your partner sleep is literally emotional abuse  go eat some cake and cry fatty
  i would dump you just for repeating the same thing over and over again i also like fat chicks with short hair
join a gym join a gym join a gym and dont just do cardio you need to strength train your entire body to the best of your ability unfortunately it takes time but you need to stick with it you got this you deserve to be happy but you need to put in the work
  you deserve to be happy  does she though
  she doesnt not with that attitude
  id kill myself if i had to talk to that dude for more than 5 minutes
  hes aspie
  i couldnt even read this whole thing it is a miracle that he puts up with your shit the amount of selfcentered selfpity here disgusts me stop punishing him for being around you
  he loves to smell his own farts
  the dude is not the problem he sounds autistic but nowhere near as annoying as fucking op fat with a butch haircut and literally crazy i feel bad for this dude he probably deserves better
  nah you can tell he likes the clingy insecure ones and just didnt feel like dealing with it at that moment because he was going to sleep
  literally this
wish we were in southbank  eyyy my homie
dont just fucking comlain about it on 4chanyour weights something you could easily control yourself and if you do think your uglythen be a good enough person to make up for your looks
i lost 100 lbs and now i have loose skin should i get surgery i basically look like the middle picture right now
  if it bothers you a lot then go for it
  i dont really want to but im afraid no guy will ever love me if i dont get it done
its just loose fat not skin
  its skin bro    idk why people refuse to accept that excess skin after major weight loss is a thing
  if you can afford it definitely also watch out for    tldr your body will try whatever it can to gain all the lost fat back all the fat cells are still alive in your body just empty and waiting to be refilled for me it took 2 years before the ethernal hunger went away i was finally able to eat maintain diet but if i didnt restrain myself i would super easily become fat again
  ive been at a healthy bmi for over 3 years now and ive been working out a lot too everyone kept saying the skin would tighten up but it hasnt 
  whoa its almost like actions have consequences do it if you have money for it it shouldnt even hurt that much and you will get fancy scar    but remember that fixing your belly skin wont magically summon boyfriend you gotta leave basement and go to social events you hate to meet some potentional husbandos
  i mean i was obese since i was a kid i ate what my mom gave me i lost the weight as soon as i started living on my own but the damage had already been done by that point
as first post said definitely do it if it bothers you and youd feel happier/more confident with the excess skin removed    definitely dont do it for fear of no guys ever loving you yeah maybe more guys might want to get in between your legs but you can definitely find love with loose skin    t guy whose wife has some loose skin after losing a lot of weight
  congratulations on the discipline of the weight loss thats far more significant than a minor cosmetic issue
  congrats to the weightloss anon  im on a diet for 2 years now and also lost almost 100lbs  i dont look like pic relatet middle but fear if i keep going its gonna be that bad    idk much about the skin removal surgery but saw a video of one and it frightens me that i may have to do the same  i heard that the scar would be pretty painfull because its so big and that it talks more than 6 months to heal properly you cant do sports or any other activity cant expose it to the sun for too long etc
  gj on weight loss also its not all about your body that attracts men you gotta be sane too
  skin recycles continuously with full replacement after around 7 years long term continuous efforts to increase turnover rate of surface skin can be effective but difficult to do as a habit    surgery will basically just cut away the excess skin which can be particularly useful in also removing fat cells prone to regrowth but can leave scarring which will last the same amount of time    either way youve got to deal with some sort of lingering skin issue surgery is probably a good way to ensure you dont easily regain as much weight if you slip on your current diet but its expensive and ultimately your body image is more about your own confidence than what a man makes of it
having sex with a escort for the first time tomorrow what should i do she does everything you can imagine according to the page shes on   any tips guys
anyone
dont take no for an answer
  if you pay her and then she says no you either get robbed or you become a rapist so choose fucking wisely
is it legal where you are
  hmmm i think you should fuck her  /thread
  be clear in the beginning about what you want to do  nips in the face and some doggystyle would make for a fine evening
  thanks anon
  play some vidya with her nothing too diffucult unless she suggests it you should only have games you are at least fairly good at lying around nothing is worse than her kicking your ass cos shell be bored as fuck if you are no good she can and should win some but it has to be a fight
  talk with her before sex  ive been with a few escorts since its legal and quite common where i live and breaking the ice and relaxing instead of going straight into fucking always makes for a much better experience
  r a p e
my sincere advice is cancel the booking and do not do it take it from somebody who has made this mistake theres a kind of shame that comes along with it and its impossible to shake even three years later spare yourself the agony and find a gf
  this just think about the fact that someone else probably came in her pussy right before your appointment    also theyre not called escorts the correct term is hooker
    what a bunch of fags fuck them and fuck that escort if she is smart she will make you feel comfy and wanted nothing wrong with it
  quick question would you recommend to a woman that you love mother sister cousin that she become a prostitute
  if the money is right and they were treated right yep are they less of a person because they make guys feel good  maybe your just a stuck up asshole that thinks a job defines who you are
  i could be a stuck up asshole but i believe that treating people as commodities for your instant gratification is pretty pathological also with prostitution comes the decreased capacity of the woman to pair bond excluding the chance of a fulfilling romantic relationship and motherhood
  lol ok whatever bs you just said there guy you think you know everything about everybody and its the rule i have no use or patience for people like you
  i dont think a difference of opinion warrants that conclusion but ok sorry youre so touchy about your habit of paying for sex enjoy your cope
  i dont pay for sex i do believe in the right for a woman or man to have sex for money no crime nobody is hurt im sorry you have such a perfect life that you judge others on 4chin youre sad bro grow up
  but you are actually judging people you dont know based on generalizations based in no actual evidence how is that anon wrong  also  paying someone to perform a service makes them a commodity
  do you honestly equate sex and all that it is intrinsically linked with on the same level as any other kind of service like a mechanic or contractor
cancel the escort you ll get incurable lifelong virus that causes genital warts and for what    cause most women are stupid cunts     just wait till u meet a decent girl and dont become another whore monger
  some people can yes its not for everyone obviously but surprise surprise not everyone is built the same fact is it being illegal a doesnt stop it and b just makes it even more unsafe for all parties do people not own the right to their own bodies people sell their physical labor all the time and to some men and women they see sex as a physical labor as well
il try to explain this the best i can hopefully this story wont sound to confusing     i had a friend years ago lets call him a a started to date my little sister when she was 13 years old and a was 18 at the time i didnt like it but i tried to talk some sense into him because even though it was really filthy what a was doing we were friends for a long time and i didnt want to lose a friend i wanted to try give him a chance still it was hes first girlfriend so he dated her out of desperation but another friend lets call him b said i should just cut contact with a after a while i listen ended up b and b ended calling out a for it and made heaps of post on the social media calling him a dirty pedophile and it ended up ruining a life and made him lose all of hes friends and made him super depressed and now he never leaves hes bedroom a been like this for years now now here the fucked part last week i found out the reason b called out a was because he wanted to fuck my little at the time which he ended up doing multiple times b is also a year older than a which makes it more fucked and also makes him a huge hypocrite b ruined a life just so he could fuck my little sister i dont know how to feel about this but now i cant even look at b anymore i thought he was my friend especially for the fact that he was bragging about losing virginity he lost it to my little sister but he didnt tell me it was my little sister he just seems like a toxic person to me now part of me really wants beat the shit out of him but it happened years ago so i feel like its to late for that    i really dont know what to do or how to feel about this
bump    any advice would be helpful its kinda given me trust issues
  you should execute both of them for raping your sister and being pedos then consider killing yourself for not protecting your sister wtf is wrong with you a normal persons reaction to finding out their little sister had been raped would be to fly off the handle and attack the rapist not feel sorry for them being a neet    wtf
  she wasnt full on raped she gave them both consent because shes dumb back then and her mother didnt give a shit about it we have different mothers
  a 13 year old cannot consent she was raped and if you dont do anything youre a coward if my sister told me someone did that to her i would get on the train immediately and kill them
    thanks anons
  welcome to 4channel man its basically reddit but you have to greentext if you want someone to read something that long namasté brother
  your friends are both terrible people who backstabbed each other and used their relationship with you to fuck a middle schooler cut both of them out of your life if you havent already and dont beat up b if he goes to the police you could be tried for assault just tell everyone hes a pedo
  thank you for your kind welcoming message its nice to know there a people like you here      a hasnt been in my life for a long time now but b keeps trying to contact me but i just been ignoring him as much as really want to i know i shouldnt beat him up ive got to much to lose for it telling everyone about it is probably the most mature way to go about it give a taste of hes own medicine it just suck so much because i thought he was a decent person until i found this out
i dont get what im doing wrong    at my college the resource centers they have for women and lgbt folk somehow managed to make it mandatory for people to attend social cues and body language seminars as part of their antisexual harassment thing but every time i try to behave in the ways they teach you ive been getting slapped with one sexual harassment complaint after another    im not kidding i have 12 complaints lobbied against me right now ive already had 2 title ix hearings and i have a scheduled meeting with the dean over a possible expulsion usually they just made me retake the seminars when i fucked up but ive gone to them 6 times now and always walked away thinking i got it but every time i tried to practice what they teach i kept getting more and more complaints    i dont understand what the fuck i keep doing wrong its actually gotten to the point i dont even understand what im doing at all anymore and theyre always classified as sexual misconduct even though none of them had any sexual intentions behind it nor were any of them physical    and the weird part is i never had this problem before up until now talking to another human being was a rarity but now after trying to practice the stuff they teach in the seminars i keep having this bullshit pressed against me and im fucking losing it
kill em all
  what did they teach you 
  you are going to have to be more specific about what they teach you and what you actually do for /adv/ to help you be honest now op or this thread is pointless
lmao amerimutts
sjws teaching sexual harassment and body language seminars  i feel like those would backfire spectacularly
  holy shit this is the state of america
i want to become fully apolitical but i already have a renome of being very involved with politics and current events    how do i do this
be a white straight middle class american dude with no mental or physical problems and all your friends be carbon copies of yourself
first time here   depression  refuses to do the assignments in college    i know when the time comes they will kick me out of collegue  the day comes and i am ready for the beat up of my mother   today she bought me the ps3 i have been requesting    my face when in 3 days she will know i have been kicked out and the recently bought ps3 and ps4 will be smashed to bits
what advice are you looking for
nah i was just bored i wanted to write it to feel better
  ah in that case good luck bro should check out the /gioyc/ thread its for posts like these although atm its kind of a shit show
  nvm look like it got back on track
get a job and pay her back
no energy left no motivation
so this is the mug shot of the guy who swatted people for no reason and everyone on reddit was talking about how ugly he is and making fun of him the thing is my face shape looks really similar to this so im wondering if that means im really ugly as well i know this is really dumb but id really appreciate it if you answer it cause im not really comfortable asking someone in person
  ones negative bias is going to have a gigantic influence over how they perceive someone hes a fuckwit with in unfortunate face but imagine he was a philanthropist or a discovered the cure for cancer rather than being some nerd that got a guy killed people would look at him much more favourably do some good in the world anon or at least be a decent person people will think much more highly of you if youre not a shitty person while having an unfortunate face
  do people make fun of you in public yell things at you point and laugh
  post pic and well judge
  he looks fine tbqh i think his facial hair and buzz cut are ugly as hell but thats just personal preference his ears are maybe a little big too if you look like that i wouldnt worry
  i respect your view but i think its bullshit theyre not making fun of his looks because he is a bad guy theyre just doing it cause him being ugly gives them a good reason to do it without feeling like an asshole nobody thinks stephen hawkings is ugly they just dont make fun of him because it makes them look bad      no and im sure they didnt do it to this guy either im just wondering whether deep inside everyone thinks the same things about me that they were saying about this guy but just dont say it out loud
  i thought he looked fine except from his hair too if im honest but thought maybe i want him to look fine cause otherwise it would mean im ugly too everyone on reddit talked about him like he is the ugliest guy alive though
  well you dont know that about him    people make rude comments about me just about everyday thats how i know im ugly     also mug shots are not the most flattering photos typically
i know this is the easy answer but taste is subjective ive shown my friends women i thought were 9/10 but they all said all the girls i like are really ugly even tho i showed them literal models i always thought i was ugly too fat unkempt facial hair kind of thrusting underbite but ive still had girls attracted to me it honestly baffles me how but it can happen just keep your chin up
  ask on photofeeler dot com
are people suppose to have fwb experiences when they are in their 20s    im been abstinent for the far majority of my 20s due to depression and after my depression i focused hard on building myself getting /fit/ and career path so a girlfriend wasnt an option lately ive had people tell me what you went youre whole twenties without sex why didnt you have a fuck buddy like everyone else ive heard the same thing from several people
so a girlfriend wasnt an option    nice cope
  no
  are people suppose to have fwb experiences when they are in their 20s  no although given what else youve written its not like it would make you any worse than you already are
  yeah in your teens and early 20s its relatively common it depends on the person a lot of times you might hook up with someone you know from class or part time work or whatever and youre like aw hell yeah im in now we can be in a relationship and go visit europe together and move in and well have matching th and they tell you that theyre not looking for a relationship right now but will still call you to come over its a sort of consolation prize sometimes its the girl who does it and other times its the guy    the last time i had a fwb i was 25
  how can you have a gf when youre a mess    see that sounds like a wreck tho imagine you like the girl but she only wants sex with you and shes fucking other guys at the same time thats literally being a cuck
  unless youre just one of the dudes fucking her that doesnt give a shit as much as she does    yeah if you catch feelings its a shit situation but thats what the movie from your op is all about    ultimately i think a fuck buddy is just for scared people who are too afraid to commit
  thats literally being a cuck    well no its not being a cuck would be if you were in a relationship with her and she fucked other guys while you watch sitting in a corner of the room    generally speaking too if a girl doesnt want to be in a relationship shes not going to try and juggle a bunch of guys around her schedule that defeats the purpose of her having time to herself and not having drama in her life    the closest thing i had to a cuck scenario was one girl i was banging was also friendzoning some poor incel and had to have me run out the door at not even 6am halfdressed cause i spent the night there and he would show up to ride the bus with her to school and i assume hold her purse and open doors for her and things like that hoping that all those things would make her have sex with him
  ultimately i think a fuck buddy is just for scared people who are too afraid to commit    pretty much this one night stands are great but speaking from personal experience it always gets weird sooner or later like if youre gonna fuck and then hang out and watch tv and make supper together and fuck again and spend the night and whatever else youre in a relationship technically thats probably more intimacy than a lot of relationships actually but either you or the other person are too insecure or whatever to actually make it official
  but at the end of the day it is still enjoyable to bust inside of someone its definitely not all bad
  ultimately i think a fuck buddy is just for scared people who are too afraid to commit  what about ons    wew thats pretty bad it would be painful tho to like a girl have sex with her have her not see you the same way and then go suck off other dudes at the same time not only that but if shes fucking other men then that puts you at a risk of stds
  how can you kiss and make out with someone you dont care for tho that sounds extremely unappealing regardless of how attractive they are
one of my friends had a bad taste with his friend he had benefits with his female roomate and one night he lost his fucking shit because his roommate came back late and when she got back to the apartment they sat on the couch together and started making out my friend said that she tasted weird so he asked her and he stopped kissing him freaked and said oh god i was just with this guy i forgot to and ran into the bathroom to brush her teeth
      one night stands are totally fine imo youre horny theyre attractive enough youre into them for the night nothing has to be made about it    but when youre too worried to admit you might actually get your feelings hurt and you just put up this barrier its immature bullshit just call it what it is instead of dancing that dance     the only time i think it can be actually alright is in a case where you know your relationship has a finite end date and theres no point in getting too emotionally connected for example hooking up when both of you are going back to college at the end of summer or a job is going to relocate them but id call that more of a short fling than fuck buddies
youre not supposed to do anything
  that all sounds dangerous tho regardless of how attractive someone is if they dont truly care about you then youre not in their best interests they could easily fuck you over and it happens a friend of mine got herpes from some girl who just forgot to tell him
  then why do so many people keep telling me im wasting my youth people try to guilt trip me by saying ill be old one day and bitter that i didnt experience young pussy
the only time i think it can be actually alright is in a case where you know your relationship has a finite end date and theres no point in getting too emotionally connected for example hooking up when both of you are going back to college at the end of summer or a job is going to relocate them but id call that more of a short fling than fuck buddies  why would someone do something like this when they already know it will hurt them do they have mental issues
  cause you probably will  do it if you want to not because someone else is telling you to  if you dont want to people will make fun of you if youre open about it though
  you probably will  see youre being just like them    how can you say you probably will
  most people like sex  its how the species reproduces  its not a brainless generalization to say you probably will regret not having sex with bitches in their prime
  its how the species reproduces  right but youre not saying to reproduce with young girls
  was also friendzoning some poor incel and had to have me run out the door at not even 6am halfdressed cause i spent the night there and he would show up to ride the bus with her to school and i assume hold her purse and open doors for her and things like that hoping that all those things would make her have sex with him  why the shit would you let her do that even if you dont care about the dude
  im not  i dont see what your point is
  i dont understand how you can say what i will or will not regret     maybe i should just rewire my brain to hate sex that would solve everything  right
  i said probably
  how is it that big of a deal tho i mean everyone misses things in life maybe youll never go scuba diving or something maybe i wont fuck 15 different girls maybe the next anon will never see bishkek
  it depends how you feel about it most people feel that its a big deal
  why its not need its a want like many other things
  because people who like sex tend to reproduce and pass on whatever gene made them like sex
  but hooking up with thots isnt reproducing    why are humans so dumb that we still follow animalistic instincts
  not anymore troglodyte  the hedonists that engage in the kinds of arrangements like op suggested are the first ones to do everything they can to eliminate the chance of having a kid
  i disagree with you and ive had plenty of one night stands yeah someone can fuck you over its why you dont leave your wallet and watches and shit out where someone can take them or be such a heavy sleeper when you bring home a random person that they can exploit you    protip you probably have herpes and just dont know it yet he probably had herpes before her most people have it and are normally asymptomatic      well you kinda are eventually youre going to age out of banging hot 20 year olds it might not be in your 30s 40s or even 50s but this is something that wont be available to you unless youre extremely well off or want to pay for sex its one of those get it in while you can things      there is nothing that will hurt you about having sex with someone for a couple of months and enjoying your time together while admitting you cant make it work i spent a wonderful winter over a month with a girl where we had sex enjoyed our friends kept each other warm and then went back to reality at the end of it all going back to school and being interested in people more compatible than us
  your monkey brain thinks it is and it will reward you for it    sometimes even people who arent degenerates still like sex there is far less incentive to have a kid if you dont like sex
  i forgot to mention ive been saying im not a fan of shitty fwb shit just trying to lay down a distinction and explain why people feel that way      why do we do anything that feels good that isnt productive youre going to get hit by a bus one day out of the blue or get some terminal illness in a much more likely way than passing in your sleep in your 90s when youre sitting on your deathbed and the reality of your bleak pointless existence is weighing you down you might wish you spent time doing shit that just felt good      why do you do anythig
  this sounds narcissistic and apathetic desu youre just using someone over a few months maybe they actually like you and then you just ditch someone is getting hurt
  why do you do anything  i go to the gym to be healthy i have a career to make money to support living and to be healthy
  youre just using someone over a few months maybe they actually like you and then you just ditch  its still more honest than serial monogamy of modern dating
  nah were mutually happy with an experience we know isnt going to last what should we have done ignore our interest in each other try desperately to endure a long distance relationship between arizona and tennessee or maturely accept its not the right time but we could enjoy each others company      sorry i didnt realize id typed that it was supposed to be the part above about productivity but there are things in your life like shitposting on 4chan that you enjoy that are ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme of things      its always weird when weve argued in a thread like two days ago and out of the blue you agree with me
    this happened to me she left after 3 months of what i thought was serious dating     shit happens man sack up it still hurts and its been longer than the time we even dated and she still like checks on my snapchat stories and shit     who cares life is gonna hurt some times wait until youre old and its harder to feel these emotions then shit starts to really suck get hurt while you can feel while you can     theres this really good louis sketch on this topic 
  i still think youre a degenerate its just something youre open about its much more bothersome dealing with degenerates who are nevertheless convinced whatever theyre doing is somehow good   if i had to pick one i would prefer a society where half of the people were like you and the other half actually do care about waiting as opposed to the mess we have now
how do i get an fwb
  tinder but expect to get hurt
how does a fwb thing differ from a relationship    you hang out and spend time together you have intimacy you go out and get dinner together travel whatever    is the only difference that she is free to fuck other people at the same time
  you do whatever you want when youre not together and youre perfectly fine with leaving each other alone she is free to fuck other people but so are you
  ok but what if i dont want to fuck other people that would make me a cuck right i mean i wouldnt want her to fuck others either
  if you choose to let her fuck others but you wont then you are choosing to be a cuck
  then you want a normal relationship and not fwb
  i wouldnt want a woman im intimate with to fuck others    ok so i still confused    is a fwb thing basically an open relationship because they sound identical     like a fwb thing seems like a normal relationship minus the fact the girl can fuck others which makes it seem like an open relationship
  its like an open relationship youre like a part time couple one big advantage is the lack of things like jealousy lies drama you both understand that you are together when you want but also dont need any possessive feelings and worry about the relationship
  he would show up to ride the bus with her to school and i assume hold her purse and open doors for her and things like that hoping that all those things would make her have sex with him    haha damn
  the point is youre just friends the expectation is that at any given point in time you or the girl can say yo i dont want to do this anymore and the other person genuinely is fine and done with it too with no hard feelings you go back to being semidistant friends who will occasionally see a movie or grab a beer like you would with one of your guy friends which is of course difficult to do     the benefit is no one can really accuse you of monkey branching you have a thing for the hot girl at starbucks go for it youre not cheating you really fall for someone else great end the fwb thing i personally think its mainly just people pretending they cant get hurt if they dont say certain things like they know this person is going to cheat on them but they maintain the illusion of control by saying bbbut we were never in a relationship anyways    but you keep saying intimacy which is missing the point theres no romantic gestures no obligations to see each other on a certain amount of days no anger if someone doesnt text back no surprise gifts or dinners at home its carnal sex not intimacy
  swapping body fluids and pleasuring your partner in intense orgasm isnt intimate  ok    so basically from the rest of what you wrote fwb is a label for consensual cucking this is what it sounds like consensual cheating
i seriously cant find a girl to have sex with let alone make an arrangement like that  not a virgin even
  it is literally impossible to cheat in a fwb situation by definition
  if one partner doesnt want to fuck other people then they are getting cucked
  why would you agree to that arrangement then  also i dont think you know what cucking actually means
  you said fwb means both parties can see other people i dont want to fuck other girls i dont want her to fuck other dudes
   i dont want to fuck other girls  your choice but why would you agree to the arrangement then are you stupid
  then dont get into a friends with benefits situation no one is forcing you hell fwb doesnt necessarily guarantee anyone is fucking anyone else it just kinda leaves the option open you could even come to an fwb arrangement and be monogamous if you talk it through like a respectable adult but all i could really see that being is were not going to make any commitment to each other and are only going to fuck when its convenient but absolutely no hanging out or sleeping over or dinners or whatever      swapping fluids and pleasuring your partner in intense orgasm  holy shit do you really think this is what sex is like every time im not even sure youve ever masturbated much less had sex     this is  hop in bed  bust a nut as quickly and conveniently as possible  kick them out  smoke a bowl and go to bed
so i had a routine exam for work an ultrasound and it appears that i have some very fine stones like sand in my kidneys   people tell me to drink water but will that be enough to pass that shit out of my system
  its just some shit in your kidneys man no big deal just let it pass through im wondering what caused it though
  start drinking cranberry juice theres something in it that erodes the stones so youll probably wont even notice when you pass them make it a part of your daily routine and you shouldnt have to worry about it again
  used to eat a lot of salt and didnt drink too much water nor any liquid      thanks will add it to my rutine
how much caffeine can i consume before i stop getting any benefits from it i want to order some caffeine pills and gum to consume on the way to work because a regular cup of coffee doesnt do it for me anymore also what would the effects of snorting a crushed up caffeine pill be would it be better than regularly ingesting it
  i dont know about snorting but i have smoked coffee once not purely coffee grounds though it was mixed with some weed the joint burned very evenly and the whole time i didnt know whether to feel baked or alert     anywho youre better off sticking to drinking the damn thing no milk creamer or sugar take that shit fullon black yeah thats right get blackedcom find the strongest you can get your hands on youll know when it kicks
  it was mixed with some weed the joint burned very evenly and the whole time i didnt know whether to feel baked or alert  thats interesting were you feeling that way for the entire duration of the high
  smoking coffee  hermano
  yeah that sounds fucking awesome its probably perfect for the kind of person who does their best work or has their best ideas when theyre stoned ive developed many algorithms that i probably wouldnt have thought of if i wasnt bake out of my gourd at the time but damn if it doesnt just put me to sleep half the time
    mostly before i peaked i could feel the substances clash they melded after some time and i went about my business playing vidya or whatever     it tastes exotic as it sounds idk if id recommend it lol its just a confusing mix i was bored that one time and i didnt have enough bud for one joint
  as someone who got caffeine poisoning a couple of times i can tell you that you need less caffeine not more of it especially if youre considering snorting caffeine pills like some cracked out crackhead or something    energy drinks are actually not a bad choice theres something about the mix of caffeine with taurine and b12 and whatever other shit they put in there along with the flavors that make me much more alert than coffee or caffeine pills they also have more than enough daily caffeine in one can and it says exactly how much on the label so you know how much youre getting    i wouldnt fuck with pills unless youre diabetic or something and cant do energy drinks or you cant drink them for whatever other reason with pills you dont get the sense i took this much because i drank this much and my body feels it you just swallow it and sometimes tell yourself that its not working so you take an extra pill or two or three and soon enough youre throwing up all over the place with heart palpitations     if you really constantly feel groggy and cant focus or whatever consider medication like adderal          i used to roll green tea in joints when the weed i got was still relatively moist or i wanted to cut while still wanting to smoke a full sized joint and i had quit cigarettes already i dont know if it added much of an effect but smoking while drinking coffee or tea is always nice youre enhanced and also balanced
  yeah id like something like aderall ive tried it and found it was able to keep me more grounded and focused without being off the deep end jittery maybe the doctor would write me a prescription i wonder what would happen if i crushed up adderall tab and sprinkled it on the blunt
  chamomile  weed holy damn thats a buzz i miss sometimes
  i snorted ritalin once and i just felt awfully tweaked literally the first time i didnt know how tweaked even entered my vocabulary but i knew thats how i was feeling i swore to just take it orally after that day and then i snorted it the next few times afterwards instead
  i swore to just take it orally after that day and then i snorted it the next few times afterwards instead  kek this is how addiction begins
  yo those times were really something lol overall that shit got me laserfocused but only if i took it orally which i only ever did once heh all other times i felt invincible but more importantly to me my mind would switch off and i could attend to my papers and shit without being distracted
  how long did the high last i remember reading that nasal consumption makes for more powerful albeit short lived highs that may have only been about cocaine though
  orally about 3ish hours and that was half the tablet my first time takes 30 min to kick in     through the nose one tablet one hour high takes about 5 min to take effect holy fuck those were some fucking intense hours though i slept for 16 hours from practically putting my body on overdrive when it wore off i learned to stabilize the extreme fatigue with well black coffee and cigarettes     you want your mind and body to work properly take it with a glass of water lol otherwise have fun
  i have a lot of caffeine pill experience both orally and nasally its much better to just stick to coffee the side effects from the pills diarrhea anxiety dissociation cold hands and feet tremors profuse sweating diuresis are bothersome the ritual of getting coffee also gives you a good break from what youre doing and as far as tolerance goes i top out at 4 or 5 cups of coffee a day but got into the habit of 2 grams of pure caffeine coffee is also filled with antioxidants and other compounds that make you feel much better than just the caffeine and i have no desire to pull out sources so if you dont believe me just go to ncbi and search it up as for the snorting it clogs you up and believe it or not there is not much of an effect just save your nose for amphetamines caffeine pills doesnt even touch a 10mg adderall taken by mouth at any dose
  5 cups of coffee a day
today i finally told my father i want to drop out of college i dont like the stuff i have to study and im not motivated im interested in it and my college i live in italy doesnt really fit in this area of interest but instead focuses on software engineering and stuff thats strictly related im gonna go work to a place where i already did an internship and they liked me and the way i worked and meanwhile im gonna get some certifications comptia cisco microsoft  the problem is my father wants me to stay out of the house for most of the time he literally said 8 to 22 excluding meals and thats a problem because i also need to study for the exams practice with servers networking and stuff and also just relax a bit he also said that if he finds me at home when i shouldnt he will abandon me and my mother he thinks im gonna isolate myself and become an hikikomori or stuff like this and thats understandable i also started hating being always at home and i want to start going to the gym but hes going too far  do you have any suggestion for me im scared about having to work but im not gonna waste my time in college because im not gonna accomplish anything if im not willing to study
  honestly your dad sounds based he should just kick you out 22 and still leeching off parents get your own place
  im 19 its fine to get my own place but at least let me get started and earn enough money to move somewhere else even tho i dont see a reason to do it why should i live alone if i can stay here and help my parents so that i dont be a burden
  shut the fuck up kid    if you have to work you have to work i think youre making the right decision by pursuing the field you have some investment in your dad sounds like a bit of a pussy desu abandon you and your mother the fuck is that but you cant really get around it if youre living with him i say tough it out for a bit and save money until you can find someone to move out with then get the hell out of there
why are you not asking us where you can work between 9 and 21 where you could study and do your computer stuff  your dad has went out in the wilderness for months to bring you back his pay and you are like muh im not eating solid food anymore you can throw your effort away you should be happy he doesnt break your face pay him some serious rent and extra for the wasted tuition etc and if he asks you to bark like a dog bark     but what you should really do when you get a job earn money and need a place to study do computer stuff etc is rent a studio small place you can not become a man under another man
  also if you need somewhere to study outside of home you could go to the local library
  dont listen to this garbage you cant become a man period if youre going to let your dad stick his dick down your throat as a matter of fact you should tell him to fuck off and become the man of the house
    thank you anon ill try my best    go fuck yourself you didnt get a single point right just to let you know my college doesnt cost shit especially because im in the first semester of my first year so money is not an issue here making him pay years of college without me making any effort that would be a real waste of money and at that point he really should break my face being honest with him was objectively the best choice and it was not an easy choice
im 22 and about to leave my parents home currently looking for flats to rent and have an appointment today for a viewing i work a typical cashier job mostly nightshift and im going to go to university next year i feel like moving out is necessary    for the next years when i move out i expect lots of new things to learn about life i will learn how to stand on my own feet    the only thing i cant keep out of my head is leaving my parents alone in this big house mostly my mother they argue all the time my mom has been sleeping in my room for months now when its holiday time they come together rest of the year they keep on beefing how can i leave her behind in this toxic environment with my dad and my brother who is a total failure complete druggie and keeps on piling up felonies i dont want to leave her behind but leaving this environment feels like the right thing to do
 your parents raised you from when you were nothing to who you are now    in life you dont have to owe your parents anything but if you feel like leaving will be a hardship on your mother then the best way is to leave with love    let your mother know you care privately speak to her about how youre happy for what shes done and you will visit    when you have time come home visit her maybe bring her a gift of love it is one of the most important things you can give someone like your mother    maybe this will help or not but go ahead anon
im 19 and working for a year before going to college and other than working i live like a neet i just come home and play switch/listen to new albums my friends are all either in college or were just not as close as we where in high school i dont really know how to go about making new friends since im kind of awkward i can tell my parents are depressed by me and im even starting to miss hanging out with people
  and sites like meetupcom  might also fight the loneliness through discord communities     after you enter college you get a lot more opportunities to meet people eg clubs classes
  volunteer work    and spend some of your time reading books from your first uni courses
are unattractive people just doomed to not be happy sexually    im a somewhat ugly dude who used to believe in incel bullshit but ive been meeting people and among these i met two ugly girls one of them is the sweetest soul ive ever met she is nice intelligent resourceful all that whole thing not even fat just unfortunate face genetics now i am not attracted to her but someone as nice as her does deserve a so but she doesnt have one and i feel it makes her sad    so thanks to this i realized that women dont really have it any better than men rather than women vs men its ugly people vs pretty people and ugly people always get the short end since its all about looks and were the ugliest ones what do you think adv is it possible to find someone youre attracted to if youre ugly
  99 of people who meme about being ugly and unattractive are that only because they put absolutely no effort into their appearance of course when you have lego hair and a unibrow and a neckbeard youre not going to be as attractive as you could be fix your face    muh genetics    oh shut up    if youre that fucked up then get plastic surgery    and speaking as someone who can either be a 3/10 or a 7/10 depending on the effort you should always aim to be with someone who is attractive as you but it doesnt hurt to sometimes aim low
  nigga ugly people fuck at ten times the rate attractive people do there are roughly a billion ugly people fucking right now as we speak there is zero reason you cant be one of them youre never gonna get laid if your solution to the problem is sitting around on a scandinavian hackey sack forum to complain about people who are better off than you
  i feel sexually attracted to an ugly person because im insecure and i would feel anxiety with a beautiful person so i would not be able to enjoy sex with someone beautiful
  eh not really id say most people i meet do put some effort in their appearance for example i get regular haircuts use facial care products try to keep a 3day shave length to somewhat make up for no chin pluck eyebrows yadda yadda yadda but at the end of the day my face is very round for a male i have a weak chin my nose is too broad and bulbous my hair is way too thin to style well my ears are too big my eyes are unexpressive and shit brown etc all of these are things i have no real control over    but i mean i know the main reason is me im just talking that it seems that everybody aims for the 10/10 despite being 5s themselves and it makes me think that maybe as an ugly person you just cant win 
thats objectively wrong    unattractive women have significantly more sexual partners on average than attractive women
  if you were really not incel anymore youd see    a personality and power often in the form of money supercedes looks in men  b its easy to lay a hot girl if you find one with attachment issues    also bonus tip the majority of people learn sexual attraction to their partner over time seeing how most people arent models and eventually get old and fat
  im good looking and ive never had a girlfriend
  money mmay supercede but that doesnt mean she is going to be sexually attracted to you
  are unattractive people just doomed to not be happy sexually  no im ugly and i found a wife
  the most common problem i find is that you can usually tell if they have a shit attitude just by looking at them people as dumb as 4chan seems to think they are are quite intuitive when it comes to those kinds of things and usually swerve on them on the whole
  why arent you attracted to beautiful people
bump
i see in my everyday life conventionally ugly people with a convebtionally beautiful partner all combinations ugly guy beautiful girl etc    i think this robotic rate system thats in fashion now is fucking up a lot of minds dating apps too    i cant stand people talking about appareance online anymore wish we were all bodyless     sorry op im not helpingz just felt like venting a bit
  what are some good indicators of a shit attitude
  plastic surgery doesnt do anything about genetic inferiority anon
  everyone is ugly
  even ugly girls want chad even more so than pretty girls because ugly girls cant have chad so they crave him more  basically dont bother anon
  and ugly guys want stacy
  ugly guys just want to not be so fucking lonely desu
  its the same for girls you wont even take the time to get to know the unattractive girls to even find out
  sometimes i do but i cant be myself around them because of my own insecurity one time i had sex with a 9/10 and i was so focused on how ugly i must look to that person it was not fun the person im currently seeing is quite ugly but has a really likable personality so i feel motivated to do my best during sex while also enjoying myself
  because the unattractive girls are all craving chad anyway trying to fit in the rest of the girl group that worships him or are unattractive because theyre fat
  im  and im an ugly girl so
  you seem to be an expert on what women want despite being a kissless virgin male
  do you think your partner would like the fact that you see them as ugly do they know
  certainly not an expert just a former shutin that decided to go to college and turn shit around i always thought all these incel chad stacey memes were overly exaggerated but they were all confirmed when i joined the real world  so no im not an expert but all these unattractive girls at my college are still all the time trying to hang out with the groups that are orbiting chad
  i think he knows hes ugly lol i dont need to tell him
  same for girls  when a 3/10 can get 100 replies on tinder and potentials dicks ready
  what makes him ugly
  this  thats why i believe in friendzone as a device to get laid when ill find one girl that wholy turn me on ill go for her in the meantime i meet interesting people and overcome my anxieties
  men are desperate fucks who will stoop very very low for sex and sell out their ethics and beliefs for a crack at pussy  this is womens fault  dont ever let yourself fall into this mindset because that will destroy your chances of even friendships with people it sucks but rest assured men are very much on their own accounts to have standards its not womens fault that men are fucking slovenly
  i had a cute girlfriend in high school dispite being hella ugly but she was one of those hippy dippy types who cried at the sight of paul mccartney one time we never fucked     nothing since fooled around twice with one out of my league girl after 3 years of flirting and another homely girl otherwise im probably forever alone and im ok with it
pretty sure im not ugly but im socially retarded so im pretty sure im gonna be a wizard just the same most days it doesnt seem like the end of the world having something else to focus on helps
  not him but its a bit shitty because it raises the value of girls so much  if even an ugly girl can get sex with average dudes as a below average dude what chance do i have with any girls
  get a girl who is okay with communication in the bedroom and trying new things that quality is not restricted to a standard of beauty
  women dont really have it any better than men  lol
yes the sexual marketplace is like any other marketplace and the economic system in the sexual marketplace is laissezfaire capitalism     monogamy  socialism  sexual revolution  capitalism  tinder/social media/etc  ancap    if people have options for the best theyll pick the best simple why settle for less  also ugly women have it far easier than ugly men but attractive men have it easier than an ugly woman she could find someone maybe not to her ideal but shell find a fuck buddy at the very least
  i feel it makes her sad  you are unironically projecting your own thoughts into her
  is there a marxist analysis on the sexual market
  thats because for very attractive women being able to pursuit the top men having the fame of being an easy girl would be harmful for finding one of them as a suitable longterm partner also they inevitabily have so big standards than find someone worty of cheating is more difficult  middly attractive women instead join the sex carousel in their youth to boost their confidence
  why putting causality in this direction arent girls uglier if they are easier to fuck   so that at some point the hottest girls are those who are really really hard to get
  this is the sort of simplistic materialist/modernist thinking that leads to insanity like believing the 80/20 rule applies to sex  economics is the retarded stepbrother of political science and polisci is philosophy for morons  no people are not commodities no sex is not a trade good no the search for a spouse is a not a laissezfaire capitalist theoretical marketplace that is as fuckwitted as feminism  i know ill use dialectical materialism but replace the classes with the sexes thatll be keen who cares if communism is a train wreck i am positive itll work this time  human interactions are based on virtue not monetary value put down atlas shrugged and pick up how to win friends
  see    its called feminism
most of the time you dont exercise or someshit if youre really unattractive your parents would be closely related
  we havent had a world war in a long time that definitely made it easier to hookup in the past its given girls the idea to be picky
  virtue not monetary value  virtue is a value though
  stop thinking in reductionist terms where value means treat it like money  i value beauty but a sunset has no cash equivalent
  holy shit that looks exactly like me except im not gray yet
just do orthotropics anon there is no such thing as genetic attractiveness youll become more attractive over time if you take it seriously  speaking from experience
  there are so many misconceptions flying around on /adv/ that really boil down to failures of perception on a fundamental level like this one

hey folks    im a university student in the uk and ive been pretty big into games for the past couple of years but recently i just havent felt much engagement from playing them my days for the past month have consisted of browsing the internet flicking from site to site waiting until i can next eat food to break up this monotony    what do people do to pass the time i asked my friends who dont play games and they all just tend to watch netflix and browse social media all day on their phones but im a person who needs constant interactivity binging shows only takes me so far    what kind of hobbies exist which allow you to do them for hours on end like gaming    also i know a common suggestion will be to get a job but i do have classes for uni and id rather not work during crunchtimes plus i live in a really small town with a massive student population  so not many jobs are available    thanks /adv/

  im 28 i was probably depressed for a while but i dont really get like that anymore managing being sad became a hobby of sorts and now the kinds of things i mainly enjoy are those that are directly gratifying like exercise cooking and eating and spending time with friends as a result i think im seen as kind of boring but i guess my old personality is toast
  why did you abandon us
  is taxation theft
why do i suck/ tense up when talking to the girl i like but say all the right things with girls i just want to fuck
im in a position where my number has been passed around as a professional academic writer that doesnt mind working with arabs this one guy called me again this morning and he wants an article reviewed but hes an obvious cheater i declined the work last time should i report him to his university this time or just decline it again keep in mind these are the kinds of oil money arabs who wont do anything with their degree anyway theyre just being sent here either as punishment for crashing the bugatti or because their parents want them out of their hair not the ones that come on a student visa and stay
fuck off who cares i hope if you snitch on them they kill you and i this is coming from someone who hates arabs
  yo i have that same nerf gun
  this is /adv/ anon
theres this girl ive met about 2 months and a few weeks ago i realized how much i liked her and had a crush on her fast forward some stuff happens and now weve been dating for a few days ive never had a gf or felt this way about anyone so im not sure what to do or how to feel i told her the day after we first started going out that i love her because i just couldnt help it and i do turns out people wait a couple months to say something like that ive been thinking about it looked online and the problem is that apparently i might just be infatuated with her and not actually love her i really dont want to be infatuated justwith her i really want to love her
  stop crying over it and just enjoy your time with her dont bring it up and just enjoy your lifeif you two feel the same in a few months or the right time then enjoy it but if your a little bitch like your acting like its only going to make it worse    sorry tough love just dont be a bitch
  you have to realize you dont actually know this person youre probably infatuated with her because since you dont actually know her well enough youre in love with your idea of who she is rather than the reality
  what did she say though
  stop complaining and just enjoy yourself have a good time and dont think about the future i wish i was in you situation so just be happy besides it really doesnt matter in the long run because im sure you wouldve said it to each other eventually 
  slow down champ or youll blow it it is ok to describe infatuation as love the word love has many meanings im sure she knew what you were saying if she didnt she would probably have freaked out that you were being too clingy and moving too fast and all that what im saying is all is fine this is not something you need to fix just enjoy go hold hands and see a movie also plan something less mundane with her like go snowboarding or something
i fucked up really bad this time  fucked a girl raw because the condoms didnt fit she said she would take the pill but now she fucking said to me she doesnt want to take the pill fuuuuuuuuuuccccckkkkkkkk  how do i get out of this im fucking panicking what if she gets pregnant   she will take my money and everything that i have if she gets pregnant   this bitch thinks she is slick huh im 100 gonna kms if she is pregnant i wont be a fucking slave  pls gib advice bros
  what if she gets pregnant  oh anon you really dont understand what happens after unprotected sex
  it was one day after her period ended and she said because of that i dont have to worry about anything  and i didnt even cum inside of her  what the fuck do i know i was a fucking virgin until recently
  enjoy fatherhood
  my boy is going to be a daddy    they grow up so fast 
  i see guys run free all the damn time without having to pay for getting a girl pregnant nothing happens till you get married or you do something retarded like sign the birth certificate with her    stop fucking worrying and enjoy nutting in her pussy if she gets pregnant you can tell her to fuck off and that its a problem you warned her about
  oh buddy we told you so by now youre best to monitor her closely
  get facial plastic surgery and move to the other end of the country the 10k you spend on that is cheap compared to 18 years of child support youll thank me later friend
  what are you going to name your little fleshy ball
  until the state hunts you down and tells you to pay the 80000 that you owe your baby mamma
  if you slip a plan b to her you will go to jail for 10 years for premeditated homicide not even kidding
  the state doesnt move just because some ho whined at them they need pretty substantial evidence that it is indeed the kid of an individual plus its actually pretty costly to get people into maury situations and thats just too much for drama for women    if you remember the michael jackson case that only took off because he was a celebrity and it kept spinning in circles just because of how easy it was to fight off yet again because he was a celebrity
the condom didnt fit  kek
  condom didnt fit hahahhaha
  bro there is like a 5 chance the bitch gets prego if you raw dog and cum inside her on her most fertile day stop freaking out
  if you didnt cum inside her and if shes being truthful about when her period ended you should be fine i doubt shell get pregnant from it    it is a fact that emergency contraception fucks with hormones and menstrual cycle but she is a bitch for promising to take it and then not doing so fuck her not literally    next time if condoms dont fit or whatever dont let your horniness take over stop and just do oral instead or something maybe also a lesson not to do one night stands get a gf instead and have her go on birth control pill
  kek
  nigga ever heard of pulling out that shit was my only protection in my teens and i was never in 16  pregnant pulling out has to be the most effective form of protection
  most effective    i was gonnaention this shit i heard some guys cant stop or time it lol wtf just pull out when it feels to good why tempt fate
u know u done fucked up right
wrap it up boy i literally will not let my boyfriend not use a condom if he cums inside me and i have to fuck with my hormones or get an abortion hes dead
  some people like my bf literally cant control it i feel like some people like us have a good handle it we know when its building up and could even edge for him its from 0 to 100 hes suddenly cumming oh shit sorry kind of like how some people sneeze really fucking loudly and cant control it while others can sneeze silently/hold it in no prob
  one day after period  didnt cum inside  so she wasnt ovulating and you didnt cum inside chances of impregnation are very low like extremely low dont worry about it
im having great trouble focusing on college i know i need to do it i know how important it is but i just cannot focus im constantly anxious im lethargic and sluggish my thoughts often feel incoherent its like im delirious
why am i here why am i here
  existential dread sucks buddy i feel ya       talk to a therapist and sort out the immediate issues
i know exactly how you feel do something rewarding that has nothing to do with school but just makes you feel good remember what reward feels like motivation to do good in school and get rewarded with that degree
  do you smoke weed
  no alcohol drugs or parties at least until finals are over     reward your self with a few rounds of a shooter game when you get to a good stopping point with work    make sure you have a good sleep schedule
ive been dating s girl for like 2 months but havent even seen her in almost a month we barely talk via text she just disappears all the time she works retail and im unemployed but have enough income for dates and stuff so we kinda work around her schedule since she gets it week by week in her retail job shes been too busy for a date for several weeks and hasnt even bothered telling me her schedule we exchange a small handful of messages maybe 20 at maximum a day and none of them are anything of substance i talked to her about this issue of no quality time or communication last weekend and she said she would make an effort to talk more this week but nothing has really changed  i guess my question is how i can somehow fix this or if i should break up with her
    sounds like you guys arent even dating    get a job but honestly she is probably cheating on you been in your shoes before big guy
  been trying to get a job theres not a lot in my area though except food service and thats my limit    but yeah ive thought about if shes cheating honestly at this point it doesnt even bother me cause like you said it doesnt feel like were dating im planning on waiting til its been a full month a few days from now since our last date and then ill try and break up with her im a wuss though so who knows if i will thanks anyways anon
    look for jobs in security honestly trust me there are plenty of jobs in that field
  yeah ive seen a lot but theres requirements i dont meet honestly no that im basically single again ive lost that big motivation to get a job
  shes not interested move on
  im unemployed but have enough income  does not compute  if you have amassed enough wealth to have a livable passive income you would not be unemployed your nature would not allow it
 nice relationship with my gf   broke up after 5 years    fast forward 4 years    successful anon   anon goes out a lot travels goodtimejpg   alcoholic    ex comes back to me but with a child she had with chad thug nigga   feel it could be my escape from alcohol     wat do  open the war against alcohol alone or take the easy but risky way with my ex 
dont do it  alcohol  step sons
  as an alcoholic who works with other alcoholics frequently that plan is doomed to fail cant tell you the number of times an alcoholic or drug addict thought having kids or a family would somehow give them the motivation to clean up and stop drinking i heard one ladys story saying how happy she was she was pregnant because she knew being a mother would save her from her addictioninstead she gave birth to a dopesick baby it was pretty sad
anon im not planning to make a child   ex gf comes back to me 3 weeks ago then we had sex she comes to my house twice a week we spend good time eat play watch tv speak a lot the difference is that now she has a 15 years old black boy   i became an alcoholic in the last year we quit in 2012 and i saw her for the first time 3 weeks ago   i have money successful  career work contacts     i was with her for 4 days now and didnt drink at all for me it looks like an escape gate     btw im not a big alcoholic i drink 1day/3 67 beers but i feel i cant control myself when alone
  life story almost the same   are you me    well short answer to this and what i told my ex is to fuck off with that bullshit  she not the same girl your fell in love with all those years ago she broken and used up and ready to bring your life down  let the hoe rot
  deep inside i know youve done the right thing but the feelings i get when shes with me is like im loved again i get interest and i drink no alcohol fast story explanation   i made some weird shit years ago and know every thug in the city and the neighbors cities and presented my ex to the thugs here and there big mistake then i got money though crypto and had a good life and now she steps back in when i have everything but an addiction problem which is starting
  willingly cucks himself    just drink yourself to death you degenerate cuckaholic
  do not take your exs child is this even a question
  escaping alcholism  getting back together with a single mom  choose one
raising another mans child  cant even control his own drinking habit  kill yourself
  the mistake you made was spending time with her i know its a weird thing to say but you let yourself fall in love again  hearing her voice again   remembering her small   bringing back the good memories     if i did anything of that with my ex we would be back together  i had to forcefully remind myself that this girl has hurt you before and will hurt you again given the chance  and theres also a chance she will hook up with big black chad again    if it was up to me dying alone with alcohol poisoning sounds better then living a miserable life with loose leg ex with nigger kid
  fucked in both situations kek       gtfo faggot ive seen / made more in my life that youll never see/make   i dont want to cuck myself but looking im for an escape that wont fuck off my life
  exactly my situation i dont know what the fuck i have to do     its the first time i saw such a good advice on this shity board i know youre right but how do i enforce this decision when she comes to my house      kek i think ill have to fix my alcohol demons alone im afraid like shit
  somone got triggerd by the truth where did say i was better than you letting yourself get cucked is bad didnt say anything about you as a person
   willingly cucks himself     no seriously i fall into alcohol like a shitbag     drinking with friends  drinking before going out  drinking alone  drinking to overcome the hangover  drinking to feel good     im a good man i wake up even if i drank the night before i make my shit happen i help people but i feel like im going to die if i fall deep into alcohol    maybe yes i got triggered sorry
  best bet is to be disgusting around her  in other words   open up about the problems you have now  remind each other how old they are  bring up times when she hurt you  all this because     women hate to see weakness in men  women like to live in the moment so dont remind them how much time has past  women hate it when they have to admit to being wrong or call out on doing bad   i guaranteed she will try to dodge those questions  the more you leave yourself open to her the more ways she will play with your feelings  be strong jew man
  i dont like showing weakness itll be a difficult step to make kek     anyway thanks for the discussion anon i wish you the best
  being an alcoholic is better than dating a single mother who will 100 take half your shit
  you dont know shit faggot explain yourself of dont even post absurd shit like this
  wow apologizing on the internet and even fucking on the chans kudos dude     but still really lets forget the cuck aspect it wont help your alcoholism kids are stress and worries it will make things worse probably drinking to relax drinking to cope with stress drinking to reward yourself no just no    maybe just maybe date her casualy like really casualy fwb or something like that
  kek you make me laugh thanks i was wrong when i answered last time the i apologized which seems normals to me     she doesnt drink and when im with her i dont have the cravings to drink i thought of this as an opportunity to make one month without alcool but im afraid to love her again after one month
  fwb is too dangerous then as you see most folks here say it is a bad idea apart from not even being your child rasing kids in itself is hard and you will cope relax whatever with alcohol im repeating myself you got your adv warnings and our opinons think analyze try to be honest and rational with yourself and decide
  but with a child she had with chad thug nigga  dont even think about it retard its not worth it at all
former alcoholic drank a handle a week of jameson since i was 23 im now 28 around my birthday about 3 weeks ago i decided to go without alcohol for one week did it very easily now i have maybe a beer a night    so in recap i went from about 15 shots of whiskey to 1 beer a night and feel great we all know alcohol is bad for us and kidney failure is listed as one of the most painful ways to die my uncle died from it its really fuckin easy bro you just literally stop drinking
  still too much daily alcohol is too much in any amount
  actually its not everything in moderation the physical effects of 16oz of whiskey vs 12oz of beer are vastly different my liver and kidneys will thank me
  lol triggered by the truth like my jewish friend always said facts dont care about your feelings
  single mother with a mutt baby  thats a big fucking no stay far away from that mess adding more problems to your life is only going to make it worse
  if what you posted here   is a fact check yourself faggot no truth or fact to see there       right in the feels   one problem against an other or one problem adding to the other   reeeeeee
  fuck no    there are other outlets and other roads you can take to help battle your alcoholism dont get roped into a child that isnt yours for the next 18 years not to mention that bitch doesnt love you she may say she does she may put out she may do everything she thinks you want to try to sucker you back in to be a beta provider and then drop it all the moment she gets you trapped in ive seen it a million times
    just chiming in to say dont do it    shes there for your money there may be feelings involved sure because things are rarely black and white but at a fundamental level this is what single mothers do they do everything they can to get a provider to pay for them and their kids on top of that youre loaded    go to alcoholism support groups watch some jordan peterson whatever it is do not let yourself get roped in and used like that she gave her best years to some other dude and now wants to give you sloppy seconds    this exact thing is happening to my buddy right now the girl is doing everything she can to sink her claws into him and we cant tell him anything because hes whipped she has two kids shes aging she doesnt have a job he pays for everything being on the outside i can see little things she does to try and hook him that arent normal hes also an alpha motherfucker so its just really weird hes falling for it    in the end its your life do what you want but needing a relationship is never a good basis relationships need to come from abundance and free choice
    chad  thug
i wouldnt
why havent i ever been able to get a girlfriend
because you have never asked a girl out
  oh blunt
  yeah thats probably pretty much the case
  i did once but she said no and never talked to me again
why do you think you havent been able to  we cant do all the detective work here
  too reserved just like me
  you just gotta put yourself out there op youll get rejected or have bad experiences sure but the trick is just to keep trying
  because youre fat and gay
    im 26 years old and never had a girlfriend before i met a girl literally 1 month ago and i wasnt even trying    i think it all comes down to just live your life meeting someone is all about fate and luck to be honest talk to women like friends and stop trying to get in their pants every chance you get and you just might get lucky one day
  if youre the quiet type to not initiate conversation this advice does not work not every male virgin is trying to get into every girls pants and laying back being friendly is going to get you nothing
  /thread
  youre not supposed to stop after one girl its like dying in a video game once and deciding never to play again even though you could easily devote time to git gud
  i never liked challenging video games
  dont complain about the game if you dont even put a modicum of effort into playing it
  video games are boring
  i put effort in them i just dont enjoy them
  because you dont ask for ehat you want and you live a boring life
  shit dawg ive spent thousands of hours in the gym coded fullstack websites during high pressure crunch times given a speech to 300 people wrestled a state champion wrestler sprinted up mountains at 5am and have met tons of people in several jobs    none of this shit none has ever given me more stress than thinking about girls im much happier now that i stopped thinking about them girls are an illusion
  meeting someone is all about fate and luck to be honest  fuck no if you talk to noone how can you expect that they will talk to you most people even more so women dont want to make the first step so its up to you
    its just a metaphor i hope women are enjoyable to you otherwise why complain about something you dont even want
everything above 20m mostly unsecured heights like thin grid stairs or platforms excluding cliffs and solid buildings and the like really fucking spooks me how do i beat height anxiety
you dont unsecured structures arent trustworthy and you should be on alert when traversing them
  not being able to go up on a simple scaffold is a massive disability imo  i dont know it just bothers me that i have it even though it doesnt change my life whatsoever i feel like its a sign of my cowardice
virtual reality simulation supposedly helps with that but you may have to accept that it will be with you to some extent as far as inheriting overkill instincts for selfpreservation goes at least you can live a mostly normal life with acrophobia
how do i push myself to do school and get good grades and study while not being well mentally
take it one day at a time one step at a time take it in pieces but not as an impossible whole give yourself time for the things you enjoy while making sure you get your work done too time management is key and the best way to approach that is to constantly be thinking abt how much time you need to do a task and always allow yourelf enough time
is it rude to tell a girl that likes me that asks me why im single that im happy being single until i meet the right girl should i come up with something more complex    i said this to a girl last night and she seemed totally demoralized i felt really bad is there a better way for me to say something like this
  depends on how you said it but from this post it doesnt sound like she had logical grounds to get upset
  she had a big crush on me and has a boyfriend now i dont show up a lot but shes trying to hook me up with someone/anyone but its of course a bummer that i dont think shes the right girl and that id rather be single than just going out on a date with her or having casual sex
  she wanted you to tell her youd like to go out with her and basically told her your not the one i think is the girl thats right for me and smashed her dream into bits     bet she came down to reality pretty hard lol
  i can see how it would imply that she isnt the right girl but thats really quite a mild insult all things considered depends on the context and the manner in which you said it but idk    maybe she was really into you and/or wasnt prepared for rejection
  thats a pretty standard answer
    she has a boyfriend
so today im going to break up with my long distance girlfriend ive been planning this for a while  my plan was to go up to her house and end it there so shes in a comfortable location and will have the support of her family after i basically planned to arrive and break up   this hasnt come to fruition however she is meeting me half was between mine and hers she wants to go for indian food and then go back to hers an hour train and then about the same on the bus   i know 100 that she will be crying for a long time afterwards and i dont think an indian restaurant is the best place to do that it seems unfair to do it there   the other option i can think of is to not bring it up until we get back to hers but that seems a little cruel as i will have to go several hours pretending nothing is up then suddenly spring it on her  is there a third alternative or a better way to do this weve been going out for quite a while and i really want to do it in the nicest way possible i would really appreciate any advice you have to give
  it doesnt really matter where you break up with her shes going to be just as upset at the restaurant as her house in fact you should probably just break up with her over a phone call it seems more selfish of you to plan this trip to meet her get her all excited to see you and then when you get to her house you end it
  phone dont waste her time
    is the phone really better would make it way easier for me but just seems kinda cold like i cant make the effort to do it in person plus she has depression and i want to make sure shes ok before i leave
  she has depression and i want to make sure shes ok before i leave  shes not going to be okay if she wasnt depressed she would still not be okay you are about to break her heart you are going to come across as cold no matter what at least dont waste her time by pretending you want to see her try to see things from her perspective
  it never crossed my mind that breaking up over the phone could be a possibility it just seems disrespectful   weve already made plans for tonight so from your point of view i should just call her when i finish work and break up over the phone
  why are you breaking up
  i dont know how you can consider breaking up over the phone disrespectful but not your original plan theyre both disrespectful but in my opinion the phone isnt as bad but break up with her however you want no ones forcing you to do it a specific way
  when we started going out we were in a similar place we would just get drunk all the time but now im trying to improve myself and she not only has no interest in doing the same but impedes my doing so also i have come to realize that our relationship is an unhealthy one were effectively codependent she is over reliant on me for emotional support and i was trying to fix her and feeling guilty about her being sad i put off breaking up with her for too long which i now realise was mostly due to the guilt of hurting her   im dealing with my own issues too and its hard dealing with them as well as with her problems  i really do want the best for her and think breaking up is best for both of us i just dont know how to do it in a compassionate way
  over the phone seems like i couldnt be bothered making the effort doing it in person allows me to explain my decision more effectively over the phone would be easier for me but probably harder on her   its possible i still feel guilty from how i ended my first relationship i was 15 and inconsiderate and did it over msn ive felt guilty ever since and told myself i would break up in person next time
try some where instead like a park go to the park instead if planned restaurant and break the news offer to take her home after you do it while shes upset so she isnt abandoned
  making her drive hours to meet you  just to break up  you deserve a special place in hell  a ldr break up has to be long distance phone internet everyrhing else is a waste of time and money you even get her all excited to meet you to just breal her heart which will make it even harder for her you fucking asshole rot in a hole
  thanks thats helpful but how do i change the plan without alerting to her that something is up if she starts to cotton on then we could end up breaking up in the train station which i really dont want
  giving such advice  kys      you dont sound like you want to break up with her stop being an indecisive beta bitch and break up right now over phone or fucking stay together   bbbut i still wanna meet her and say it in person  you want to make it extra painfull for her  fucking faggot people like you make it harder for actually decent guys
  dude please tell me how my advice was bad enough to earn a kys im genuinely curious and am willing to learn
  get her all excited  she pays for a ride to the location  awaits op with a heart full of joy  he put thought into this date best day of my life can finally see him again  he comes  breaks up  now offers to bring me home  he doesnt understand the pain i am in right now  his presence just makes it worse  i am all alone now crying my heart out in public and dont know what to do  great advice almost like you never were in a relationship before  why do happy go lucky people like you give advice on such things you think you are so nice and comforting but in reality you have not a single shred of empathy
  you sound bitter as fuck
  you sound underage as fuck  the world is not a flower garden you faggot its harsh and unforgiving stop acting like the world is nice and fair adults should have figured that out by themselves   remember this site is 18
  i get the impression this was written by someone whos wounds are still sore and is channeling that into his/her advice      alternative is  phonecall out of the blue  boyfriend breaks up with her  no emotional support  lost out on all the added communication of a face to face convo  now sat all alone in room crying and not really understanding what went wrong
  yea thats what i think she gets zero closure and becomes sure that the relationship she had was just made up in her head which hurts and drags on for months and months with possibilities in her head instead of her healing
if i was her id prefer it over the phone its going to suck either way just be respectful and talk her through why you have to do this
    i say it again underaged virgins leave this site  you never were in a relationship and never went through a breakup just shush     still thinking face to face is what a person wants in this situation  you can have all the same information exchange with a call and even messages you dumbfucks get a hold of yourselves  you do it face to face if you live close and actually visit often this is a fucking ldr not a real relationship
  why do you feel the need to attack everyone in the thread on a board designed to help people   60 of communication is non verbal which is why the phone seemed to me such an insincere way to do this in the first place   for anyone who cares im on my way to meet her now im meeting her near her house so ill ask her if heres a quiet place we can go and then try and do this in the nicest way possible thanks to everyone who helped even where the advice was bitter and aggressive
  because people are stupid and i have no sympathy for those people who have no lack empathy or knowladge in such specific subjects shouldnt give others adice on it its that simple you can only discourage them by being an asshole
  for someone who talks about empathy you seem very unready to see opposing points of view from your own you preach cynicism which could be fairly damaging for some of the suggestive people who come to this board for help im glad im not so impressionable as to have taken your advice im op although that is the danger of /adv/ you will only find mixed conjecture based on the personal experience of the posters    the based op uses it as a last resort to see if they are missing any point of view and wont take your aggressive and ultimately negative posts to heart
  meanwhile in the real world she calls up her backup guy friend and promotes him to bf after a good dicking
  no need to ruin everyone elses dinner at a restaurant have some respect for others
for anyone who cares ive realised the fatal flaw in my plan i was going to spring a break up on her out of the blue which would probably have been the most distressing part of all im waiting for her now ive listed all the issues in our relationship so we can work through them together if we cant then a breakup wont be such a crushing and horrible surprise if we do then great obviously     thanks to everyone including the bitter guy
  lol you really live in your own little 4chaninduced reality huh
  good for you op i hope you guys can make things work remember not to threaten with a break up either give her an honest chance to shape up ideally offering your full support with no strings attached and only mention the idea of ending things if its clear she takes you for granted
im a 27 old kv and lets be honest i think im too far gone to ever be able to get into relationships the problem im having is i still want good social status is that possible without a girlfriend
  if youve managed to maintain a well paying job and a decent amount of friends then yes youll just be the rich guy who focused on bettering himself rather than focus on a relationship
ive had an on again off again crush on my friend 27 v no gf so i wouldnt say youre beyond redemption buddy some people are just awkward but to answer your question you do not need a girlfriend to have social standing but it will definitely be a different standing once people start having families not necessarily a bad thing but its there
yeah for sure my friends think im fucking a different girl every night when in reality ive never even kissed a girl  and i didnt even lie i just acted natural and they made assumptions
  i make 25k in texas what if i just become fit and dress well can that work i water fast so i can save alot of money just on that salary
  oops well i made the mistake of telling the truth at my job am i screwed they keep trying to hook me up with ugly women and single moms im good on that
  like anime  black  plays video games  draws anime  owns onaholes  yeah im not holding breath i rather pursue something i can actually control in 2018
  if thats a description of you none of those things would disqualify you for dating for me at least altho you dont really share you masturbatory details unless asked ngl your pessimistic attitude is probably not helping its kinda the same thing dragging the dude i know down i know it must fucking suck but nobody likes a debbie downer as much as that sucks too
  reality/being negative  sorry im not one to ignore the fact that everything i do isnt considered social acceptable especially in the black community
  im sure its not the end of the world
  are you messing i dont know a single black guy not into anime thats harsh man but if you think liking anime or drawing anime is acceptable in any racial community than asian youre mistaken again i get that it might be worse or judged harsher but the negative attitude even if its reality wont help find like minded people and work from there
  me too  aaaahhhhhhh
  definitely and hey youll need it to not want to kill yourself anyway right
  naw bro i dont have that problem i mean can admit i get lonely sometimes but thats what i have my friends for
  man you really wasted some time didnt you    read think and grow rich with an open mind its a book about making money but theres more to it it will help you get the status youre after
  thanks my dude all these replies but you are the first to actually answer my question
    my friends think im fucking a different girl every night  if you are a kv but your friends think youre a player i doubt they are good friends because apparently you dont trust them enough to tell them about it    but anyways how come youre 27 and have never even kissed a girl have you actually tried dating and going out or what
  pretty hard to get a gf when you are broke and still live at home taking care of sickly people its not a big deal as a kid i knew it would pan out like this
  fair enough    as far as your social status goes i would say this mostly comes down to your friends colleagues and family you dont need a gf to have a good place on the social status ladder will say though that at your age people will likely ask questions about why youre still single but this shouldnt be too much of a problem    im a 27 old kv and lets be honest i think im too far gone  not sure about this your age is where women often start to become desperate to settle down so as long as you arent disgusting looking there should be plenty of women who would be willing to date you problem is these women are past their sexual prime so you would basically be settling for used up goods and goods that are about to hit the wall however if youre a kv then i guess anything is better than nothing
  because apparently you dont trust them enough to tell them about it  why would i want to tell them    but anyways how come youre 27 and have never even kissed a girl  im not 27 im just saying that being a virgin isnt a death sentence  have you actually tried dating and going out or what  not extensively i dont think its for me      this is a different anon
the problem im having is i still want good social status is that possible without a girlfriend    of course
  see thats just the thing i dont wanna settle so rather just give it up all together and just stay on my grind i know about the red pill and mgtow already so i dont need a lesson on women
  my pleasure
  no its not if youre unsuccessful with women youll always be looked at as weird
  just bee yourself    reference material  
  you guessed wrong idiot
  le bee urself
go hard
  holy shit are you me im making 27k and doing well enough to live alone but theres only one admittedly good promotion ahead of me before retiring in 40 years
is male ass play gay/weird
yes
  nah
    the duality of man
  i think youre trying to communicate something here but im too brainlet to understand it
  it isnt if its a femenine ass
  not really she may have something that makes her feel good too
  if youre doing it with another man then yeah its pretty gay
if i only attract autistic boys does that also make me autistic 
  yes
  no it doesnt youd attract more of the right kind of guys if you show a little skin or wear something tight fitting
  it doesnt mean you are but it makes it much more likely    im an autistic woman who got herself checked after a pattern in partners
  i didnt know you could catch it that way
  if i only attract redheads does that make me a redhead
  no it just means something about you is attractive to autists  maybe you inadvertedly act like one of their japanese anime girls in some way who knows
  semirelated but where do i find qt autist girls  t britfag sperg
  you are either autistic/weird ugly or you have low hygiene
  gaming cafes or theres an anime film coming out this week
  if autism was an sti it wouldve eradicated itself by now
  i dont think so  maybe youre just smart   maybe you appreciate that you know that their social games will be either notthere or very simple which is nice right keeps things simpler
  what
why is such blatant shitposting tolerated
  you may think my post was retarded but yours is at least ten times as retarded  what
  i read somewhere online that women who date partners who are on the spectrum have higher chances of being on it too      being red head is a physical attribute autism is internal  permeates multiple areas of someones personality so there must be some underlying reason why a large number of them seem to be drawn to me      dont normal guys like smart girls too
yes magnets only attractive a magnet so meaning magnet    dumb pig
not necessarily  it could mean you have a personality which puts up with autists more than others so they gravitate towards you as a safe person  kind of like how faggots end up friends with a bunch of women again theyre safe
it means you are a beta female beta females attract beta males since beta males are intimidated by alpha women
  men and women have different symptoms for autism if youre truly that worried just google the symptom sheet for women and have a good look through it if you identify with more than 70 id say its time to see a doctor and try for a diagnosis
  i dont think your post is retarded your post is retarded
  ignore the trolls and listen to hitler over there youre probably just a very understanding and empathetic person someone people feel safe around for people with autism like myself its very rare to find a person like this and theyre an absolute treasure
  thank you

how to make a move on this girl i work with  situation  are in the same group of coworkers who hangs out together once / week at a bar  known each others for 1 years  have lunch once / week together  went on holiday 1 week together during summer  are organising a party toeghter for the other coworkers for christmas  all with the othe people from the group    now ive began to realize im attracted to her based on how cultivated she is and that she has pretty good tastes she is sligtly autistic and kinda cute  how can i tell if she is attracted to me also and how do i make a move on her i cant really be too forward when im with my other coworkers  now we are at the level where  she is playfully hitting me when i tease her  takes my phone to check some stuff and doesnt really retract when i use it as the same time as her hands touching  we have fairly good connection/start to know each other tastes  but its hard to tell if im imagining things or not
how to make a move on this girl i work with  i wanted to stop reading here because its generally not a good idea to date coworkers    are you two ever alone somewhere at times might as well bring it up carefully and tell how you feel
bump
 guys
my long distance girlfriend broke up with me because i was really unattractive we got into a few fights because she was so busy with school and i wanted more of her time than was available then i planned to visit her and it was going to be the thing that saved our relationship we planned on having a lot of sex going out to every meal and going on trips around her city and i missed it because i wouldve failed a class from too many past unexcused absences and it was such an obvious mistake it was so pathetic and it was such a let down in her mind that im sure its the moment that things went downhill a month later we broke up we saw each other for a week because we both were home for thanksgiving we hung out three times but didnt have sex i sent her a bunch of emotional and not very confident texts which she was polite to and thankful for but not in a way that made her excited    i have a plan to get her back and i want to know if people think this is delusional or not she likes spending time with me and she is attached to me somewhat she still talks to me everyday and considers me a big person in her life and she plans on seeing me in a couple of weeks with no expectations over winter break im probably the only or one of the few people shes going to spend time with over break she also doesnt talk to men that shes attracted to at school she turns down attention constantly and spends time pretty much only with her friends in really wholesome contexts    cont 1/2
  its fucking over bro  move on
i think if i act confidently subtly but not directly let her know that my bad habits are completely done for add a few new elements such as me going to the gym and me not doing any drugs anymore i got a 40 this semester thatll help me out as well combined with the fact that ive been going to and will go on dates with more women as/more attractive to her and i just act normal funny confident and make a move towards sex at the right time say a week into our two weeks together that shell be attracted to me again in the same way she was when we were dating     after that when shes excited about me again ill plan on visiting her in a month it wont be too far out to cause her to lose interest and it wont be too soon to seem desperate one month away in early february    then i will visit her and do everything we planned on doing the first visit i missed and from that point on theres a good chance i could redeem what i lost
give it a shot watch a bunch of corey wayne on yt    but if it fails move on make this your only attempt    stay away from any relationship convos and just focus on having fun hanging out and hooking up focus on making a fun romantic evening that leads to sex
  its my only shot theres no opportunity for anything after this this is the only context i see it being realistic but its definitely worth a shot and would be a nice boost to my pride to redeem something that i lost because my life was less in control than id prefer it to be
  honestly bro dont do this for your own self respect    dont be a new and improved person for someone else i mean it sounds like youre doing all this shit to get her back but why not just do it for yourself if shes not interested are you just gonna suddenly revert back to your unhealthy habits yeah you will because your whole reason for doing it is her but what about you bro    you need to learn self confidence what youre gonna exhibit is some weak pseduoconfidence bullshit and i guarantee you youre not the only guy on her mind the truth is you fucked it up but take it as a humble lesson and work on yourself and try again with a new girl you try regaining this girl by transforming into her perfect guy and suddenly all respect flies out the window from everyone and yourself even if it works and gets her back    move on
  i dont think so because im not going to sacrifice things that i like about me to be her perfect man what makes me upset is that in a world where i was the person id like to be this would work naturally and its why it worked so well before i dont want to be doing drugs i dont want to be missing class and i dont want to be unsure of my ability to cope my emotions to adjust to reality    i can admit i fucked it up i can take it as a lesson and i can keep trying with new girls i already have had sex since shes been gone im planning on a couple more dates in the future before/during the time ill see her    i honestly think that even if i dont get her back ill know to keep going anyway but i am going to try to get her back because she was really important to me regardless of the principle of me needing to do things for myself or regardless of the ability i have to move on no matter what the value of the reward makes it something i find it valuable to put energy towards
im literally in your exact situation except the second she dropped the its not you its me and lets be friends please i want you in my life shit i pulled i love you too much to be just a platonic friend if you ever change your mind let me know otherwise goodbye forever she was crying in my arms the last time we saw each other    she hasnt texted me since the end of august if she doesnt reach out by the end of this month im going to text her and test the waters i know that the moment i can meet with her irl ive got it in the bag but getting it to that point is the big challenge
op here    this might be tough to hear but i dont feel the way i felt over thanksgiving break i dont think i enjoyed it as much as i said i did and i think i dont really think i enjoyed this at all recently    i really feel like we both kind of let go of what we enjoyed about each other and were just trying to get away with things that dont mesh with our established dynamic at all    so im willing to put all of it behind us and just try to enjoy myself again one more time but after this break i dont know if theres really anything i can do i want to tell you now so youre not blindsided but if nothing works   we might just have to stop talking to each other altogether if i dont feel good again    so why dont you come over i can make us dinner im willing to see where this goes but i wont guarantee anything
  op you see how desperately youre trying to get her back because she doesnt seem to want you anymore ya now flip the script     women want what they cant have just as much as men dont be extra or give her what she asks for and wants let her come to you
  here      dont fucking say this this is absolute sabotage and will guarantee fucking sink your chances to 1    go watch corey wayne
  you start your essay by writing that your relationship ended because you are unattractive than you say that it started to go downhill when you cancelled a planned visit in which a lot of sex was implied i dont know if you are ugly or not but certainly you dont seem like a coherent person to be with
    did the same message to a girl who used me as a rebound then got back with her ex after giving me shitty reasons for breaking up    she messaged me few times after thisx while she was with her ex/actual cut her off anyway she even said happy bday to me few days ago    i plan on getting over her and if/when the time is right get back with her     she was way too special in my life and i she was attractive for me both physically and mentally but after the shit she did and played me i had to cut contact with her
  no im an attractive person its just the whole having to cancel bc my life wasnt together thing was really disappointing and kinda killed what we had      i did watch corey wayne he said to make her feel like she could lose me if she tries to make it just about friendship
i suggest to watch corey wayne and read his book like the other anon said also watch craig kenneth to see the psychological side you became unattractive because you became needy and clingy to your ex because she got distant you overpursued her which made it worse the best thing to do is move on and dont look back dont contact her for any reason unless she messages you first
  she will for sure message me in two weeks to hang out i know for a fact because were going to be in the same town    what do i say when she does should i just invite her over for dinner
  you shouldnt get your hopes up but if she does then invite her to your house to make dinner and watch a movie if she resist just tell her its no problem and to contact you when she changes her mind also you need to change your bad behavior not for her but for you
me and my friend are doing shrooms for the first time in a couple of weeks we are doing 2gs each he says we should take it with lemon juice because it makes the high more intense and kicks in quicker will it be too much for us to handle
  why tho
drugs are fun thats why
why do the most retarded drug ever snort some coke and do something useful and productive with your life
    maybe you should start out with 05 grams each    you have no idea how potent they are or how they will effect you and even a small mushroom trip is very very enjoyable    i also recommend having weed on hand to manage gettting too trippy weed is great for bringing you down from uncomfortable hights
  ive done shrooms once in the past 2g did a shit ton of research before finally committing to it being knowledge about what youre taking helps a lot with any anxiety that might cause a bad trip with the dosage you are taking though you should be alright just try to avoid eating for a few hours before taking them make sure to chew them well as for the lemon juice ive read you get the best results with freshly squeezed lemons id also make sure to clear up your day and have a sober buddy if you plan on going anywhere i felt the effects for about 56 hours but still didnt feel safe to drive till the next day personally i loved looking at the clouds the way they danced in the sky was just amazing i plan on doing more in the near future once i have a free day   as for food you wont be hungry at all just dont forget to drink some water i would advise skipping the lemon juice for the first experience just so you can get a foot hold on what to expect when i did it like this it took about an hour to kick in an another 45 mins after that to reach a peak i also found that having my sober gf watch over me made me feel much safer about what i was doing i would highly advise having at least one person there to watch out for everyone body weight also plays a part in to how much you will feel the less you weigh the less you need to take to reach certain levels for reference im 130lbs     just be ready to give your self up if you fight the effects you will lose and ultimately be scared
  you clearly havent actually done drugs if you want to actually be productive buy some meth
  lemon juice will fuck you up    intense nausea and insanelly fast and powerful comeup is noy worth it dont try to save a few bucks by using lemon juice it will most likelly fuck you up i took 3g pe ground up and tekd and i got drug induced psychosis trust me dude it aint worth it    any more questions im a shroom expert ask away 
  dont listen to this guy  its a good way to take it
  lemon tek tastes disgusting insane nausea even more so on an empty atomach nausea creates discomfort which is really bad during a comeup especially a comeup which is fast and hard as fuck if you want to make the shrooms kick in faster make tea add ginger lemon and honey 0 nausea not to mention that lemon tek basically halves the trip duration okay more like x067
  maybe youre just weak  smoke a bowl and surprise nausea is gone  tea sounds good tho
  sure lets reccomend mixing drugs for a first time user your solution to the nausea  quick comeup problem is to add even more shit lets throw in some dmt and ketamine while were at it
  oh shit not a whole bowl of weed wtf hes gonna die from a heart attack call all the doctors available in a 100km radius this is serious shit bro he did not just smoke a bowl of marijuana and ate mushrooms what the fuck was the madman thinking holy shit some people just want to watch the world burn huh
  obviously you are unaware of the synergetic effects thought loops and paranoia heighten on shrooms weed causes receptors to keep firing shrooms cause hyperconnectivity taking both is not the same as the effevcts of one plus the other first time user take it clean dont fuck around mushrooms are dangerous contrary to hippie and pothead belief
  been there done that  git gud
  you sir are more concerned with your ego than with the safety of the individual at hand you are a bafoon and i have no further use arguing with you    good day
  this though i definitely recommend all sorts of hallucinogens for most people i dont recommend it for all people namely those on ssris or those with underlying anxiety or mental health issues even within their family     peering into another conscious perspective can trigger all sorts of things like ptsd or full blown psychosis  so make sure youre in the right state of mind and also ease yourself in  just an anecdote  dmt fucked my life up for months because of the intensity it was well worth it in the long run but i considered myself mentally strong before taking the hit and then fully found the depth of how wrong i was then had to figure myself out post experience which is much harder to do than preemptively accepting things
  2 grams is fine as long as its not like 2 grams of all shroom heads it also helps if youve like done any other sort of drug before like even just weed so youre familiar with the concept of not being completely in control of your perceptions    my first time doing shrooms was actually my first time doing any drug ever and you know what it was tons of fun just cause i was at the right place at the right time with the right people    there were other times years after that when i would just smoke a bit of weed and because of the situation i was in i just wanted to crawl inside of a hole and die and hope that everyone forgot who i was    hell there are even times when i was stone cold sober and i also wanted to die its all about what mood youre in and what you do when youre high and also who youre with if its anyone at all ive done shrooms solo and it was also fun in its own way          i mean if you were raped as a kid or you watched your friends get blown up in vietnam or you survived a school shooting or something then yeah just wildly taking mushrooms while already being on a mix of mental medication isnt maybe the best idea    but just smoking a fuckin bowl to offset the nausea isnt going to make a normal person go crazy and try to eat their own face    this most underrated post in this thread
try growing shrooms   get trichoderma ever single time  why god why
i took shrooms with about 10 mg of xanax to try and ensure my trip was good i heard this kind of ruins the trip i had fun though should i go again without the xanax
ive been seeing this girl for a few weeks her friends told me to take it slow shes a friend of a friend she really seems into me but pretty much never texts which is very different than i am used to  she never pulls out her phone when im with her so maybe she just doesnt check it much idk  im used to associating that with disinterest  i really cant deal with emotional distant women it just doesnt work   is this one of those things that can change over time after we get to know each other better
roommate just fucked some random girl in our room while i was sleep woke up to them fucking and they hadnt even tried to wake me up before intercourse im 20 years old and a virgin 4 years single at uni i will give any info necessary i need sex so badly now that its making me stir crazy i dont want to hurt myself or anyone by remaining a bitter incel

  step one   stop jerking off  step two   you sound fat lose some weight and build muscle that helps your sex drive become stronger  step three  stop being a bitch
  im 510 and 140lbs far from fat actually everyone tells me im a skelly  i work out and i have stopped jerking off the latter is exactly why ive noticed this problem    how do i cross this mental barrier it cant be physical because if i look at even a 90 censored pic and jerk off for hours on end while literally hard as a diamond
i have a big problem    i have ocd and there is one thing i particularly obsess on and that causes me the most grief i have a feet defect that has been progressively getting worse nothing can be done apart from surgery and im seeing a top doctor in june i think about it very often and check my feet every day looking at my ankle testing the ability to jump looking in my legs in the mirror etc such compulsions take a lot of my time in the morning its worst in the shower because i get to see my bare feet im often late because of it    im starting a job on monday and im afraid how ill make it without being late and also i worry that people will think im weird if i cant control my compulsions at work i have walked to and fro in a mall before staring at my legs in the glass im sure it looked weird not to mention the obsessions and compulsions cause me a good deal of mental distress sure my feet might be getting a bit worse but even if im not exaggerating its no reason to be tormented with anguish 24/7    what do i already take antidepressants and ive scheduled therapy

  is your friend the only one with access to the drug source
all i can say is do what you have to do just know once u get ur hands dirty especially after getting caught its very unlikely to lead to a legitimate path although working hard labour work is not sustainable id suggest doing a small course not a degree but something to give u qualifications in a specific field whether its social work or debt collecting this will provide u with a reasonably sustainable income the money will always be tempting tho i know i would continue with the dirty work
  he doesnt have access to the drugs we usually wait in our car for someone to come deliver it to us     i dont care about the drug selling shit anymore im already certain im cutting ties with him because i dont want to go to jail and neither does he im just doing it out of desperation i dont know what to do outside of this though i stop helping my friend and im unemployed living on the streets basically i need an alternative or im fucked and ill be forced to keep this shit up
  ive been arrested before for unrelated shit and prison scared the shot out of me its also the moment i realized my life is fucked lol     what is social work jobs like or debt collecting and do i need the degree for those jobs im not very smart lol
  no u do not need degrees for most jobs although if u have a criminal record itll be hard to find work anywhere corporate im in australia we have tafe courses which give ur certificates makes it easier to find work debt collections or ticket inspecting could be a good place to look if u have a crim record
     dont want honest work   does crime instead    youre a big faggot
alright so i changed the password to my account because someone had hacked into my account and i cant get back in and there is literally no options left for me the recover email was hacked as well and ive tried everything to get it back frankly im tempted to pay someone to get back into me    please help this is stressing me out
  only you can solve this problem
hey guys i need your advice    i recently asked out a girl from my work group in university that i am friends with for quite some time already long story short she already has been dating someone for a week now thats not my problem i can handle rejection the problem starts when i drive home it was quite cold and suddenly the whole freaking street was frozen i lost control over my car and almost hit a tree luckily neither me nor the car got damaged for some reason my first thought after fuck that was close was that another female friend of mine from the same work group had mentioned how she would have to drive home to an area where i knee it would be even colder than where i live so i sent her a message warning her about the ice on the streets after i got home we kinda started texting back and forth something we dont usually do and idk why i went with it maybe cause i wanted to talk with someone after such a shitty day we ended up sending messages to each other over the course of the whole next day too and today i realized that it might have come over to her as flirting now i totally didnt mean to flirt with her i jsut wanted to talk with someone but now im afraid she might see me as a guy who just tries to hit on one girl after the other since she is bff with the girl i asked out and i am quite sure that she knows about it i would appreciate any advice on how to get out of this situation without accidentely ruining a healthy friendship
  why dont you wanna date her
  youre overthinking shit stop
  because i really dont feel like dating someone right after i got rejected by someone else if this was another time maybe id be interested but as things stand it would feel like she was just a replacement and she truely deserves better than that
  im not sure i mean i dont usually chat with her much and now i messaged her kinda out of the blue with a warning and proceeded to talking about how her day was like
if you are good friends then maybe just talk with her about it in all honesty
what kind of stuff did you text her about
my girlfriend promised me not to smoke a couple of months later i find out she smokes because of her friends influence i believe she says she smokes because she wants to and she will quit when wants to   i can tell her parents yet i dont want her to hate me for it i asked her close friend not to give her any cigs she replied saying that you should love your girlfriend for good and bad things if you really love her  what the fuck do i do
its dumb but it doesnt necessarily affect your health    is it bad breath that you dont like maybe have her try vaping
dont tell her parents you fucking retard
unfortunately no matter how stupid is her excuse its not something you have power on the best thing is to learn to let go    this is easier said than done my bfs mom died of cancer because of cig and he is smoking a lot yet i know all too well nothing good comes from pressuring him he simply knows that i disaprove    you can however agree on forbiding her to smoke inside a room you sit in or before kissing and she should probably understand that
  let her smoke
  dump her
  let her smoke if she wants to shes not your fucking property
  beat her friends up and rape to assert dominance
get her an ecig make her drop the nicotine you can use them with only flavoured liquid  other than that you should dump her both for breaking the promise and for being a health risk she doesnt respect you you dont need to respect her  t got cancer from passive smoking
  it doesnt necessarily affect your health  come again
  this   its food for thought
  fuck off with your second hand smoke propaganda its all bs
  i know its all about controlling your piece of ass with you men but even if you beat her shes gonna do what she wants if you arent around if you want a girl that doesnt smoke you picked the wrong girl
  cigarette butt of a person denying the existence of second hand smoke  
  itt your brain on tobacco
  ashtray breath  just dump her
    samefag  fuck off there is no reasonable science to back that shit up sure if you enclose a box with smoke and put a rat in their if course it will die just like if you filled the box with car exhaust so again fuck off with that shit
tell her she should stop but she should start quitting during new year and whenever she wants to get a smoke youll drink some finesingle malt whiskey and a thick sigar and smoke that shit in her face tell her shes a smoke dumpster
  you dont sit in a room fool of car exhaust either you dumb dumb      i can tell her parents  holy shit op dont be such a fucking sperg  if she smoking triggers you so much then just break up there is nothing more pathetic than someone trying to use friends and family to pressure a partner to change their behaviour
  ah duh a sealed room with no external air supply you faggot i think you should try it
there is no defense for smoking period
  what if you enjoy it
  there is no reasonable science to back that shit up  its okay to have doubts regarding science when there is only one paper but this shit has been peer reviewed time and time again
encourage her to smoke more until she starts hacking up shit then get her a juul and shell probably make the switch pretty fast or if shes more reasonable skip the 1st part for the second
  propaganda bs you believe everything your told eh 
  thats not a viable defense due to its negative impact on the user those around the user additional medical resources that will need to be spent on the user and the effects of smoking on society at large you would have to be a truly vile wicked person to smoke
  unfortunately most people quit an addiction for themselves if you quit for others than your chances of relapsing increase the best you can do is remind her of the health consequences offer your support and tell her you want her to live longer not die in severe pain etc i wouldnt recommend pressuring someone or alienating them to quit it almost always has the opposite affect you are not in the wrong if you later decide to leave her personally i find smoking disgusting and is an absolute deal breaker    t ex smoker for 1 1/3 year
  i hate your face so you know people like you are the worse i give zero fucks if you like it or dont i have the right to do as i want with my body and the right to tell you who wants to run my life to kindly fuck off and go fight the war on women or some shit
  if you quit for others than your chances  than  goddammit i messed
dump her    smokers are all sluts
  what if you enjoy shooting yourself in the brain
  ok ill bait propaganda to what end  and paid by who  and aimed to whom 
  ill bite
  t literal 12 year old  its my body mom i do what i want  daily reminder that we live in a society
  but most smokers are aware of the health problems and they dont care  it is not immediate and they like the feeling of death when they smoke  it is like convincing a fat person to loose weight  every fat person knows how much it sucks to be fat and the health problems are visible to them every day through everything they do  but loosing weight is such an abstract thing for them they dont just do it
tell her she smells like shit and her teeth are brown and her skin is more wrinkled girls care about these things but honestly get over her when you can im sure youre underage but she sounds immature
    people have the right to do bad things or perhaps more accurately people dont have the right to force you to not do something unless it reaches a certain threshold of badness but that doesnt mean you should do bad things just that you can its like saying i have the right to not tip my waiter yes you have that right but you should tip him nonetheless you dont have to donate to charity but you should
  smoking is a dealbreaker for me in a relationship thats established by me in the very beginning before were official so they have an opportunity to back down    what im saying op is you cant change her if its an issue drop her
  fuck tipping  employers who hire service with the idea of the main source of their income being tips are the worst scum pay the damn taxes faggot
  punishing employees who depend on tips for their employer being a capitalist  nice
  secondhand smoke is only a problem if you breathe it  i imagine that she doesnt smoke inside
op its really quite simple have an adult conversation with her and try explaining why you find smoking unattractive the health issues the smell the yellow teeth wrinkled skin etc tell her that you know its her decision but that this is really a deal breaker for you and see how she responds a relationship is a two way street and if you cant appeal to your so in an honest conversation and get past the rhetoric of her shitty feminist friend then perhaps its best to move on you dont own her but if she doesnt care at all what you think or want you probably shouldnt date that person
be me  born into rich family   successful in school high scores  when compared to my older bros i always get praises  made it to the same uni as my older bros different major  they graduated with great gpa   i am having shitty time and failed 1 class  deleted an entire semester bcs i didnt do well in the current one  family expects i will be even better than my bros who used to be losers in school  i am the true loser now  i love my family and bros and i dont want to disappoint them   i will hear all your thoughts
  i didnt tell my family i deleted the semester except my father
in my opinion not disappointing your family is not a valid reason to score good in university  your aim should be to learn something to become someone  are your actions in line with the aim  if yes then you are doing good  if not then you need to reevalute your actions
anons how do you forgive yourself for doing bad things and move on i no longer engage in the bad things but my brain is trying to convince me i am a shitty person and i am not truly friends with people because they arent aware of it
also the manga is called dungeon meshi delightful read
i dont know if this is necessarily a good strategy but whenever i get upset at myself or others rather than issuing blame i try and remember that were all just meat machines and our actions are dictated by our genetics and environment keeping that in mind try and do my best to avoid unfavorable outcomes in the future
  sin no more you obviously havent changed if you still feel burdened by guilt my guess is youre a slave to your desires still want money still addicted to videogames porn food etc
you repeat to yourself just dont think about it three times anytime it comes up then focus on something that demands concentration
  try improving yourself as a person over all you cant undo the wrongs you committed but you can stop yourself from doing them again
  i have beeen considering running charity events to raise money for the cause i think most of my current problem is my ocd clinging to the fear of friends not legitimately being your friends because they do not know that aspect of you despite it no longer being a part of myself
  i will try that anon it is tough when your brain is hopped up on pure ocd juice
if you still feel guilty it doesnt mean you havent changed i feel guilty for the pain i caused to the person i love it hurts to see how hurt they are and how much they struggle to heal you know you never meant to hurt them and it wasnt even your fault it was just meant to happen you know that it wont happen again but the damage is done i stopped beating myself up for it long time ago now i am trying to accept it it takes a lot of time and energy to go through it i guess you get at the point of humans make mistakes but ive learnt from it at some point
    i have ocd too that is where i got the trick from theres therapy to specifically correct these sorts of things do you want more tips on shit i can add ya on discord or something
  yeah and some people do the same thing over and over again while preaching they wont do it anymore they knew damn well at the time it was intentional and not a mistake and if they still struggle with magical thinking like that then they really havent changed    at the end of the day your choices are yours you are the master of your own actions own up to them dont paint it as something it is not    for example when i fucked up and got addicted to pain pills percs i wasnt sitting here blaming anyone but myself for my stupid decisions i dont call it a mistake because it wasnt i just didnt know how bad those shits were and prior to percs all i ever fucked with was vikes so i didnt think itd be a problem since i never got addicted to those so i did what i did not knowing the outcome would be as serious as it was if i had known before hand exactly how addictive they were i would have been more careful or just not fucked with them same as i know that if i cheat on someone im going to hurt them and myself only difference is i know that before i do something stupid like cheating hence why ive never cheated on someone or with someone and distance myself from people who behave that way i may still talk to them and interact with them but they will never be close to me
anons how do you forgive yourself for doing bad things and move on  alcohol
  plz no anon
  sure anon thatd be lovely
    then gib discord i get spammed too much from soc now

i have a job interview at mcdonalds tomorrow  any tips 
if you show up youll probably get the job
  nice tank you anon
that youve made it this far and are even contemplating how to perform well on an interview is more than enough proof that you are overqualified    you deserve better  like taco bell
  even if you dont show up youll probably get the job
  show up on time youll get the job  show up on time every day at the job youll probably hit assistant manager
im fairly certain you also need to be clothed and have at least 3/4 of your limbs
  availability is always a huge selling point in retail always be open about when youd take days off most commonly and when youre available keeping that dialogue open is basically strictly to your benefit    the more open your schedule the more beneficial it is

i was abused i devalue myself internally a lot very sorry for reacting to life by being a worthless coward my purpose is to be the lowest of the low my feelings tell me what to do like a scared child its how i learned to live who can stand a guy like that im embarassed to exist  sorry im afraid these claims could actually be a narcissistic passive aggressive attempt at manipulating people with sympathy just want to test wihat you think before i try to do something about it because i need to be sure not to unconsciously screw up another attempt at getting help i should probably kill myself but we all know thats out of the question im just trying to prevent or at least minimize the damage im causing  25m chronic depression
  damn to find someone with similar experience i always put others before me and now im wondering what am i actually living for
i noticed this a little under 3 weeks ago now thinning on the left side on my scalp at my hair line at first i thought maybe i was brushing my hair too hard/roughly and pulling hairs out but it bothered me heavily as there was a small spot that was very noticeable to me i was always a bit rough with my hair never really took the time / care needed when brushing it so it still seemed plausible for this to be the case    a few weeks have passed and i havent noticed any significant change since then aside from the fact that i now obsessively stare at myself in the mirror scrutinizing every single visible hair follicle i can see as well have feeling obscene levels of selfconsciousness around coworkers ive never felt before to the point where i actively adjusted today to avoid having my head in a light when overlooking some documents with a coworker today    oddly enough no one has made any comments or said anything about it no one seems to even noticed it at all but i cant tell if its them actually not noticing or if they are just not being rude  as a note i am a male with long hair i know cut your hair ive been wanting to for a while actually and was cut a ton of it off in a week or two for the first time in nearly a decade for christmas/new year look and to donate some hair however now the thought terrifies me i dont want anyone to noticed this and im worried a shorter cut will make it very noticeable      cont
im not sure if its of any consequence but just in case as far as my health goes im honestly not a very health person id say i have no illnesses or diseases but i sleep very little even more so the past week or two just this week alone ive been at work running on 2 hours and 15 hours of sleep respectively just from not being able to fall asleep in bed   i eat like shit honestly my diet is god awful i spend the bulk of my money eating out because im too lasy to buy groceries or cook for myself which leads to a lot of shitty fastfood meals and take out and i have a terrible sweettooth i have heavily cut this back recently but i used to eat candy cookies doughnuts etc between meals ive nearly eliminated candy with some rare exceptions and im not eating packs of cookies/doughtnuts by the day anymore typing this out makes me question how i dont have diabetes or weigh about 400 lbs but i guess i was blessed with a fast metabolism and finally aside from not really working out or exercising especially now that im at an office job vs an active one i have a dental health issue id say these are probably the biggest thigns about myself as far as my health goes nothing else i can really think of  i also have a decent bit of hair that seem to come out in the shower but having long hair i never know if it was a lot of hair or just a little bit of really long hair in that instance i usually clear out a small ball of hair i wad up in the drain catch as well as a small ball every time i shampoo/condition my hair i didnt / dont know whats normal for that so i cant say if its something to worry about though the hair is in the picture    cont
my hair is something ive always taken pride in something ive always and consistently been complimented on my entire life not only that but i am not a tall man by any stretch of the word im no midget but still i dont workout so im not very built either i can grow a wickedly good and naturally well shaped beard but i cannot stand facial hair either i dont think bald could work well for me in the slightest plus my girlfriend hates baldness and has a slight irrational fear of bald men  tldr  i think my hair is thinning out  i might be being irrational about it  its causing me a lot of stress and social anxiety  i dont want to shave my head  i want to save my hair / stop this
holy fuck your hair loss is so minimal but the fact that youre having an existential crisis over something so cosmetic makes you so neurotically vain that you should seek psychological help
i literally thought you were a woman until the last paragraph cut it and get over yourself
  the fact that youre having an existential crisis over something so cosmetic makes you so neurotically vain    maybe but its really the only thing physically that i take pride in on myself i think everyone can have at least one thing they like about their self  its not the only reason but i also work and business and a short skinny bald guy doesnt necessarily give off the best first impressions obviously im not bald right now but id rather not even go down that road  its likely minimal because its something thats very recent and if i can solve the issue early i can keep it longer i didnt mean to set you off by wanting to stop something early      i do want to cut it actually ive been looking into cutting it off for quite some time its longer than ive ever had it in my entire life and while i do enjoy having long hair i want a change  im just worried about a shorter cut making it more visible
  its really the only thing physically that i take pride in on myself  dude see a fucking psychoanalyst
  
  this lmao you just took the time to write a fucking essay about your slight hair loss take some time to reflect on that
  already have   doesnt change my question about possible ways to stop it
  okay dude you want to be a douchebag about it you dont want to hear that youre acting insane if youre so insecure that the thought of going bald one day flips your entire world upside down go out to a dermatologist and get a finasteride prescription for your minimal hairloss and take that pill everyday for the rest of your life your dick might not work and your overall day to day life will be virtually unchanged but go for it because you obviously cant sleep at night with the thought of getting old running rampent in your head
  at least you tried to offer some actual advice this time
if you seriously start to go bald a lot of people just completely shave their head bald i completely agree with this and im planning on doing myself since i know im eventually going to go bald
  id agree though that tends to look much better on taller or more muscular men im like an asian in height cant say ive seen many 57 guys get taken seriously being bald
i am fucked up /adv/ i met a woman and managed one date it went well it was very very basic just coffee a diner it was nice now here is the problem i found out she has a kid already she wasnt really hiding it and hasnt explicitly told me she has a kid but i know she does i do like her and she is probably the only woman in my whole life to pay this much attention to me but am i wrong to date her i actually very bothered by kids who are toddler aged should i actually not bother with the second date again i do like her but the kid is making me nervous also where would we even go for a second date i am so boring that i dont even have ideas dinner and a movie is like my default go to idea how the fuck do people do this
they wont call you dad so youre good to date her if shes that good just dont go to her house for prolonged times when the kid is there or hell get used to you in the bad way
    i see any ideas for a second date i honestly have no fucking idea what to go do with her i am really really fucking scared actually i have never been to the point i am now
  she has a kid already  you arent wrong to date her but she is wrong to date you i would abort the mission senpai prepackaged families are depressing as you dont get to experience the freedom of a normal relationship that doesnt always have an unintentional third wheel or hell however many wheels that hinders you from exploring it
    fuckkkk at this rate will i ever have a girlfriend this is horrid i guess you are right though do i ghost her or i guess i could remain friends with her why is it that i am 29 and have no idea about relationships fuck
  29  oh  you know what nevermind if you like her then accepting her is probably your best bet about when you hit 30s is when you can only pick up drama queensgirls who want sugar daddies or single mothers who have teen or preteen kids anyways a mother with a toddlerand just one kid at that is a steal for where youre at still kinda sucks because you cant be as impulsive with her as you want but this is probably your best bet    for the next date id do something active like lasertag or shopping with her third date is more eating out and check out each others places then it all should be natural if she likes you back
    fuck how did it come to this holy fuck i am fucking hyper ventilating right now my age has finally hit me its funny because i am 29 and honestly i feel like i am still a teenager its weird help me
i always used to think that i have low confidence and thats why people never approached me and i never had much success making friends or finding a girl but ive grown to realise just how painfully insecure most people are and now i feel like im actually relatively pretty confident and people dont approach me because theyre the insecure ones and i dont mean that in a sour grapes way i dont judge people for being insecure    does this make any sense are most people deeply insecure or something
yes and the ones that dont either figured that out or are too stupid to feel shame
be me  22 yo male  grow up without father  dating a girl for 4 years living together for 2 years  living in a 2nd world country  earn 250/hr blue collar job  can barely pay rent  be hungry all the time  slowly losing weight  cant go back to university since i decided to take a year off and my parents threw me out of the house because of that 2 years ago cant work 160hrs a month plus full time uni  no savings no car no licence  around 1k in debt  got felony when i was 18 1 gram of weed on me at a festival  got half of a tooth left on my right side and a big hole forming on my front tooth dont have money to fix it its hurts every day for 6 months already its horrible  got a weird skin problem thats slowly creeping up on my chin  wanna see psychiatrist but no money for that as well  always put on a happy face when with my friends and family i never talk to anyone ive never talked to anyone i tried to talk with my gf but she started using the painful things i told her against me on arguments but im literally worse dont shun her   i love my two brothers id die for them my stepfather told me to never ever come back to our family house last time over a very minor disagreement   i was the hottest chad boy in high school now its all chrashing down on me   stopped smoking weed few months ago its literally worse now i think ill go back to smoking every day   i feel useless all i want is to get my own house and raise children but i cant even take care of myself   i know its all my fault  literally thinking about leaving my gf giving all my belongings to my brothers goin far away from my country and jumping off of a cliff     my first time posting on this board not that i expect anything i just have to lift thiss all off off my heart     where should i start how do i brake out of this circle i cant talk to anyone because i have built this strong never sad character around me noone even cares noone knows     
  help will be given at hogwarts for those who deserve it op
seek social services/help  be honest with family/friends about your situation  if they care about your well being and youve not exploited them in the past then ask for some financial aid  set up at budget and cut out things you dont need  example do you drive to work can you take the bus or walk to your workplace  set up a food budget and search for decent ingredients that are high in nutritional value  be mindful of your expenses  with the right mindset you can work trough this struggle and i think you will good luck op 
  250 hour  2nd world  uhh i got bad news for you the soviet union hasnt existed and the term you are looking for poor countries is 3rd world nowadays    there is no help other than what you can do yourself in such a situation
my friend just came out as questioning his gender  hes asking our group to call him a she  i think facts dont care about your feelings  what do i do
depends on how good of a friend he is hes a degenerate and its up to you if you want to indulge his degeneracy or ghost him
  just stop interacting with him
problem is if i ghost him then id have to ghost my dd group
  watch this and become smarter  really tho give it a fair watch for your friend  
  then put up with calling it a her it could just be a phase or just dick her to show dominance
  edgy 12yo
its a fact that your friend wants to be addressed as she so respect that fact regardless of your feelings
  bait
  based and maturepilled    anyway calling her for what she really is gender wise speaking especially is also factual
    i watched it about 7 minutes of it so you dont have to op it isnt worth watching i understand what she is trying to say but if you get into an argument with most trannys especially the ones on here they will scream and writhe about how sex isnt based on biology sex is based on mind then they will link their cherry picked articles and studies that back them that are bare bones at best there are albeit few trannys who arent fucking insane and arent special snowflakes but very few    so as for your friend op if youre pretty close to this person go for it otherwise be polite call it a she/her but perhaps be very up front about it ill call you her/she if you want but you will always be a man in my mind     i dont know most trannies i have met are just such fucking snowflake people even the few i have really liked are edgy and hot topic fags who constantly accidentally hurt themselves  i found one tranny on here who was upset that her straight male friends who knew her before transitioning didnt flirt with her  the fucking mental gymnastics of these people  also ben shapiro is a total fag he isnt exactly wrong but hes a fag find a better role model
  watch it all anon  yeah sex is based on biology  gender isnt based on biology   do you even know anything about trans people
  even shapiro admits that in private he calls trans people by their preferred pronouns just use the damn female pronouns youre not a holy crusader fighting degeneracy
  no im not going to watch some random tranny make a video against ben shapiro/redpillers with random interspersed raunchy sexual humor that is so quirky  which may be funny if it wasnt such an attempt to be a quirky gay  as i just said i have had trans friends here and there overall what is there to know its body dysphoria my friend nice try though
probably bait but honestly call them by their preferred pronouns i have a couple friends who went trans one mtf the other ftm i honestly think being trans is mental illness and is dangerous given the suicide rates but i supported these friends and wanted to keep them as friends so i went ahead and supported their decision both reversed their decision eventually the ftm is now back to being a woman though she had top surgery so thats unfortunate and the other is now genderfluid which is retarded and annoying but whatever theyre both good people and they werent the most mentally stable people to begin with    if you criticize them for being trans i can almost guarantee they will take it as an attack on them and you will ruin the friendship
  you wrote a bunch of stuff without addressing the mistake you did on your first reply making fun of the humor she makes like its of any relevancy i know you are not going to watch it you couldnt debunk it anyway  nice try though
  i do this too ive met good people who are trans and albeit though i disagree with them on literally everything i call them their preferred pronouns or whatever because i respect them as a person and also dont want everyone to hate me for thinking that being trans is a mental illness so just put up with it op
theres plenty of medical and biological reasons why someone might feel more male or female than is typical such as androgen insensitivity where genetically you are male but your body doesnt register the masculine hormones so you look female pic related    biology is messy and theres a fuckton of stuff between male and female that is immediately and also not immediately obvious same with disabilities there are several health conditions that are very real but you cant see by looking at someone    to say that you have to be only male or only female is to ignore just how fast and loose biology plays there are hundreds of examples in humans and other animals where its not just one or another packing people into exclusively male or female by genetics or appearance ignores the huge swathes of gray between the black and white as well as the numerous outliers that mix it up even further such as xxy or xyy people    you cant tell whats going on from the surface and this is also ignoring the bullshit these activities/jobs/hobbies/preferences are exclusively for one or the other maybe fewer people would feel the need to question themselves so much if we didnt arbitrarily bifurcate our culture and force kids to do or abandon things for ridiculous reasons
  thank you
    shut the fuck up you disgusting freak    tranny acceptance was a mistake
  anyway the side of logic the right will keep believing whatever they were believing before spreading fake news and incorrect scientifc facts about trans people sad
  your word salad doesnt change the fact that dick  man and vagina  woman    back to tumblr tranny scum
      this is how /pol/ snowflakes react to scientific facts  anyway trans people and the lgbt have more and more power everyday you cant do anything about it  you can sperg all you want keep seething
  i suggest you find some examples of intersex genitalia and see how that fits your narrow definitions
  lmao more power to commit suicide with each passing day as they slowly realize that they mutilated theyre bodies and everyone sees them as freaks      no thanks keep that shit to yourself you disgusting pervert    trannies are mentally ill and should be put on medication for their body dysmorphia not encouraged to go under the knife to engage with their delusions
  intersex people are born with any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes gonads sex hormones or genitals that according to the un office of the high commissioner for human rights do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies such variations may involve genital ambiguity and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than xymale and xxfemale
  flat earth believer level of ignorance and delusion  you dont know more than psychologists and doctors  and dont worry now that people transition at a younger age theyd manage to obtain the body they identify as fluently without puberty too much on the way so theyll be finally at ease dont worry they wont suicide theyll be all around
  intersex does not equal transgender intersex is what happens when the body is develops somewhere between male and female from birth theres plenty of instances of a baby being born and put under the knife to correct intersex genitalia only for it to have been the wrong one from the getgo how weould you feel if some doctor had assumed you were the wrong sex because you looked a little different and surgically altered you without your consent to make you into what they believed you to be    you should take a course in biology right now youre arguing that orange has to be either red or yellow
i just identify as cisheterosexual checkmate atheists
  tranny psyops are the worst liars ever you were born a man and will always be a man and never pass for a woman quit lying
  ben shapiro is a very clearly an egotistical person with obsessive disdain for transgender people and he gets paid to be that the first video i ever watched of him he compared transgender people to otherkin and made a notsosly remark about otherkin being put down like lame animals hes also dishonest as is made apparent by how he refuses to meet transgender people headon and instead skirts the issue he tells a transwoman youre not a person with xx chromosomes when obviously everyone knows transwomen have xy cheomosomes and thats not remotely what the trans controversy is about    hes not a good person i dont care about how smart he thinks he is and the fact that his wife is a doctor is completely irrelevant so he should stop saying it every two seconds    hes a typical troublesome kike if im being honest im sure he makes money with every malicious remark he makes its paidfor controversy to make the left into a boogeyman so that poor people will continue to vote right
      lmao stay seething tranny freak
  un    ahahahahahahahahahahahaha
  why dont you look in the mirror for a good several minutes with corrective vision on if thats what you need to see clearly yeah i mean this literally and dont get distracted by your hair or your skin i mean really look at your whole self
    youre a man in a dress who wants to pay doctors money to chop off his dick and have a bleeding festering and dilating wound in between their legs    keep your perversions away from children you disgusting freak
  im not even trans nice try take a class and learn how to actually argue instead of trying to throw insults that arent even insulting
  i suggest you that and smash your tranny manface into the glass you absolute melt
it feels good to read all those defensive replies from fake news outlets  it means they know very well themselves the power trans people are gathering  dont worry they wont do anythibg to you all they only want to be themselves like everyone else ane you wont stop them
  being a tranny enabler    neck yourself
  im not a tranny just a passerby who noticed how bad a person you are knowing your personality i wouldnt even hire you to do a job for me 50 discount that is if you have any skills at all    as for being your friend or your brother there is absolutely no way i could be convinced now im not a girl but i imagine i would need to be some sort of abuse victim to find being within 10 feet of you acceptable this is of course in a scenario where i know what your personality is like
    youre unironically a bigger faggot than your friend for caring
    being a male casually within range of you i would feel safe because you are almost certainly a weak man that i despite not being very fit at all could break in a matter of seconds
  back to plebbit you absolute goth
    ive never seen the mainstream media criticize trans people ever instead they make it the hip cool thing so they can rake in big pharma bux paid for by the taxpayer
  pathetic insecure npc
  im too busy enjoying my happy marriage wonderful family great sex life and successful career thank you have a nice day
  my style is very basic not goth and i dont use reddit at all if you use reddit at all you use it more than me    your respones show that you have a very low ability to understand humans or be useful to them so i do suggest you do us all a favor and exit conscious existence soon thank you
  the tranny fad is fading more gays are realizing that having surgery wont fix them they will always be gay men even if they put on a dress
    i am conscious and i assume you may be conscious so i prompt you to resolve that irritating liability to those around you by ending your life
      lmao keep trying to justify your disgusting beliefs to me little bitch
  this is the natural conclusion to the conversation so please just go and do what ought to he done now it would be for the best
what im witnessing in this thread is the usual tale  anons who write very well thought and proven posts mature enough to not insult even tho being sperged on and then /pol/tards sperging all over the place  the split was useless id say to leave these poor souls alone they are probably grown men who ended up under a bad influence or naive teens i feel sorry for them and i hope one day theyll get out of it i believe they deserve better
  very true trannies are lost misguided souls whose mental illness is getting taken advantage of by big pharma pushing them to mutilate their bodies for the profit of others
  madeup tranny infographics and reddit word salads trying to make themselves sound as smug and selfrighteous as possible  good posts    cringe and bluepilled
  do you know how many people actually fit this description a lot fucking less than there are trannies ill tell you that much but you already looked at the stats on klinefelters didnt you
  thought and proven posts  can you explain why there are so many mtf trans and so few ftm trans if there was a genetic correlation wouldnt it be within standard deviation but its not is it youre delusional my man
  its about 5050 mtf are talked way more in the media     landen m walinder j lundstrom b 1996 prevalence incidence and sex ratio of transsexualism acta psychiatrica scandinavica 93 4 221223 doi101111/j160004471996tb10638x pmid 8712018 on average the male to femalefemale to male ratio in prevalence studies is estimated to be 31 however  the incidence studies have shown a considerably lower male to female predominance in sweden and england and wales a sex ratio of 11 has been reported in the most recent incidence data from sweden there is a slight male to female predominance among the group consisting of all applicants for sex reassignment while in the group of primary early onset transsexuals there is no difference in incidence between men and women    from wikipedia page of gender dysphoria
  sex and gender are literally synonyms of each lmao    there are literally 2 genders fuck outta here with that gender queer and nonbinary shit     genderqueer is basically being nonbinary but gay or lesiban or bi    the fucks who fucks qeustion there gender and say  im this type of gender  are the queersfags
2 genders thats all there is also body dysmorphia was a mental illness until that jenner fag came out
  its painful to see your understanding of society words definitions and science hasnt surpassed grade school    if you werent a dullard your anti tranny babby shit would sound more like peterson or shapiro but instead it sounds like a child
  theres only two genders freak and you trying to sound like the biggest pretentious wanker possible wont change that
  i didnt say anything about the number of genders you total retard
  shut your mouth when youre talking to me pathetic faggot
  yeah if they actually tried to form sentences id take them more seriously  it doesnt really matter anyway science and facts given the ben shapiro catchprhase ironically by our side
  your anti tranny babby shit    who said i was an anti trans 
lmao trannies literally on suicide watch
  stop talking to him and find new friends who arent idiot child libtards
  oooh that him in caps so scary  grow up    trans ppl on happiness watch and sustained by science
gender is a made up concept derived from sex a biological concept there is no reason for any differentiation between the two terms because they refer to the same biological reality
  wrong and made up holy shit guys theres scientific proof itt quit the damage control
  m e n t a l i l l n e s s  e  n  t  a  l    i  l  l  n  e  s  s
  theres not actually a debate going on just a bunch of people making themselves look like big emotional retards transgender have and always will be a part of our society and you can just kill yourself if you dont like it    your posts are so glaringly retarded you seem to think of you keep typing gender is the same thing as sex on 4chan then everyone who is more intelligent and educated than you will rewrite every dictionary just to conform to your autistic baby fit
  if it makes you feel better their whole society is going downhill and all conservatives can do is damage control they can try to bring back industry and everything but at the end of the day these people just are what they are be happy with what you have in life trans or cis and dont let the lower people bring you down
  there is no scientific proof in any other species of the animal kingdom so no its most likely made up
  animals arent transgender because they have no concept of gender because they have no concept of self you are the biggest idiot ive witnessed in months animals have sex identity not gender bexause they arent the same thing get a dictionary and look up the two words if youre interested in learning anything and dont come back with some distorted version of the facts like a kindergarten child
keep calling him he and if he cant handle it leave that fuckin tranny
  your an idiot who is delusional trans is a fad for sad shity people who want to be different and get attention wanting to mutilate your genitals is not going to make anyone happy you people are beat shit crazy
  youre an idiot
  that was my 3rd post in the past 2 months or so i dont write this all over the place i was just stating a common fact that our society has sadly lost you are right that there is no debate on this subject but not on 4chan in scientific and medical communities
  even with transgender there are only 2 genders trans are people who transition from one to the other
    yeah i feel the same way too to me condervatives are a bunch of people at least mentally one decade older who suddnely found themselves in a world that isnt theirs anymore a much better world for everyonebut they want their one back  thats impossibile and what they call degenerate is gaing more and more power i feel pity for them in some way  gtg have a great day anon you all other should learn how to keep up with time
  muh politics  lmao  this thread rn desu
  what fad there have been trans people for millennia although they didnt exactly have the modern concept of being transgender
  what about people in a coma or vegetative state who have no concept of self do they have a gender if they are not expressing a self at the time also many animals are self conscious
  conservatism is pretty broad the specific type of person youve been arguing with here probably has less going for them in life than the transgender people theyre ragging on sad i hesitate to call these people conservative because it sort of lends them credibiltiy and implies they have a value system beyond emotionality and reacting to situations like dogs
  gender  made up  you dont have to be protrans to realize this is stupid yes gender and sex were synonymous but now gender is used to describe the societal expectations given to the sexes you cant deny that men and womens cultural roles and appearances vary wildly across space and time
  not really when else in history has it been a popular thing to be trans having a hand full of people with body dysmorphia is not the same thing as having a social fad to encourage everyone to question their gender legit its a bunch of sad bata boys who cant get pussy and they have been told if they say they are girls people will have to like and except them they are pawns in a political game aimed at destroying men and family structures same as encouraging girls to be whores and have children out of wedlock they and nothing but brainwashed people who were sad and lonely and the left has told them pretending to be the opposite sex will make them happy and fix their problems it wont they are just being used and it actually is very damaging to their already shity mental health
  people in comas had a concept of self and their own gender before they got into comas and stop using animals as a comparison for human behavior anon its embarrassing cannibalism murder rape incest etc are practiced by animals but we dont use their behavior as a barometer for human behavior
  what about african and native american cultures that had more than two genders im not saying there was a significant amount of trans people in those cultures but they definitely werent considered fads
  gender is not being used in language as cultural role its being used as a standin for sex ie basically sex its a very deep mindfuck and i only say that because of the amount of people it has actually affected even though its a made up abstract concept      whats sad is the trend of people who arent going to be starting families because they reject the basic mom/dad dichotomy even though thats exactly what they grew up with in 9999 of cases
there are a lot of feels before reals in this thread if only the poltards would embrace science and logic instead of sperging based solelyotion on em
  it was though it was still a way to get attention and be different its a mental illness some people honestly feel wrong in their skin fine your brain is messed up and it cant except your body others they just want the added attention being trans will get them still a mental illness because they are so insecure they are willing to mutilate themselves to have people give them attention or in past times to be seen as special or spiritually different or what have you
  then just ignore him what is d d
  found your friend op
  yeah its clear that the tumblr 3000 genders fad isnt canon in real society i think the vast majority of people even sjws know that      you can disagree with a trans person anytime whether theyre conscious or not there is the trans persons selfperception and then theres your perceptin of them and these are two different things op is free to say to his transitioning friend i dont agree to think of you or treat you as insert gender here only someone who has lost sight or who has never had sight would think otherwise    this bickering that sex and gender are the same thing or that people must play along with the transgender ideology or be punished is ridiculous
  gender is not being used in language as cultural role its being used as a standin for sex  i dont know where you get this from biological sex / gender theyre being used to describe separate but closely related concepts
  and being a keyboard warrior who doesnt even make a compelling point until the person hes debating has already left the thread accomplishes what
this is one of those times that empathy comes into play op if you gave a shit about your friend youd listen to them truly listen to them and try and understand them shit thats what id do for any of my bros no matter what the topic is
  i guess we have different understandings of what a fad is
  these robots who sit in discord together usually arent real friends often times they dont even have a real friend
  i only bother replying because of lurkers i do not care when or who replies to whatmost people are lurking      i dont know where youre getting your nonsense from sex has existed for a billion years gender maybe a thousand at best
  ah okay so you agree that gender does exist
  fair enough i guess i dont understand not being understanding to your friends like shit man my friends have done or believe in some dumb shit but itd take a lot to oust them as a friend just bc theyre trying to find themselves in the little time theyve got i got a friend going through a communist phase but for the first time in their life they believe in themselves so fuck it ive got a friend whos dedicated to the church but it gives their life meaning and makes them feel like theyre not alone
  i say fad because a lot of these people do not genuinely have gender dysphoria they have just been told that saying they do will get them the attention they so desperately crave its been very pushed that saying your trans will get you special social standing and your a protected class hence why we see such out of proportion numbers of trans people as compared to the past if it was not a mental illness and just a normal part of humanity it would be way more prevalent threw out history and not just appear in a hand full of cultures over the course of humanity
here is how i think of it  im not a fan of humoring this delusion but its necessary to respect people as they are dont fuck with self identity its important  he will always be a man always however the way he chooses to view himself is also important call him a she if it makes him feel better its a sign of respect to your friend that you humor that delusion  respect is important as long as they arent shoving shit down your throat humor them
  it exists for the same reason we have the color mauve it is only for people who are unsatisfied with a word like purple even though mauve is literally the same thing as purple
  out of curiosity how many transfolk have you actually talked to and listened to
  well put  but i gotta say for how much id like to dismiss them sometimes its hard id like to brush them off my shoulder but the true is the lower sometimes does get to me is not much ighthe fact they are wrong but they still thibk they are right more the fact these barking dogs as masses manage to make ppl lifes worst  hopefully theyll die out within this generation and when ill die if ill die old the world is gonna be a much better place
  mauve describes a certain shade of purple they are not perfectly synonymous similarly gender describes ones expression of ones sex but the two terms are not exactly interchangeable its not a hard concept you almost got it
  lots they are over on here  havent you noticed you can go in and read whole threads of them discmtheir feelings and just their lives in general my opinion is based off of what ive seen many say and express they might not all agree with my assessment but that doesnt make it wrong people lie to themselves and many dont want to admit the problems they have or that they are attention whores
  no i mean oneonone conversations with transfolk where you listen to them not reading 4chan posts that claim their trans/you assume are trans and basing your conclusions on that i ask again how many transfolk have you actually talked to and listened to
  ben shapiro  if this isnt bait theres probably very little hope for you if by facts you mean biological sex and by feelings you mean the internal experience of gender and/or gender dysphoria then yes the discrepancy between the two is a fact that trans people know all too well and its the exact reason they might try to ask their friends to help them feel like a person by addressing them in a way that makes them feel valid if youre in the business of invalidating someone and making them feel shitty because of arbitrary factors like biological sex that doesnt make you a valiant defender of facts in a chaotic and emotional society it makes you an asshole  trans people dont pretend to be trans for attention or for diversity points or whatever /pol/ is saying all the trans people i know have gone through so much shit since coming out from family members and friends refusing to validate them to the daily struggle of being called a freak or a degenerate every day when theyre just trying to live their lives the image of an sjw dystopia where trans people are given privilege over cis people is completely absent in the modern world and if you had a single trans friend youd know that  my advice stop talking to them if youre the kind of person to tell someone who they are because of some scrawny jewish nerd on the internet you wouldnt be a good friend anyway
  anti semitic piece of shit youre no fucking better did trannies ever get genocided and put in work camps fuck off bens suffered more than these sex perverts his grandparents were in fucking camps
gender isnt real  you have a penis vagina or a medical condition and youre either okay with it or youre not and want to change it  everything else is overthinking
  fuck off you stupid jew
  i have known 6 trans people in real life out of those i think 1 had actual body dysmorphia the other 5 were just sad stupid kids who were confused and thought it was cool and would get them acceptance from their peers they all when to high school with and were friends with my younger brother honestly it seemed like the 5 were lonely and horney and they didnt get attention from girls and wanted sex or love so badly they were willing to pretend to be girls themselves to get it o and shocker not a few years out 4 of those 5 no longer live as girls they grew out of it and found out it wasnt really for them gender fluid my ass more like they didnt actually want to go threw with getting their dicks cut off other then them my opinion has been based of people posting here mostly on soc where there are lots of pictures and timestamps so they are who they say not just people pretending to be trans
  using the wrong term  its from high school    if you base your world on your high school experiences you have a lot of growing up to do still please tell me youre under 20
  i know thats why i picked that example so i could make this point right here  they are not perfectly synonymous  yes and gender and sex are not synonymous but they represent one thing in different ways all of the colors mauve represents on the spectrum can be described as purple this doesnt mean they arent purple it means they are a specific way of describing purple gender describes sex
  agreed on everything except that ben shapiro is a fag ben shapiro is epic
  lmao you cant even read my reply properly my brother was in high school these were his classmates i talked to im 32 years old the majority of these trans people are in there teens and early 20 because its a liberal fadlove how you only address one small part of what i said and do that incorrectly typically leftists argument style here dont address the point being made next you resort to name calling since you cant have a pointed discussion on the subject
  i agree that gender describes sex in some sense but we obviously disagree as to how rigidly gender is defined by biological sex
  acting like everyone should learn your dictionary of terms no one cares its only important to you and no matter how much you whine you cant force others to used your made up terminology
  omg guys he met 6 confused people he could write statistic about trans people lol its not thate he ignored your argumet you have no argumentw dummie
  ben shapiro is 53
  he doesnt know that all words are made up
  how many trans people do you know ive read the oppintins of literally hundreds which is what ive based my opinion off and you still cant debate any of the actual points ive brought up your are only proving my point that you people get ass hurt when you cant force your misguided opinion on othere and defelct the conversation also you assume im a guy so funny how your all upset for trans people but assume my gender when it has nothing to do with the discussion its so funny how stupid and unable to formulate valid points most leftist are this thread was a good laugh deflect deflect deflect
tell him youre not going to respect his wishes because you want the best for him  severe ties if need be
  oooo more deflection no language is what is recognized by a whole group of people your terms are made up and recognized by very few
  this    guy didnt have have a strong father to follow so now his identity issues and crisis follow
  looooool i cant believe you are really basing the argument on how many trans people we met irl do i have to explain why thats stupid and then you go on bringing in your assuming your gender meme but end up writing deflect deflect lol is this a joke stop watching blaire white and other cringy yt videos   anyway you seem to think transgenderism is a lib fad like it was born today  all i hope from you is to respect ppl who actually have dysphoria which btw you do not know more abput the doctors who diagnose it
  fact is your friend is asking you to call she do your feelings tell you to do differently if yes why are you seeking validation on 4chan  anyway nice larp
  i didnt say i dint respect them i said that not all trans people actually have dysmorphia that lots of people and just sad and confused and think being trans will help them i said that some people do actually have dysmorphia and that its a mental illness because it is not being able to except your body and wanting to mutilate it as a result is a mental illness im not saying they are bad people its just very sad that they feel that way and will go to such extremes to change their physical body to suit their delusion its wrong that its so encourage to harm your body rather then work on helping your mind except the healthy normal body one has the push to handle it this way and to tell everyone to question their gender is a political agenda
  npc meme go away we are human here to stay
  ok this is a much more compelling argument if you want to call gender dysmorphia an illness thats fine i think about it more as a condition mainly because heres a study      theyve actually done studies on the brains of transgender people and have found some interesting results typically male and female brains look differently from each other and have founds that a transgender persons brain while looking most similar to the sex they were born as have very similar qualities to the gender that they identify as and thats even before they have any types of surgery or hormones added the longer they went through hormone treatments their brains began to resemble more and more to the brain of the gender that they identify as until it was almost identical    givenw this info i identify it as a condition they were already born with some of the qualities of their gender    i dont think calling mutilating what they do to their body its fair its a procedure enable from doctors they are encouraging trans people to live the healthiest and happiest way possible i dont think you should act as if you know better  they are not delusion its been proven itt
  its kind of like you are saying  yeah they are in the wrong body but should go on with it anyway because to me thats mutilating  its not easy its extremly painful and many kill themselves transition is the only way way for them to live an happy and healthy life please understand this
  you all other should learn how to keep up with time  yeawere all so envious of your mediocre cognitive abilities
  i guess you really are you seem unable to understand the facts proven scientifically itt sorry
  youre making a lot of assumptions there i am not responding to your facts or science im simply pointing out that you cant even formulate a coherent thought or translate it into a complete sentence  itt  this thread is full of morons trying to sound smarter than each other none of you know what respect is grow up and be decent people this shouldnt even be a question treat other people with respect until they prove that they dont deserve it its always a two way street you have to give respect to get respect no matter who you are
  damn anon in that regard you aee right i believe in my ideas but my english sucks given my mother tongue wnglish should ne easy though
  just dont be a dick its not that hard to just say she/her its only a pain when people start with the weird made up pronoun bullshit im not speaking fucking martian to address you
  say that the sun is blue because it might offend an idiots sensibility otherwise  if youre male youre male  fuck off
  hes asking our group to call him a she  i think facts dont care about your feelings  i fail to see how those are incompatible  language doesnt care about chromosomes language only cares about useful descriptions  the most useful way to call someone whos in all functional ways female is she    language being descriptive is a fact that doesnt care about how you feel about it
  in all functional ways female  yeah keep telling yourself that dumbass
  language is a means of communication and should reflect reality saying that a man is a woman is still a lie no matter how you feel about it
whats with all the tranny enablers here dont pretend that you actually think that men in dresses are women theyre not and you know it they know it as well but they try to brainwash themselves into thinking otherwise its not kind to lie to them and let them live in denial its just easier for you cowards because youre too afraid to confront them
  incredibile how all /pol/tards keep babbling the same stuff over and over even though science proved them wrong keep crying babbies facts dont care about your feelings   trans dudes and ladies will contiue to exist and our society is becoming way more leftist as time pass have fun not being able to do anything about it
  all people who dont fall for the tranny meme are /pol/tards  incredible and what science are you talking about do you mean the same science that proved that there are no meaningful differences between male and female brains and therefore it is impossible to be born with the wrong brainsex
  what science    read the thread its been already argued and lol  your made up facts
  muslims will start slaughtering you all soon enough
  no meaningful difference      literally scientifically proven
is he a lesbian who is trapped in a mans body too    if so thats a big red flag he isnt really one     is he single too or hasnt had a gf in a long time or if ever then thats another red flag    sounds like he is going through some weird phase where because he doesnt or cant get his dream girl he wants to create her by becoming her i know it sounds like some fucked up serial killer shit but thats what it will look like to me if he possesses those traits i just mentioned
  so we should call him a he
  tell him youll start calling him a she when he transitions
  every day i thank god for hrt every person that transitions is one less subhuman to pass on their defective genes
  maturity / being correct    if i showed a little kid a tranny their natrual reaction would be revulsion  its not a mature reaction but it is the correct one
    makes a tonne of good points  ignores them all so um have you like akshully met and spoken to trans people  yes actually 6 different experiences etc more good points made   only 6 experiences back to high schooll    arguing with the mentally ill not even once
  omg guys he only met 6 people lol    same poster     i cant believe ur basing it off how many trans people we know    so just to confirm you ignored all his points and strawmanned him with a question about if he knew any trans people which he did countering your strawman and then you have the stupidity to make that second post admitting you dont know any trans people yourself    by your own definitions he has more experience and knows more about trans issues than you do
my boss neighbor is trans ftm she hasnt had her twat flipped so i refer to her as meatbag anyway shes upper 30s shes nuts    she constantly stands at the back fence and moans when my boss and his daughter are outside playing every time my boss talks tp his wife the meatbag repeats what he says in a mocking tone at 10pm every few days she gets on her motorcycle and revs the fuck out of it     she used to be part of the gym i worked at they had to kick her out because she would get naked shove a dildo halfway in her vag and go shower in the mens changeroom     this adds nothing to the thread really just wanted to share
          lise eliot a professor of neuroscience at the chicago medical school and the author of pink brain blue brain says that anyone who goes searching for innate differences between the sexes wont find them    people say men are from mars and women are from venus but the brain is a unisex organ she said     huh really makes you think    well it makes normal people think but the mentally ill such as yourselves are just hellbent on denying modern science
  but even if he flips his dick in hes still biologically a male
  but one neuroscientist says  but male and female brains are not much more different  so one person says they are different really does make you think
  why and when did dd switch from nerd shit to a bastion of faggotry every time i hear about dd or similar tabletop rpgs its always about a troupe of pansexual demiqueer xe/xem/zirs going on an adventure to the dildo factory    as for the pronouns ask him if i had a toyota camry took the toyota symbol and camry decal off replaced them with a chevrolet symbol and corvette decal and made high speed race car sounds every time i drove it what kind of car do i drive when he says toyota camry tell him i truly believe my automatic transmission family car is now a high performance manual transmission sports car so what kind of vehicle do i really have when he answers a camry again tell him its the same thing with the pronouns he uses no matter what he wants to call himself it wont change who he really is continuing the car analogy as you check the car and feel theres parts to fix he wouldnt let you buy corvette parts to replace camry ones it might still run but it wouldnt run at the level it was created to run and it would never truly be a corvette no matter how many parts were swapped hed stop you from making poor decisions youre doing the same for him
  questioning his gender  what the fuck does that even mean  hes asking our group to call him a she  does your group call each other he/she can you give a context to where this will ever be relevant it seems like a minor problem and he is a bitch for even bringing it up
hanging around with degenerate trannies    your first mistake
  why and when did dd switch from nerd shit to a bastion of faggotry  pretty much everything in niche entertainment from comics to literature to ttrpgs to indie videogames has become infested with lgbt and feminist shit theres a whole generation of deranged people
  just do it   despite what /pol/ might tell you it doesnt hurt to refer to somebody with a preferred pronoun or whatever trannies are still people they just suffer from a severe mental illness   if it makes you uncomfortable to associate with somebody who acts this way thats okay you can stop being friends with them at any point theres no shame in distancing yourself from somebody who has very clearly gone off the deep end especially if what theyre doing is morally questionable
  all male organs are different because they are roughly 10 bigger which is exactly what she is referring to why didnt you post the whole quote     male and female brains are not much more different from each other than male or female hearts or kidneys
  ignores the point that it is literally only one person saying that  ignores that the article even says in the science world its something thats divisive   averaged across many people sex differences in brain structure do exist
     the point that it is literally only one person saying that    you could find a thousand similar srticles if you cared to do one google search     that the article even says in the science world its something thats divisive     of course its divisive so is science on climate change but im sure we would both agree that it doesnt mean climate change isnt real     averaged across many people sex differences in brain structure do exist    nice try cherrpicking a quote again you do realise i can just post the rest of the quote and shatter your point every time you do that   another study found that averaged across many people sex differences in brain structure do exist but an individual brain is likely to be just that individual with a mix of features as new scientist reported in 2015    also something else you seem to have missed  because most scholars know that any small statistical difference between men and women will make headlines academics desperate for funding and attention often focus studies on gender disparities you go back to data analyze it for sex and if you find a difference then guess what you have another paper
  suicide rates go up after transition they are not in the wrong body they are mentally ill and should be working towards fixing their mental health and excepting the healthy normal body they have     it is mutating those hormones couse cancer and a whole host of other health issues that simply going to counseling would not couse these doctors are leftist and push for transition because that is what their political agenda preaches will help everyone has both male and female attributes that dose not mean pumping hormones into your body is a healthy thing to do let alone surgically removing parts anyone who cant except their healthy normal body and is willing to go to surgery to change it has body dysmorphia even a girl wanting a boob job she should he able to work records excepting her natural body but instead gives into mental illness and goes threw painful surgery its the same thing trans people just have a worse delusion then others and are being give bad advice on dealing with it simply to push a political agenda they are being made into pawns at the expense of their health
  been shapiro is a tranny you retards    that being said just use her pronouns its easy as fuck youre not outing yourself to the general public and honestly it helps cement your other views cus most of the population wont instantly see you as unreasonable
   could find  do my work for me   course its divisive  ok   brain is likely to be just that  likely  thats why i didnt quote that bit because its not a certain thing stupid
all i really care about mentally is man or woman its not really something that hugely matters but there are a lot of social nuances associated with the genders so it sort of just streamlines everything    if you were born with a vagina im inclined to want to fuck you if you were born with a nutsack youre my competition if either gender wants to change that it makes me uncomfortable most people ive spoken with who have are very awkward and are usually just more on the masculine or feminine side of their respective genders which ends up making it really confusing when interacting with them because a girl that switches usually has more characters of a girl than a man or even an effeminate man and viceversa this makes me uncomfortable and the immediate mental association is one of hormone abuse and genital mutilation     those are my feelings on the matter    my thoughts are that i cant really claim i know any better medically or psychologically because frankly i lack the credentials and knowledge    the fact of the matter is that no matter how much anybody tries to bully me into thinking otherwise its not going to change the way i feel      so i say do what youre comfortable with if you can live with watching your friend go through this and catering to their whims then go for it if not then it may just be time to move on if you care about his wellbeing then talk to him dont confront him just let him explain himself and see where these roots stem from
  i don know why but i read that as goblins
  asks me to provide sources  provide some  asks for more  i tell you where you can find more   my job for me   kek     brain is likely to be just that    thats why i didnt quote that bit because its not a certain thing stupid    and yet in your previous post you wrote  averaged across many people sex differences in brain structure do exist    you dont understand the concept of averages do you
  ever heard of innocent until proven guilty its not our job to teach you basic science which if you didnt have your own agenda you would have learned already but it is fact your job to disprove the current widely accepted scientific theory binary genders in favour of your own    its not our job to teach flat earth theorists that the earth is not flat any less than it is our job to teach you there are two genders it is their job their job to find proof that validates their theories not ours
   me to provide sources  can you provide a source for me asking for a source   you dont understand the concept of averages do you  sure do its still more evidence than likely    current widely accepted scientific theory binary genders   i never said that i dont agree with the binary genders theory were talking about how male and female brains are different i understand that genders are now or maybe always were defined as something socially constructed while sex is biological
even if there were male and female brains in that sense that theyre vastly different and you can be born with a wrong kind of brain))) male trannies still wouldnt be women because the rest of their bodies would still be male the same goes for female trannies bodies matter even if it offends postmodernists having a male or a female body means having different experiences its literal material reality you guys can stop being delusional now    also i dont care if you want to be gender nonconforming thats totally fine just stop lying about reality
  postmodernists  that doesnt mean what you think it means
  can you provide a source for me asking for a source  sure        and yes saying  only one person said this   is asking for more sources
  only replies to the joke part of my post  still the only source he can provide is google it maaaaan
have sex with your friend youre obviously in the closet
  it probably doesnt because thats the nature of postmodernism its an intrinsically pretentious concept you can exhibit it by basically being any sort of antimodernity special snowflake you are objectively postmodern in that sense
  un  anon i
    i was only pretending to be retarded gotcha      the only source he can provide is google it maaaaan  see the first paragraph of    not to mention youve been using multiple quotes from a source i gave you itt still ill cut you some slack it must be hard living with dementia at such a presumably young age
bait    sage
  what do i do  use proper nouns instead of pronouns  nobodys infallible truth violated  nobodys delicate feels bruised    but im pretty sure all you faggots on both sides just want to argue so go ahead with that
  postmodernism is anything i say it is    well at least you understand it
   was only pretending to be retarded gotcha  anon it was clear i was asking for a source before like you said saying only one person was saying something is asking for a source so me asking for a source on asking for a source was a joke i know it ruins it having to explain it but you didnt get it   see the first paragraph of  your provision of sources is one article on one person saying something for someone else you were talking to i am saying you had to cherry pick an article where one person is talking about something as if its fact and your response is google mannn  not to mention youve been using multiple quotes from a source i gave you itt  because you are using it as if its 100 fact and it refutes your own point dingus
think about what will make him happier and do that its as simple as that
  the specifics of what youre talking about are irrelevant the point of my post   was that you are the one who has to prove your point of view to others and provide others with sources not the other way around when you claim someone commited a crime they dont have to go out of their way to prove their inocence the accuser has to go out of their way to prove their guilt
why do transgender people trigger you all so much their life is of absolutely no concern to you it doesnt affect you at all having to call someone she instead of he is not a huge issue you are turning it into a bigger problem than it is  just do what makes the people you care about be happier whats so hard about that whats more important not making that 0001 extra brain effort to say she instead or he or making a person feel happier and more comfortable
  that doesnt solve anything o enlightened fencesitter constantly using someones name in lieu of pronouns would be really awkward you would have to stop using himself/herself entirely when talking about the trans person and what if they decide they want to be called a different proper name you get the same issue of whether its right to call them by what they prefer or what they were born as
  i was just pretending to be retarded   but unironically     oof didnt read the rest of your post
  it does affect my life when male trannies attempt to invade female only events like sports for women and obviously win because of their male bodies and thats just one example nobody would care if trannies just tried to live their lives peacefully without bothering other people but this is not the case
  thats an issue thats unrelated to the pronouns thing im talking about the pronouns thing
  i dont understand someone trying to make a joke so i better just call them retarded  tob geg m9
  what do i do  its funny that your friend is brave enough to face his friends with honesty and you come to 4chan for advice lol the choice is simple do you want to keep your friend or keep your pride
  it does affect me when tranny freaks start getting put in schools to brainwash my kids into being trannies    be a freak if you want to be but stay the fuck away from normal people especially kids
  why dont you take a trip into the city and call a nigger a nigger and see how that goes thats a much better analogy than whatever you said about blue suns
  ha as if youll reproduce
  entire media complex has sanctioned harassing and doxxing people online for crime think  hurr you afraid you might lose your job or something wow real tough   this brave and institutionally enabled mentally ill person is called names sometimes check your privelege   daily reminder that its not a choice its mental illness or ideology
  daily reminder that choosing to use wrong pronouns when its literally easier to use the right ones is mental illness narcissism or ideology
  be me   white  not a deracinated sheltered little bourgie like you   get called slurs and names for being different too   dont beat people up for it or slit my wrists     how about you act like a civilized human being instead of a goddamn animal
  people who dont believe what i believe are narcissists   good to know that your ideology of tolerance doesnt prevent you from dehumanizing others really goes to show how affective all that brainwashing did to prevent future conflicts on the basis of skin color or sexual orientation
  you didnt respond to the question i notice
    neither of these have anything to do with this thread this was just a question of do i refer to a person whos begun to outwardly present themself as female as  she in their presence do i split the difference and call everyone they or do i act completely autistic and take every opportunity to remind this person they were born with a dick  facts dont have feelings  sure but people do you think youre winning some intellectual victory by only being factual but youre just being a cunt you all probably have interactions every day where you make small compromises in order to not be a complete dick honestly if it looks like a woman ill call it she out of simplicity if it looks like a man with long greasy hair then maybe we need to have a man to man talk about expectations vs reality in the long run though its not going to hurt you to not be a bully
  ideology of tolerance  kek im far right and not trans im just smart enough to see when things are legitimately harder than they need to be even big man shapiro tranny hater extraordinaire dicks up pronouns and uses them correctly more often than he doesnt    nice straw man tho buddy itd be hard to argue against my actually beliefs so i can see why you havent
  i did i gave an answer youve probably never heard of you low born freak stop acting like an animal if someone says something that hurts your fee fees its not an excuse to get someone fired from their jobs or beat them up     go fuck yourself you toxic moron
    tranny damage control    off yourself degenerate
  kek im far right and not trans  its just that if you disagree with someone enough to the point where you work use their ideologically motivated language youre a narcissist   uh huh why dont i believe you
  cant wait for the non asnwer   because u dumb lol
  youll give them an inch and theyll take a mile no im not going to use the pronouns just to be nice and entertain their delusions
  wow you resort to nothing but insults that quickly you seem to find my premise foolish and unnecessary but you still think your ideas make sense open your eyes child youre being contrarian for no reason
  if you cant handle reactions to what you say you shouldnt say them this isnt hard      probably because youre a brainlet who thinks language is restricted between types of people you say you cant wait for a non answer but all youve done is no youre not
  gang beating people for hurting your feelings or killing yourself for people hurting your feelings are just fine ways to behave   no
  well by all means tell me about how far right your ideology i mean i can sure tell youre a right eing radical by the way you think that using ideologically charged egalitarian language is just fine with you and how you think there is no nomos by which people ought to behave by
  that wasnt the same person so now youre throwing around insults based on nothing youre an absurdist i never said i supported or condoned suicide or violence as a response im saying i understand that words and actions have consequences if you feel that you should always call a male a man then why wouldnt you also believe you should always call a nigger what it is its because you are a weak bully and you can only prey on people weaker than yourself or people who cant reach you     and for reference im white too but id rather not lump myself in with your ignorance would you like to insult or argue against anything else i never said or claimed to believe
  greentexting things that no one has said or implied at any point  i feel bad for you
  unironically believing that you cant be both right wing and a decent human being
  that no one said  ahem  why dont you take a trip into the city and call a nigger a nigger and see how that goes thats a much better analogy than whatever you said about blue suns    lrn2read
id just call them whatever they want im okay with the lgb part but the whole trans shit never sat right with me especially when people start advocating for small kids transitioning or mtf participating in womens competitions however if someone wanted me to call them he/she/it/whatever id do it just because its common courtesy im not gonna start ranting in their face and getting triggered just because they asked nicely if i could use a certain pronoun its not something that affects me much so id rather not ruin a potentially good interaction with that person
  personally i think there is an epidemic of megalomania in this country he can get a sex change if he wants its not a big deal because its not gonna hurt anyone but hes never actually going to be a girl hes gonna be a dude with fake tits a mutalated dick and an artificial hormone imbalance there isnt shit he can do to change that chromosome as for the megalomania thing im a straight dude that paints his nails and openly admits i kissed another dude before but despite that im in touch with my feminine side that doesnt mean i feel the need to get rid of my dick and be called a woman
just use whatever pronouns they prefer    wow so difficult
  i wrote it you moron show me where it says that violence is an appropriate response show me where it says victims of bullying should just slit their wrists you cant why its not there the point was youd be unwilling to go call a bunch of inner city black people nigger but you have no problem verbally assaulting someone you dont see as a threat
  youre an absurdist  camus a shit   if you feel that you should always call a male a man then why wouldnt you also believe you should always call a nigger what it is   i do i dont like most black people and disparage nigger culture regularly they were better off singing jazz and smoking weed not whatever they fuck they do now if a black person acts civilized then so be it if not niggers i dont like white trash either its that simple just act like a proper human being     its because youre a bully who preys on the weak  ive had my ass kicked more than a few times for speaking my mind i get mine more than i get got though if you hold views youre not willing to express and protect then they arent your views       enabling self destruction is moral and decent   no its not i will not assist someone to destroy themselves youre not far right at most youre an american conservatives which for all objectivity sake is a reactionary liberal within the context of the enlightenment values in american culture i am not going to engage and support culture that emables the mentally ill to mutilate themselves
  anti immigration pro ethnostates pro eugenics anti tax im just not a fucking snowflake who cant handle people having different lifestyles degenerates gonna degenerate caring annoy it is what brings you down to their level
  he doesnt therefore noone can
  bash him
  show me where i said violence is a proper response   even in this same post    the point was youd be unwilling to go call a bunch of inner city black people nigger but you have no problem verbally assaulting someone you dont see as a threat    why else would they be a threat if they werent violent youre saying even if you dont quite understand it that the status quo for black people being called a nigger is violence which it isnt first of all black people do not all have hair trigger tempers second of all youre saying that your assumed reaction among these groups to bullying is a normal and justifiable response because of the aggressor who wants to prey on the weak     that is what i mean when i say they need to act civilized their is a nomos a law by which people ought to behave for their own benefit and for the benefit of others
  im not aware of the khmer rouge   you could just as easily be a left wing racial separatist you know racialism isnt inherently right wing  in fact nationalism for most of the 18th and 19th centuries were seen as radically left wing alternatives to monarchism the point of having a law is that you say you will not tolerate x behavior     granted this is a mental illness and not necessarily a crime there is still a normative behavior by which you need to behave by that is the whole point of deontological ethics to begin with my dude
  observing a thing is not the same as supporting or promoting it youre just as bad as the sjw snowflakes youre arguing against claims that no one is making you can project all you want it just shows how confused all your ideas are
    this guy studied philosophy and now he thinks hes the smartest guy in the room that or hes practicing arguing just for fun hes failing at both either way
  observing a thing is not the same as supporting or promoting it  oh please the only reason you brought up a comparison between using the wrong pronouns and calling street thugs nigger was to introduce violence into the equation and call me a coward because you wouldnt say it then huh dont pretend that you getting schadenfreude from this is nonexistent when youve been so persistent in calling me a bully ive already told you that i will call a spade a spade for its own benefit at this point youre just lying about your intentions and accusing me of projection reflexively     youre not observing anything btw youre using a priori logic to promote a cultural identify that you dont even understand
  insecurity   cope
  youre making a lot of assumptions about my life experience you also make a lot of assumptions and leaps in logic to argue against nonsense that no one is purporting i cant even take you seriously i tried
    i love contra
  lol its been proven trans brains are more similar to the gender they are theres enough difference between the brains to say this but keep seething trans people will go on living their true selves why you sperg on 4chan
fuck niggers and trannies
  coping on my 4chan no way
its at least funny to see anons cherrypicking scientific pieces and seriously think they know better than doctors and psychologists who enable transition to people with dysphoria transition which is a medical treatment approved by all first worlds medicine stop arguing with them like they are worh something these gaslighting emotional babbies arent worth more than trash  stop deluding yourselves   trans people are here and wont go anywhere go live on a mountain in the middle of fucking nowhere if thats so annoying to you or even better stop being retarded
  lmao shut the fuck up faggot
    embrace free speech if it hurts his feelings stop interacting with him he just wants to start trouble over nonsense
    lol
    no he doesnt        in this interview he specifically said that he doesnt    stop lying
    theres plenty of medical and biological reasons    if you have more than 2 chromosomes you have down syndrome    psychologically transgender people tend to suffer suffer from gender dysphoria a mental illness much like anorexia    just because i got my dick cut of and put on a dress it doesnt mean that his chromosomes or bone structure magically change  its absurd too say that their arent clear differences between genders specifically psychology physiology and brain structure
    makes scientifically backed claim    shut up    lol
    t roastie failing at trying to start a meme
    agreed
  submitting under pressure for fear of losing tenure/reputation
  either care about your friends feelings or dont     friendships dont care about facts as much as mutual respect you could always speak to your friend honestly if this is an impasse in your friendship that allows one or both of you to leave the friendship then it wasnt a very important friendship to begin with
  right so its a fact that your friend asked you to use a different term so put aside your feelings and do it or dont be their friend bc you cant deal with your feelings
  shut up abomination
  trannyfag delusions    back to plebbit fag
  these people arent human op he made that choice to become how he is so say what you like violence may be necessary also
  i mean i dont think youre wrong but i also dont see the need to be an asshole if you really feel that strongly you can just ghost i ghost people all the time for little reason just avoid using pronouns entirely and try to relax
  lol funny how youd sooner think to call a black person a nigger the analogy holds because you can identify a black person without using slurs same way you can identify a woman without saying cunt    fucking leftists and their latent racism i swear
  tell it that you question them also and _feel_ they are not a she but a muppetwanker insist on calling them that
  kill yourself
  shrinks exist for a reason go to one      roll playing  just pretend hes a girl nigga wtf
  
  i wouldnt call them that but i am aware that the term exists and that its not an appropriate way to address another human being trying to give other people a base level of respect isnt a leftist ideal and if it is it shouldnt be i dont understand your actual problem with referring to a person as she if they ask and are respectful towards you
  depends if you care about him to a level where youll indulge his feelings call him she if you dont care about his feelings call him him if you care about his feelings but honestly feel like hell suffer long term harm if you humour him also call him him
  its funny to see you blindly put these people on a pedestal while pretending that social pressure powerful organizations and establishments with a political view in one way or another have no bearing on scientific consensus and the claimed opinions on individuals within the scientific medical and academic research fields gender identity is one of many scientific issues that has been unnecessarily politicized in part because of the powerful forces mentioned above that exercise undue influence and bias over the scientific community and any dissenting opinions it has always been that way to a degree but it is steadily becoming worse as time goes on you can respect the scientific method and the sacrifices these people make for the purpose of scientific advancement but dont pretend like they arent susceptible to the same institutional corruption biases or lack of morality as anyone else in any other field of work is
  contrapoints is dumb as fuck its like the altlefts sargon of akkad except stupider
  wow you mean they were just in it for a quick buck off sensationalist idiots feeding them views    nnnnnaaaawww nobody does that on youtube
  not a huge fan of jpfaggotry but what he said was spot on the problem of transexuals really has little to do with their existence it has to do with the way language and truth has to be redefined to establish ideology and sterilize traditions and parts of meaning most of the trannies i know know this and feel very guilty for being apart of this actually
you couldve summed up with gender its psuedo science being well spoken wont change the fact your conspiracy theory has no concrete  good luck founding a concrete article against gender that isnt pseudo science  all pro transition stuff has already been posted and not debunked
  to 
  use her correct pronouns and be a good friend you mannerless heathen btw transgendered people are indeed supporting by biology
only a narcissist would observe the world put people into categories then rather than collaborate with others who want to collaborate they try to impose their view on others i have no problem with some tiny dicked loser taking out their inferiority on the one group below them but i also have no problem with somebody using their body however the fuck they like ironic that people who go to a magic temple to light candles at specific schizophrenic times to pay tribute to magic fairies are the ones saying others are delusional
  climate change and the shape of earth are debated too dont worry trans people arent hiding any scientific fact
  im not about to go trudging though this entire thread but i do want to offer this  gender dysphoria is a medically diagnosable real condition that you can look up    essentially men and women have different brains on a physical level which can be seen in brain scans gender dysphoria happens when someone has the physical brain of the opposite sex if he feels like a she it might be because he literally has a she brain its not as baseless as youre probably thinking it is and its not a madeup sjw/liberal thing
tfw looking at tranny suicide rates and numbers  feels good i wonder why people go ahead and murder them why do it if they cant even pass being 30 years old
  tfw looking at mens suicide rates  feels good man dont have to worry about them theyll kill themselves anyway
why do so many of you faggots hate trans people
  pretty much a good thing too since working class men killing themselves will help in faster societal colapse if they dont contribute with taxes or work
  who needs working class men unless you mean soldiers otherwise they might as well kill themselves they provide nothing but violence and aggression
  anyone related or working for the state needs to die men women tranny whatever some are just kind enough to kill themselves early
  questioning his gender  you mean you get points for broadcasting you are just questioning damn he doesnt even have to go all in and still gets the benefit of manipulating everyone why cant we all just ignore their attention whoring seriously you dont have to look at every screech for attention
      im pretty sure both of you never worked in a physical job and would come crawling on your knees the moment the government and working class stops doing their jobs
  unless you mean soldiers  but you dont need men for soldiers according to games and movies even a 100 lb woman can easily take out two dozen well armed men
  nah just men      im ex military      no we dont but more soldiers will always help if you use movies or vidya for your reality it explains a lot
  my point is when others warp reality you dont have to participate we can call bullshit declaring you are a woman when you arent or fist pumping a badass girl cartoon character for knocking out a dozen guys with one punch as proof they can do anything a man can do only better will never make it so without everyone being in on the lie
  no youre point was sarcastically trying to tell me that we needed men because muh media shows off women as more badass than they are now that you cant argue vs that youve changed the goalposts to muh reality delusion be triggered elsewhere
hey regular users just had a question and wondered if you had any relevant experiences theres this girl that i enjoy the company of but before we hang out she always wants to light up and gets offended if i want to step out / tries to keep me in the room each time weve gone to dinner afterwards and each time shes gotten paranoid that im angry at her   how much of this is normal vs red flags   pic somewhat related shes a pawg
i smoked weed regularly for three years starting in high school it was fun at first but it are away at my savings and stopped feeling good after a while i then started dating a girl who never did any drugs in her life and that was my last incentive to quit     that girl youre with sounds annoying as shit though i remember doing the same to people who didnt smoke with me i was a pusher if im being 100 honest smoking weed or any other kind of frequent drug use is a massive red flag in girls fuck her if you want but dont cuff her she will likely cheat on or dump you once she finds a guy who has drugs ive been at parties where stoner girls gave head or even fucked guys who had weed or coke which girls love especially proceed at your own risk
  pic somewhat related shes a pawg    heh    do you smoke do you ever light up with her why do you step out    as a fairly frequent flyer i would be a little bummed if my potential partner or simply person i very much enjoy the company of was bothered enough by my smoking habits that they dont want to partake or even stay in the room i love to smoke before i go out     with that said if i knew that it bothered someone that i smoke around them i would stop doing it around them if you want something serious and she does too it should concern you that she continues to do this after youve made it clear it bothers you maybe a yellow flag
  thanks for the input
  i havent smoked in years she keeps saying she wants to get me to but im currently waiting to hear about a job with the government and its still a federal crime to have thc in your system even if its prescribed   i only made it obvious once that i didnt want to sit in and she was still thinking about trying to get me stoned it doesnt bother me per se really but i think she enjoys the conversation we have when she takes the first hit and i do too but i dont know that she has the mental maturity to think outside of her own situation at current her mom did hard drugs and she was born addicted to heroin but weaned off of it part of me says she may go to it but another part of me believes shes stubborn enough not to i dont know her that well yet
  let me go ahead and take back what i said in my last post dont proceed shes a ticking time bomb
  yeah   this is especially disconcerting because shes told me she had friends who were regular users of coke and i told her one of the circle of friends we have used to be a crack user and instead of trying to avoid him she asked if i thought she could get him to fall for her    cant help who you have feelings for im thinking of no longer reaching out to her and seeing if she still contacts me we met in uni and this is the last week of our semester together
  she wants to get closer to drug addicts for quick and easy access to drugs i know you cant control who you have feelings for but you sound like a smart guy whos better off finding a smart girl
  thanks for your input
talk to this one girl in uni every so often she sometimes asks me to hang out or study and i say well do it sometime laughs at my jokes   sometimes gives me alcohol at parties and snapchats me first i guess shes into me but im not sure im an autistic virgin but not kissless and want figure out how to go about getting with her what do
bump because im in a nearly identical position
  you already have her attention next step build a connection you must now indicate too her that your interested in her invite her too study in a public place after the studying becomes boring try too bring up conversations and topicsno politics that will allow you to understand her and have a feel for what she likes then try to relate to her you must after ask her that you would like to spend more time with her  seeing a movie getting coffee restaurant etc everything else is up to you now
the internet has made it so that i cant stand talking to people who i dont have much in common with ill start making a friend / start flirting with girls who show interest but soon ill realize how hard they are to talk to due to a lack of shared interests and start distancing myself    how the hell do i get over this part of me still is idealistic that i will get le qt anime loser gf but i know thats unrealistic
how do people manage ldr ive been having one for 2 months now and it feels like an absolute hell
dont i assume youve already run out of things to talk about
  im in an ldr rn were one and a half years already hes my first sucks desu sounds corny but weve grown to love each other already idk what more to say whadya wanna know
  we never had much to talk about im now just trying to talk to her more but shes kinda hard to get answers out    how do i go about asking for nudes
  how do you get to know each other without the relationship seeming extremely artificial
you dont manage a ldr its doomed to fail regardless
  did this start out as an ldr or did it become a ldr later on in the relationship
why does it feel like hell    i hate that having a gf costs me tons of money we share but still she lives so wasteful and cant even watch instagram girls without getting a rage fit but it great to have someone who cares you wants your body and is sexy to look at and always by your side
  3000 miles away
  mine lives 9000 miles away
mine has lasted three years at this point but now im hitting a new wall in how the fuck are we going to move in together in a way thats fair for the both of us
  you seem to be under the impression that they dont have plans to meet op never said if they did or didnt but if youre serious then you do have a plan
  this is a big meme   is right
unless your life revolves around playing online games of some sort together how do you manage to continually talk and strengthen an ldr
  well never going out for me my girlfriend seems to still hold up a social life though despite apparently not liking being social
  so what activities do you do together are you both part of an online circle of friends
  nah just talk to each other about what were up to and she tells me about her career i tell her about mine otherwise its talking about music which we both love    obviously if something big happens then thats what we talk about basically its like any couple
  just take time and calls are worth much more than the same time texting
  how are you going to feel when she starts fucking some dude under the radar then slowly disappears after she tells you shes confused about what she wants
question what about this relationship makes you guys wanna keep at it what are you getting out of it
  this
  i had a ldr for 2 years  she ended up cheating on me  not worth it unless you can regularly see each other like once a month or once every two months at least
  what attracted her to you in the first place is she also that into you need to be honest with self if this is really worth it otherwise if it was shallow to begin with why not see other people
    well firstly you think you know women but you dont know her secondly if she was going to do that surely she would have done so in the last three years
  well firstly you think you know women but you dont know her  i know more about the game than you do you retard i dont put myself in ldrs because its a disaster and women react on emotions if you knew what you were doing you wouldnt be here asking for advice
  this    my story from a few years ago    meet girl  she likes me i like her  we start dating  we start hooking up  fast forward by now weve been having sex for about 2 months  lying next to each other in bed after i nutted inside her  see text messages from some random foreign guy on her phone  confront her about it  turns out she was in a long distance relationship with some dude who lived on the other side of the planet they were together for like 2 years and she just told him a few days ago she didnt want to continue their relationship anymore    see the point im trying to make here with my personal anecdote if youre in a long distance relationship with a girl more often than not she will mingle with other dudes behind your back hoping she will eventually find a suitable replacement for you a guy who is at least as good as you but who lives in her own town/city after she has been cheating on you with this random dude and thinks she has got a firm hold on him she will eventually dump you and move on with the new guy    this is why i always recommend guys to steer clear of ldrs its a path that will lead you to alot of despair due to not seeing your girl often enough and it comes with a high chance of getting cheated on and eventually dumped
  oh shit you know about the game you know that only applies to drunk slags at the nightclub right i dont think you are able to put yourself into a relationship of any description so you needed this thread it really made you feel better didnt it
  then just marry the whore
  i broke up with her earlier this year aint happening
  its all games dude this applies to all women try dating girls that are real instead of this fantasy ldr bullshit
  but literally all of that can happen in a relationship anyway im not about to get rid of my current relationship based on what some random anon claims on 4chan
  i suggest you get a relationship of any description before critiquing mine
  i have a girlfriend guy you know what the best part is she lives in my town
  right and my ldr is on the moon
  might as well be if you cant see her then whats the fucking point dummy
    but literally all of that can happen in a relationship anyway  well obviously in every relationship there is a possibility of cheating to happen but my point is that in ldrs its way more likely     you can never satisfy your girlfriend if you can only see her once every few months or whatever it is add into that the fact that its easier to get away with cheating if your boyfriend lives far away from you trust me if your girlfriend meets a potential suitable replacement for you who lives closeby she will probably not back down from giving him a shot    im not saying its guaranteed to happen but its way more likely ldrs are so difficult that they usually just arent worth it your time and energy is way better invested into finding someone who lives closeby    inb4 give me proof of cheating being more likely in a ldr  fuck off use your brain because its common sense like i explained in this post
  its way more likely  yeah because if she was promiscuous shed totally waste her time leading on people that might not go anywhere    trust me bro when she meets someone more convenient she will ditch you in a second  again this is some sort of incel image of women i accept its a possibility but it doesnt seem likely considering she was a virgin until 24 and i came along    fuck off its common sense  its being a skeptic because youve clearly not had a relationship you remember fondly
  random anon here who is not one of the angry incels roaming this place     ok what is your relationship like you said earlier you find it hard to talk to her so what is the relationship built on    that other anon saying cheating is more likely has a point she might not necessarily be a slut or the kind to cheat but she might still grow detached from the relationship to a point where she wont want to be in it anymore      ldrs are not hopeless but it does take an especially strong relationship to work     also you guys video chat
  im not the op or who ever said they were finding it hard to talk to their significant other she busts my chops if i dont talk to her daily
  okay bro wish you luck in your ldr i gave you my perspective on this and clearly you identify your specific girlfriend as some special snowflake who would never ever cheat on you regardless of the circumstances     its being a skeptic because youve clearly not had a relationship you remember fondly  im not exactly a skeptic because of bad experiences ive never been cheated on myself as far as i know atleast its more that i try to think logically about these things and not pedestal women if you think about it with your head instead of with your dick you know that committing yourself to someone who lives thousands of miles away from you is not a good idea i see these ldr threads on the daily here and every single time the majority of anons advise firmly against it for all sorts of very valid reasons    problem is love makes it very difficult to think clearly and you will probably continue to convince yourself that your specific ldr will work out even though most others dont
  girlfriend as some special snowflake who would never ever cheat on you regardless of the circumstances  yes exactly its kind of what you do in a relationship  you clearly dont know what youre talking about whether the relationship is long distance or not you think you know because how high youre setting your guard but i can tell youve never been loved or let yourself be loved    if youre such an alpha male you feel you need to disregard them all rather than protecting one of your own then i feel sorry for you tbqh
  i hope a woman wrote this jesus
  im enjoying it now and thats all you need in this life to live in the now because tomorrow is a cruel place no matter what you do    but have fun planning how to make it impossible to be embarrassed with a woman when you first talk to them worrying about the future really works for those guys
  have a great time in your fantasy land until reality gives you a hard smack on the back of your head
  you just didnt find the right girl yet    i never had a long term relationship until i met a girl i was certain was perfect for me we married 4 years later
  well who avoids them life thanks for the advice you fucking tool
  what
question what about this relationship makes you guys wanna keep at it what are you getting out of it  i also want to know the answer to this
  who avoids hardship in life do you think youre winning by avoiding them
me and my boyfriend have been in an ldr for almost 4 months now it sucks not being able to have a hug or anything but we text every daywe have phone calls a few times a week exchange selfies/lewds and on special occasions we have video calls and we also send each other letters through the mail which helps to have a physical object
  what the hell are you talking about you incoherent retard
  ah never mind m8
  not sure if youre aware your username is op when you are clearly not the op
  wtf its so confusing keeping track of all the anons since your style of replying sounds like you are addressing stuff aimed at the op ok then all the best with your case if you think youre solid alright but dont underestimate the very real hazards of ldr
  oh shit
  waste of time   dont even try the only people who make it work are desperately doing so to prove to every person they know that theyre the one in a million and they have something special and genuine
  do you have any plans to move together at some point
how do i know when i have the right job and when to settle you never really know what youre getting into moving around different jobs its such a commitment the next job might not be anywhere near as good as last
when youre genuinely happy working there i suppose just know that moving around jobs is pretty much a requirement for advancement sometimes a lot of bosses wont pay you more than they have to and the only way to really show them they have to is to be ready to leave and use that experience somewhere that will hire you on at a better rate raises are rare these days
  do you resent going into work  yes   not right job  no  acceptable job    a job is something you do between 95 to fund your life work to live pal not the other way round
    thanks what are ways of finding out beforehand what are important questions to ask current employer and or person interviewing for new job is it reasonable during interview to ask if its ok to start in 2 weeks for notice or they might hire someone else
  not quite sure what you mean do you mean can you figure out if youll like it during the interview  for me wether or not ive enjoyed working for a company mainly boils down to the people i work with it could be the best job on the planet but if youre surrounded by shitbags its going to suck its luck of the draw on that one     most people moving jobs have a notice period so if it comes up in the interview tell them for reference ive revently accepted a new job and told them the earliest i could start is 1st feb they could not care less immediate start tends to be the exception not the rule     what job is it youre going for
  im currently warehouse/data entry worker going to start looking for work elsewhere when i get my resume updated im asking about questions to ask interviewer beforehand i have lead work experience should i look for that type of job basically we had mexican workers that spoke very little english i would communicate my bosses orders to them and help them get set up daily
hi guys i was wondering why is there so many perverts male on the internet and why is there so little woman on 4chan
  they directly correspont to eachother
  i just dont get it why are they so perverted
  frustration and escalating sexual fantasies leading to degeneracy and bitterness
my wife and i have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage we had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life however a little under a month ago she approached me about trying new things she has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage my wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to spice things up at first i thought it was a joke but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me i had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days i obliged    that next weekend she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable additionally the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks weve had together since the birth of our child we were back to our old sex life doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head however that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again i was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasnt cutting it for her but i agreed    this is when things took an extreme turn during this second pegging while my wife was inside of me she grabbed my hair craned my neck to the right and pressed our foreheads together i had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered i want your shit i pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said i want you to shit on me i pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying i felt like a dick because she thought i was shaming her in a way i was because i thought the request was far too extreme i ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends but didnt tell him what happened    1/3
not your personal literotica site
  she pegged me  1/3  dont bother we already know op is a faggot
after that incident my wife and i hardly talked all week unless it related to our son at the end of the week i asked my wife to talk about what happened she told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her i thought it was sickening but she claimed this was her deepest darkest kink i couldnt understand how and why my shit excited her but she insisted that she has always wanted this    we fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink i tried to put myself in my wifes shoes i told her that i will shit on her if that is what will turn her on she was so happy and even though i was still completely nauseated by this desire i wanted to satisfy her    that brings us to tonight we were having sex for the first time this week when i regrettably confessed to her that i had to take a shit she perked up with a smile sensed my discomfort and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me i still really didnt want to go through with it but since i had promised her i pulled out and we ran to the bathroom    she got into the bathtub and i hung my ass over the side of the tub i started pushing but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife i turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish with enough time i was finally able to get a turd to start coming out i could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening however before the turd was able to drop on her chest i felt a sensation around my asshole    i turned around and saw my wife  the love of my life the mother of my son  attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole i was horrified that she would try to do this and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldnt receive it in her mouth     2/3
  youre a disgusting person and a disgrace to men everywhere
as i clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and i heard it land somewhere beneath me i was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it so i ran to the other bathroom to clean myself as i was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how i will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again i heard footsteps approaching my wife lightly knocked on the door i didnt respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more i thought about what just happened she walked away and then i got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed    ive been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife we have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow but i dont think i can look at her after what she did to me i feel deceived and violated by the woman i love and trust during our initial conversations about this there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest she knew how uncomfortable i was with this in the first place yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established    i would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one im turning to this board for advice because for obvious reasons i cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and i i know that some of you may find this humorous but please serious comments only  this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage    3/3
      i know that some of you may find this humorous but please serious comments only
isnt this stolen from a reddit post where it already got a lot of replies days ago
  you know a bit too much about reddit to be welcome here kiddo
hay man so here is the thing it is not okay if you are not comfortable with something in sex and your wife needs to understand that he reaction to you saying no originally is a red flag as far as i am concerned you should talk it out of course but if you are not comfortable it is not okay
  im here for over a decade i think i get a pass
  ive been here since 9/11 newfag
  somebody post a link i want to see what happened also im extremely jealous if this is true
  wow thats before the website launched in 2003 old
  fuck you redditor
op this post made me smile  not being unsympathetic to your situation but the way you wrote it made it funny  sex is about respect try to make it so you can respect her and she you sexual desires need to be satisfied and if not they can lead to tension talk to her about whats going in your sex life what you like what she likes and the frequency you guys would be okay with it  the first step to making this productive is humoring her the next is communicating/disillusioning her maybe only as her birthday gift you do this idk do what makes you feel good ultimately if this doesnt then tell her that
  still a newfag
you loser ass faggot
you know sometimes we get off on weird shit  usually im pretty dominant in bed but one time while fucking my ex i was in full blown ecstasy and also drunk and i told her to slap my face  she did it but we never had sex again after that
ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
  ignore the trolls    some philosopher said you can never know where goingtoofar is until you go there    something  maybe the other wives  made your wife realize how vanilla her sex life has been and she took the chance of suggesting a little kink that worked so well that she got a little overenthusiastic and opened herself up to all her wildest fantasies and in the process went too far    now you both know where toofar is and you can have a calm and nonjudgmental conversation about it honey im happy were opening up our sex life but that last one was too far for me by all means lets experiment more but lets agree two things from the start either of us gets an absolute veto in advance or after and if we do go too far we will write it off as a mistake and not hold it against each other
    did you shit on her face
  shes getting you ready for the inevitable cucking that she is going to perform on you i mean she already doesnt respect you you let her fuck you in the ass but who knows maybe the bull she has in mind doesnt mind playing both ways maybe youll enjoy it as well   inb4 troll
  thinking memes are real
  most of this was pretty hot im not at all into scat but i could see myself shitting on someone if thats what they really wantedid never understand it though all for the pegging and occasional dominance though
well that escalated quickly
  contrary to your fantasy soccer moms arent discussing pegging while waiting on the kids
any advice on how to earn money without getting a job thanks in advance
get a career
good luck

how do i stop being a degenerate gambler im at the end
  step 1 learn math  step 2 realize that all of the usual games are rigged against you  step 3 redirect your addiction to trading which is gambling but it is possible to become a consistent winner so it is a gambling game that you can actually get good at and unlike poker no one can ban you from participating once you get really good
  what games do you play/what do you gamble on
i have a request for a website but i have the most vague memory of it    this website had romantic advice on how to fall in love and why we fall in love     one article just said that it was most of the time just dumb fucking luck    another article was a theory that being to friendly to women triggered the brother/family/incest part of their brain so it turned them off to fucking you but if you have different genes theyre more likely to want to mate  have kids with stronger immunities    i know this is a dumbass long fucking shot but those articles changed my view of relationships like 7 years ago    it was a plain text website not a blogspot not blog in the domain or anything like that    help would be appreciated lol

how do you breakup with someone youve been with for a couple months    weve already said i love you way too early for my liking but w/e im not going to say nothing back and she fucking obsesses over me and i just want it to stop without hurting her furthermore pretty much all my friends here are her friends and i know shell deal with it poorly they will resent me for making her feel that way
  im having a similar problem but i have my own friends so im not as screwed as you are ill be monitoring the thread to leech advice on how to break up amicably
  tell her that it was a mistake and you now feel differently about the relationship   you are fucked either way due to the friend situation so might as well save time on your part by not dragging it out
how do i deal with the fact the world is going to end soon i fantasize frequently about shooting up the nearby area and making a statement
   i fantasize frequently about shooting up the nearby area and making a statement  then why dont you
the world isnt going to end if you genuinely think that it will youre suffering from delusions and you should seek help before you hurt someone
looks like youll be spending the end of the world in jail op the internet police have been notified and the fbi will soon be at your door
if porn can be used to encourage homosexual behavior among those who are otherwise uninterested in such behavior could something similar be done to induce asexuality
  encourage homosexual behavior among those who are otherwise uninterested in such behavior  induce asexuality  thats not how sexuality works
  testimonials of people who stop using porn claim otherwise not everyone of course but its enough to not warrant immediate dismissal      well im asking because i want advice on how to do it not get a browbeating lecture from some sanctimonious folks
borderline thread    turns out many of my life damaging choices over the last decade has bee caused by having bpd  anyone around with it that can just idk talk about themselves about it  other suggestions of what i can do about it etc  know someone who has it what are they like
  look into dbt theres a workbook you can buy on amazon and work through if you cant afford therapy or cant go for some other reason bpd is treatable despite what some will tell you take responsibility for yourself its hard work but you can learn to regulate your emotions most people learn these skills as children for whatever reason you never did so you have to learn them now put in the effort and you can be a better person anon its all up to you
  here is the book you should get    
  sorry bad link    
  thanks ill see if i can find it free online though
im a 19 year old guy my mother is dying im failing all my classes in college and im emotionally fucked my whole life my household was broken my father would beat me senseless with a leather belt for the smallest accidents until i told the nurse at school when i was in 2nd grade after that it stopped and my father didnt speak to me he has been abusive to my mother after they got married he doesnt care about her or me only about his other children from a past marriage and they all have children of there own now he also was one of the lucky boomer immigrants from europe who came here and made it today his mill has over 140 employees and makes a hefty amount my mother came here with him after he met her in europe and was a complete stranger to the usa she abandoned everything to run away with him they had me and she stuck with him because she cares so much about me that she refused to leave him because she wanted to secure my future over the past several years shes developed many sicknesses one being very aggressive osteoporosis which is crippling her with no cure her new medication will probably make her go bald the past week she has been crying all day my father ignores her and treats her like a sub human i just sit there and let her cry on my shoulder even though i myself feel like crying because theirs nothing i can do to help her i am the reason she stuck through all the neglect and abuse im the reason shes falling apart she has nothing besides me no friends no will to live the only thing preventing her from suicide is me and now shes starting to talk about how she hopes she dies soon so i can be free im so tired i feel so helpless to come home everyday and see her like that to have my father give a fuck about the situation my father would kill me and her if we brought up therapy like she did long ago and its to late to fix either of them someone please give me some advice or help im desperate
honestly i would say fight your dad should something like that happen again or call the cops when you get video proof make sure he knows not to fuck with you again im very sorry to hear that this is happening to you
right now youre at a spot where college probably isnt your priority withdraw from your classes if you have time if not then just retake the classes eventually try only taking 1 or 2 classes start working for a bit it might help you gain focus try to take your mom on a trip or get her the therapy she needs im sorry about your mom op shits sad as fuck
tell your college see if you can get it so you temporarily pause your studies    dont try to throw yourself through it i had to care for my mother who had mental health issues and now because of the stress i have my own mental heath issues    your father is a dick id personally say try your best from resisting to kill him at least while your mother is alive if you want to get your friends to follow him home and break his skull with bats make sure your name is on the will first    and frankly be open to your close friends youll benefit from the catharsis
she stuck through all the abuse and neglect because she was afraid she couldnt support you on her own your father probably sees that as weakness or cowardice he sounds like a massive asshole but he has a point you arent going to fix your parents at best you can avoid repeating their mistakes     i think the key is to find a balance that lets you get on with your life this guy  has decent advice about school/work your mother needs your emotional support but if giving that support means you arent independent/happy/successful then thats an understandably bad outcome from her perspective just try to find a balance that allows you to keep moving forward
  i had a appointment scheduled at the schools student wellness center for a session but the lady gave me the wrong date by accident and didnt believe me that i was right so my next appoint is scheduled in a month because there so booked
  ok i have an idea if you really think he is going to beat you up if you bring up therapy then record yourself read this script pretty much and save it now set up cameras around the house where you think you gonna talk to him about it then do talk to him about it dont defend yourself get beat the worse it is the better it is when he is out get your cameras get your video go to a lawyer and sue his ass
  by this script i mean the op
  this may be deserved but op might encounter legal difficulty if hes essentially baiting his dad into this behavior    op here is what i suggest speak to your father as a man  there is stuff you have yet to do and stuff you are doing who matters here your asshole of a father no its your mom shes proud of you op in some ways you are more a man than your father ever was  talk to your dad about expectations for the future here is what is needed i need you to contribute this if you can here is what i am going to do to make shit better  shit is stressful as fuck and its not going to get any easier you however will get better at handling it and thats what you seem like you need right now  share with your mom some beauty shes had a hard life take her to a concert show her a pretty view  more than anything do what you are motivated to do you can do some awesome stuff here op your father be damned  also get therapy for you and your mom as soon as possible take her out say youre exploring the city/burbs/etc and take her she needs someone to give her guidance as much as she needs someone to listen to her youve done good things so far op but you arent done yet  you might appreciate this song   and you and your mom might enjoy a good movie koe no katachi  share the good op and when the time comes put your asshole of a father down for the man he wasnt and if you happen to grow even more than i anticipate forgive him  godspeed op
        thank you for the kind words of advice i really appreciate it all
how do i stop being a virgin im 19 and in my country it means last year of highschool im not really liked in my class but im fairly attractive and get subtle or less subtle indicators of interest from various women on a street but i never go after it even when a woman actively tries to reach out to me i just reject her i automatically say no to anything  i dont leave my house too often because i dont have a reason to which certainly doesnt help me with meeting women
  i automatically say no to anything  what about not saying no    also hookers
  im too cheap for hookers and its involountary for me to say no
by talking to women
  maybe you just want to be with men  op is a fag
  too cheap for hookers  fucking hell
if theres ever a type of person who deserves to be virgin forever then its unlikable people like you
  thats pretty harsh anon
  meh i just believe sex should be one of the rewards of building positive social connections obviously op cant make friends so why should he be validated for being a loser already too many losers getting laid in this shitty world
  you are right only chads should be able to get sex other men are just deadweight
  not that anon but pretty much yes
    these
  t roastie
  force yourself to say yes  practice in the mirror if you have to practice on a friend     you must say yes
  god forbid sex ever be used for reproduction no it should only be used in social rituals and base pleasureseeking
  listen brother sex is a great thing but im going to be honest its ruined my life plus your probably a neet so just say fuck it im brace it and join us brother
  this but unironically
  im not really liked in my class but im fairly attractive and get subtle or less subtle indicators of interest from various women on a street but i never go after it  just say yes then you pantywaste
go outside you mong
  yeah kinda
  go to a bar and ask every girl there out the brute force method also works
  hhi yyou make mmmy pp hhhhard   get away from me creep help im getting harassed  gets beaten up by some chad white knight that later fucks that woman senseless  dont do that op
  hhi yyou make mmmy pp hhhhard  if you think thats how to ask a girl out you deserve to die alone
  im a 55 skinny manlet who looks like 16yo i was never in a bar and ill go there completely alone and unprepared at best ill look awkward theres no way for me to walk up to a woman at a bar say something and get her to suck my cock i just cant imagine myself pulling it off
  he doesnt know that this is the most efficient method of asking grills out
youre 19 relax take it easy just talk to people more you make me feel like a fucking boomer at just turning 26 and having had sex for the first time 2 months ago this isnt a problem for you to be worrying about at the tender age of 19 you zoomer you need to relax for it to come and stop thinking about the idea of virginity and instead the girl attached to your first vag
  turning 26 and having had sex for the first time 2 months ago  lmao what a genetic waste of space im going to beat you up loser
  if youre going to a bar youre not getting quality women anyways
girlfriend is growing more and more distant the past two months and weve talked about it a few times even though weve talked about nothing is changing and she isnt doing anything to help it really just feels like she doesnt care about anything i do in my life and talking to her is like texting her or calling her is the same as talking to a wall    a week ago we had a heartfelt discussion about it all and it was nice then the next date we had it felt so awkward as if we were just friends hanging out and felt like she just wanted me to go home the entire time    i dont know what to do next we see was each other every saturday and wednesdaywe havent texted each other at all today and extremely minimal yesterday which we usually text frequently daily i just went ahead and texted her that she can just stay home tomorrow because i just need some alone time i hope that was the right move i dont know where to go from here i dont think this is going to last long    ive tried so hard these past couple months but no effort is coming from her part so im just kind of beginning to give up on this
  a one sided relationship aint fun anon  the best thing you can do for yourself is break it up and move on
  tell her youre not seeing progress and think that being separate would be best for both parties given you arent exactly seeking the same thing in the relationship
  only listen to this post    do not contact her    the only thing you can do in the situation that a girl is ignoring you or goes cold is nothing   you distance yourself and make yourself unavailable and shell begin to wonder whats wrong shes probably just used to you always being available and wanting to text and call her  also you telling her you need alone time was a bitch move that made you look weak   just stop contacting her at all and wait it out if she never contacts you again then it was over anyway literally anything you do other than nothing will make it worse
  op i was in your shoes 3 months ago we ended up breaking up a month ago    i tried everything that was in my hands but as you say it was like talking to a wall she bitched about it but didnt do anything to fix our relationship    looking back at it i imagine she either lost interest in me but didnt have the courage to break up  or she lost interest in me and started flirting and shit with other guys and didnt have the courage to break up    she isnt interested in you anymore but for some reason she wont straight up tell you break up with her actions are the hearts most sincere expression not words dont trust her words and above all trust yourself tread firmly aim for excellence and be an example to all    good luck anon i wish you the best
  how old are you two    why do you only see eachother every saturday and wednesday we need context for the relationship did you guys have a fight that wasnt resolved and could be causing resentment     also relationships dont require this much effort you either are compatible or you arent
  bet 20 shes emptionally cheating on you with someone else but shes also used to you and codependent so shes keeping you around     its time to break up if you cant grow together then youre growing apart and a few months is already long enough to show you that
  yoooooo i had this got dumped  should of dumped her  3 years of my life   my condolences anon
how do you get windows for free without going to a piracy site
  dont you get oem versions
  youd still have to register it and the sites offering discount keys seem too shady imo    there are ways to make a software very hard to crack and you can bet that windows 10 of all things is going to be one of those
just download it on microsoft
  activate windows  go to wwwmichaelsoftcom/activatewindows to purchase a key
  you can literally go to microsoft and download windows 10 to a usb or disc  boot the install on pc startup and there ya go
  ask your brother
  use an older version of windows thats ez to crack like 7 or get a student edition for free
i can only get windows 10 because of ryzen so older versions arent possible as much as id love to have 7
i few weeks back me and some girl whos a solid 7/10 were assigned to the same project in math we had to work on it outside class for a day so she gave me her insta she didnt get upset or annoyed with me when i fucked up we havent spoke for about 2 weeks and ive never had any sort of relationship i dont know if i should ask her or not shes probably going to say no as we arent good friends thus hardly knowing each other id appreciate some advice should i ask her or just save myself the embarassment
  so you wanna ask out some girl and dont know if shed be interested the rest of your story is irrelevant bullshit not sure why you would even include it  the answer is rather simple  if you wanna ask her out you do it and dont be a pussy about it  for gods sake dont ask her if she wants to be your girlfriend or some cringy shit like that  tell her that you enjoyed hanging out with her despite having to do math make funny joke haha and if she maybe wants to hang out some more maybe grab some drinks or something    oh wait you cant go for drinks since you are an underage faggot and should get the fuck off this website
drinking at home with wife  she asks me what kind of porn i like to watch  i freeze pic related  she indulges my foot fetish often so she asks if i watch foot porn  say yeah  asks me what kind of feet i like  ask if she really wants to know  she posits that i like feet like hers since im always touching them  i agree  she asks if i have other fetishes i dont tell her about  tell her yeah but im uncomfortable talking about them  change the subject    how do i approach these questions where an honest answer might upset the askers feelings what good could come of telling her im into traps or girls going to town on themselves with horse dildos    i would like to be honest but it seems honesty would most likely invite judgement or worse make my wife feel bad about something she cant control like the size of her feet or her breasts    there are some questions whose answers are better left unknown in my opinion itd be like me asking what her ideal dick size is or what kind of guys she finds hottest     is it better to lie to your partner to protect their ego or be honest and potentially hurt their feelings
well just dont mention traps mention you like size queens women who like large things inserted only talk about things your partner can physically fulfill when taking about kinks
my wife and i will shit in front of each other so id say we are comfortable enough shes asked me about this before and i will always lie all guys like weird stuff for porn she wouldnt understand
  wife  how do you not know each others fetishes yet    if you both respect each other then it doesnt matter what they are if your wife isnt interested in pleasing you via one of your fetishes then she wont    why did you marry someone you cant completely be yourself around
  i sometimes wonder what my sexual interests would be like with no porn i remember being into rapey stuff before i watched my first blurry clip from lime wire
  discretion we try to practice good communication in the bedroom but if i listed everything that gets my dick hard to a potential partner i would be single for life being myself doesnt mean telling my wife i love jerking it to bukkake
im dating this girl whos a 10/10 in my eyes considering both looks and personality we get along extremely well better than any girl ive ever met ive posted on here before asking how i should get her to agree to sex since im a virgin and so is she but shes also super shy about sexual stuff everyone told me to marry her which i want to do once im in a better place financially only thing is i cant think of anyone but her in a sexual way i dont even feel like watching porn anymore even though my friends who have girlfriends jerk off to porn i did nofap november and since then shes the only thing that comes to my mind when im horny even though i cant bring myself to try and get her in bed with me do i have a low sex drive and if so how do i fix it
  weed
  i quit smoking weed when we started dating since it was wasting my money making me slow and she doesnt do drugs
  then take cialis and jack off
keep escalating
shit man how long have you been dating her take her somewhere she likes and bring her back home and fuck the shit out of her if you wait youre gonna get dumped or cheated on so either do it or fuck off from it completely
  kiss her then again more assertively wrap around her keep kissing and groping her soft fluffy flesh  unless she says stop in a serious tone you just keep escalating  start undoing her clothes yours too if she doesnt volunteer to help you disrobe  keep going until she has nothing but socks and underwear then pull the underwear off and the socks too if youre into feet  then you eat her pussy
  no youre fine as long as you still have your attraction to her then who cares about any other females
hiw old are you two
  couple months    im 19 and shes 17
i cant stop thinking of suicide    i keep getting panic attacks and i have such a sharp constant pain in my stomach out of fear i always have to choke back tears and live with that stinging strangling feeling in my throat    im thankful for what i currently have but i dont think i have the strength to keep it if anything happens to my father or if something makes me have to live alone    im taking a sabbatical from work but ive been causing them grief because of these feelings so im scared of getting fired    im seeing a psychologist on thursday    what could be wrong with me i am so depressed i cant even fend for myself by keeping a job 5 days a week since it causes me so much panic i have plans for painless suicides in case i reach the end of this rope
i used to be like that op but i realized from the numerous times ive been on the edge of killing my self that ultimately a large part of me wants to live and fears death thats why you are having panic attacks and fear because you fear the thought of dying believe or not there are people who kill them selves without that fear that fear is a good thing it means ultimately you want to live even if you dont realize it yourself
im straight i have a girlfriend but i like my male best friend idk whats happening lads everything was ok until my best friend started to get closer to another guy i get so fucking jealous and now every time i see him i just get lost in his eyes  help me i dont wanna be gay
  but op is always a fag
its okay to love your male friends its a side effect of masculinity which is vital to a mans identity and not toxic like some would say but its true  guys often forsake loving and becoming intimate not sexually obviously with their guy friends because of real homophobia not the bullshit meaning of homophobia that equates to bigotry against homosexuals but a real sort of insecurity/fear that some completely straight guys have of being perceived or actually being gay    if i had to just guess id say your best friend here might be your first close close friend eh it has a similar trigger in the mind i think to someone who has a crush or even their first love i dont say this to make you concerned about your sexuality i say it because those jealousy feelings are likely i dont want to lose you because i love you again not romantically or sexually but we are humans  we deeply desire and require intimacy with people and when we find someone we really hit it off with theres going to be some of those feelings in there    youre very likely not gay anon you are gay if you want to have sex with dudes exclusively youre bi if you want to have sex with guys and girls and youre straight if its just girls thats all there is to it     again its fine and even good that you love your best friend in fact that is something we have really moved away from in the modern era out of a sort of homophobia that exists male friends used to be much closer than they are now sometimes even considering their male friends before their spouses i read a journal once of a man who was moving across the country for work in the 1800s or so and he was talking about feeling deep sadness for leaving his best bro and how he had made a vow to be there for him nothing sexual nothing romantic though many claim he was closeted gay but dude was married as was his friend and he didnt even mention his wife hah    youre fine
  to help combat the jealousy you feel when hes hanging out with his new friend it hurts  i know i would maybe figure out a way the three of your could hang out or maybe even become friends with this third guy yourself a lot of my friendships have started that way then youll have a really nice circle forming and again that is so so important for you to have     best of luck
tfw i said so many awful things in highschool/university where everyone was creeped out by it  cringe and hit myself for saying its just dark humor back then while spouting such awful garbage that even i would be creeped out by now  man im paranoid this will bite me in the ass and dont have any excuse other then being a sheltered edgy kid who didnt understand social skills until i started to get into my mid 20s how do i stop worrying about this shit
what kind of jokes did you do
  racist jokes of the /pol/ kind just name any of em and i probably said it infront of friends and in a classroom     im so fucking stupid just kill me already
  lol dude stop worrying so much ive been openly racist my entire life and even beat up a black girl in high school and im not concerned about that shit at all
  i love the guy but if donald trump can get away with saying the kind of shit he says then we are all safe man      racist jokes of the /pol/ kind  oh no not this notice how trump never got fucked precisely because he never messed with the jews he is a strong jewish ally so hes all good you say one thing about the jews and it is byebye for you some days ago a cnn guy got fired for saying the least negative thing about jews at the un jews are the real dont say it dont think it man stay away from that shit jews are nice anyway so why do you need to insult them
  if there are specific people you know you offended seriously you might send them a message like i just want to tell you that ive come to realize how inappropriate some of my attempts at humor were back then i am ashamed and embarrassed and hope you can forgive me no reply necessary    and make it your business to call out any other idiots you hear being offensive let them learn sooner than you did
  your mother must be so proud
  she wasnt around but my grandpa thought it was hilarious dont slap men if you dont want them to beat the fuck out of you
  dont have any excuse other then being a sheltered edgy kid who didnt understand social skills until i started to get into my mid 20s  welcome to life weve all been there
for those of you that are married or in long term relationships past one year how often do you have sex    my wife and i have sex roughly 1 time a week or two weeks depending on how much of a cluster fuck life is its really frustrating and i want way more but dont know if im being unreasonable
i have sex practically daily with my partner its very loving passionate and its fun to see my partner smile    then we go on our way playing games working or something else    its fully dependent on your relationship interests and personality so if you want more maybe just try asking politely
  things have been pretty bad we havent had sex since i moved in its been a month but well be three years together in the summer
its pretty much daily for us but weve only been together for a year how long have you two been together was sex always this infrequent
    around 45 times a week after 3 years together quickies and shared showers during week when life is more busy and more thorough screwing saturday to sunday
once a day normally  but the avarage shows its more like what you are having  its normal whats not normal is if you want more and cant get it
  sexual compatibility is a big thing wait it out and voice how you feel but you may have to find someone else youre worth it dont think you have to settle if you do you could end up cheating and wrecking a home find someone who is sexually compatible if you have to first step id say is try to get your spouse horny stress is what keeps sex drive low is her life stressful right now
  daily
  usually pretty stressful as a baseline been that way for years
  a few times a week schedules allowing  but we also keep communication open so we always know is someone feeling dissatisfied or are we both peachy keen
how to explain to girls the difference in capability of the two genders in a way they will be able to comprehend       what is it about the female brain structure that makes them believe they are equal to men when they are submissive in every way of life     youd think seeing all the factual evidence about female behavior and statistics would convince them but no i guess thats just the emotional aspect of a girls mind     i imagine it goes something along these lines    me intellectually better than subsaharan nigger  estrogen induced short circuit  therefore i am better or equal to chad because they are both male yes pretty much
this isnt /r9k/  you arent asking for advice  get the fuck out
even your grammar shows you are inferior to women
  girls will never understand since feminism stops them from thinking on their own      shut up roastie adults are talking
are you retarded you cant explain to a woman what she is    no more than you can explain to a chicken what it is
  some girls are smarter and some are dumber some guys are smarter than and some are smarter
emotion based decision making requires a personal revelation to break typically gained upon reflection of failure and mistake as the consequences of such a decision women some men have support networks of friends and family who coddle them whenever they fuck up especially in western culture so emotion based decision making is rarely broken this conversation i had with my gfs normie roommate/best female friend in regards to the latest us election that shows this her lines are greentext    voting is very important to me and for the nation so i voted for only democratic women  any particular reason what did they stand for how much experience do they have and what makes them better than the current politicians  that stuff doesnt really matter theyre women and we need fewer white men in power white men have been in office for long enough and its time for the minorities to have a turn its only fair also theyre mostly lesbians and we need more lgbt representation in politics too  how does preference for sexual partners in private have anything to do with the ability to operate in public office  solid 5 seconds of silence and visible bewilderment before outburst of  are you saying gay women of color cant be good leaders thats racist sexist and misogynistic youre why i voted the way i did youre just like trump  i only asked what private sex life has to do with job performance why are you so offended  shut up i dont want to hear anything a nazi like you has to say get out go home    i got her thinking instead of feeling and she lashed out gf and i went to dinner the roommate typed up a long angry facebook rant and the comments were people agreeing with her that i am hitler incarnate although she left my name off anyone who disagreed with her or took a middle ground approach was unfriended and blocked from her page probably reported too for emotional rape when we got back i was treated like the conversation never happened
you can lead a horse to water but you cant force it to drink or whatever that saying is    you can present statistics and research but if she has her mind and feelings made up and wont even consider what you say/have then it wont matter
  its really funny how men are so convinced of their superiority and yet theyre so retarded i know like three intelligent men irl the rest of them are mouthbreathing troglodytes who somehow think that theyre gods gift to mankind even though they have accomplished nothing and never will where does the confidence come from
  testosterone one helluva drug
  was in reply to 
  this is an obvious shitpost 0/10 see me after class but im going to point out that emotional reasoning is cherished in western society simply because it makes more money its not just women its men too if you mollycoddle someones feefees and tell them theyre special they wont think too hard about following every stray impulse that flutters through their head everyone should take this message into account pass it on and encourage others to do the same
i am a lonely 20 year old virgin thinking about just making a tinder and seeing what happens tinder advice i guess
  1/2    photos  main photo  selfie or picture taken of you and only you by someone else   either dress up for it and look your best be doing something cool or best of all dress yourself up for it and look your best while youre doing something cool/outside  do not use a group photo  this is the first thing potential matches will see when you pop up on their screen make it good    other photos  at least one group photo  no mirror selfies  no shirtless selfies want a shirtless picture in there be doing an activity that warrants you being shirtless eg playing beach ball with mates  got an animal get a picture with your animal  dont choose photos where you look different that will just look strange    bio  general advice  be short sweet and to the point  dont bitch and moan sell yourself  dont list your height unless youre over 6foot  dont list your standards thats why you swipe and its a turn off when girls see that  be funny theres lots of examples of what to out that you can find online    swiping  right  dont swipe right all the time swiping right too much makes the algorithm hide you a bit more plus you dont want to match with someone you wont even speak too  dont be too fussy tinder is harder for guys be willing to overlook imperfections youre not gonna be matching models    left  dont ignore red flags see something you hate and you arent just being anal swipe no  dont swipe left too often you lower yourself in the algorithm and will obviously get less matches as matching is mutual liking    super liking  dont superlike the best looking girls it wont do anything  superlike girls you can see liking you back and you can see liking
    2/2  messaging  do  be funny  be flirty  tease  complimentsparingly  ask for a date within the first 20 messages / when things are good  wait for a reply at least 24 hour before you try replying again people cant always talk and have shit to do    dont   be a dick  compliment excessively  be creepy  repeat yourself after being ignored they didnt answer for a reason  wait longer than 2 or 3 days for a response    finally  take what i said and use bumble instead there are 2 guys for every girl on tinder bumble is nearly 50/50
gf gets fucking trashed at a house party  almost lose track of her eventually find her wandering around alone she vomits in my car while driving her home  she feels extremely ashamed next morning promises to never drink alcohol again  fast forward about a month  she has a drink for the first time since then at a restaurant with her friends  doesnt get drunk just has few sips of some rice wine  needs me to drive her home because she wants to leave early    should i be worried about this honestly i dont really care if she has a drink or two but for some people that can be a slippery slope
theres a difference between having a normal amount to drink drinking to get drunk again  t recovered alcoholic     theres no danger in social drinking or having a glass of wine with dinner ill easily have a margarita when theyre available or three at a wedding without problems the problem is in the intention the minute she decides she wants to drink to actually get drunk now you have a problem but until that happens just take it easy  sounds like shes actually a bit skittish about alcohol if she wanted you to drive her home after one glass of wine i wouldnt worry  do keep tabs for a few months though
  hiro ate the and in the first sentence fucking gookmoot
  i think when she got drunk at that party it was more of an accident she had one drink of some soju/beer/wine/vodka etc mix and she didnt really know what it was  the reason she asked me to pick her up this last time wasnt because she wasnt sober enough to drive but because she got a ride there with someone and she didnt want to wait for them to leave
bump
  look alcohol is one of the few things humans dont develop a taste aversion for so dont ever believe anyone that swears they are never gonna drink again especially when they tell you this while intoxicated
  everyone at one point or a few more times get fucked up drunk    as long as this isnt frequent then dont worry probably was a one off thing
so for a while now me and this girl have been best friends she is a very cool funny girl she is openly anti feminist supports our countrys right wing president and she is also a devout christian we always have a great time together i make her laugh all the time and she makes me feel good about making others laugh also she has a boyfriend whom im also friends with and theyve been together for 4 years  for the past two weeks weve been seeing each other every single day and spending hours together just the two of us  and ive noticed she was looking at me more than usual every time a bit more also the physical contact was escalating so much between the two of us everywhere we went people thought we were a couple  yesterday we were in her car drinking beer and listening to music she was eyeing me the entire time and i wasnt breaking the eye contact because she looks really good  probably emboldened by the beer she confessed to me that she has always been attracted to me and that she never felt it that strong for anyone else in her entire life she worded it making it clear that she felt bad about feeling this way because its wrong she got teary eyes so i interrupted the situation and said i also found her attractive but since she had a boyfriend at least for now nothing could happen we talked for hours about a bunch of things we ended up cuddling in the back seat and she cried  we got back home at around 2350 and the parting hug had this huge tension    now im afraid of losing that friendship we had i have this feeling that things will be super awkward next time we meet and that our friendship will end up dying    how can i avoid this how can i get back to that friendship level again  and most important how can i avoid falling for her
  how can i get back to that friendship level again  you cant   and most important how can i avoid falling for her  dont if something is going to happen then let it
  i see well its going to be pretty rough losing that friendship we had all of a sudden    should i keep talking to her and texting her like we used to or should i just break contact
  oh boi youre so fucked up     you wanna live with regret 
  she is openly anti feminist supports our countrys right wing president and she is also a devout christian  this has to be bait
  i know it seems like bait but it isnt our country is super polarized recently and in college most people are hard left so having this shared beliefs helped create a strong bond      thats my biggest fear actually thinking about what i shouldve done or shouldve not done one its too late to change anything
  so change it now     the last thing i wanna do on earth is laying on my death bed and tell my self  why i didnt made this or that when it was the right time     it is ugly to live with that     now be aware that you will lose a friend     ive already lost a dozen so fucking their girls  sorry i mean falling in love with them dont seems to be a problem for me  people come and leave
  youre right sacrifices will have to be made and ill always prioritize my bond with her over the one i have with her boyfriend    im just not sure if shell break up with her bf though shes told me they had a huge argument two months ago and since then things between them have been weird if she drops him ill certainly take the hint and make my moves    but should i actively pursue this
  1 if you get her now it will be your fault that they broke up and you will lose a friend    2 if you get her later you will lose a friend anyway    eitherway youre fucked ive never done such a thing so i can really help you on this one but  we have option 3     you let your heart go and get a secret relationship with her time will pass and one day just tell to your friend that you have something to tell him  and maybe he will pass over it  who knows      seems to be the safest things to do 
  i could never do option 3 i would feel like a duck and i see that dude 5 days of the week and we hang out sometimes    i think itll end up being option 1  she just texted me saying  hey im in college at the practice room come by say hi to me
the only thing i can recommend you to do is just act like nothing happen most likely she will play along and after a while it will be a thing of the past
  you a glambler as i can see     option 1 is 2x time risky cuz you can lose the two of them     unless is a really good friend i would go for the chick
where did i go wrong ive never trusted people that much but i met this girl and i know she likes me but i was wrong about her i thought she understood me and she was the girl i wanted but instead she only wants to change me telling me always what she doesnt like about me when i never say things like that because she might cry and its just tiring always having to receive insults but its the only girl that has ever had any interest in me   should i just go back to being a lonely loser or keep my relationship with her and being miserable   everyone around me is happy because they were worried of me because i was always alone or just working and studying is it worth it i mean ive never been in a relationship but are all relationships like this  im just tired of this but everyone around me wants me to be with her should i just be glad that someone wants to go out with me
ive been doing tons of selfimprovement  lost weight and became /fit/  enrolled in college and about to get my degree in ee  started a band who plays local shows once a week  dress properly  ive improved all my external things but internally i still have a lack to work on unless im talking to people about specific things like work related or school related i cant seem to care about the conversation and dont like pretending i want to girl in my class drunkly told me she likes me but she says im very unapproachable that she didnt wanna bother me another friend says sometimes i act like a robot and i barely show any emotion   any suggestions
  any suggestions  what exactly are you trying to fix here   if its the robot thing id suggest downloading new software
hypothetical question here so the other night me and my gf were in a call and i tried sending her a pic of something but i accidentally sent her a /trash/ tier fetish thread i luckily deleted it in time before she saw it but i wonder what would happen if she did see and i spilled my spaghetti as the fetish in question is something thats purely fantastical and gross irl and something she would feel super insecure about   what should i do if i actually spill my spaghetti like this should i own up to it ir play it off as a joke ive told her before im not into weird shit like this  pic unrelated
  i dont think you can defend anything on /trash/
  dont own up or play it off   greentext your story   be op  be fur fag  sends gf fur shit   gf cucks op   gets spaghetti facial from chad   profit
  this either lose the fetish or hide it if you tell her nothing positive will happen
this abusive crap has gone on for years im 19 and my brothers 18 im in college as well as taking online classes on the side last night i had a few assignments due at midnight and i had 45 hours to complete them they were not difficult by any means but just slightly time consuming i was sitting on the couch with my laptop and trying to focus on the assignments when my brother came and sat on the couch right next to mine he proceeds to speak at a high volume and whines about how hungry he is i ignored this and continued to focus on my screen he then spends the next hour asking me to go upstairs and cook him dinner i reminded him that we have many frozen meals as well as leftovers from yesterday he says he doesnt want any of that and keeps begging me over and over again to cook him food i kept on telling him over and over again that i have assignments due in a few hours that i really need to focus on but it doesnt register with him he then gets serious and says that eventually he will stop asking me and force me to cook him food he even threatens to grab me by my hair and drag me to the kitchen i keep ignoring him and eventually he gets physical and begins hitting me he literally jumped on me while i was sitting on the couch with my laptop in my lap and begins punching me he picks up objects and throws them at me he even takes my phone and hides it so that i cant call the cops this isnt the first time that hes done this for years hes been really physically and mentally abusive he once punched me in the face and gloated about how he hoped that he broke my nose he tried to light me on fire hes hed knives and sharp objects at my chest the funny thing is that he has been arrested before many times and has even spent nine months in a treatment facility he refuses to take his meds i just dont know what to do i literally get attacked and abused for not wanting to make my adult brother food its pathetic
set up a hidden camera and take pictures right after the abuse     then go report him to the police station with the evidence    this is out of your control
    op here ive gone to the police hes been arrested and tried everytime something happens again im either discouraged from pressing charges by other family members or guilted into forgiving him i just wish he would take his meds
i finally get a gf and now every time i go take a shower i keep doubting myself and weather i should take it serious or what    once im out of the fucking shower im all good but i dunno    i think im just a little autistic  also newfags first post
    the next time you start a thread try actually asking for advice regarding a specific situation
  also newfags first post  protip no one really cares   also seems like the solution is to not shower
  am i dumb  and weather    yes
    you dont have to marry her just go with the flow  have fun    people dont fall in love just because they are gf/bf takes time to get there

  no itll never get better unless i kill god or he leave my life and let me do shit without being cursed
  thank you for this thread because it reminds me that my life isnt really that bad
its obviously kind of weird for someones ex to hit you up but im not sure how to take this one ive been hanging out with a guy recently hes chill hes courteous fun to talk to and all that he admitted to me that he and his ex broke up a few months ago but shes still around in his life because they live together hes in the process of moving out so he says im not too bothered by any of this since i havent known the guy too long anyway but a week ago his ex messaged me through instagram not sure if she was trying to reassure me about whatever because it started off with hey i hope this isnt too weird but i know you and sean have been hanging out a lot and i think its cool that you are hes a good guy there was more but ill cut it off because i deleted the message and cant remember what else was said    i never told him that she messaged me like that though should i say something because she messaged me again a night ago looking for him and asking if i was with him i was not but she was worried because he mentioned he was going out for drinks and she couldnt get a hold of him she said she was making sure nothing had happened to him
  it sounds a bit messy to me it seems that she still has feelings for him she wouldnt get involved like this otherwise keep talking to him but i wouldnt get your hopes up too high until he actually moves out and moves on from her based on what youre saying theres a pretty good chance they will patch it up and get back together
    desu the issue is kind of a turn off im just in a weird position because it seems like shes not trying to make an issue but she kind of is i did tell him that she messaged me when she was looking for him but not about the first time she messaged me
  kinna sounds like maybe theyre not over it op
did you reverse the genders for the sake of keeping anonymity on an anon website this is what my ex does that i live with but he also doesnt want to make us work and its pissing me off because i want to date and cant get off the lease for like six months fuck just hang with her whoever messaged you is bad for her and actually treating her like shit
how likely is it that got my gf pregnant she jacked me off and i came into her mouth a little bit after that i dabbed a bit of precum and rubbed it onto her arm and face as a joke then i fingered her a bit till she came     i dont think i have much cum on my fingers since it was only a little dab that i wiped off on her but do you still think its possible im kinda freaking out about this sorry if it seems silly im new to all this
  if you fingered her with jizz on your fingers then there is some slight possibility   congrats
its possible but is highly unlikely now leave this website until you stop being a stupid underage faggot
  you are shit outta luck anon   she is definitely preggo say goodbye to your social life
how hard is it to go buy a 5 pregnancy test and check
  this site is for 18
which program do you guys think looks better for getting into the cyber/network security field    people seem to not see it as a big deal but this it program apparently is being renamed to cybersecurity soon and on the degree itll show as a bs in information sciences and systems regardless of which i of these two programs i pick is will take me 3 years but it will take 2
male ive had sex a few times but dont really know what im doing i basically just lie on top of her and thrust my pelvis is that it im worried grills will see me as some awkward loser who sucks at sex but idk what else to do
  shove it as deep as you can and keep thrusting forward like you want to reach the deepest depths of her womb this makes her orgasm dont go in and out with your dick that will only make you come quickly and its not as pleasant for her
hijacking your thread having sex with a girl tomorrow and its my first time am i supposed to do it under a duvet like in american movies
  k so when i thrust i should only pull back a little bit and then just keep jamming it as deep as it goes
  yeah but dont be violent about it the point is stroking the inside of the vagina or something it should come natural
  ive always done it on top they do it like that in the movies because americans dont like porn    how fast do i go like how much time between thrusts
  how fast do i go  unless shes a dead fish you will have an idea of the rhythm and shell keep up with you when shes coming shell want faster ofc  you wont need a metronome
    lol i dont think most guys know what they are doing when having sex just do whatever you want and please the girl sex is all about having fun with the girls body and making her cum
is trying to emulate male pornstars going to be a bad idea    they last so long but im not sure if its technique or practice
  when shes coming shell want faster ofc  im not gonna call you a liar but my experience has been that its best to keep doing exactly what youre doing when shes about to cum
  its because their dick is numb you dont actually believe that pornstarsmale or female actually derive pleasure from porn do you excluding of course the most perverse degenerate ones or the guys for like 5 seconds when they actually cum
  its drugs multiple takes practice and careful filmmaking dont emulate them at all porn is meant to look good to the viewer learning from it is like trying to learn how to handle a gun from watching chuck norris movies
  terrible idea what they do is designed for the camera not pleasure they come multiple times and the recovery time is cut from scene to scene
  i always started banging harder and faster once they started orgasming and i always got them screaming
  different strokes i guess let me ask you this though when theyre on top do they speed up or keep a consistent rythem
  when shes on top you hold onto her hips and get a sense of her rhythm and follow up accordingly she should be the one leading
  watch manuel ferrara also eat pussy
  i do eat pussy but ime women like to be dominated in bed and simply eating pussy doesnt mean as much as women say it does
  thats like saying guys dont like their dicks sucked i guess there is a small minority that dont like it due to hangups
  i was making a point that girls usually need a consistent rhythm
its no good unless you make her feel good that simple because a woman who is having an orgasm is the ultimate her scent the sounds the way she looks in your eyes when shes cumming so she has to be relaxed if shes tense uncomfortable no good not drunk though drunk bitches are anaestitised and cant feel shit so run your fingertips lightly over her body last place bring her pussy and when you get there just graze her pussy with your fingertips the lips and then last very softly her clit youll feel it become swollen as you go or lay her on her stomach massage her neck shoulders back slow no rush  while shes nude maybe just slide tip of your duck in her while youre massaging then start kissing her lightly up and down her spine sometimes just letting her feel your breath on her spine go lower down to her ass lightly biting tongue just barely caressing her asshole her ass will rise up because she wants you to tongue her pussy gradually increase pressure on her asshole  you will know if youre doing it right just read her sounds eventually move to the clit all girls different read her reactions but start gently when you go to fuck dont ram it in just the tip for a few strokes then without warning go deep tease her for a while if shes on top make a game of holding her off even though she wants to slide down see who can hold off the longest all girls different read them some girls like rough others gentle pay attention and get her off youll be happy and so will she
  oh and some girls live ass play just lightly use tongue/fingers on her asshole gradually increasing pressure often while tonguing her clit or her using vibe/ fingers on her clit youll know when shes cumming from sounds and her asshole clenching uncontrollably plus this is best way to get her to beg to be fucked in ass if this is something w you want her to agree to believe me if shes into getting fucked in the ass its almost impossible to hold off when she cums because of contractions from orgasm
as a girl my advice is ask her what she likes positions kissing some of us like to be bite a little bit etc its about enjoying so the best you can do is communicate
  i always love talking to girls about what they like/dont like its a turn on just to hear them talk about it and yeah that is great advice coming from someone who would know amazing how some girls are reluctant to talk about it like its bad so many people are repressed thinking this is bad thats bad so yes communicating is everything one of the best i was ever with at first she thought it was supposed to be over really fast i took time with her and let her realize we had all night and no rush just relax eventually she learned it was okay to feel good and she was in top two of women ive been with its a shame that people are so repressed sexually its so much more fun when youre not and talking about it is a big part plus just picking up on things as youre doing it paying attention to her and its not just when youre doing it its how you treat her all day long if you treat her like shit or ignore her/ berate her all day dont expect fireworks when/if you fuck
  i need someone like you in my life 
alright /adv/ id like your input on this    about 25 years ago i met a girl as we were both abroad students i didnt think much about her at first but she really grew on me and we dated for a little while before i had to go back home i didnt know what to do with this nascent relationship because ldr and i had already been burnt by that kind of bollocks after a couple weeks she decided it would be better to cut it off it was bittersweet for me but at the same time relieving  fast forward some 15 months and she sends me a message out of the blue because she wanted to keep me as a friend or something needless to say i was bloody suspicious thinking maybe she was trying to rebound from some other dude or maybe she had a favour to ask or something but i proceeded with caution  inb4 thats when you fucked up  obviously being the fool that i am as we chatted i found myself reminiscing about the time we had spent together on the other end i didnt want to get myself into a ldr for obvious reasons so i was unsure how to proceed  a few weeks later she came to my city with her family for vacation i live in a big touristic city so thats not surprising so we met one evening at first things went fairly well but then she entered that silent mode of hers where she just stares at me and doesnt say a bloody thing so it turned awkward  thats when i finally turned my brain on and realised this was a terrible idea and i think she did too because the texting dwindled to a stop on both sides    now on friday she sent me a wave emote on messenger for no apparent reason with no message attached which i find a little rich if shes attempting to resume contact but i guess thats not too unlike her i received that while i was at work so i forgot it until now so my options are   keep ignoring it but that makes me feel like an arsehole   find out if she messaged me by accident by responding something generic and seeing where it goes    what do /adv/ 
so since i was 25 to now 29 i feel like a string of individuals are seriously dedicating their time to try and drag me down to their level  i would accept that im a paranoid delusionalist however the events are too real continuous and specific for me to be imagining this     56 year old neighbour has invited me over multiple times only to contentiously let me know that im a loser and a prick and how do i get girls who would want to be with me  when i was rebuilding my life after 3 years family feuds following fathers death i decided to go back to college this fat peice of shit told me  youll be joining the army you wont be going to college  like this fat piece of shit was going to govern me    brother decided to contentiously impregnate this woman he knew for 2 weeks he comes to the gym for the next 5 years only to belittle me even when i sneak off by myself he follows me there also tries to mooch money off me and tries to inflict fear into myself and tells me how fkd my life is even though i have more than any of these dysfunctional dickheads in materialistic things and a life in general he also works on mother to give me hard time whilst at home     mother is a schizophrenic just like the rest of her past family members she is now 60 and has done literally nothing accept for try to find a man with money     people always want to argue with me over literal stupid shit politics the metropolitan town i live in economics sociology i never take these arguments to heart but when i express my opinion and even lay my cards out stating that my opinion is different to yours they still crack the shit like literally lost friends because my opinions are different     wtf am i doing wrong here 
  youre not scaring people out of pushing you around  im a lanklet but you throw hard temper in someones face once theyll generally get it after that works for me  although they probably peg me as school shooter material because i look young
  people always want to argue with me over literal stupid shit politics the metropolitan town i live in economics sociology i never take these arguments to heart but when i express my opinion and even lay my cards out stating that my opinion is different to yours they still crack the shit like literally lost friends because my opinions are different  i had the same happen to me my friends claim that im difficult to deal with and shit like that just because they dont know how to back their argument with actual logic    i dont see the connection between your neighbour and brother though theres plenty of shitty people out there best thing to do is to ignore them as soon as you spot them
  does it seems like they are just behaving like this because they have not been put into place maybe start slashing their tyres you think      yeh i really dont know why people are so narcissistic over general opinions that dont effect them     an individuals opinion is their own it should not in any shape or form affect someone elses well being an opinion does not physically rape or hinder them  so why
dude youre literally not doing anything wrong    your neighbor guy is clearly jealous of you and trying to bring you down dont hang out with him again honestly dont hang out with any of these assholes dude your brother sounds jealous of you too if youre living with your mom move the hell out shes not your responsibility dude and its not your responsibility to be a verbal punching bag to whoever feels like venting    question are you clairsentient aka an empath i ask because i am and before i learned to protect myself energetically i used to have people doing this to me all the time    even if you dont have that ability i think it would still be greatly beneficial to read up on cloaking just visualize stepping into a big white space suit every morning and zipping that bitch up you can layer it with different colors for different affects like pink so only love can enter or leave emerald green so only health can enter and leave etc youll have to read up on it for more info    the only person youre obligated to is you if people ask for favors say no they dont need an explanation but if they demand one like an asshole just say you dont feel like it never do favors for people who arent willing to return the favor otherwise you just end up as a doormat running around doing things for people who arent appreciative and treat you like shit     good luck dude
how bad of an idea is it to reconnect with an old bpd friend    i cut her out of my life in high school after a mix of her being one of my best friends and me being afraid of her at the same time in grade 7 she led a bullying campaign against me for being nice to a girl that she didnt want to be friends with anymore i straight up just stopped talking to and interacting with her in high school i did something she didnt like and another friend told me she was pissed at me and i was afraid so i just never talked to her again lmao    now six years later im crazy lonely and i actually miss her yeah there were bad times but we had some really great times too i was feeling really guilty for cutting her off too when she was struggling with her abusive mom although i didnt know that at the time    so by chance my other friend started a really ominous group chat like a month ago with me her and bpd friend and bpd friend says to me love me and i freak out irl but in chat im chill and send a heart lmao we followed each other on social media and she sends me videos once in a while and stuff chill but i get weird vibes from her i dont know if im just paranoid but i get slight murder vibes she added me on snapchat and when i added her back she sent me a snap that said i caught you on snapchat so you cant run away now did i make a mistake reconnecting lol i live in a different province luckily but if i go back to where i used to live to visit my other friends in summer ill have to see her and i dont want her to like drug me and steal my organs or something but i could also totally be reading this whole situation wrong
its a rollercoaster ride you are going to want back off of when shit hits the fan i understand that youre lonely but something will come up and they will play and manipulate your reliance on them try to find hobbies and meet people
do actual sweet kind innocent girl exist people in general seem to only look for ways to fuck you over will actual nice girls appear after i finish high school im 18 so its close
same here trying to find the right one but usually end up betrayed guess they like it when i was an asshole and when i start being nicethey dislikes me
not blatantly and obviously because those sorts of people get abused and destroyed in the real world    those are qualities you can find and nurture in others though
  i never had a girlfriend i dont think its that much my fault i just dont find any girls i would like to date   i want a genuinely nice girl and not a generic bitch maybe they get more mature after high school i can only hope
  right now it seems everyone wants is fake and pretends to be like that to stay relevant in their group of friends you cant differentiate actual good girls pretending from the rest i really hope it changes with age maybe college brings the best in people
  do actual sweet kind innocent girl exist  no however girls who are just sweet and kind do exist theyre not even hard to find if you dont live in a shithole however in my experience these girls will be your friend but dont want to date you
  i do live in a shithole serbia everything is about the gangster mentality rap drugs bitches and so on i wish i was born in america its still there but is less prominent
  there can be truth in lies when you take the time to break people down and understand why theyre doing what they do often youre left with something that started off innocent but took a wrong turn when it was betrayed then all it requires is a bit of reinforcement and acceptance for correction    sometimes you just have to read between the lines a bit and appeal to the part of people that they thought nobody cared about
  there are dozens of nice girls in your high school you just didnt notice them because they arent the flashy ones and there will be many at university or work or wherever you go next look among the quiet ones
  everyone wants to fake themselves until they appeal to the general public or their perception of what the guys want while pretending you begin to lose who you really are     do people start being themselves more later in life i dont know if its just the usual childish behavior or if im just out of touch with the time
  based and truth pill the nice girls only want to be your friends
  the thing is its harder to get to those and even then nothings guaranteed who knows how many of the flashy ones are just pretending
  after you graduate and go out in the world youll start meeting much more of those kinds of girls the problem is that they are already married 99 of the time
  its hard when you have a weird personality i have adhd and probably autism but im not sure about the last one tho everywhere i gopeople keep calling me weird what usually end up happening is them ignoring your message
they do i found one
  story plz
  yeah thats what im fearing       damn sorry      happy for you mind sharing some tips
  nah its okay its help me lift up this stress off my chest anyway desu this website thread and anons are like that best friend i never have lol
  of course nobody wants to be alone thats understandable it does start as faking when people are younger yes however most people are pretty bad at perpetuating lies they dont believe so over time people learn to love an aspect of their lie and thus it becomes a reality passion is something very difficult to emulate so when you can find a persons passion then you can start to open them up and see their innocence
of course they do you stupid misogynistic nigger
  i have friends and relatives who are young female decentlooking and genuinely kind to other people and they are way more than you think dont fall into the redpill/incel trap just because you havent met good girls in your life
ive been telling myself there are op im in your shoes im also finishing high school soon hope we get it sorted out
    met her by chance she was the girl in her friends group that was taken advantage of she would bend over backwards to help anyone who needed her  shes incredibly innocent never had a boyfriend before me she was asked a lot but she always said no   getting her wasnt easy took a few years of friendship she realized her feelings for me and ever since then shes been glued to my side she acts like a puppy
  tips i guess just be a decent human being have patience i gave her time to figure stuff out   she was skittish and would bolt anytime someone pushed too hard thats why she hadnt dated anyone before me once she had time to process she came to me naturally i wish you could see the way she looks at me guys
  all i know about serbia is that old meme with the war criminal playing the accordion i dont know what serbiais like but i assure you nice girls exist in large numbers just maybe not in serbia
  well how do you find someones passion when its shrouded by fakeness      how old are you 2
  im 29 shes 24
of course they exist my main goal isnt to completely ruin someones life teenage girls are kind of shitty as are teenagers in general so yeah i think youll probably find it easier to meet someone in college or something
  i think youll probably find it easier to meet someone in college or something  thats all i wanted to hear thank you for giving me hope
  no problem op ive heard university is a lot easier when it comes to socializing if you really try to put yourself out there and make an effort my former friends first day in university resulted in him being invited to play pool with some random guys from his dorm  dont fret youll be okay
  it kinda depends on the country starting uni from the fresh i think is the best for people like us on 4chan
  that is correct but even if there are like 100k people in your town youre still gonna meet new people in uni
they exist but they stay away from people with overtly pessimistic views of virtually any kind this is because negativity loves company and it always starts with why have we been wronged and ends with them perpetuating that long enough to become the monster    the problem as i see it is that everyone is so eager to find blame in others so that its someone elses problem but so seldom willing to stop and ask what they can do to better influence what they come across    you really have to be ready for that horrible rate of return when being good/innocent/giving/etc simply because theres a lot more demand than supply for them and not all demand good itself
  it seems like as time progresses theres more and more mob mentality and were losing true good values
  no lol if anything women are meaner and more ruthless than men could ever be    you were lied to
  bruh im sure you had some bad shit happen to you but thats just not true
  lmao at this sissy faggot who cant attract a mate unless shes a whimpering mouse
  i wish i was born in america its still there but is less prominent  take it from me youre not missing out
  hahaha
go live in japan the women are pretty much all polite you likely will never be accepted though and if you have kids your kids wont be accepted either so never have kids there     later on in life your wife will likely hate you though i saw that a lot in japan you are only there to work like crazy and make money once you retire you find out your wife doesnt want you at home
yes i am and was frustrated and really fucked up and felt like the world was literally hell shit loads of medication and therapy     but i finally found one im so lucky but anon they do exist no matter what keep looking bc it is real ive been with my girlfriend for a long time and its 100 forever because we both know what it takes to accept and love people do exist like that but its very few and far between and getting harder     dont stop looking
  learning the desu language is too much trouble       congrats how / where did you find her story time
  a 100 kind and pure of heart girl no only saint mary is like that the rest are somewhere on a spectrum and will frequently be selfabsorbed selfish and hypocritical like women usually are the trick to being happy with women is to stop wanting an innocent waifu and not taking women too seriously also never confide about your personal issues/insecurities to a woman in fact youre better off not telling anyone but a therapist about that shit
  my ideal relationship is one where i can talk to my irl waifu about my problems and get emotional support from her same reversed
  honestly most of america isnt much better
  it cant be worse try experiencing being a teenager in serbia
  ive been there but youre going to get fucked a womans view of you will drop as soon as you reveal to her that you have weaknesses and insecurities they want a man to provide them with emotional support and they feel like you cant do that if you need emotional support yourself at first theyll either act compassionately or will ignore you as you tell them what troubles you and as soon as the first conflict between you two appears shell use everything you told her to hurt you happened to me way too many times    a mans role is to be selfreliant it sounds depressive at first but once you get to a point of not needing anyone else its very liberating
  from my experience girlsor really just people in general are even worse in college most are still very immature and now live in an environment that encourages them to behave like degenerates and have no one to tell them otherwise
i think my gf is sweet kind and innocent but we havent been together long enough for me to be sure
  my husband and i have this kind of relationship there is hope op dont give up
  sorry to hear that anon  if its the innocent pure kind girl im talking about she wouldnt do that thats why im asking if the exist
    see it does exist
  they might but theyd be extremely rare and youd best be served by behaving as if they didnt
  i found her because she lived a town over from me in high school we messaged each other a couple of times over the years but nothing ever happened because we were dating people on and off and it never was the right time however she always seemed to be very emotional and sincere and i knew there was something special about her i go to uni near a city and she is a year younger she then went to a uni in said city im near i saw that and messaged her and asked her out to lunch in the city we met up for the first time in real life after years of little messages and it was great we then didnt stop hanging out basically every day and it hasnt stopped since theres obviously been hard things weve gotten through in getting to know each other fully but its really starting to pay off more and more i see the results and see the future im actually happy for the first time in my life it can happen you just have to find someone who actually can care about someone and get past their own shit
  my nigga even if these types of girls allegedly exist you would have to be fucking stupid as fuck to actually believe that one is just because she seems like she is    take this from someone who was stupid as fuck save yourself the pain
theyre married or engaged before age 20     they exist but they are scooped up so fast like nobodys business     will actual nice girls appear after i finish high school   no   thats the short answer if you want a good woman your best shot is now youre very intelligent to pose this question   for what its worth im 27 and successful with women
  if its the innocent pure kind girl im talking about she wouldnt do that  there are a lot of good women out there who you could have a good relationship with but the woman in your imagination only exists in your imagination all real relationships involve conflict compromise disappointments etc you have to learn to contend with another persons flaws and weaknesses and they have to learn to contend with yours you will never find this pure girl who only does what you want her to do treats you the way you want to be treated feels the way you want her to feel other people have free will and it is never easy to share your life with another person but it certainly can be worthwhile
what if youre fairly sweet and innocent as a man does that help you marry a nice lady
  im trying to find that special someone it looks like it wont be in high school though       i consider myself nice and not overly malicious and i know a few people like that if i can exist so can girls like me
  i recommend joining a monastery anon
  muh nice guys finish last  yeah whatever
  being nice is only seen as a positive if you have other traits that already make you desirable if all you are is nice you wont get anywhere   in public im that guythe averagelooking quiet and polite dude with messy hair and no sense of fashion its not going to get you anywhere   if youre sweet and innocent while also being say a pro athlete then girls will notice
  
op here what has the thread derailed to          
  men must be men because women love men   women must be women because men love women     to embrace feminine qualities will repel you from women we are a sexed species
    you guys are dumb as fuck you can easily be noticeably naturally masculine while also treating people well and staying true to yourself
  yeah thats kind of the definition of masculinity women are the ones who put on facades makeup and pretend to be something theyre not
i would like to think im a nice innocent girl and we do exist were just not 10/10 usually just 7/10 im 18 not in college also im new here i dont really get how everything works yet so pardon me if i messed anything up dont give up hope were still out here
  also im new here  leave this is for your own benefit
  looks honestly dont matter that much all you have to do is not be overweight seriously you didnt mess up anything
  spent like 5 minutes trying to figure out how to reply i am really bad with websites i guess im like 5lbs overweight for my height according to bmi although im trying to hit the gym more often thanks im still figuring this whole site out is there anything i should watch out for or any advice you can give
  why do you say leave great name by the way lol
  im new here  lurk more
the girl has to have a good enough relationship with mother and father more than anything desu
  if my math is correct thats like 2 some kgs thats nothing im talking 10 kgs in a plus    tips  dont ever say youre new   if someone doesnt believe youre a girl dont bother most people who say they are girls here are just roleplaying  dont go to /r9k/ and especially dont say youre a girl there   dont post too much of your info people can and will seriously dox and find who you are  /adv/ /a/ /v/ and boards like that are safer 
  uhh because this is 4chan
  thank you very much i truly appreciate your help
  thats my good deed for the day i helped a girl now karma should do the rest and make a girl help me
im going to go sleep thanks everyone you gave me hope back
  found a sea girl from travelling in a ldr atm beautiful sweet and mature but isolated from world trends and memes i wont touch western girls anymore but ill see if the red pill applies to her also lol
  men are soulless sex machines  women are guiltless manipulative snakes  theres no such thing as someone nice we all have ulterior motives and are out for everybodies else throats theres only survival of the fittest with the fittest being either the physically strongest the richest or the one with the best connections
  only a sith deals in absolutes
  i was 21 when i met a girl that was the kindest and most sweet girl ive ever met she was so pure     but she broke up with me because she didnt want to be with me anymore after 3 years after that she became very cold i realized she had only really been so caring and compassionate as a byproduct of love who she really is is someone who doesnt care and is very selfish    so im off of love for now betrayed by the one person who was supposed to be my soul mate
  soulless sex machines    then how do you explain men creating every civilization in history how to explain inventions made by men    if men are soulless then how do you explain men forming every single important religion most holy people are men those in history who achieved enlightenment were almost always men    and a side not no all people do not have ulterior motives for everything genuinely nice good people do exist maybe you havent met any because you live in a terrible place or more likely explanation is you are autistic and do not understand people so you assume nobody is nice because youre autistic as fuck
  its usually the worst people who adopt this cynical outlook on life when you hear someone say people suck theyre really saying everyone else is just as shitty as i am rright
  good thing about them is that they dont get much/any attention so its initially awkward but then you can have them captivated
  my ex left me because she thought i was too good for her and that i was too innocent its fucked me up because i like taking things slow and when i asked if she really was ok with that she said she was and didnt mind waiting for the guy she was smitten for turns out that was a lie if she had been honest then i would have gone on to us doing oral and the like was groping her and making out she was being nice and didnt want to hurt me which hurt even more than if she had been mean
  you can have them captivated  nigga we dont want a sex doll
  everybody is an asshole    live with it
  its as simple as id said there are truths to those lies you just have to spend some time around them to get them to drop the act and realize that somebody can genuinely care about who they are as an individual rather than simply judge them for it    there are a lot of reasons to lie and its not always something done with nefarious intent many times people just want to be accepted and its the only way they know how to be
  the fuck ya lookin for a unicorn
im pretty sure majority of the girls always have a bad side in them so there no such thing as a completely nice girl they can look nice act nice but they cant be completely nice what youve gotta do is get into redpill shit it tells how to use the kind of socialmanipulation woman used against them when the time comes that you found your so called sweet kind innocent girlfriend and you keep thinking that shes sweet kind and innocent sooner or later the girl will find another man
whats the difference between reading a book and reading shitposts in /adv/   legit question is there even a difference
  books are written with the intention of creating art  shitposts are written
books can teach you shit  this is just a sad circlejerk
  shit isnt art  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
so i had a housemate move out of my apartment early this year paid back his bond n everything all good one time the pipes in our apartment fucked up and his room got flooded his room smelt like mildew and the carpet was just soaked but the agent wouldnt pay for a temporary place for him to stay i paid out of my own pocket for him to stay somewhere else nearby and it was his last night here anyway before he went on a trip interstate the next day away from his girlfriend    on another occasion i even gave him a free brazilian wax he normally pays 100 or so for that done at a clinic so i saved him a fair bit of money when he was in a shitty financial situation     sure there were things he might have not liked while living with us i was also poor at the time unemployed so i did some catsitting have my own cat and they would get into cat fights this housemate would take it into his own hands and get between the two and one time he got very deep scratches from it i told you it was a bad idea he would say     i also might have not given his bond back the very day he moved out he said itd be okay as long as its before he moves to a new place because he was still living at his gfs parents place so i sent it a few weeks later thinking it would have been fine maybe it wasnt and he was salty over it
anyway few months later he moves out he texts me about getting off the lease but theres a tenant transfer fee of a 100 whenever you leave the lease he never transferred me it so i didnt bother taking him off i was going to clear out of this place sometime this year away so whatever everyone will be off the lease by then so last month i moved out ready to get my bond back n all but he just has to sign the bond claim form to confirm that he is getting nothing back as i already paid his half off months ago when he left he literally ignored me and my partners pursuits to meet up with him  us offering to drive to where ever the fuck he was  for him to sign the form and i could finalise everything get my bond back he answered once at 2am saying he just finished work and said we could come but yeah 2am was too late and we were asleep he ignored all my texts after that and even blocked me so i had no way of contacting him    told the property manager and she told me to just send the form back without his signature and shed sort it out but why the fuck are people so shitty
im almost 30 and just started dating my first gf we get along pretty well have similar interests its been three months and the whole time i figured she wasnt a very sexual person i was ok with this because i havent cared about sex in a long time im also overweight and never pictured anyone wanting me physically last nught however we werw talking and she brought up that she wanted to start getting intimate she also tried to give me a bj which i turned down i dont really understand why she woukd want that from me when she could have it with anyone she wanted after years of hearing how repulsive i am i have no clue how to even be sexy too someone i dont know what to do about this besides maybe breakup seeing her later tonight   inb4 loose the weight fatty  been on a diet and hitting the gym for two years now progress is slow do to past back injury
  you just allowed your insecurities to be a barrier to the sexual relationship your girlfriend needs get ready for the single life ps that shit had nothing to do with your weight
shes going to ditch you women need sex just as much as men and if you rejected her shes going to start feeling unattractive and when a woman feels unwanted she going to go craycray
  anon if a 600lb man can fuck a 400lb woman so hard they literally bring the building down around them then you need to fucking step up
  that cant be real right      maybe for the best been single so long before i dont think it would be a big deal  i just dont understand why now shes been more affectionate too lately i figured she just wasnt like that too old for sex and cutesy shit unless she has a fat fetish
  why are you sabotaging this relationship if you dont want her break up with her you just gave an example of what i just accused you of use this as an opportunity go see a therapist just because she wants to suck your cock doesnt mean she likes fat guys just because you are a sexual generalist meaning youre too disgusting to be picky doesnt mean she is your low selfesteem is palpable
  sounds like your not ready for a real relationship or even fit to be in one but i know how you feel and used to have the same problem    used to be overweight   lose a ton of weight and sex drive shot up high  30 now and learn women really care about sex    not having a sex drive sucks because you learn to live with out it in reality women sex drive are stronger then men  if your not fucking her right she will find someone who will
   i dont know what to do about this besides maybe breakup    either smoothtalk her when you see her and say that you want to be sexual with her but didnt feel it was the right moment back then  or  say that you dont feel anything sexual and if she cant handle it break up
  too old for sex  is she 70
  that cant be real right  its totally real to be fair tho it was a 250 year old building that needed a pretty major overhaul since most tenants had already left because of the structural issues nobody was below them when they crashed through the first 2 floors they were on the third and landed in the basement laundry they only had a few minor scratches and stuff too    point being tho if these two have figured out their shit surely op can and should
  shes 30 i was lead to believe people people get all the fucking out of the way in their early to mid 20s late 20s early 30s is when people start settling down part of the reason why i figured it wasnt going to come to this
   to be overweight    a ton of weight and sex drive shot up high  how does that work
  op not who you are replying to but i heard body fat traps in testosterone or something like that
  you are a fucking retard people in their 30s have a lot of sex as do people in their 40s and 50s
  literally just cross the i feel bad about myself bridge my girlfriend and i did it and it helped beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all that news
  and you need help with
people 30 often have more sex than they ever did in their teen years not only can they now last longer and are more practiced theyre also into progressively weirder and weirder stuff to keep the experience fresh
  okay op i see where your coming from and see the solution  a lot of guys dont realize this one fucking fact about women they are not as interested in your looks thats what guys like for women its all about how you make them feel period  they want to feel protected secure loved ect this is why women get get with some house of a man and genuinely love them  its why shes with you you make her feel some combination of those things so stop worrying about your looks and just fuck her already make her feel loved
  as a man in his 30s i can confirm every year in my 30s i have had more sex with more girls than i did in my entire 20s
  based off things i read here it didnt hit me how retarded that sounds till just now i have 0 dating experiance so i really have no clue whats going on the closest i had was this one girl who i was seeing she identified as an anti sexual and went out of her way to make me feel like shit for disagreeing with her    it just weird that she never brought it up early i do enjoy being with her dont get me wrong believing that she wasnt into sex though made it easier for me if you havent figured it out by now im a virgin
  anything x 0  0  sure im having more sex
  thats the math tho anon you gotta have some to have more and youve literally got a woman in the wings willing to help you with that get on her
  brought up what when you are 30 you expect to have sex in a relationship you should have brought it up early on that you are asexual
  not asexual i just stopped caring after hearing for years how ill never be wanted you just stop giving a fuck even read it on here how no one wants a fat guy up until recently she wasnt very affectionate and gave no hint of wanting anything sexual
  i literally have a young woman in my office whom exclusively dates fat guys anon why are you still typing here go fuck your girl dont answer that wasnt a question it was a prefaced instruction
  every girl and every guy wants sex unless they are asexual why is this so hard for you to understand
  its just that i feel pressured now knowing she sees me this way before that i felt like this was just a settiling for companionship situation now i feel like now theres a possibility of disappointing her and everything changed now
  not seeing her till later tonight so does she have a fetish then    i know a feel people who arent asexual that just are not into sex im more comfortable beating it than be naked with anothet person
  does she have a fetish then  when its not a weird sex thing which it isnt in this case its called a preference she has a preference anon some women simply prefer more squishy cuddly men
  im having such a hard time understanding that mindset so many reasons why being fat is disgusting its such an obvious sign of poor health how can someone find this attractive is beyond me and personally feel incredibly insulted if my gf referred to me as cuddly or squishy shes seen me shirtless before it weird me out that she would still want me naked and flopping on top of her after that
  well you find your own health disgusting because your body obviously needs you to long term do something about it to stay alive thats just self preservation anon    but people generally cant help their preferences any more than you can help wanting to stay alive i prefer asians not culturally just specific face/body shapes and generally i get accused of yellow fever or wanting a submissive asian but its just a preference    just remember to take any weird preferential things she might say like cuddly or squishy with the intent theyre given rather than how they might sound to you in context with your own self preservation    but also dont hesitate to improve your health as your self disgust diminishes with the deterioration of your health youll probably discover she likes you regardless of your body type as preferences rarely withstand long term intimacy
just got back from gym she called me a little while ago she got mandated overtime at work told her we need to talk about some things after not sure what direction this is going to go in thank you for the advice ive had alot to think about
hey guys i could really use your advice    so i have been talking to this girl and we are really getting along very well   yesterday she told me about her past and her struggles with anxiety and depression but i responded very genuine and acceptingly   and i really think we connected   now her parents are split and i honestly feel like she could have some abandonment issues   she has really low self esteem and i think the she would really want to be with me all of the time if we were to get together   and im not sure if i am willing to put up with that much drama all of the time   i mean sure i like her but i am honestly afraid that when i were to end things she would be really helpless    have any of you had any experience with this kind of situation
one of my old friends from high school invited me to her 21st birthday iaccepted its gonna be at a mall tomorrow how i can i assure my self that everything is going to be fine and im gonna have a good time im very lonely and this does not happen often i just really dont want to fuck this up
  yeah ive been there here is my tip to you get drunk as quickly as you can and take every drug you can get your hands on much easier to socialize like that
  this
  not bad advice but i dont think theres gonna be that much alcohol involved
wow nobody can help me ok then
its that time of the year again i feel like my life is falling apart but i cant muster any motivation to do anything about it ive abandoned all my hobbies and im falling behind on assignments in college how do i make my living space depressionproof ill also take pointers on lifestyle changes im sick of feeling this way i just want to feel at peace
put something in your room that makes you smile just being a little happy might give you motivation to be better in college or in general
  do you take medication for your depression
  the best way to make your living space depression proof is to spend less time there alone get out among people more this will cheer you up  or at least distract you from your depression  and then quiet time at home will be relaxing
  i dont i dont consider my case severe enough to that and i want to put that in my body because side effects worry me      ive been trying to make an effort to go outside more but between work and school its a bit tough ill also look into putting something in my room that makes me happy oddly enough i had never thought of that
been friends with benefits with this girl for about 3 months and i think she likes me low key    she goes out clubbing constantly which i personally dont like doing but idc if she likes it and she has little to no emotions the only time ive ever seen her show deeper emotions in when its like 3 am after we have had sex and its cuddling up to me    i do like her and so does every single other guy she meets but should i keep it fwb or should i persue a relationship we have been friends for a while and it would suck to not have her as that anymore but a lot of friends have come and gone so its not like i wouldnt be able to handle it plus it shows that she kind of likes me    also it should be known that i dont go out much so i dont actively meet new people crazy often but every single time i get a new job i either find a fwb or a gf so its not like it would bother me if it didnt work out i just would be dry from sex for a bit
how do i find a girl thatll let me shit on her srs

hi   have you ever feel this feeling when you have all off work to do but you cant make it i have very big problem with laziness i just not feel approaching cunt i always distracted on my phone and other can you give me advice how you fight with laziness
turn off yer phone lad
  i do this but does not work

i think i have some serious issues with interacting with normies i always do fairly well when i actually interact with them but theres this mental block where i just really struggle to bring myself to interact with the vast majority of society i just feel like i wont be able to connect with them at all i really just want to be able to push myself to go on tinder dates or talk to girls at the gym/concerts/bars/whatever but i just feel like im not capable of interacting in society and shit how can i get over this
  i think youre just an edgy special snowflake but it should go away on its own when your balls drop
  normies arent your problem imho people are
  all type of people are
  what kinda autistic fag spends his time calling people edgy on 4chan lmao      more or less what i was trying to say i cant push myself to connect to anyone who i dont already identify with if that makes any sense
  i feel similarly  i become bored with people very quickly so i usually dont even bother   i can keep a conversation with just about anyone male or female attractive or not but i get sick of them   interacting with them rarely gives me anything so these interactions remained confined to situations like classes  to be honest i dont see people outside of my family as necessary for me to be content or happy
i have 3 kids 2 from my current wife and 1 from an ex they are ages 22 18 16 the 22 year old son is from my ex and he came out as gay like 8 years ago and i thought it was no big deal you just do you you know    now my two daughters have both come out as gay in the last couple years with my youngest coming out a couple weeks ago    this is statistically impossible i want to call bullshit but i live in seattle a really left leaning town which i adore in most cases but the overwhelming support my kids get from their peers and institutions boggles my mind i want to be a good father and not deny their identities or suppress their sexuality god knows it could really dark if their dad does that however i feel like this is too much no one else in my family line or my wifes or my ex wifes is gay now its three in a row this is just too much
  the gay gene runs strong in their parents
first come to terms with why it bothers you now    until then nothing anyone else posts will have any meaning and will largely be incendiary
  no one else in my family line or my wifes or my ex wifes is gay  no you just dont know if anyone in those lines are gay plenty of people who are gay especially bisexual live their lives in the closet and reproduce
sexuality is pretty influentiable even if both the right and the left deny it think about weird fetishes do you think humans are sexually attracted to shit like vore by nature or look at other cultures where being gay is normal also not all cultures see something as normally sexual for us as kissing  the fact that seattle is a very left leaning town has made your kids gay

  wow op im so sorry for your loss truly and dark and disease ridden lifestyle that theyve chosen and not even just one but all three
  woman are only gay until they find a good looking man
  your family line just ended   you can go for wife 3 and try again   i would somehow link this to op being a fag but i legitimately feel sorry for you
can anyone give me any general tips for getting better at playing music  i play piano and guitar but im not very good
its all about practice
  switch to percussion and become stick boy
  id rather not
  percussion is the easiest thing ever just remember that if you wanna give up
play slow dont speed up until you feel completely confident and dont make any mistakes at the tempo you are playing do it gradually  use a metronome  record yourself and listen for the things you dont like about your playing and figure out how to fix it
i proposed to a girl like one month ago and she said that at the moment she wanted to remain friends recently when i fap my dick is like stimulated only by her but i feel like a piece of shit doing this to her without her knowing all of a sudden she tries to recover the lost contact between us by sending me some funny shit and talk about our life oh and she starts liking all my instagram photos but i think likes/she likes me ofc so what do i do i feel strange talking to her all of a sudden and i dont feel emotionally attracted to her anymore pic unrelated
  i proposed to a girl like one month ago and she said that at the moment she wanted to remain friends    wait    did you just propose to her out of nowhere without even being in a relationship with her in the first place
  english is probably not ops first language
  maybe but i also wouldnt be surprised if some anon did just propose to a friendzone girl out of nowhere
how to come up with ideas for a good thesis if you cant think of anything
  goddamnit are you me
what are you studying
  its a literature class
  literature class  hope you didnt get a student loan for that
  do it on hp lovecraft or stephen king
write about why jesus was actually homosex
i met my girlfriend about a month ago we played around with each other at some times but we have not done any penetration her breasts are starting to become sore and her vaginal region is starting to cramp this could be her period but she hasnt had one in over five months according to her should i start worrying about pregnancy or is getting into an intimate relationship triggering back her period im afraid maybe some precum got near her vagina and found its way in i need some input
if you didnt penetrate her at all or played around with your cum near her vaginal area she cannot be pregnant by you
i mean my shlong touched her vagina but didnt go inside im iust worried that if i produced precum and if it touched her vag lips that it might of swam inside
  have fun raising jamals son
  its impossible penis needs to be actually inside the vagina dont worry dude
have girl that i like that likes me back  go out on second date   get really close to her and try to make my move   so close to kissing  friend is third wheeligg and it doesnt really happen and both of us can feel that   ask her out on another date  havent asked her to be my girlfriend yet     have i all but failed in this relationship what is my primary objective here and how do i reach it i havent really been in relationships much and i dont know how to act
  wait youre supposed to verbally ask will you be my girlfriend or something
  well i mean how else are you supposed to know otherwise youre just stringing people along
just do it you dont have to get all into a peck is decent
is it really worth going after a hot geek girl who has a bunch of orbiters   i mean im no chad myself but i wouldnt consider myself on the level of those kinds of guys at least not anymore   but its tough enough to get any alone time with a girl who doesnt have all of that    my question is is it worth it and can orbiters plz fuck off and find another girl to creep over so i can properly fail with her
  you can do something that all the orbiters didnt ask her out
im really liking this girl and i feel she feels the same way but im afraid if i actually ask her out or tell her that i like her she will shut me down and then our frienship will be ruined and weve known each other for 5 months and i feel like we have built such a good friendship that i dont wanna ruin it    what should i do
  you cant be friends with a girl anon not the same way you can be friends with a dude try it and if it doesnt work out find a real friend and accept that she will probably distance herself from you
rileystickagmailcom    the goal is to make an album that has a cool james dean vibe to it where any demographic  culture can thoroughly listen to it appreciate  get inspired by its vibe    im imagining a project with stripped down instrumentation and vocal delivery more in line with early rock n roll records  as if the band is playing  trying to impress friends inside a basement no pretensions    to give the vocals a timeless feel to them theyll be presented in the more simpler deliveries of 1950s rock n rollers though with a more laid back vibe to it of rappers which will also help in bending  vibing with the instrumentation    for the lyrics im imagining a mix of modern thoughts on mental health  modern society  culture with lyrics that resonate across the board    the instrumentation will be rooted in a bass guitar drums  simple keyboards to help retain the vibe of a simple group playing live onetake music in front of friends though when necessary added electronics  production will assist with extracurricular sounds to fit certain vibes    the musicianship wont be showoffy or necessary rather the each instrument will serve a memorable purpose  sticking in your head and catching your ear furthermore the music palette will be diverse where the bands genre cant necessarily be defined    im aiming to have the production have a warm  worn sound to it to help give off a timeless feel to it giving it an easylistening feel to it      ultimately i believe an artistic yet fun band that pulls off a natural  irresistible vibe with great  catchy lyrics instrumentation and production could serve as a high quality project that could really take off with audiences if all the ingredients come together    rileystickagmailcom
my girlfriend got triggered at me when i told her i refuse to teach girls self defense she was considering getting into a martial art or even boxing to defend herself if need be i shook my head and told her to just get a gun she said why not both and i told her no woman can defeat a violent man in straight handtohand combat so it would be a waste of time then she got mad because i teach her younger brother already she challenged me to a friendly fight to prove a point and i waved her off because i would just let her win and because its not the same as a rapey or murderous bastard trying to get her    im a straightforward dude did i actually do anything wrong
why even ask its clear youre not open to dissenting opinions
  i am and when theyre wrong i say so
  no woman can defeat a violent man in straight handtohand combat  thats dumb women can learn selfdefense moves to stop guys even if theyre stronger its a meme that a woman is always helpless in a violent situation alternatively she could carry pepper spray if she doesnt like the idea of guns
  fine then youre wrong you deny helping someone improve themselves because of a limit to their capabilities you believe they have according to you her max ability is less than yours therefore she never deserves to reach it if we accept your belief that she will never be physically capable of defeating a man what about if she is attacked by a woman you would damn a person to weakness because they could never be as strong as you nothing about your philosophy demonstrates any logic or the desire to help others despite the fact that you supposedly have a job helping others
  not op but in a 1 on 1 situation where both combatants are unarmed the male will absolutely obliterate the female  if you want a ratio i would call it 9010 or 955 males favor i honestly think that the muscular gap between men and women is much more pronounced than most claim it to be  also stop watching those dumb meme self defense techniques for women videos 99 of it is fucking dog shit
its really insulting and id be surprised if she stays with you much longer who needs such a dumb and condescending boyfriend when theres better out there
i hope she learns self defense and then beats you up
  fuck off with your bullshit stats if men can so easily obliterate women all the more reason they should be trained in self defense
  the best self defense is a gun true but martial arts for self defense isnt the same as a brawl she doesnt need to be able to kick the dudes ass she just needs to be able to gtfo of there unraped
this is absolutely ridiculous techniques in selfdefense have nothing to do with strength i could easily flip a big guy down hard and im not that strong how about this scenario a buff 510 weightlifting fit woman vs a 5 4chan nerd i know who would get the snot knocked out of him
  mass/size is what matters in physical confrontation no matter how you slice it  a big girl will btfo a small man but girls are smaller overall thats why this is a thing
  the weightlifting chick    men have drastically higher muscle density ive seen scrawny computer nerds utterly dominate female cops with delusions of competence at my gym before
  im open to other opinions   i know when other opinions are wrong because my opinion is 100 right    even though you have the personality of a dumber than average rock and dont deserve a girlfriend my honest advice is to realize that most violent offenders are not trained in martial arts and most women who are trained in martial arts can beat the fuck out of most men who arent     theres a high extreme where a competent female fighter would always lose against a competent male fighter due to genetics but the world isnt on the tip of the bell curve     also martial arts teaches discipline not just defense/how to beat somebody up your failure in your original post to understand this makes me think you dont even know martial arts near as well as you think you do and are not teaching her brother well/at all and shouldnt teach anyone in general     theres my opinion if its wrong just say so
  bullshit stats  if you want a ratio i would call it 9010 or 955  i was stating an opinion i also forgot to state it was the average male vs average female i dont think 955 is unreasonable at all if anything its probably more in the males favor than that kek  but yes men are significantly stronger have greater lung capacity denser muscle mass and are overall larger than women  you can have all the technique you want but when a beast is chasing you down you better pray to yhvh for a miracle
  most women who are trained in martial arts can beat the fuck out of most men who arent  i dont think youve ever semiseriously sparred with a woman before they always describe it as getting manhandled by a neanderthal even adjusting for size a man with no experience will absolutely crush a woman with years of it     guns are the only real way a woman to stand up to a man besides crying for help anyway
  believing that muscle density is the primary factor in a physical fight  its brainlet season
  muscle density has nothing to do with strength    so thisis the powerof feminismwoah
  youre an idiot plain and simple engaging in any kind of conversation with you is utterly pointless because this situation has nothing to do with the benefit of teaching women how to defend themselves and everything to do with your childish inability to admit that youre wrong
  guns are a good equalizer in general in societies that allow it so im with you getting a gun for defense if you feel you need it is fine men or women     again  it really depends on the man/woman ive done some bjj with some badass chicks and lost to a few though yeah with training men win more times than not     but if youre talking about an average dude with no weapon and absolutely no training in martial arts it doesnt take much to subdue/run away    and guns can be good unless theyre taken from you and women have that problem just as much as men not always but sometimes     so theres multiple avenues for self defense but martial arts is one     and what if a woman attacks her
  im not going to deny that men are generally stronger and bigger than women but a man vs a woman is not really comparable to a beast chasing you down i dont understand how you know women are more vulnerable yet decide that they shouldnt learn to fight like even if it only increases their chances of survival by 5 it would still be worth it
  thinking that strength is the only factor in a fight  throwing out 4chan buzzword insults to cover up your incompetence
  yeah some guy is gonna swoop in there and get her attention and then shell be gone
  muscle density has nothing to do with strength  nice strawman
  look up lucia rijker vs somchai jaidee  the dude was pretty much some random unknown lucia was the best in the business in kick boxing
  again  martial arts isnt just about defending from being raped/attacked in hand to hand combat against a trained male     thats actually the least important part of martial arts     youre simply wrong factually but above that youre an idiot when it comes to recognizing there are more benefits to martial arts than women beating up men nobody is keeping a woman who is trained in martial arts from also carrying a gun/pepper spray/whatever else she can
  i think what op is getting at is that teaching them self defense would encourage them to fight when its far better for them to run   in principle its best that they have whatever means necessary to protect themselves but practically speaking it might not be the wisest thing to do
  learning to use weapons properly and effectively is a much better asset than any form of unarmed training its much less costly on time for a woman to learn how to wield a weapon because lets face it women are just not as interested in unarmed combat resistance training combat in general etc
  martial arts teaches you to avoid conflict whenever possible    so unless op is teaching her because op seems to think martial arts is about wanting and trying to fight people  she could still benefit from learning martial arts just like anyone else     i love martial arts and i havent been in a fight since high school so years the benefits of martial arts are well above how exceptional i am at actually fighting people the only time that matters is if youre training for competitive fighting    its a tool  like any other your legs are tools your speech to deescalate situations is a tool control over your body is a tool discipline is a tool hard work ethic is a tool     anyone arguing against martial arts for women on the basis that they cant beat up x doesnt understand martial arts at all
  sorry meant to say its been 10 years since high school
  i think what op is getting at is that teaching them self defense would encourage them to fight when its far better for them to run   that isnt what op is getting at at all hes stated several times that theres no point in teaching them to defend themselves because it wouldnt help at all when that statement is blatantly objectively incorrect its safe to assume that any reasonable person when faced with a larger opponent would absolutely prefer retreat over a fight the entire principal of selfdefense surrounds the concept that they are techniques you employ when you have no other choice if you have an opportunity to reasonably bow out of a fight with no detriment to you but you choose to fight anyways its not selfdefense anymore i dont understand the logic that teaching a woman how to effectively escape from an attacker is going to encourage her to face him head on that doesnt make any sense op is also an idiot in not realizing that selfdefense particularly womens self defense is not about winning a fight its about stunning your opponent neutralizing the threat to yourself and disabling them to the the point that you can escape there is absolutely benefit for a woman to have this knowledge op is 100 incorrect
  im a straightforward dude    you pretty much answered yourself with the same question    your personality dictates a form of leadership in a bossy way you couldve argued with her more before flipping her off you just cut to the chase and made it sound like youre sort of an asshole    if you wouldve taken the time to tell her that a 100kg dude would literally piss on her defensive skills no matter how good she is at them she wouldve eventually understood    but this way you just told her youre useless go away i aint wasting time on you go back to her and have a conversation with her on this    do her a favor and teach her a few moves you wont die if you waste a few hours on her
  learning to use weapons properly and effectively is a much better asset than any form of unarmed training  no not really selfdefense scenarios are particularly dodgy because theyre typically close quarters the last thing any small woman needs is a larger more powerful opponent getting a hold of her weapon that shes trying to fish out of her purse while hes 4 feet away the first thing they teach you in armed defense is knowing when not to draw your weapon if you cant draw effectively or at the right time in the right context then its infinitely safer to not use it unarmed defense is far more effective and practical in an everyday context
op is almost as autistic as the incels on /r9k self defense is supposed to help escape op apparently wants his gf to get raped because anyone with a brain knows that some defense skills are better than having none
  no    i want her to just ventilate any fucker who tries to go after her instead of larping as a kung fu master
  a gun isnt going to be effective in situations where the person is already too close if she gets snatched she can at least have some sort of skill to maybe get him off of her or stun him so she can get away your logic makes absolutely no sense
  your argument is illogical there is no way to frame your argument in a way that is even remotely logical at this point youre just digging your heels in deeper because you arent capable of admitting youre wrong
    as i said its not the idea of self defense im against and op doesnt seem to be of that mindset either its just priorities i find it mildly odd that he outright wont teach her some basic things to do ie heres the best way to crush a guys balls but the main point is understandable a bit more so given that she wanted to fight him which is exactly the kind of unwarranted confidence that could get her seriously hurt or raped in real life    i think he should accept her offer of a fight then after he wins to dispel her idea of being able to put up a fight he should just teach her the basics while stressing that running away from or shooting the bastard should be her first instinct
  hes right youre the dumb one here honestly    if his gf is the type who is yeeting the instant she feels the slightest power inside why would you teach someone this unstable anything that offers her power    shed commit suicide faster this way
  you sound like an absolute retard in what way is having no defense more effective than having some defensive in situations where someone grabs you from behind or corners you how will only running help in any way this person would only need a few seconds of her digging for her gun to snatch it from her or stop her at this point youre desperately in need to feel right that youre rejecting the simplest logic that everyone in this thread has been trying to explain to you but continue to be a cuck im sure if shes smart shell apply for a defense class without caring about your sperg opinions or help
  its better knowing than not knowing especially against someone who doesnt have any training it can mean life or death as long as you teach her to avoid the situation and run for her life before trying to defend herself and losing
   and yet you used a photo of the worlds most iconic warrior woman in your post   do this girl a favor and break up with her so she can find someone whos not a controlling dick who wont get in the way of her selfimprovement
  
if your girlfriend is reckless and takes on fights then i can understand not teaching her but if shes not and wants to learn in case of an emergency then that could be helpful it can be as simple as showing her points on the body that are weak to help her get out of the situation my nephew whos about 14 had some guy try to pick her up and run with her luckily shes ruthless and went straight for the eyes and then ran home
  not really a can of pepper spray or a small caliber rifle will do a much better job at defending yourself than martial arts if she wanted to take a selfdefense class that would be a different story though as those can teach you how to avoid physical confrontations entirely
regardless of your reasoning youre not obligated to teach anyone anything you dont want to
  if his gf is the type who is yeeting the instant she feels the slightest power inside why would you teach someone this unstable anything that offers her power  thats pretty detached from reality there is absolutely nothing unstable about being pissed when someone condescends to you and treats you like a silly defenseless defenseless child she told him she wanted to get into boxing to better learn to defend herself and he basically said aww thats cute youre a woman so its a waste of time either youre being willfully ignorant or youve never spoken to a woman in your entire life if you think her reaction was at all unprovoked even though she would get her ass kicked in a fight with op its extremely demeaning and insulting to be told that theres no point in learning selfdefense because youre too weak to ever use it she responded the way she did not because she thinks she can win a fight with him but because shes pissed that he acted like such a dick its as simple as that
  a small caliber rifle  yes theres nothing impractical or ineffective about walking the streets with a 22 around your back for selfdefense      i think youve replied to the wrong person
  white knights getting triggered because gurl power memes dont actually follow trends within sexual dimorphism in humans   you realize that were still mammals right
  sorry i meant a small caliber pistol   in retrospect using something like a bolt action 22 for self defense would be hilarious
  no woman can defeat a violent man in straight handtohand combat     are you fucking retarded stop with your edge 4chan persona and use your fucking brain retard my gf and i been through some jiu jitsu training were not even that good but she can beat some niggas up that dont know how to fight even if she doesnt match them in strength she can at least get out of a bad situation
this thread is bait  op has no gf  youre just refusing to teach your hand to defend itself
    jiu jitsu is pretty much negated by the mere fact that eye gouging and hitting the groin exists in most streetfights god dont hate seeing someone in a headlock in holy wood movies not biting  gouging or going for the groin    fighting dirty works rules are for competition not real life
  say that to my face motherfucker and not online and see what happens
  she can beat some niggas up  in 90 of cases its a better idea to run than to fight  especially when you are outnumbered ive seen too many people try to emulate hollywood movies and get their shit kicked in because they didnt think people would hair pull go for the groin or bite them     thats not to mention knives clubs glass bottles even fucking pens even people who are well versed enough to teach a martial art cant handle being gang beaten by people with weapons without a scratch or just straight up losing
  of course when you can run run but sometime its unavoidable and you gonna which you know some techniques we dont learn jj to start fights and look for trouble imo its a good skill to have and confidence booster as well
  actually id say youre wrong  women need to know self denfese hell even children get taught that  and this is self defense not an arm wresling match its not about strenght its technique  most self defense classes are full of women from what ive seen    and from her perspective you probably made her feel weak of course shes physically weaker but no one likes to feel helpless
  this is bait    and its not even specifically targeting feminists its just asserting that women are weak how depressing
  some knowledge is better than no knowledge
  this is bait because op states a fact
  its bait because its bait nice try
  alright kiddo
definitely bait no woman would date a complete brainlet like this and if not bait then shes definitely going to bone her chad jiu jitsu teacher because hes improving her unlike the autist who thinks no technique is better than some technique
op youre a fucking idiot just sign the cuck form and go jack off your students
  no woman can defeat a violent man in straight handtohand combat so it would be a waste of time    its self defense not a boxing match dont they just teach them stuff like scratch the guys eyes and try kick his balls that might work enough to let them get away they dont have to win the fight
a girl with selfdefence is better than a girl without self defence    the best selfdefence is running away second to that knowing how to block a punch or get someone off you could be life saving    i dont really know why you think a gun is useful its more likely that the gun would be taken off the person and used against them    also i dont really know why youd deny someone the other benefits of martial arts    im a straightforward dude did i actually do anything wrong    youre not straightforward at all lol
  1 if the martial art style is worth anything it should teach you to defeat a stronger opponent who doesnt have the training  here we are assuming rapists are some lowlife who could never be social enough to be good at martial arts himself  2 the reason people learn it is to feel more secure and less scared when they go about it also gives them discipline it is generally a good thing to learn regardless of how effective you actually is when you are in combat  3 she is a person you like why is spending time with her a bad thing
  here we are assuming rapists are some lowlife who could never be social enough to be good at martial arts himself    now im imagining some black belt rapist doing roundhouse kicks with his dick sticking out of his gi
  wise old sensei true mastery comes with asserting mind over matter if you dont mind that she doesnt want it then it doesnt matter
  i was thinking along the those lines in a fight with no rules because if someone attacks another person on the street there are no rules it would be hard for a guy to win if the woman just you know kicked them in the weak point everyone knows about sure you could argue a guy would defend that area with their life but when they are thinking about things such as assault i doubt the first thing in their mind is i must protect my balls rn though this is just my opinion   also why are we talking about if men were to fight women when talking about self defense it might sound like a dumb question but its not like most selfdefense fights are two people in their fight stances about to duke it out from my knowledge its usually someone with a weapon of some sort behind a presumably defensive person so in my opinion it doesnt really matter who could win in a fight if the fight is already rigged in the attackers favor  also the whole women cant beat men thing is a fallacy anyone could beat anyone if they strategize properly like i said i cant name anyone that isnt apart of the jackass crew who could stand up from a kick in the balls  and finally i believe everyone has the right to learn to protect themselves in any way they see fit
a woman could never defeat a man in physical combat  therefore women should carry a gun instead  so violent men can overpower them take the gun and murder them instantly  good plan
  could you take a professional female martial artist in a fight youd get crused into a fine paste by miesha tate
  youre a dumbshit fighting is not about raw power its mostly about dexterity and agility too yes punching and kicking power can be useful but for selfdefense purposes its mostly about knowing which nerves to hit and how to redirect your opponents energy
nah    fist fighting is a terrible way to defend yourself and requires a solid foundation in order to be effective often the mere presence of a firearm is enough of a deterrent to end such situations before they even begin    i think that i personally would have fought her its tough love but a valuable lesson that somebody doesnt soon forget just get some equipment and gloves for it when you start dont even toy with her just straight to the ground as quick as you can
  as a man who was kicked in the balls a lot as a kid i can tell you that its very easy to prevent yourself from being kicked in the balls    also the pain can be ignored it isnt like tv where you graze a dudes left nut and he starts crying on the ground when adrenaline is at play it hardly matters    the problem with physical confrontations is that there are always questions associated with them no matter how well trained you are you cant assume that things are going to go your way especially if they arent alone
  self defense or not you dont want any more niggas getting shot another man dead from a bullet wound is the worst possible outcome dont fucking tell her to be waving a gun around either shell have to deal with the trauma of taking someone elses life or shell get the gun turned back around on her and wind up dead herself
  your 100 right unless shes a huge girl like bigger then most men it wont do her a lick of good ive been in that situation and the guy wasnt even a big guy like 150 lbs and even with me fighting like a wild cat i got left on the floor unconscious and bloody she should get a gun and learn well how to use it go shooting and take classes on how to handle a weapon in a threatening situation carring is the only real equalizer
  have you ever tried to fight a man in ernest like your life depends on it not a play fight i mean a man that was actually trying to harm you my guess is no and god forbid you ever have to your feminist beliefs will have you dead in a ditch
the problem i see most commonly is lack of brutality this is also where the woman loses control over gun meme comes from if she isnt willing to kill the attacker no amount of training will do her any good  pepper fog would be my choice for a woman more likely to use it than a gundoesnt rely on strength and doesnt need a lot of training
  some women do use a gun just fine though i just watched a video of am 18yo girl who lived out in the sticks a guy was kicking in her front door and it was only her and her infant son at home she shot him to death in her living room emptied the clip i would do that no hesitation even if it wasnt in my home the important thing is that she understands you shoot to kill because your life depends on it if you just wing him and he gets the gun from you your dead if she cant understand or except that then yah i guess pepper spray will have to do
    holy fuck     the roasties are absoluyely seething itt
  op your right but you need to lie a little to your girl  also dont listen to these  white knight   rosties   feminist    all you want to do is protect your girl not tell her she weak  just go to her man what are you waiting for
if you are a professional trainer and you tell someone that learning selfdefense/martial arts is useless maybe you should reconsider your job and do something else
without going into too much detail i freelance with a company that pays us per the job report filed if we file 75 reports in one month we get a bonus     what ive been doing lately and this is what i worry may be unethical is that if i finish 75 reports in one month thus earning the bonus i start to work on my next reports but not file them so ive completed reports but not filed them waiting for the first of the month i file around 5 on the 1st getting me much closer to that magic 75 it would be more honest to file the reports as soon as i complete them but less beneficial to me as i contractor do you think this is unethical or am i just taking fair advantage of their payment system
unethical yes morally wrong no
hey guys i got kind of a lengthy story im just wondering if im right or wrong here my gf expressed to me how much she loves to be rubbed so whenever were holding each other i always make a big effort to keep rubbing her the whole time whenever i ask for something like that shell do it for a minute get tired or distracted and just stop i feel kinda shitty bc i put a lot of effort into her making her feel loved wanted etc but it feels like shes not doing the same i confronted her and she said she cant even recall me rubbing her too much i called her on this kinda angrily and she said i was referring to rubbing her head specifically which seems kinda bullshit am i wrong for feeling unappreciated what should i do   ps she also recently offered sex as a reward after i stayed up late to edit a long research paper of hers i feel like sex isnt really a great gift and that kinda sparked the argument
  almost everything nice you ever do will go unnoticed do things to please her if you like to please her not to build up an account to exchange for gifts from her later
  yeah but i feel like i deserve the same effort back into me if i spend at least an hour of the time trying to rub you you should be able to muster over a minute of reciprocation before your hand is tired or your phone is too important
 a relationship is a twoway thing     period anon your move next
  set a timer and exchange both of you should try for 15 minutes  discuss focus areas and learn to use your body weight to create preassure    t massage therapist   feel free to shoot me a question
  ever give happy endings
  ps she also recently offered sex as a reward after i stayed up late to edit a long research paper of hers i feel like sex isnt really a great gift and that kinda sparked the argument  lolwut  did you want a better gift or are you just offended at the concept of using sex as a reward
  nope but ive known a few guys that ended up sleeping with the lonely house wife clients
  we have basically the same sex drive so wed be doing it regardless basically shes saying my reward for doing a pretty long favor that hurts my sleep and academics is something i would have gotten either way
  i guess offended if i whipped out my dick and said thats your reward for editing my long ass essay with countless errors at 2 in the morning i think shed feel the same way but then again the whole post is kinda about reciprocation and equality and if im justified
  any tips on hand cramping/tiredness i try to just switch to knuckles/elbow for a bit  not op
    thats kinda lame desu my boyfriend and i regularly reward or punish each other will bullshit we always do for each other anyway whether its sexual favours food massages etc its just a fun way to initiate things to hand control over to the others preferences and to make their task a bit more bearable by letting them anticipate their spoonful of sugar afterwards  maybe she conveyed it in a lazy dismissive way if youre comparing it to just whipping your dick out but still
  idk its just i will massage caress rub her for hours on end whenever i ask for a little bit of that back she just seems to get disinterested and stop one time she did something that rly hurt me so we agreed a 30 minute massage could be given when i asked when i asked for it it lasted about five bc she would press so hard in that it hurt and i eventually asked her to stop it felt kinda intentional bc i kept telling her to stop pushing in so hard but she just kept going until i was pretty done
also id like to add that a lot of times in public shell say stuff like god i wish i could rub ur head rn but in private she never does i dont get it maybe shes just lying to seem like she cares more than she does bc she wont have to follow through in public
  drink more water upwards of 90 ounces a day take calcium magnesium supplements daily and eat bananas you wont have any cramps after that    as for being tiring rely on your body weight to create pressure stand next to the bed or kneel while shes on the floor and use as much palms knuckels forearms and elbows as possible avoid using your thumbs and fingers for the most part except for feeling structures and light strokes    dont underestimate the proper use of technique over pressure compressions and trigger point make adhesions melt away if applied correctly they would be useful to you because essentially its just leaning into another person with your elbow know when you lay in a bed with your elbows holding you up while you chat with someone thats what youre going for find the tight spot and sink into it slowly and hold
    i get you anon i have similar shit happen the thing is some people just dont see the value or effort you put into nice deeds just stop rubbing her back to the point where it physically drains you  if you stop alltogether she will probably be a salty bitch but just minimize the effort you have to put in to obtain a similar reward
  you wont get better advice than this op
should i try weed    i really want to try it but i am not sure i should because my uncle has schizophrenia  can it make me have a psychotic attack even though i dont think i have schizophrenia 
eh itll probably be fine if you just do it once dont smoke something too strong and youll probably enjoy yourself
smoke a very small amount it can take a little bit to kick in at first so if you smoke more because you think it hasnt affected you yet you can definitely set yourself up for a panick attack
if schizophrenia is in the family absolutely never try psychedelics like lsd or shrooms you can fuck yourself up for life
that art is so beautiful  10/10
  i have schizophrenia in the family and i smoke weed constantly and have taken 200ug of lsd with no issue at least so far is the worry that a bad trip triggers your latent schizophrenia or will psychedelics actually cause you to develop it
  weed is easy  smoke a very modest amount be somewhere safe and mellow dont need to do anything or be anywhere or interact with anyone youll be good
  it can trigger it we dont really understand much about schizophrenia but we know theres a strong genetic factor so generally if it runs in the family its safer to stay away from mind altering substances
  dont do it dont fuck with any drugs since you have a family history of schizophrenia sorry man it sucks but thats how it is
  its not instantaneous or anything if youre strong willed then yeah try it but be aware that youre more likely to have the panic attack oh god im dying and broke myself forever response than a chill response when i say this i mean actually you think youre dying youll survive though and if you just do nothing and let yourself internally freak out the worst that happens is an hour passes and youre a little more calm     youll probably try it and as soon as you feel it youre gonna think that youve triggered a psychosis and youve forever broken your brain but you havent
drinking is nice  i wanted to try weed because alot of my friends say its fun   are there other drugs that would be safer for someone with my shit genes
i have a friend whos got a prescription for percs and he offered me should i  i also have a drug test in two weeks to a month
do not try it     there is a big change that youll fuck up your life
  this thread is full of some of the most autistic replies ive ever seen weed is not a poison and it definitely isnt heroin you arent making a permanent lifechanging decision if you try some weed in college or after an existential crisis stop being such drama queens    op weed is fine just as long as you dont let it overrun your life it can make you slothful and unfocused and it can even keep you that way if you decide to be one of those people who smokes all the time    what these fools have forgotten is that sometimes people want or need to be slothful and unfocused we dont work all the time some people dont know how to relax properly or need a little help relaxing because theyre shy or selfconcious or just stressed about a ton of stuff weed helps with these things    go ahead and give it a shot op just try it on a weekend or something and set aside a couple hours to do a fat lot of nothing other than maybe play vidya or surf the web youll be just fucking fine
  this this board seems like christian reddit or something  its just fucking weed
  i am a bonified christian who doesnt think there is anything wrong with weed
how old are you if above 23 or so i say go for it
    you two are retards with no medical knowledge and youve ignored the most important part of the op
  cool i honestly didnt find a better word maybe outdated conservatives    as if you have medical knowledge lol  hell be fine as long as he doesnt smoke a blunt to himself in one sitting
  you mean the part where his uncle has schitzophrenia you know that person who is not the op how stupid are you
the first and only time i smoked i was plauged by fear and felt like i was going insane   i thought my friends were trying to kill me i drove home blazed ill never do this again
  which means it runs in his family retard either through his paternal or maternal line psycotic substances can trigger things like schizophrenia in someone who clearly has a genetic predisposition like op think russian roulette each time he would potentially smoke pot
  youre more likely to develop psychosis from traumatic life experiences
  i am probably not going to smoke weed is there some kind of other drug that will be less harmful for someone like me  are percs nice
  well i would want to know that i was suffering from schizophrenia sooner then later and get treatment for it so yes try it
  the part that makes you retarded is that op would naturally develop schizophrenia either way if he has the dormant mental illness weed doesnt give you schizophrenia it can cause it to surface earlier thats not such a bad thing because then you can get it diagnosed treated and adjust life accordingly vs just being a time bomb waiting to go off in your late 20s
unless you want to end up like syd barret do not fucking do it    very very stupid idea
  its likely you will worry about the genetic factors when the paranoia kicks in underlying psychological issues usually reach the surface at around 19 if youre much older than that you should be fine that said im a stoner not a doctor and personally weed has caused me problems   my problem is that i had it down as a wonder drug which couldnt do you harm and didnt realise the downsides until to late i also started using it to escape from a reality i didnt like that said weed is very fun and provided it isnt abused it can be a powerful tool for personal growth and for enjoyment       have you drawn any conclusions from this thread op why is it that you want to try it in the first place
  try uppers like coke or adderall and downers like alcohol first to get a sense of how you are under the influence of drugs without heavy psychedelic effects then maybe try a light dose of dph although this is dangerous because its been shown to increase the changes of alzheimers later in life or a veeeery light dose of weed
bear in mind that the majority of people in this thread will be drug users who as a group tend to underexagerate the negative effects of drug taking me included
so i got fired from my jobi had it briefly more than a week ago for not being a team player they never warned me about anything now im trying to look for a job and have applied to many places my results were 2 interviews but obviously i havent gotten a job from either places what should i do
  keep applying for other jobs till you land one    maybe do some gigs you can find on craigslist or whatever in the meantime
  it is not usual to be fired out of the blue think back and see if there were warning signs you missed and learn from them    meanwhile the average job hunt takes six months if youre getting interviews youre doing better than most
  for not being a team player  so you were the antisocial one
so i start a job tomorrow the first job ive ever had     its a 9 to 5 office job so lets say the time im not home is from 8am to 6pm    thats a massive part of my day gone holy fuck    how many hours am i supposed to sleep a day ive been so used to the college sleep all day meme that im disconnected from reality
  work is overrated
sleep 8 hours a day you dont need 8 hours but if you allot 8 hours its usually good so that gives you about 5 hours per weekday to do what you need to do    thats not too bad better than shift work always hated getting back to back shifts that are only technically 8 hours apart doesnt even give you enough time to get a decent sleep let alone eat shower or do anything else literally get home sleep and go back to work some days i think id rather have just slept in the back room
  death is underrated
i work at a bank i do 12 hours overtime saturday sunday   then weekdays 98   theyre behind on work been like this for a month its easy shut your whiny wageslave
  welcome to adulthood enjoy your stay     sleep from 10 pm to 7 am if thats not enough you might have a medical issue
  how many hours am i supposed to sleep a day  eight typically peoples days are split in to three sections  8 hours sleep 8 hours work 8 hours leisure although you loose a big chunk of that leisure time to doing work related things like traveling getting ready in the morning some people take work home with them etc
  just remember that first day is usually the worst a lot of new things is coming up and you can feel overwhelmed but it will go away in couple of hours
desu you only need six hours of sleep minimum thats the amount of time it generally takes for the brain to sort through all the information in a day or just two  any more or less and the brain doesnt sort things efficiently    but it used to be more common for humans to sleep for a certain amount of time and then have a nap  which ive determined is that 6 hours and a 2 hour nap which ends up being 8 total and whenever i meet people who sleep 8 straight hours they have fucked up sleep because they have more energy  which could also be affected by diet  towards the night  so i assume that it doesnt work
  now you understand where your parents where coming from    try and develop a life schedule laundry meals shopping etc it will teach you how precious free time is
  i just say 8 because it takes me about an hour to get to sleep and then i can wake up before the alarm which is a much nicer way to start the day
i guess its all just a shock to my system and ill get over it
  anon just want you to know i was in the same boat nearly 3 months ago    honestly it will surprise you how quickly you adapt
  go to bed at 10 or 11 up by 6 welcome to adulting or you can be an insomniac like me and pretty much never sleep more then an hour or two its unpleasant but i get a lot done
8 hours my dude youre lucky its not shift work i did a lot of finish at 11pm start at 8am your body will get used to it
gf and i are going to have sex for the first time both virgins anything we should be aware of we wanted to try mainly unprotected vaginal and raw anal both finishing inside so we want to stay as safe as possible
unprotected vaginal  finishing inside  at least have her on birth control unless you want a baby on yiur hands
  you can get morning after in amazon for like 20 or that vaginal gel stuff for her take it slow at first with anal get lube use it well have your whole dick slippery as a slug and put a little on her asshole too be sure she doesnt eat 12 hours before and have snacks available after most people get aftersex munchies
  dumbass morning after is for emergencies and fucks up the girl for a week wear a condom and/or take birth control
  fucked up for a week or pregnant her decision you can use the female contraceptive spermicide gel fine no issues
  for the anal we were thinking of going without lube also she has constipation so i guess the no eat part should be fine    main thing is she had health issues and had no period for over a year started having it again only recently so we think it should be safe to go unprotected
  okay now its obvious that youre baiting nobody can be that stupid
  please elaborate
  let me guess theyre going to do anal first then vaginal
  even i do know thats a no
shameless self bump
yet another self bump
im 32 years old i am unmarried single    i have found that i cannot watch sex scenes in movies or tv shows even watching them alone i feel uncomfortable and skip through them im not however a prude i wish i were in a relationship with some sexual component but im not    whats wrong with me
  u a fag 
  sounds like youre lonely
movies are stupid make more money instead
  youve won but youve realized the game was survivalism in a toxic apocalyptic end state in the kali yuga cycle of history you are unironically in the best possible condition to improve your life and a woman would only destroy it because theyve been poisoned by the current social state so even if you left of to have even greater financial and personal success its likely your line will end with you and if you reproduce your children will more likely than not be poisoned through their socialization so theres nothing left to do is continue to develop yourself and pray you live to see the actually complete total collapse in a violent civil war that would create the conditions for a completely new society to rise from the ashes with an only moderate chance of being a society that could actually produce people with a sense of responsibility transcendent humility and determination to create conditions that would be a blessing for their progeny
recently graduated from uni originally i was considering applying for med school however my extracurriculars arent particularly strong because of time spent dealing with a medical condition and another family member being ill as well i was told by a close friend already in medicine i could use these as experiences on my application which would apparently boost my chance of getting in significantly however i dont feel happy using a family members illness or my own as a bargaining chip to get into a program besides that the debt and time sunk into schooling seems less and less worth it personally overall i just dont have a desire to go that route anymore id booked an mcat test date prior and have been studying for that but unless i manage a great score i doubt im headed in that direction i was considering other healthcare related professions i could aim for and was wondering if anyone here had any input
fuck all that just live off welfare in some inner city somewhere its free money
  if only it were that simple there isnt welfare where i live lol
bump
i feel guilty using it sometimes because i feel like im taking up a spot that could have been used for someone whos actually suicidal or is it okay if i use it when i am super depressed ive been having problems with feeling left out by friends and having alot of social issues but i dont know if its worth it to talk to a suicide hotline for that should i just buy self help books instead
  do you feel your depressive state could progress into a suicidal mood
  well    honestly no im far from being a tough cookie i honestly just dont have depression genes and i havent been through anything traumatizing enough to induce that     i actually think you have to have balls of steal to go through with suicide like jesus christ you are almost gauranteed to go through insourmountable levels of pain to die you might as well live ffs itd be less painful than dying
  if your not in immediate danger of suicide i would recommend a therapist
  youre right yeah    i think those hotlines should be reserved for people who are in danger i think i wont use them  ive used it like 3 times now i feel bad    i can figure out how to find a therapist or something it cant be that hard im poor af so there has to be some kind of welfare program that will help me
ive made huge strides in overcoming my ptsd and panic disorder this year ive made tangible improvements to where my mental health is no longer the focal point of my life because it doesnt need to be ive rebounded from being homeless and now have a place to live my own car and savings i have a few close friends that i see regularly    im now on the other side and am doing quite well but im haunted by memories of what could have been    i imagine if i was having the results in life that im having now instead of barely starting university i likely would have graduated instead of a weird string of one night stands and relationships that didnt last long at all id at least have valuable experiences if not a solid years long relationship the potential is definitely there but my mental health was so bad for years that i was stuck in a wrong place wrong time space for much of my young adult hood    any advice would be welcome but im mainly looking for support
same boat my friend same boat  mental illness is fucking cruel it takes no prisoners and its stigmatized way more than it should be  all i can offer is someone in your same situation  we got fucked
just try to ignore that yeah things could have been better but they also could have been so much worse its frustrating when we wish something had happened sooner but its happening now every time you feel like shit for it being slow remind yourself that its still happening    you can drown in whatifs what matters is thay youre still doing it small victories are still victories and its the accumulation of them that leads to real change
its possible to get better i had a surgery go really bad very bad infection afterwards and during the fever that resulted i had such bad hallucinations i had ptsd for 12 years panicd by everything    i recovered though eventually its been nearly 9 years since my surgery now im 26 in a longterm relationship at my dream university and happiest ive been since that surgery    it takes a long time to come back from mental illness if i can do it so can you best of luck and love for all of you guys
  i have no advice just a stupid story    i graduated high school when i was 17 i made a salutatorian speech fuck everyone thought i was going to cure cancer or something    moved a far while away to do uni  then something happened i dont know what i cant tell you honestly but i stoped going to school i just stopped i remember going to an adv org chem class and just crying    i sequestered myself into a room my parents were paying for for at least a year   i spent some of that time working for home depot  but most of it was alone and isolated  i watched gomtv starcraft whatever year that was    anyways i got out of it spent time with my parents and went back to school  i graduated   and haha now that means nothing  so im an officer in my nations military  i like that end actually   this journey took me 10 years    life is strange would i expect to be a marching saluting glove wearing officer of the military no way  but i am and i like it
bump
holy fucking shit op i know exactly what you mean had a horribly traumatic experience at the beginning of my sophomore year of college that led me to drop out went down a long and winding road of attempted and failed education and career paths drug and alcohol abuse bad relationships hitting rock bottom i ended up in a decent place right now but yeah i wonder what could have been i sometimes feel afraid that i lost something ill never get back i feel guilt for not being that bright loving boy anymore like im letting down the people that love me somehow people tell me its not my fault but i cant help but feeling inexplicably guilty about i dont know just the person i became and when im really in a dark spot i cant help but wish that it was me that died instead which of course just makes me feel even guiltier so many people that loved and believed in me along the way
life is becoming not worth living more and more eatch day the doctors think im schizo but what i believe is happening is that im being gang stalked gangs stalking is where your followed and messed with 24/7 they try to drive you crazy theres cameras in my room and bathroom and they have put devices in my walls to make sounds to drive me insane they can take control of my tv dvr ps4 or anything to mess with me they even stalk me on ps4 on black ops 4how am i supposed to function normally and support myself if this gets worse i feel like im part of some vast government conspiracy
you are definitely schizo i used to be delusional as well hope you get through this
jklogedesklsdjnvkdfslkmnvs25145361351353
  what kinds of delusions
im not gonna sugar coat this life sucks at times its gonna hit you hard and if you want to kill yourself then do it it makes no difference to us if you live or die however id recommend you keep on living because only the weak give up so easily it has its bad but theres also good and if youve made it this far you can go the distance the way we see it your worthless but were ass holes were also not the people you need to be taking advice from     anyway if you think you have a stalker then change up your routine or move out of town its completely understandable just remember life has its bad but it also has good if you think youll never be happy again then end it but if you think there is a chance to be happy again keep holding on do what you think is best
  why do you give advice as if there is multiple people with you
because there are several with me
  and who are they
dont you worry about that
  who would want to gangstalk you are you really that important youre probably just a narcissistic schizo crazy trying to make up stories get help youre not being stalked idiot
  im sorry mate you are definitely schizo    can you tell me what events led you to becoming like this or did it just develop out of the blue without a major cause
welcome to the nhk
i found out a coworker cheated cheats on her husband i desperately want to tell her husband about it what do i do
  anonymous letter
  dont bother if you dont have some evidence mind your business
  blackmail her for sex take pics send to her husband  without your face when youre bored of the slut
  do you not have facebook just fucking tell him and provide the evidence
  pm through facebook with supporting evidence
  you should know that you are about to ruin at least one persons life before you pull this trigger i hope that woman really did you wrong otherwise keep it until she actually does anything bad as revenge is fair game
  do you not consider cheating to be bad
  of course it is bad but it was not done to you are you going to ruin a persons life just like that im not saying dont do it im only saying that it makes more sense to keep it as revenge or blackmail material    i mean if i had information like that about someone id milk it for all its worth but well maybe your values lie elsewhere just saying youd be a shitty politician
  well personally i hope your partner cheats on you and youre not told until its been happening a good long while i might make a bad politician but youre an awful manipulative person
  the person that cheated ruined their own life they should never expect when found out that it would remain a secret thats how the game is played you should except that as a cheater
  based
  not helping out a fellow honest man
  oops meant to say this post was based       is still based though
        i dont mind any of this of course you are all morally right and if i was the victim here i would want someone to tell me however id also want someone to give me a million dollars and yet it probably wont happen like that everything has value everything is an asset and the owners of the said asset have the right to use it as they want and when i have something i make sure i use it efficiently to ensure i get the most out of it theres a reason people who do charity work dont have even 1 of my net worth
  even if you werent a 17 year old larper  theres a reason people who do charity work dont have even 1 of my net worth  except for lord ashcroft bill gates and everyone else on this page  get to fuck you absolute winnit
  honestly do men have any loyalty to each other is2g
  okay that would be a good argument if you are ignorant about what those people do those people do not do charity work they fund charity work and if you know anything about this funding charity work has its own economic rewards if you are a crook then you can go full clinton foundation and use it to launder money/enrich yourself but if you are benevolent as i personally believe but can prove is bill gates then what you get is a lot of social capital and good press you should see the lavish annual parties these foundations throw for their main contributors that networking with other businessmen famous people and the media are worth at least twice as what is put into charity and i would not expect anything less from a savvy businessman you spend money to make money as simple as that have you ever seen businesses that promise that some  of your purchase goes to charity then you understand
  no not really there is only a very select few that can have a real friendship
  but both of the people i named lord ashcroft and bill gates do both not only do they fund things as youve tangentially ranted about but they also do the physical charity work in person themselves from time to time bill gates spends 3 months a year doing it    so ill ask do you make 100 of what lord ashcroft or bill gates does if not your statement is just as wrong as your morals
  but they also do the physical charity work in person themselves from time to time bill gates spends 3 months a year doing it    fair enough but you have to realize that these people are already elderly billionaires do you think this is a significant i remember that donald trump too one day filmed himself doing the jobs of the various people that work at trump tower and cleaned bathrooms and stuff just good press he is already a billionaire and he is old now he can do whatever he want did you shed a tear when djt cleaned that bathroom thinking he was some benevolent guy helping out his working class employees its all business its all good press    also you are missing the point if you want me to spell it out for you then    if you are a guy in your 20s do not waste your time doing activism or charity go get a job
  stay out of it unless your friends with the husband and even then i would hesitate    for one she will find out its you the husband will cave in and say it was you two depending on how good she is at lying she will turn it around on you and youll be the bad guy and hated    and lastly why do you care how do you know they dont have an open relationship whats in it for you to gain too much risk and nothing to gain give it time and shell get busted eventually
          men are literally the most dishonest and disloyal creatures in the world being on 4chan makes me feel like not telling dudes when they get cheated on is fucking karma
  no the point was you were trying to act rich or important when you got called out on the fact youre an awful manipulative person i dont care for your advice and the fact youre offering it after the response you got is hilarious tbqh
  hi there just dropping by to say that i am a 30 male have never cheated on anybody in my life three of my previous girlfriends have cheated on me before one of them with at least two different people that i know of  just wanted to serve as a reminder that the world is not so black and white have a good day
im glad for that roastie    like not telling dudes
  sounds like a larp tbqh stories like these only come out when someone says bad shit about men      t disloyal man
how dare you work to right wrongs in the world
  sounds like a larp tbqh  thats okay you dont have to believe me if you are determined to stick to your worldview thought id share just in case but what can you do
  stories like these only come out when someone says bad shit about men    it might be worth pointing out that saying bad shit about any particular group of people is naturally going to draw opposing views from those whose life experiences disagree with the original poster
  tell him if you want to   i agree with the guy who said use it for your benefit though   moralfags will never make it because they just dont understand nature
  why dont you become a cop or a judge if you feel the need to seek retribution and butt into other peoples lives that is none of your business
  oh aye its just that men never say any of that shit being loyal and not sociopaths into someone uses some evidence to show that they appear to be    men dont care about being loyal or honest they just dont like being told they arent
  why how do you know he doesnt already know what if he cheated first what if theyve reached an agreement it isnt your problem stay out of it
    bro its just nature were wired to select alphas to mate with    btfo you pathetic beta
  women dont care about being loyal or honest they just dont like being told they arent  youre a moron friend
  but my evidence is literally piling up in this thread          theres literally no loyalty or honesty pathetic
  the question isnt why its why not   op is clearly not happy with having this knowledge and having to keep it for himself   fuck that shit op just get it off your chest and hopefully everyone including you will get whats coming to them
  posts on 4chan  evidence  come on now who are you trying to fool here     theres literally no loyalty or honesty pathetic   itd be disloyalty if he doesnt tell his coworker/friend   also how is it honest if he keeps his mouth shut  fuck you and your fucked up logic bud
  i hate to be condescending but you sound like a young person or someone with very limited life experience i dont really have much interest in debating someone who uses sweeping generalizations and blanket statements they are usually very stubborn and just want to troll people    i care very much about loyalty and honesty its one of the most important things there is to me im sorry that you havent met someone who shares those values
    hey cheaters husband your wife is cheating  knowing that she has her husbands trust in her pocket shell make a story of how op has been abusing and threatening her for months  op gets a broken nose by husband followed by getting raped by hr before getting fired  the end    pottery
  the fact that 4chan is frequently viewed because its seen as the most honest place on the internet because of its anonymity seems to be lost on you    it is dishonest and disloyal not to tell him hence the comments i linked
  im probably older than you more larping you only feel that way because someone has called you out on it you would in no way display or be proud of these traits if you werent offended
  you are right i misunderstood your earlier posts   i thought you were saying not to tell   anyways op its your choice   just try and not get fucked over like  said   best of luck my dear friend
  i just turned thirty this past week    im proud of those traits every day and the way i live my life is enough of a display but yes if someone says something i disagree with im going to voice my opinion i really dont see the problem with that
definitely tell him cheaters deserve no sympathy and anyone who defends them is a cuck or a cheating degenerate themselves they hate people with stronger wills than them and the potential for those people to wreck their games
  they hate people with stronger wills than them and the potential for those people to wreck their games  this
  woman cheats  you men are so dishonest      anyway the real reason to hesitate here is what happens if the husband doesnt take your word for it most guys arent going to want to believe it even if it comes from someone theyre close to
how did you find this out op
  nothing its none of your fucking business
  its not your loyalty or or your honesty     no one appointed you the morality police this isnt iran    ben franklin printed it on our nations first currency mind your business
  is fucking karma  ignoring everything else in this thread i just want to point this out since many people fall victim to this line of thinking    never use fairness or equality to justify evil an eye for an eye leaves the world blind every time you encounter an injustice in life you have the choice to retaliate or forgive and understand what would you want if you made a mistake    good people have empathy they genuinely feel bad when they do something wrong always forgive these people understand mistakes come big and small and people are tempted by different ranges of thing     evil people dont feel bad you may always retaliate against them might is the only language they speak
and my advice for op    the golden rule applies big time just ask yourself would you want to know if you were that husband from her coworker just flip the situation and put yourself in his shoes     then you have your answer thats all you need most people here can offer you an abstract moral analysis discuss the risk to your job etc but it comes down to your own personal ethical code
or ask yourself if you turned on the news to see that after telling him he murdered your coworker and their children and killed himself because finding out so close to christmas caused him to snap is that something you wish to be part of
  not op but yes he still has a right to know and something he may or may not do is in no way an argument against telling him what is already going on and frankly if he killed his whore wife shed deserve it
  but does op have the right to tell him is really the question
  what is it about women and assuming were a hairline trigger away from murdering them and the children  do you guys just see the shit we put up with and think yeah id put these little fuckers in an oven if i had to deal with being treated like that are we like an entire race of fat chicks to you
  yes obviously not only does he have the right to get involved he has an obligation to do so adulterers are the scum of the earth and they deserve no quarter in public condemnation of their deeds
i love skating  but my country only has a few skateboaring parks  so what should i do skate on the road or the grass i keep falling down when skating on the road because it is not flat enough compared to other countrys
  me and my friends used to skate to local schools in my area on the weekends or you could find an empty parking lot
19yo kissless virgin femanon no friends 9/10  people think i live a perfect life and constantly remind me how beautiful i am thruth is i fucking hate myself   i cant hold hold eye contact without feeling nauseous cant go outside and face strangers either in fear of being stared at people follow me around to take pictures of me and tourists ask for selfies i hate all the attention lots of sleepless nights thinking about cringy interactions with a cashier 6 years ago adrenaline rush everytime i go to class ive had suicidal thoughts for the past year walking on the sideway and praying for a bus to hit me etc   i cant talk about it to my family i dont want to sound like im complaining   what should i do
  idk what do you think you should be doing
idk what do you think you should do
  wahhh im too beautiful my life is so hard    grow up
  cringy interactions with a cashier 6 years  kek
i mean these are a lot of problems but just to order them for you it seems like self esteem issues/social anxiety then leads you to being lonely no friends which leads to a lack of a support system for all these things no social group and social fear then leads to no romance all these things being linked is sad for sure but i point it out to you because at the same time if you fix one thing its likely other things will fall into place if you can fix your social anxiety then you can make friends and then you have more support and so on    in terms of advise though all i can think of is the obvious if you feel like you need it then go to therapy else take little steps starting from where your comfortable to build parts of your life where you can be confident in whatever that is a hobby or a few social bonds or so on good luck my friend
do you also stalk a cute boy by any chance lmao
get on tinder
go out with a guy that can relate to that type of experience with the opposite sex
  you have social anxiety address it before its too late
  this
  thats because you think you are 9/10  pathetic faggot
  d  gimme da pussy i can do something for you
  find an incel
  sounds like narcissism unless you truly are 9/10 anxiety obsessiveness low self esteem and major depression  seek psychiatric help
im trying to get better at my hobbies and learn new things but i have an interest in pretty much anything that comes my way adhd so focus is hard    im trying to dedicate at least an hour a day to deliberate learning but i want to do more     any advice on learning
not sure if there is any advice for my problem but i will try  you see i have no problem shooting conversation with someone random like in a gym on the street in the shop thing is i cannot bring my social skills in my uni people on my course arent that talkative and stuff but there are plenty of pretty girls outside my course i just get that blockade thinking that there is no way interacting with them without coming as creep wishing that there was a party where i could meet them easier i dont know maybe its fear of being labeled on uni as creep maybe remains of my anxiety and shyness i just would love to make more out of my typical boring day in uni
so i lost my virginity to this girl and weve fucked a few more times but these last two times we have tried to have sex i lost my erection i lose it easily due to side effects of antidepressants she seems to be nice about it but i feel like shit at least she enjoys when i give her head tho
so what advice do you need
switch anti depressants or go on a lower dosage its what i did and it helped
  i would like to but this medication has worked a lot and im afraid ill go back to feeling anxious and depressed all day long i might make an appointment with my doc anyway so thanks
when is a good time to call it quits  ive been trying for a little over 3 years to get an actual relationship and it only got me a single ons which was basically her using me for sex and 3 dates that went nowhere  got fit  started socializing  got hobbies  i know the main problem is probably that i cant keep their interest up but how do you even fix that    im honestly in the verge of just going full monk mode and see how long i last before offing myself or something
  women are unappreciative beings that only care about a certain type of men    work for your goals and enjoy your time with your closest friends
  im having a hard time not accepting this with the kind of experience ive had
  thats only western women
i dunno either man some of us just arent meant to have relationships just like penguins arent meant to fly if youre anything like me then half of you problem might be your own selfsabotage i know i do it to myself sometimes     its like theres no way out once youre in here
  the only men that get women are confidence monsters and people naturally born attractive    if youre neither you may ask many girls out but youll be the desprate fuck that has been turned down a billion times and fucks uglies     im all in for change of the self but not for women my man these whores dont deserve your effort all they do is put make up in the morning thats literally all their worth  there no way out but there a way to happiness do what you dream follow your ambitions
  basically my lack of socialization during my teens screwed me up for life  is there any point then even trying
how do i get over my girlfriends past
you dont really either you care or you dont and if you care that much then she might not be right for you
  whats her last
you dont you wont and youll never no matter how hard you try     im sorry im 27 and i tried that dance again this year i really thought its possible but its not you should break up break up if you honestly think you can do better and you have enough time left
  this if you have hangups repressing or ignoring them will just hurt you in the end
  how do i get over my girlfriends past    i know this is just about how much dick shes taken but im imagining a guy trying to get over the fact that his girlfriend participated in a genocide or something
  i think that would be easier desu
  according to the firsthand accounts from the few survivors the guards at that facility enthusiastically engaged in the sadistic torture of the confined population but my girlfriend claims that the camp was just a holding facility while they waited to be relocated and the fact that none of the residents are referred to in paperwork following the events of january 17th is just due to shoddy record keeping who do i believe guys
easy you just have to have a body count and exploits close to hers    when i was young i used to worry about this kind of stuff a lot    after ive had about ten partners and lots of kinky wild sex i no longer care anymore i never even ask
  but her sexual past is perfectly clean    sounds like a woman after literally hitlers tender heart 
  what if he doesnt want to get an std also what if hes not comfortable just sticking his dick inside of the body of some thot who doesnt care about him and will judge him
  you mean like her sexual past how many and what kind of dick she has taken prior to dating you    if so would like to know how many dudes she actually banged before you
  if you mean her sexual past try to improve your selfsteem and confidence also take advantage of her experience make her try things you have never tried make her teach you things if she is experienced she most likely is better in bed and knows what she likes unless she was a pornstar or a prostitute in which case she probably did everything for a job without enjoying usually while exploited or abused    my advice dont let conservatism and puritanism ruin your relationship
  but the fact his gf has hooked up with a lot of guys that adds risk factors to their relationship
  make her try things you have never tried make her teach you things  thats fucking embarrasing desu    i mean its great advice if youre desperate and have a weak sense of masculinity
  not this guy     but yes a girls sexual past has influence on her ability to pair bond well in the future there are studies out there that prove that a high body count for a woman decreases her pair bonding abilities    the precise number does matter though i want to know from op what exactly were dealing with are we talking about a girl who has had a few ex boyfriends or are we talking about a fullblown roastie who has banged dozens of random guys
  not necessarily women eventually want to settle down she probably will be more loyal than other women because she already experienced what she wanted to also if after been with many chads she chooses anon is because she thinks anon is better than the previous chads    men on the other hand i wouldnt marry a womanizer because they never change
  life is risk     if you are scared then gtfo and she can move on too its cruel to be with someone out of fear of loneliness/lack of poontang then end up ejecting because you dont fit each others needs
  there is a huge difference between a girl whos kept sex for relationships compared to a girl who has casual sex    with relationships shes bring intimate with someone she loves and who loves her there is trust and care this shows she cares about herself    with casual sex the girl doesnt care about her partner and he doesnt care about her trust doesnt exist she just wants to feel a throbbing cock in her mouth she puts herself out there open to numerous risks     casual sex is toxic for future relationships with casual sex she knows she can get laid whenever she wants when her and her boyfriend go through a rough patch instead of working through the issues she knows very well she can go find someone else st anytime feminism is encouraging promiscuity among women there is also a large increase in divorces in modern day it is related
  she already experienced what she wanted to  so you wouldnt mind knowing that your gf had a deep thirst for throbbing cock down her throat from dozens of men before you
  you dont get it promiscuous women are more likely to cheat and divorce
  this is your problem your masculinity is so fragile you are weak and your selfesteem depends on how dominant and superior to her your feel is that the case   also girlfriends have to be like your best friend or better than that somebody you could trust your insecurities and your fears on somebody to share your doubts to feel accepted to be yourself in sex you should be able to ask and talk you should be able to ask things like how do you like this or that what else would you like me to do what does arouses you the most and things like that      and she may even know how to please you more than a virgin
  i am woman nonpromiscuous and had i do understand the jealousy it produces to think about our loved ones sexual past but we should really overcome it in the case of women many fears are unfounded i dont believe most women get more pleasure with casual relationships than with a romantic one women dont work like that i dont think they are more likely to cheat
  masculinity is not fragile because of this its just logic nature and evolution     its like saying is your body so fragile you cant even play with fire and guns like all it takes is just one little bullet in your chest then you just die are you really so weak and fragile     i mean if this is how you use the word fragile then sure but i prefer to call marrying a virgin smart     and she may even know how to please you more than a virgin  even if that was true and its not but lets pretend it was men prefer virgins despite this fact were preferring virgins for reasons completely unrelated to sex the reasons unrelated to sex are so overwhelmingly important like happy life stable marriage super strong bond that we dont care one bit how good or bad she is at sex     youre actually degenerating the concept of relationships by following this line of thinking
  but we should really overcome it  why
  why dont you just date nonpromiscuous men
   you   masculinity is not fragile because of this its just logic nature and evolution    you are just basically blaming evolution for your choices influenced by cultural norms to avoid any personal responsabilities you could perfectly accept your girlfriend as she is its your choice if you dont and hope to find a virgin many men are choosing different than you     the point is you could have a good marriage and a happy life with a nonvirgins woman are you a religious fundamentalist
why is being a virgin related to a happy life super strong bond if you cant form a strong bond with someone that has had sex before i dont know what to say the strongest bond ive ever had is with the man i am married to after a few boys i dated in the past i try my hardest to make him happy i love him to pieces and i dont want anyone else just because i am not a virgin i dont understand why i would be more likely to cheat on him because of that i went through horrible sexual experiences when i was a teenager and i have to take the blame for it
  virgin   sorry its the phone
  men are different a womanizer will never change there is already very low likelihood a husband wont cheat on you at one point because men are just too sexual and dont love or have feelings but if he was promiscuous it will be hell
  nice mental gymnastic you have for promiscuous women
  not that anon but your post is so completely garbage and without substance only a woman could have evaluated what you wrote after writing it and still hit send    evolution influenced by cultural norms  evolution isnt influenced by cultural norms cultural norms are a very broad subject if you were to make a one offstatement like this itd be more accurate to say that evolution influences cultural norms but more accurately traditions     rest of post  you didnt state any arguments you just gave superfluous suggestions with little relation to any argumentative basis a nonvirgin is always a slight to a womans value in any society regardless of whatever you hope to selfcomfortingly assert
  my stance in this stems from my observations in nature and women im not blaming my choices on evolution im making my own choices because of it im definitely responsible for this choice and the quality of it     i could accept a woman like this yes but i wont i have standards anyone can date a woman only good men can date good women     im aware that theres risk involved like you cant reach too high and date out of your league but also you shouldnt settle for less either whether or not you get a quality woman largely reflects what you have to offer     men are choosing different from you  i mean i dont understand this sentence men are always choosing differently form one another some men are rich some are in prison i personally dont adhere to mainstream and prefer to carve my own path of success so i cant accept this appeal to date a slut just because other men are doing it     the point is you could have a good marriage and a happy life with a nonvirgins woman  actually this is the point were making to you you cant   at least you most likely cant the odds are out of your favor when you date a slut   i mean sure obviously its possible its possible that you can have a peachy perfect marriage with a slut but lets get real you probably wont  why risk your life when you dont have to      are you a religious fundamentalist  no
  women are the same
  i have to take the blame for it  blame depends   but responsibility definitely
  by rotting out her anus in the present
  dont date whores theres a reason you dont like your past its your instincts screaming at you telling you this whore is not meant to be your girlfriend cant turn a whore into a housewife/girlfriend no matter how hard you try
question    im a guy and i can not do ons or fwb i can only have sex within a relationship so why should i be open to dating a woman who had numerous ons and fwbs throughout her life
  this i was the exact same way when i was first starting out dating and having sex always insecure because of my lack of experiences women just have it easier dating in their younger years for the most part and the worry about my girlfriends past was literally me worried about my own past and its so called inadequacy once i expanded my horizons got a body count and realized i was good looking and competent in dating and talking to women the worry about a girls past doesnt even come to mind  you do make a good point brother when you start becoming more sexually active this is something you have to worry about so all i can tell you is to use a condom every time never ever trust a thot when she says shes clean a lot of stis can go undetected for years before someone realizes or gets tested not trying to scare you but it is part of the risk you take so you can minimize that risk by wearing a rubber everytime at least until youve been dating for over a year and youve made sure shes been thoroughly tested in addition to getting yourself checked out
  the worry about a girls past doesnt even come to mind  but why why does the revulsion go away having lots of sex with tons of people is still really really gross and you dont want to subject your kids to the hell of having a mom that used to fuck a lot thats like the opposite of what a mom should be moms should be the purest humans possible
  dont get over it  you want to deny how you really feel about her because you dont want to be alone again  all you are doing is getting yourself stuck in a crap relationship instead of looking for a girl you actually like
  heres how you can do it    while having sex slap her and tell her whats bothering you continue slapping her and command her to tell you how much she wants you    repeat every now and then and shell be wired to love you
  also if after been with many chads she chooses anon is because she thinks anon is better than the previous chads  this has never been proven ever
  i dont believe most women get more pleasure with casual relationships than with a romantic one  they absolutely get better sex in casual relationships this is unavoidable the people who are the best at sex are utterly horrid to have relationships with
  this
    she claims that the prussian blue stain was missing from the alleged gas chambers and that the camp had an orchestra and a brothel with a swimming pool but i dont know senpai how can i believe her with the release of the eichmann papers
  so hot
  you shouldnt dont believe all the idiots in this thread trying to defend the past of a promiscuous partner if you hold yourself to a certain standard you shouldnt settle for someone who doesnt because you will never be happy they like to defend their poor lifestyle choices by saying that youre the one in the wrong or that youre insecure that rationalization is laughable you dont get to do whatever you want in life and still expect people to treat you the same i hold men and women to the same standard so nobody try to hit me with that double standard bullshit
  can confirm my mom was and continues to be a slut and it causes me a lot of pain mentally a lot of times i wish my step mom was my real mom because she was nurturing and not a whore these in the moment people have no consideration for future children or anything else other than what feels good in the moment
you have to consider that is not always black and white my mom is as pure as it can be nurturing and loving a few years ago i learnt that she cheated on my dad which she regrets anyway you wouldnt have expected it i didnt it was shocking but my pure mom was still the same if you fucked two or three guys in the past because you loved them/you thought you did/or for whatever reason not just for the sex i dont think it makes you a thot i do agree that i wouldnt think the same of my mom if she were to bring a different man home every weekend i think my dad is a slut for that same reason not your ideal type of dad
  i do want to maintain my standards its justnhard when everyone acts like im wrong
  youre not wrong think for yourself     women have an interest in telling you youre wrong when theyre not virgins themselves women have very simple minds and when you say something like this even circumstantially they take it personally as if youre saying i would never date you and it hurts their feelings women are very very bad with rejection unlike us women get super angry when theyre rejected     men will have an interest in telling you youre wrong when theyre not attractive enough to earn a virgin or they are white knight communists who treat sex like only a pleasure or they are immature/naive/ideological who dont understand how the world works     sex is super important pigeons for example stay together for life just because they have sex one time pigeon sex lasts 23 seconds and thats all it takes to trigger the brain activity that bonds them together forever even the males will die for her its very powerful similar effect in humans a woman will only ever love the first man she has sex with
  false why do you incels need to come up with dumb lies that can be shown to be wrong with 2 seconds of google your pigeon fantasy is retarded as if your fantasy about girls only loving their first man
  allright man im all for pure virgin waifus but youre taking it a little bit too far  a woman will only ever love the first man she has sex with  thats definitely not true theres still somewhat a debate but the general consensus in the scientific community is that biologically were serial monogamists not really supposed to bound for life like pigeons of course that can happen and imo its great when it does but you know if that was the norm we wouldnt have such a history of adultery and promiscuity as a species
  pigeons arent bound for life though
  i think youre going too far with it finding a virgin isnt possible but i think if a girl has only had sex within relationships then that is ok
  they are im fascinated with pigeons and know a lot about them      this came to me from my existing knowledge of pigeons when i was sitting on a park bench feeding them over this past summer i was watching their mating rituals and watching them mate once when i saw it it struck me thats it a successful ritual and cloaca kiss a 2 second kiss is all it takes now that male and female will never leave each other the male will breastfeed and defend/die for the nest if he has to and its all because of those two seconds    what happened in those two seconds to cause such a dramatic effect on their life then i started to think about sex and how it changes/rewires our brains and how all the girls ive ever known only ever love the first man they have sex with and why men by their nature prefer virgins then it became evolutionarily obvious to me       right and your argument is the yieldtosociety or yieldtoculture opinion thats fine basically you accept virgins are the best sluts are the worst but realistically youll end up with something in the middle and you think people should be satisfied with it     i disagree because i dont settle for less but if you choose to go that direction thats perfectly reasonable       finding a virgin isnt possible  um what do i need to say yes it is   like do i really have to say that
  you clearly dont know much about pigeons when a quick search immediately shows you they are at best socially monogamous and definitely not bound magically for life you know as little about biology as you know about society and relationships are you 15 because you sound very young and clueless about the world
  all the girls ive ever known only ever love the first man they have sex with  you dont know many girls then
    so when faced with truth you both descent into personal attacks    clearly you have a selfinterest in virgins not being important if you didnt have a selfinterest then it would be easier for you to accept harsh reality
  because he killed his sentimental side and embraced decadence
  how is it a personal attack to point out you are factually wrong your ideas about virginity or pigeons or whatever are just plain retarded its like you are a kid believing in fairy tales
  men dont love or have feelings  wow
so basically you are traumatized because you were never good enough compared to the first man your girls had sex with well youd have a point only if it was true for most women if anything we learn what we want or dont want in bed and from a partner the first man that i ever had sex with was an asshole who sucked in bed the one i am dating right now is amaziing in bed and as a person though weird poor guy though it must have been hard for you
  i think its more likely that his girlfriend is a slut and hes distraught over it
  you know madam anonymous this is an advice board where we give advice to people to help them maybe this concept is too big for your female brain but being rude doesnt help people with their problems     your kneejerk snarky reaction to ops post proves my point earlier  women have a selfish selfinterest in suppressing this fact anger is response to threat and your rude post only proves that youre threatened by virgin girls since you can never be better than them anymore you do whatever you can to repress the knowledge in other men
how do i escape being average    have an average job that pays an average wage  doing average at uni  live in an average house in an average area  have a nice but average girlfriend who also has an average job and is doing averagely at uni  come from an average family  drive an average car  have average looks and an average body    doesnt seem to matter what i try im just constantly stuck at average     study super hard still end up with average marks   work out intensely still have an average body    wat do
  find something youre aboveaverage at
  try my coral reef theory     a coral reef doesnt happen overnight or even noticeably over a short period water from all corners of the ocean flows over a few sunken objects for years as each new batch of exotic waters flows over the objects it leaves a little bit of barely perceptible particulate no one notices at first but over time this pariculate accumulates and builds on itself with each new batch of water    then one day you look and realize theres this large exotic amazing looking reef born of years of activity and lots of different things washing over a few small unremarkable objects    so how does that apply to you try unusual and new things youve never done before never been to a german heritage festival in your town screw it go to one never been to a fencing class take a few you might find something youre very good at but over time as you try more and more of these things youll one day look at yourself and realize youre a pretty interesting character youll probably meet some interesting characters along the way as well
  one more idea    it is said that if you want to know what kind of person youll be in 5 years look at your 5 closest friends similarly the bible says you can tell a mans character by the company he keeps    wanna be an interesting and impressive character go out and look for 5 individuals you would want to be like 5 people you who are accomplished or entertaining or endearing or all of these things     figure out a way to be around them and befriend them in 5 years or perhaps even sooner youll find yourself being a lot like these people you admire
avarage is good  not everybody can be the best  the point is to put in the best effort you can into things  if thats avarage then who cares but considering how stupid and lazy ppl are you wont stay avarage with that    everybody wanting to be a special snowflake is detrimental to society as america perfectly shows
  instead of chasing being better than average chase a passion or a hobby you really enjoy this is completely cliche but it is the answer to your problem in pursuing something you really enjoy over time you will get very good at it then youre above average apply this to a few things you really enjoy and over time you become specialized in areas where you are definitely above average
  youre destined to be a fucking normie
a friend ive known since 2nd grade im now 27 seems to be distancing himself from me and not wanting to hang out anymore any advice for this i texted him to try to get to hang out and play video games with my gf and i and he tentatively agreed a few times then came up with excuses in the last minute hes busy and works a lot of overtime but i know hes not that busy the only thing i can think of is that maybe hes bitter of my situation he has had solid longterm relationships with girls since middle school i never got a gf until i was 23 years old and it was only for a few months now hes had his first dry spell of no gf for several months in a row and i have my first longterm gf i think maybe its that he used to think of me as his geeky awkward nerd buddy but now he feels down that even i have a steady gf and he doesnt hes a great guy but i feel like harboring bitterness over something like this is something hes capable ofwhat should i do hes my only friend really i was hoping to make him be my best man at my wedding when i marry my gf but at this point i might have to make my brother be my best man or something cuz i have no other male friends irl
  hes your friend not your gfs friend he probably doesnt like your girlfriend and you seem to be a dude that is with her all the time sometimes thats what happens dude you seem bitter that you dont have male friends and are trying ti project it onto him
  hes never met my gf yet last time i hung out and told him i got a gf and he was like well i dont have one and he tried to say it in a comical way but i could tell from his tone he was really hiding some hurt im not bitter im the type of person who is incapable of hating anyone and only has passion for my fellow human beings i am just trying to understand him and salvage a friendship that has lasted nearly 2 decades now
im obsessed with a girl i dont know at all and have only actually seen about 8 times not spoken to just saw around town she works at a grocery store thats close to where i live i avoid going there at all anymore so that i dont become known as that creepy guy who stares she may be the most attractive person ive ever seen so id imagine shes seen her fair share of creeps and i want to avoid becoming one of them i know posts like this are common on this board but im worried i may be actually mentally ill should i be concerned that i think like this
  im obsessed with a girl  incorrect you are obsessed with an image an illusion of what youve decided she is youve built up a fantasy in your head and fallen in love with it but it is not her she is a human being and contains multitudes about which you know nothing abolish this fantasy or keep it and disconnect it from the human     or better yet talk to her dont ask her out or be a sperg just make small talk whenever you go there for groceries after youve known each other for a bit you can proceed she might be great might turn out you cant stand her
so ive broken up with my long distance boyfriend the problem is i found myself missing him more than i thought i would    how can i get over this quickly ive blocked his number snapchat and email but i have to literally place my phone out of my reach to resist myself from unblocking and checking his snapchat stories seeing if he emailed me or called     i was the one who initiated the breakup so why am i the one going crazy trying to stop myself from stalking him i feel fucking disgusting
  what a fuck up you are
  well you obviously werent very sure about breaking up to cut someone completely from your life you have to be confident and 100 believe you are ready to let go missing someone its normal and perhaps time will make it easier try to be busy through your day and reflect about the reason you wanted to break up that will either reassure you of your decision or point you at what needs to be done wish you luck
  we would constantly fight like every day over small things and often hed just be emotionally unavailable when i needed to talk and hes used personal things ive told him against me to make fun of me ive been wanting to break up with him because of those things but he insisted that we should continue the relationship because theres nothing else better to do and so i initiated it on my own because it was taking a toll on my mental health
  you are in love with your own projection
  then there is your answer he isnt good for you and you already know it like any relationship even if it was toxic you felt something for him and it will take time just dont close yourself with the heartbreak go out do stuff pick hobbies meet people your life its not all about him so dont make it to be that
so a few months ago i lied to my best friend so i could get nudes i hate myself for my actions and i dont expect sympathy nor do i want it i just told her im finally ready to accept her not being a part of my life and its time for me to start moving on i struggled to let her go but ive finally accepted it i just came here to vent    im sorry i hurt you i was in a horrible place and you were fun that i was sorely lacking you made me feel attractive and worthwhile but i guess i proved you wrong and showed you that i was like every other guy im sorry i wasnt the support that you needed im sorry i took your love for granted and im sorry i can never go back and change what i did    i love you olivia and im never going to stop loving you i just wish i showed you that

  woke up well rested ate eggs had tea and exercised  starting to talk to girls  soon to be the 27 yo bloomer  still insecure about the whole virgin thing but ill get over it cant be the most difficult thing ive overcome      how do i build confidence in myself  you must challenge yourself and embrace hardship  go hike for an hour if you cant leave the house go take a cold shower  do things that are more and more difficult  i have anxiety and insecurity too but then i remember i hiked 10 miles into the woods through steep terrain and slept by myself while i did that most normans were watching netflix or jerking off    
lol i hope you all die screaming
  but thats not special i know of at least 3 people who have done that  ive cycled 140 kilometers in one day but it doesnt mean jack shit because im not the only one and there are people who have done better
  muh bucket must crab
  i dont claim to be a mountain man or olympic athlete but it is special you can both know that you challenged yourself and overcame your own fears and you also know that most people youll interact with would shit themselves or be physically unable to do what you or i did i think thats special and derive confidence from both aspects primarily i like to challenge myself and dont really worry about how far other people go or how extreme they take it because someone will always one up you
  but if i can do it anyone can im a loser dont you understand that why doesnt anyone understand that why does everyone keep turning a blind eye to the fact im a failure i dont do great things and i dont do special things everything i have done in my life has been either below mediocre or a lucky coincidence to be mediocre kudos to you for gathering confidence from your actions but some of us just arent capable of that
  thats a shitty attitude to have
  prove me wrong and ill drop it
  very few people do great things or special things not doing them doesnt make you a failure  stop comparing yourself to other people this is a very common mistake normal regularass people make and is very destructive to self worth
  then how do i know if im successful or if im failing there has to be something to compare yourself to i dont know of anything except for other people and i meet and interact with ordinary folks every day
  id say youre doing fine considering you are posting form a device that cost hundreds of dollars so youre not homeless  success or failure isnt an end state compare yourself to the person you were last year or a month ago you shouldnt be worried about personal success or failure otherwise
  the idea that you need to be elite to be confident in your self is retarded you dont need to stand above the rest others do not need to be lower then you
  best post on /adv/ ive seen in a long time
  even better advice is not to engage with people like that because they only bring you down its like hanging out with someone who always has bad luck their bad attitude rubs off on you eventually
  its either that or being a worthless fucking peon dude
  fucking relax  learn how to enjoy small things in life and put your focus only on whatever is in front of you
  i like the idea of this thread its nice
how do i force myself to have a cold shower  
ill chime in to this thread too  this is gonna sound corny as fuck but im actually really grateful for my dog and hes practically my beacon of light in my darkest days hes an 11 year old gsd old but still very active its because of him i get up early in the morning to go for a walk and exercise its because of him i actually cook food for both him and me hes the reason i come home responsibly come home some would say that hes holding me back from being free but considering i just started living by myself hes like an anchor for me so that i dont drift away from going full retard and be grounded    /blog
  responsibly come home
  if you get in while the water is hot it takes a supreme amount of willpower to switch to cold  i recommend put the water on full cold get in just do it then switch to hot it will take a minute before hot water comes out then switch back and forth a few times ending on cold  do it after you exercise or something too how shitty this is depends on where you live too of course the water is probably 4550 f here and i have been ending on cold water for the past month _every_single_shower  dont try to work your way down slowly you want the shock from the extreme change  just commit you wont die
i love my cat    my friends are fantastic and eternally patient with my grand autism self     i might soon have a work from home job so i will no longer be a neet    i miss my ex dearly and painfully but time heals all wounds eventually    i am grateful that my life could legitimately be so much worse thanks op
    technically inappropriate for this thread but it lifted my spirits because it echoes my own usual sentiments toward happy and positive people  thanks fren
  im glad that this thread managed to lift your spirits even in an unconventional way thats what its here for at least
  but life doesnt suck for vince im 98 certain that meme started to keep the little guys down our lives are harder to get awesome but they still can be
well im making it  some coworkers invited me out i guess we are friends now its much easier to fix youre physically rather than mentally but it was worth it never give up
  its much easier to fix yourself physically rather than mentally  also one girl said she loves me never had that before
  im so happy for you anon we will all make it eventually when we bloom instead of wilting    what have you been doing with your friends
  this isnt powerlifting general wait this isnt /fit/ lol
ive fallen into a sort of depression this season im also incredibly anxious what are some habits i can implement into daily life to help me live in the moment more importantly how can i live through love instead of fear
  depression this season  make sure you get a winter light so you still get your vitamin d this will help far far more than you know     daily life  write one thing youre grateful for every day and read one thing whether its on an app or irl pic related is my tub itll keep you grounded id also suggest a daily checklist on your phone to keep you doing shit that needs doing    i cant answer that last bit unfortunately im still trying to learn that myself
this general is great we should make this a regular general
  did the long distance thing for about 5 years  damn dude here i am in love with someone from a different country but wont commit because of the distance but you went for it glad it worked out for you
  only by working together can we all make it anon
how do i become less cynical and depressed in the winter
  less depressed  get a sad / blue light lamp plug it in when youre on your pc do some very minimal exercise eg 5 squats when you wake up keep your vitamin d intake high    less cynical  write down one thing youre grateful for every day and after youve built up about a week you start reading one a day this can be done on apps or irl actively spend time with people you like even if theyre animals make to do lists every day so you can prove youre doing stuff to yourself
  feels good man
how do i stop biting my nails its been a bad habit since i was 8 almost 27 year old boomer
  jeez it depends on what youve tried   clear nail polish   anti nail biting polish   finding a taste you really dont like mint garlic and put that on your fingers    you tried these
  i have not
  good luck anon i would definitely suggest doing them in that order
  on that note how do i surround myself with genuinely positive people i keep meeting either sad sacks or narcissists
  same here thats just what i felt like saying  part of me knows its kind of unhealthy but im so far removed from that kind of mentality that i cant help feeling a strong hatred
  not the person youre responding to but thats mostly be the person whos company youd want to keep and then keep trying basically try to find environments where you think people like that would be      i used to be like that anon i mostly just exhausted myself through it tho it only leads to one place if you dont get off the train of thought
  i used to be like that anon  then what happened
  i basically became a neet and tried to kill myself on two different occasions whilst drunk i realised that there was only one direction if i kept hating myself and everything around me and that was into the ground i had to figure out if i hated myself and everything else enough to brutalise the very few people i loved i was very fortunate that the answer was no but it could have very easily been the case that i never realized the direction i was going on until later on in life when i had managed to push everyone away im very grateful for it honestly
  to offset that depressing stuff im grateful for my family they are my pillars not all family is blood find people you love more than you hate yourself and spend as much time as possible with them even online or in vidya
  confidence isnt being the best its being comfortable about what you are   who declared you the arbiter of who is worthless if you are as worthless as you say than why should anyone believe what you say there is not intrinsic worth there is only human capital and ever human is worth some of that
  literally did nothing to be here though  i might think ive improved in one area but another area always suffers whenever im feeling good about my grades my body suffers whenever im feeling good about my mental state my grades suffer whenever im feeling good about my body my mental state suffers its an endless cycle and those arent the only three elements obviously    i have to be something to be confident in myself i do need to stand above the rest or my life is meaningless i have to be unique because thats part of what makes us human  nevermind the fact i have no community to fall back on nobody cares about the fellow mans problems and they deserve better than listening to me pour my heart out    i really am gonna have to kill myself one day huh like ive known this since i can remember but every time i come to this conclusion it still stings a bit surprisingly less and less though
  i found a girl who likes me  its been great  aside from feeling like there is constantly 2pl8 on my chest all the time  my dad says thats love  but ive been in love before and it doesnt feel like this  this is frankly awful
  find people you love more than you hate yourself and spend as much time as possible with them  i have a really hard time being around people  i have inferiority complexes towards most people and i dont really trust them also ive probably trained myself to be alone when i was younger i was a problematic child so now i dont really feel the urge to be around others  i cant seem to develop bonds with people
  animals are people to me so you have any pets i have a cat he has an rbf like me i love him a great deal    have you considered going to therapy its free in my country so i understand you may not be as fortunate but even if you think its a load of bs they teach you very good coping strategies for inferior thoughts and such if i may be so bold it might be that youve forgotten how to do such a thing and learning at this point feels awkward in which case therapy would also help with just for having to speak to the therapist
  and how can i be comfortable with what i am when i am worse than everyone around me
  you have any pets  no    have you considered going to therapy  i have been seeing a shrink for almost two years now    they teach you very good coping strategies for inferior thoughts and such  really all my therapist ever seems to tell me is to reflect on what im feeling    it might be that youve forgotten how to do such a thing  developing bonds you mean    learning at this point feels awkward  oh goddamn it fucking does in every field
  reflect on what im feeling  what what kind of therapy are you doing    developing bonds  yes whoops my bad you might have forgotten how to actually do it since you specifically unlearned it    in every field  hahaha tell me about it im right there with you its apparently normal tho
  what kind of therapy are you doing  im not sure might be cbt    you might have forgotten how to actually do it  i think i never actually learned how to do it in the first place
  yeah mate you subconsciously think something is wrong  i hate to tell ya it usually means something is wrong  only usually though could just be nerves
  try to do a small random act of kindness each day take a deep breath its going to be ok
  be a good personthats it material wealth is not what we should measure each other by if youre known as a charitable and kind person by your community i garuntee there will be people striving to be more like you  if you continue with your pity party and self loathing than this will be my final reply
  im not talking about material wealth at all   if youre known as a charitable and kind person by your community  you seem to have missed  in which i said  nevermind the fact i have no community to fall back on  there is nobody that could look up to me even if being myself was reason enough for anyone to look up to me    its not a pity party and you can fuck off to reddit with this mentality accept my subjective world view while i ignore your questions or this conversation is over
51  45 erect penis  below average face   socially inept  stupid  clumsy  unfocused  tell me what do i have to be positive about
  how do you expect us to do that when youre only telling us the bad parts of yourself tell us something more relevant to happiness like what entertainment you enjoy despite being unfocused or food do you like food    besides there are women out there who think short men are cute or maybe they are just as short and dont want to break their neck looking up at someone all the time my tall friend just got a tall gf and they love being eye to eye with a partner for once
good thread im happy for you
for every one day i feel like im loved by my friends and i have no problem socializing with girls there are two days i feel the opposite
  are you funny generous kind caring a romantic a good friend a good pet owner good with words good with numbers passionate about a niche subject good at your hobbies      same here man the important thing is when youre having one of your bad days think is this a bad day or is it a bad 5 minutes that im milking it wont always be the latter but youd probably be surprised how often it is
  if it is cbt you should definitely be being taught different coping mechanisms and thought exercises to get yourself out of negative spirals and feeling inferior no wonder you have such difficulty if youve never been taught you need to learn do you have any hobbies or interests
  women dont care about any of those things
  well thats super awkward as i the person youre responding to am a woman and theyre all things i find attractive in my partner
  are you funny  yes  generous  yes  kind  yes  caring  yes  a romantic  no  a good friend  yes  a good pet owner  yes  good with words  kind of  good with numbers  no  passionate about a niche subject  yes  good at your hobbies  yes    do i fit in yet do you realize how checking all these boxes is completely futile for self esteem
  you may not be aware of it but you hold these things to secondary importance if you were to list the attractive qualities of a boyfriend the first thing you would list would be his physical appearance and how you find that attractive the rest is just dressing
  its not futile at all congrats you have at least 8 facets of your personality to learn to see as things to be positive about these are good parts of you that clearly exist just from a list that a total stranger came up with off the top of their head the whole point was the original commentator believes they had nothing to be positive about which is wrong
  youre moving the goalposts this has changed from women dont care about these things to they do but its not as important as looks either concede that women really do care about all these facets or respond to the actual point    ill never be able to convince a dude on 4chan that looks dont matter so how about instead understand that attraction is highly subjective the guy im physically attracted to at the moment is a 54 husky bearded dude even if looks are a primary thing peoples tastes are far more varied than you think
  what this anon said and you really need to stop comparing your whole life to someone elses highlight reel     no matter how well you or i do someone else did better if what they did better or worse doesnt personally affect you it shouldnt matter to you mediocrity isnt the worst thing in life by a long fucking shot and most things most people do arent fucking stellar they may be sufficient but thats different
  the fuck they dont you are projecting your ignorance coincidentally that list fits me and is why my pretty skilled smart accomplished and now unfortunately deceased wife married me that list fits lots of men and women those are qualities any man/women/nullo/trap/etc should appreciate in themselves they are virtues     practice being a decent human and you cant do that by hiding
im having to live with my dad and he always tries to talk to me and then tells me my ideas and everything about the way i think and my self identity is shit    its effecting me mentally    is there anywhere i can read about this
tell us some of th ideas he thinks are shit
  nah i dont have to justify myself to strangers on the internet    thats not what this thread is about
  because its obvious that youre a whimpy faggot also if you follow that logic then why ask us advice
  what the fuck    because i dont want to go offtopic i am a wimpy faggot okay lol
it doesnt matter anyway when your ideas and if they are retarded or not just depends on who you ask    someone who thinks its fun to hunt animals would be seen as a moron by most people in a vegan restaurant    someone who is vegan would be seen as an idiot in a hunting store      someone who thinks art is a waste of tax payers money would be seen as an idiot in an art school    in other places that person would be seen as highly logical    this is entirely the reason it doesnt matter    ps not a vegan
my life feels weird    like i am living someone elses
    same fag
i fucked up at work today
  you caught me
shits effecting everything    even my management of money
your dad is trying to give you the idea to move out without actually saying it
  this dad   you suck son  dab
  i think everyone agrees with your dad
  i already want to    i dont think he is though would be good if he was teying to   say that but
  also my dads the type to say things direct    especially to me
  infact if he was that would be encouraging and i wouldnt have a problem with it
  save save save every penny you can and move its that simple
  he always tries to talk to me and then tells me my ideas and everything about the way i think and my self identity is shit    describe those because he may be right you may be right either may be wrong or somewhere in the middle     if you are failing and you refuse to change to improve youd better apply critical thinking you are young and young people have so little life experience you have to live it not download it they make many mistakes based on their emotiondriven beliefs     you need to plan to live not veg at home do absolutely anything necessary it used to be expected for youth to gtfo and make their fortune before the hugbox generation gave up
if one were to be involved in a gossip column type magazine one might casually mention to a writer or editor or w/e that from certain conversations and such well if you want to get some aggressive type performance from a man not young boy be it bf or husband or w/e you might want to hit him where it hurts at some point by saying something like how your the big bread provider and they need to earn their keep or something of that nature men are not the only ones responsible for being sugar daddys and sheet
does anyone know how to track an ip from a received email in icloud    ive been getting stalked for 2 years now and there is a police report however i need this ip for the icing on the cake
anyone
  sometimes i wonder why does google even try google should now just be a box where you can create a thread on 4chan who knew big tech has been defeated by autists on the internet
  i googled it dude jesus christ
  i hope you also binged it and duckduckgod it before coming here also i found an article on how to do that on the first result on google    are you a woman by any chance
  you cant do that the email headers will have the ip of the server that sent the email but that server will be owned by gmail or yahoo and not your stalker     getting the ip address probably wont do much for you anyway itll point to a general location but not a specific person example youll see the ip is from la but you wont see a street address or name     the police could turn an ip into a name by subpoenaing the isp the isp would then give the name of the person who owns the account that was used to the police unless you have special connections the police probably wont give a shit though     if you want i can give you a link to my personal webpage with a unique query parameter you can share that link with your stalker and then if he clicks it well see his real ip address it wont help you much because like i said the police wont care but maybe you want to
i need some advise on how to start a whatsapp conversation with my crush without coming over as akward     im really interested in one of my friends who i spent a lot of time with recently however i wont be able to see her for some days and i would like to still keep in touch with her through whatsapp      however i have no idea how to start a whatsapp conversation out of nowhere without making it super obvious that i have a crush on her
can someone tell me what exactly a coffee date is i have autism
  actual autism or 4chan autism a coffee date is literally just a date where you go get coffee
  i heard it involves beer
  either you or the coffee is the third wheel in this date senpai
    its just you the girl and some coffee if its meant to be you guys will have a good time if it isnt then you wont really feel it     its just the way it is dont worry too much about it and have fun
i had the same question why does everyone ask for coffee in particular
  why does everyone ask for coffee in particular  because they want to make it clear theyre not getting drunk with you
  oh okay so its not literal good because i think coffee is gross
  its literal in the sense that you go to a coffee shop on a coffee date but no one is forcing you to order coffee
  its a staple first date idea for several reasons    cafes are public cozy nonthreatening places it invites conversation because youre sitting across from each other without being too distracted like you would be if you were eating/watching a movie most people enjoy some sort of coffee/tea to idly sip on there are coffee houses and cafes fucking everywhere
how long does it last
  autism forever
  probably as long as you and your date want/have time for you can make it quick if you find youre not liking it
lets get bad breath together and talk   makes me kek everytime
if you really dont like coffee op try something else maybe go to a coffee house by yourself and try to find a drink youd like maybe a tea maybe a sweet coffee late machiato thing itll only cost a few bucks and some time hell even just go to mcdonalds and try a few cheap coffees or a chai tea maybe to see what you like
    fucking betas giving shit advice like always when a girl asks you out for coffee shes not literally asking you to meet at a coffee shop shes just saying we should hang out some time if youre autistic enough to take her to a coffee shop theres a 999 chance you arent going to get laid
  holy quads batman
  were talking about dating women not fucking trailer trash thots you idiot lol
  taking any advice from 4chan seriously ever
  dating chicks who smash on a first date  in anyway taking advice from megasatan
      huurrr durr hurrr  im so tired of betas giving other betas shit advice its the blind leading the blind you dont take a girl to a coffee shop on the first second or third date just because a girl sleeps with you on the first date doesnt mean shes trailer trash if you as a man dont get laid on the first date then youre unironically the trailer trash not them only autistic betas take girls to coffee shops expecting anything more than friendship you do not take girls you want to fuck to coffee shops end of story dont like it too bad
  just like the name implies you go out for coffee no alcohol no big expensive dinner just a comfy thing to get to know each other
  wow dude youre such an alpha male going on 4chan and putting all those betas in their place
  its not about being alpha or beta ya sarcastic retard its about common sense
  its about having some fun so do it op   enjoy yourself and her
is a coffee date for a first date a bad idea if youve worked with them for a while and already know quite a bit about them  seems like coffee is only good if you know absolutely nothing about the person but people always recommend it as the first date
  the most boring and forced way to find out if you like someone
  i could do that
  meeting someone while drinking coffee and discussing things to get to know each other
  trusting pua redpillers on 4chan  this aint it chief
just go for a walk in the park better yet a flower garden bitches love walks
  what does getting to know each other mean
whatever you do do not order coffee   its just one of those things
  huh why not
  is this an american thing who the fuck takes a girl out for coffee sounds boring as fuck
  just because she sleep with you on the first date doesnt mean shes trailer trash  opinion disregarded also youre a degenerate kys
how do i force myself to enjoy clubbing women love dancing and i want to have fun with them
building new pc     if i put old hdd in new pc will i still be able to get into bios
not the old bios but yes your new mobo will have its own bios is stored on the mainboard
  ok great plan is to get into bios use windows install via usb and format old hdd at same time will that work
    absolutely    if you can boot from usb which any computer from the last decade can you can completely reassign space on your drives and thus your hd    just keep in mind that you are going to lose all data on that drive
  thats the plan     going to wipe old hdd to use whilst i wait for new m2 ssd to arrive
  if that is your pic you may want to put your ram in channels 2 and 4 unless your mobo manual says otherwise
  ram is in the right slots 
i met this very attractive girl at a bar which happens to be at a meeting that i went months ago but we never actually talk there  anyway she recognize me and approach me we start talking i asked her number she gave it to me without delay ask me to text her so she can save mine the bar was about to close and her friends where in a rush so we couldnt keep talking texted her she reply by telling me that she saved the number i said talk to you later and that was it    two days later i text her a hello amy and she didnt even look the text its been a day since that    what should i do i mean in the bar she really seems to be interested in me and the lack of any kind of response really threw me off    should i send her another text call her or just leave it like that
youre 1 of a thousand guys shes talking to you didnt even touch her when you texted her she probably didnt even know who you were shes not interested doesnt even remember you and you talked to her for 5 minutes yet youre writing a blog post about the time you met let that sink in
  should i send her another text  wait a few days maybe send her something a little less awkward like hey amy hows it going  call her  definitely not
  meet thot at bar  get your text left on read     gee what a mystery
  was she drunk important question     and no dont double text her the ball is in her court now
just text her im going to double text till you block me with some emojis     but op you should be talking to enough girls where a ignored message doesnt phase you so much
  /thread
  jesus have you not learned the first rule of texting women hey hi are fucking terrible    send a text of substance be proud be cocky be assertive    hey amy it was great to see you how about you and i meet up for coffee and a walk in the park downtowntomorrow night its lit up this timw of year for christmas    boom either she is game and youre golden or shes a basic bitch and your are better off alone
  neither of us was drunk     i was washing my hands when she got out of the bathroom thats how we start talking we were joking about how sometimes you go and greet people that look familiar only to find out its a stranger     the only reason of why i ask for the number was because she was being pressure by one of her friends to leave and she seems to want to keep talking to me
  i guess you are right im not very good at texting now that you mention hah
  this seems reasonable thanks
  you might be right     i was just asking because im not that good in the follow up so i was wondering if anyone stumble upon on a similar situation and what i could learn about it    its not really that big of a deal i wouldnt be posting it here if it was something very important
is it that big of a loss if i dont have sex or relationships until like 3035    will i regret it
3035  same as for 2025 or 4045
  except you never experience young hormon fueld peak libido sex i didnt kind of a bummer but nothing tragic
  if you dont want to have sex dont do it
id like to but i dont wanna work for it life is stressful enough as it is
  until like 3035    im not saying it wont happen but i dont know hy you assume that those things will magically just happen in your 30s when it didnt during your 20s and teens      it is absolutely not the same at all relationships are ridiculously simple when youre some young 20 year old kid you date girls just because youre both into anime or the same punk bands or whatever whatever basic superficial common interests is enough to form a relationship      also this but its not outside the realm of possibility to find someone 10 years younger than you as a 30 year old you wont be young and bursting with hormones but you could always find a girl who is
how old are you following through on a plan like this for a long length of time does not usually work out  play it by ear until youre ready for it
  20
  im not op and 25 a 15 year old would be hothorrible kek
  it is absolutely not the same at all relationships are ridiculously simple when youre some young 20 year old kid you date girls just because youre both into anime or the same punk bands or whatever whatever basic superficial common interests is enough to form a relationship  this is so wrong under 30 girls can afford to skip you and go to the nearest chad without even feeling guilty im not saying relationships are simple when you get older not at all just that the cock carousel put many men on the sideline
should i colour my hair bright red or red wine colour like pic related
  neither a natural color is always the best
  red wine fo sho
  dying your hair    just get a wig
  ive had natural hair colour for 25 years now     i have long healthy hair though its just i am bored of the brunnet colour
  post pic of your hair
  i have long healthy hair tho    all the more reason not to fuck it up by dying it
just a few more years until im finally free
ive done a lot of bad shit to a lot of people i should go back to church or something
ive been on this site for nearly 10 yearsthanks for being the only constant thing in my life even when ive had nothing i still had 4chan
i feel like i fucked up  start seeing this girl  shes basically extended cousin to me  we really hit it off share many common interests and opinions  fw to a few days back  hanging out at her place watching movies  she puts her legs on my lap as we sit on the couch  some time passes and at this point im kind of feeling up her legs   nothing too fucked just running my hand up and down her legs  we fall asleep together like this  next night same thing happens  the following night same thing   this time she lays her head on my lap and drifts off as i play with her hair  next night comes we are really close at this point  laying in a sort of awkward position but idc  got her thigh/ass in one hand and holding her hand  she moves over slightly and i try slide up behind her to spoon  she gets up from the couch and sleeps on the armchair   i stay awake the whole night wondering how bad i fucked up bc she wouldnt talk to me  in the morning nothing was said  stayed there the next few nights but crashed on the couch alone
  forgot to add by the second night there i admittedly got maybe a bit to grabby i think thats what the issue is i just really missed actually sleeping with someone i didnt really want to feel her up and fuck her it was just nice to sleep with a girl for the first time in years
23  finally get instagram  stalk old highschool friends and ex gfs  everyone is healthy and doing great  i gained weight an alcohol problem depression etc  feel like a loser  only getting older and uglier  best years are behind me  my dreams are dead
  im like this but 31 will an hero soon
maybe some day i wont have to rely on insurance tied to employment so i can actually get decent medical care when im between jobs without being forced into debt and financial hardship
    quick protip becoming religious wont help you become a better person    i know people in some rural communities ive lived who believe if you go to church it means youve given up drinking and lotto tickets and sleeping around     it doesnt work that way maybe the negative reinforcement of a preacher reprimanding you might work for some people but its not going to be a cure all for your problems
my ex stalks me online so i sent him a message months ago took him a couple months before he read it and didnt reply but kept stalking asked him to meet me tonight and blocked him i know he isnt going to show up and i want to be okay with that but it doesnt stop me from feeling hopeful and crying later when i get home after he doesnt come feelings really really suck
i cant take this life of loneliness anymore lads but i have no idea how to change it    25  never had a gf  only 511  glasses  pale  receding hairline  fucked teeth  skinnyfat  no jaw or chin to speak of  dont earn much money    theres nothing i want more in the world than a relationship but its looking less and less likely i get no matches on tinder nobody ever replies on other stuff
to the girls    is there a reason that some of you are so cunty to people in public who are trying to avoid interacting with you past a hello or a nod i seem to get fucked with and laughed at a lot and was wondering about this
  are you fucking serious start by prioritizing your health
        what do you mean by are you fucking serious whats unreasonable about my post

  implying that posts on social media represent reality objectively
 insecure because never had gf   cant get gf because insecure    i feel so behind and lonely
i really just fucking want to jump ship from my day job to making my side hustle full time but i still need the benefits from my day job for the time being    every day it feels like i have a psychosomatic cold from my main job nerves on edge constantly afraid someone at work will try to kill me or tell some lie to have me arrested i need to leave fast but i need the benefits so im trapped
i have did and its making me miserable i dont feel like i am in control of my life i barely interact with people anymore and ive never explained whats up with me to anyone last time i had someone i could call a friend was 2 years ago  i have no clue where i am going with my life its just frustrating
  based

i feel really miserable
  she led g on aswell it was your turn is all
money above the rim burberry timbs
im just depressed
it feels like such a kick in the face to continually receive low grades on my course work when simply bringing myself to complete them already takes so much out of me since entering university im finally alone for the first time and now i truly feel that when i suffer i suffer alone life now seems so needlessly cruel i wish it hadnt turned out this way
i just want a fucking financial cushion of 10000000 an hour a month even a year because fuck doing shit that pays shit and feels like shit just so i can afford to live i want to be financially fucking secure and you cant do that just with one or two or even three jobs with skyrocketing fucking rents in urban areas and lack of transportation access in rural areas so fuck
the way you got excited and made me cum in your mouth was great and the fact that you swallowed while looking into my eyes was even better
i hate being tall and i cry wanting to be short and normal but i know insecurity is an undesirable trait
i have one more relationship left in me    hes got to be amazing to change my status    im happy and content as is d
  the real question is do you hate jannies
guys  need some advice    since my recent exgf is a part of my friend circle  i find it very hard to let go even more because theres still a kind of attraction between us  breakups 2 months ago and about 15 months of that we kept bein intimate having sex etc  she told me she had sex with another guy couple of weeks ago  and the last time i saw her was 2 weeks ago  some romantic this is our last evening together bullshit    drunk texted her yesterday night  nothing bad just a conversation    should i text her that i shouldnt have done said drunk texting and she should forget about it  should i talk to her at a mutual christmas party in a couple of weeks and tell her the above
how are you supposed to go on knowing its never going to get any better
jay please please please come back
  what constitutes amazing to you
  well that depends do you think it can get worse    if you think that it can get worse then what do you think that says about your current view of the world
  i dont know anon i could flunk my courses lose all the tuition money ive invested so far and be forced to spend the next ten years repaying the debt with money from a retail job that would be worse but here i go trying to get all my work done in time doing just enough work to get by and it always stings that for all this im just a mediocre student why if people knew how hard it was living life on your own with severe mental illness it wouldnt be like this instead its hellish even my mother keeps telling me to try and make friends because she simply cant understand the situation and its been years of this plus irritable bowel syndrome as a product of the illness     i suppose it can get worse but in terms of daytoday experience its hard to sink any lower than this
is it wrong to judge people if im not 100 perfect myself im going nuts over this seemingly trivial issue i end up on the mindset that im actually a great person myself despite my flaws and that im better than many people around me which in turn makes me feel like im a bad person for thinking this way and its an endless loop i cant find the safe middle ground  this is because im surrounded by people who think they have the moral high ground because of their religion but they are actually huge hypocrites i feel like im better than them because im aware of my flaws and im open minded but in turn this makes me think im a bad person for thinking im better than them
as i was growing up i was told that i was the weird kid in class later in lifei discover that i have adhd and become an attention fag tho because of that i rarely have friends which lead me to my existential crisis and depression i became more aware of my lack of friends i wish i know a way to not give a fuck about idea of being friendless sometimes i admire villain from anime such as dio or aizen because they dont focus on friends instead they focus on their goal i really wish i know how to be more goal driven guess being a weird kid make my childhood difficultalong side alocholic fatherdidnt live with my parentbulliedbetrayed by my supposed best friendsrejection
  also fuck them i mean some strangers i barely know wish me a happy birthday on facebook while old friends just forget and ignore it i got more happy birthday wish from stranger than my own friends and family luckily im not in america cuz if iami am probably one of the school shooter kid
the thought of pleasing women is what gets me off i dont much care about myself feeling good but thinking about my cock making a woman wet and feel good is what gets me going
i want us to let go i love you to death but its healthier this way you can stop using me as a crutch and you can get out there and spread your wings maybe meet someone new i can move on and forget how much i love you all i ever wanted was for you to feel the same im good enough for everything except your heart it kills me youre perfect for me i dont want anyone else
  it sounds like you are a better person i like your self reflection its not wrong to judge we all do thats why criminals are in prison just dont get too critical of others or arrogant and know that you still have issues just like everyone some people just need to crash and burn in life to learn their lessons
  you just contradicked yourself
  i already let go bye
  i could have written this word for word he ruined me for anyone else because no one can compare hes far from perfect but even his flaws are charming he was my best friend
i should have killed myself then in the 5th grade at then i would have died young and never the misery of the rest of my life my life should have ended there i would have died a happy child my family wouldnt be disappointed in me that would have been the perfect time for me to end my life unfortunately im still here and now i know the cruelty of the world now i know that ill die completely alone never know love never knowing happiness i should have died then
  511  511 is fine its just a /fit/ meme a lot of girls dont care if you are a tiny bit shorter than her or are the same height if they do care why even bother seems really superficial  glasses  get glasses that look good on your face shape or just get contacts there are tons of websites that sell complete glasses for 40  pale  go outside  receding hairline  often just normal but over here people freak out about it way to much if its actually bad ask your doctor for fin or just buzz  teeth  braces  skinny fat  read the /fit/ sticky change your diet literally no excuse  no jaw/chin  will be better if you lose weight  dont make much money  try applying for a different job go to school or follow trainings within your field so you can get a promotion  just put in some effort and keep yourself clean nobody wants to be with somebody that is glooming of sadness so try to better yourself and seek help if needed you can either complain here or spend that time making yourself a better person its rough at first but start with exercise this gives you discipline which makes it easier to reach the other goals also will likely improve confidence and mood just start out small also friends are great try out a new hobby youll meet new people that way which helps  t511 mentally ill guy who also has glasses was skinnyfat had fucked teeth who was also really fucking lonely
i finally realized how wrong i was to have this unrequited love for you all that expended energy into an empty void is the dumbest thing ive ever done why love someone that cant love me back its simply retarded
  how do you know they dont love you
  simple he has never said my name i love you
in love with an ex meth addict with 2 kids but shes the only one who gets me and understands me met her at work shes glad im in her life and she feels like shes doing better because of me not once has she asked me for anything and i only known her for 6 months we worked together until i switched departments but we still talk and message each other i really like her but her past is haunting and i know it will never work but i just cant stop thinking about her
  so i left your name out big deal    like you even gave me the opportunity to come back from that you shot me down like one of those rich old dudes with the gun and the clay disks except the clay disk was my heart you were the old dude and the pellets from the shotgun were your words    so thanks a lot grandpa
hung up on crush rejecting me  go clubbing  start dancing with a 75/10 girl  she says something into my ear but i cant hear her cause of the music  think things are looking up might get off with a girl for the first time t 18 year old virgin  she goes outside with her friends suddenly  never see her again  leave more miserable than i was when i came in
im going to start cutting people out of my life because im sick of twofaced keeping up appearances bullshit    youre not making an effort to maintain our friendship so i see no reason to continue it
  not a narcissist supports himself honest and sincere can laugh at himself doesnt have pride issues or ego issues no substance problems or porn addictions     basically a healthy individual in body mind and soul
im sick of life and everything in it    i just want to scream until my throat bleeds
  what the hell    it is a big deal he cant tell me loves me and thats what i need
im useless should i write a note before i kill myself was thinking of simply writing sorry but it seems redundant
my gf of 4 years broke up with me two weeks ago because she wanted to explore without having to cheat on me and wanted to be honest with me    she told me about a couple days ago that shes had sex with other guys but theyre not the same as me she likes my personality better and she even told me that even though she was the one that wanted and initiated the sex that its just sex and she doesnt think she can find someone quite like me    my ex gf probably thinks she can talk to these men and get me whenever she wants because we love each other a lot and while i do love her im really on the fence about taking her back if it comes to it its just the act of forsaking our relationship just for sex and how it came so easily i can honestly say that it really scarred our relationship and i dont see her the same way anymore    even though i told her i still would and i still love her she just seems like a ho to me now even though i have to think of her like that i just dont know if i should take her back cause trust me anons i really love this girl and she loves me she just wants to explore for now and trust me i feel really stupid for even thinking of taking her back    any advice for me anons
introduce self to girl  hang out with her and get lunch  find out from another friend shes got a bf  damn oh well guess that doors closed  two days later heading to lunch  see her talking with some dude  never seen him in my life probably the bf  leave them alone and go eat  later see her looking completely miserable  me and her best guy friend are leaving at the same time so walk up to her at the same time  shes always happy as fuck so i see her like this and ask whats wrong  she says nothing gathers her things and leaves  guy friend chases after her  piece together a sudden 180 in demeanor coupled with the appearance of someone ive never seen here before must be related    what should i do
  she just seems like a ho to me now even though i have to think of her like that  someone else fucked her  dont get back    t in the same situation more or less
  i normally empathize with the female perspective but not in this case it was honorable of her to tell you the truth about what she wants to do but she must have someone in mind that she wants to fuck personally as a woman if youre attached to someone and love them you will never desire another man to the point you would break up over that i wouldnt take her back if i were you move on there are plenty of girls out there
  she told me about a couple days ago that shes had sex with other guys but theyre not the same as me    before she met you or in a relationship with you
i just feel like i have wasted a few years  be me  be 17 at the time  notice this 7/10 girl optimistic and quite average  i found her to be alluring  she says that she has no bf  i wanted to date her  i find ways to be alone her but all end up in group dates  i got to the point where we can go on single dates now  my family wanted moved to a new state so we did  past forward to now 4 years  got no news of her ever since until yesterday  she got bf and she happy now  mfw where is my refund
  could be friends     i have a stupid noncompliant drunk personality too i wake up and have to backtrack and see what stupid shit i did
  ive got an hour till i leave for work so if anyones got any insight nows the time
  it wasnt anyone in mind is was more like she just wanted sex with other people just not anyone specific    after we broke up from the relationship
  its impossible to know maybe an argument
  oh i see ditch her
why cant i just flash my pussy at a guy i like and signal my interest that way and if he mounts me  longterm pair if not then nothing all this testingthewaterstoseehowserioustheyare is a waste of time or maybe i should take it easy on eroticareadings
  when i see her should i act like nothing happened or ask if shes feeling alright
im in a super messed up situation where i dont have any friends and never had a girlfriend because i just push people away or dont engage with them also i have no real hobbies      your problem is more that you dont realize your own body rules the roost not you so when you say you just wanted to sleep alongside someone you are ignoring your fundamental nature that might be what turned her off since your inner conflict just makes things awkward or thats my take anyway
my girlfriend made out with and sexted her ex half a year ago and only just told me  should i dump her its been 5 years together
  loyalty and honesty are important human virtues if i were you id leave her but its your choice
  im perfect for you then darlin
  we were in a very bad place together so i can see how it happened but i dont know if i can look at her the same way both because of what she did and the fact she lied about it  i dont know i love her but maybe im just scared of not being with her
  its called skeet shooting
  my gf of 4 years broke up with me and made sure to let me know that shes dating a guy she knew before we met that sent her half naked pictures while we were dating she flirted with several guys and even went on a date with another man to fuck with me some women use other men to get back at their significant others and you have to let it go and move on i still love her dearly but she went with the nuclear option when i never touched or flirted with another woman when i was with her
  was she doing that while you were dating or after
these poeple are fucking dead    ill wait and wait and wait and they will be forced to wait with me just so they can wait for their own deaths
  lol that looks like fun actually i like shooting guns although i cant imagine holding up a heavy gun in the air for so long id have to build up some muscles in my arms
  same shit here
if i killed myself you would be healed
you pimped me out to your friends
went drinking with friends  meet hoes  take turns fucking them  at some point cum inside one of them because im a retard  she says she has the diu  offer to buy her a pill  says doesnt want it because she has the dispositive    funny thing is im thinking in the worst case scenario and i dont see myself having a problem telling her to abort if she gets pregnant i will even pay for the abortion if she doesnt want to ill tell her shell have to raise it alone and i will dissapear    i cant believe i feel no remorse if it comes down to it i will even lie and say im a poorfag and the car i was driving was a friends who owed me a favor
i still love you i will always love you but i fucking hate that i love you
  kys
  you might be a sociopath but at least you are thinking clearly
  how did he/she pimped you did they got money in exchange or did you agree and now are remorsed      unless you have an insurance that makes people millionaire even in case of suicide then offing yourself will bring nothing good to nobody      why not just ask him out take the lead but just be sure to let him know you are looking for a relationship not a onetime thing since almost any nongay guy will jump at the chance for pussy just dont fuck him on the first date if you cant help it then kissing him isnt out of the question but beware men lose interest when women are easy sorry to put it that way but its the true
finally figured out that hes fucking his manager at work what a fucking ho no wonder he worked 50 hour weeks im done with his bitch ass
  same
  not for money
  through my life ive had random episodes of sociopathy sometimes i feel like ive hurt people even just by saying the wrong thing or if i see a person suffering i do what i can even if most of the time it means giving them a coin othertimes i just dont give a fuck this is by far the most extreme case      not gonna happen i still got things to do
  dont say a thing cheat as well and take his money
  fucking a higherposition female is the adult version of liking your teacher im sorry he cheated and i agree with  though
  i no longer believe in longterm relationships for any one they just do not work or very rarely work     they used to call it free love you just do not presume to own another persons body i do not wish to own another persons body our bodies are our own to do with what we please if it pleases us to have sex exclusively with one person who also wants you exclusively that is an ideal situation but very rare but its important to be honest with the people who want you exclusively if you want other people     i believe in liberation from the false edicts and laws of marriage marriage is a governmental racket
the problem with most incels on here and why girls are so foreign to them is how their brains are the typical autistic 4chan autist is brutally honest clueless about emotions and what we want
  a loser mentality
  dont listen to this roastie real guys dont give a flying fuck how women feel when my wife voices her opinion about somthing without being asked she gets backhanded this is how all women should be dealt with
  i am much older than him so hes already fucking his teacher     anyway ive been looking for a good excuse to get this admittedly really hot and smart but very frustrating manchild out of my life i want him in my bed all the time and hes really not going for that but he keeps me hanging on
first it was the crows then the magpies now sparrows harassing me all the timethey knock on my window
  no a realist mentality i belong to no one but myself  that is liberation
  kys
    you guys are total cucks literally the lowest tier of society if your girl breaks up with you to do hunt down some dick you better laugh in that bitches face and tell her to kick rocks the fact its even a question for you means that you are so far beyond saving it dosnt matter you should kill yourselves
i am without hope and i dislike the world myself and life  everything is money even when i was a kid i hated the idea of money money depersonalizes everything about life and the world there is not meaning that doesnt have a dollar sign love is dead because of money god is dead because of money  i hate spending money just as much as i hate making money losing money and making money have their own set of nagging problems that chain me   i was born losing money i will always be in debt and because of this i will never be free people will never be free to see themselves as people   i will never know love and for that reason my life is meaningless i dont find the masturbatory collection of things an accumulating of money meaningful or fulfilling in the slightest i find it degrading
  he probably fucks around more than just you and his manager accept this or get him out of your life      please enlighten me ive never ever managed to have a longterm relationship i dont want to sleep around i want to be in a commited relationship
  during i think she hated me deep down
  afraid of commitment
  you probably wrote all that you ugly troll
there are too many bad people on 4chan im sick of it
  too many bad people in your fucking organization    in fact youre all fucking awful
had a great date thursday night with a girl from bumble met for drinks and ended up losing track of time and talked for 5 hours afterwards i walked her home i tried setting up a second date and she agreed but not on the day shes super busy since shes studying for finals this week we talked friday but she hasnt responded since then and its killing me inside because i know im worrying about potentially nothing
i think im coming to terms with the fact that i might actually be somewhat attractive its a nice feeling
  yo protip once you feel kinda good about your appearance stop looking for validation youll focus on the negatives and get torn back down
i cant fucking get you out of my head  for fucks sake    why did i text you yesterday  why cant i delete your number  why are you being so nice to me despite knowing that i still have feelings for you    and for gods sake  there someone else now fucking you  why will this not go into my god damn head    christ almighty
  bruh if she hasnt responded since friday and its sunday now fucking forget about it how busy do you think she is      thats dumb and not true
  thank you anon but yeah i think i always kind of knew it deep down but i didnt want to admit it to myself because i do have numerous little flaws as well
tomorrow im taking advantage of the free nhs check up for old cunts  non fast blood test and then  does it hurt anywhere any issues  why yes doctor  spleen area pain  upper chest pain  shoulders pain  back of neck pain  lost stone in weight this year  groin pain
  bruh if she hasnt responded since friday and its sunday now fucking forget about it how busy do you think she is    yeah im aware i do know shes extremely busy since she told me her schedule but i know deep down its not happening
feels like im trapped in groundhog day since you left me like a sheet of sadness covered every aspect of my life everything feels like the diet version of itself and im just waiting for nothing because i want nothing but you
  ayo let me fix dat groin pain for ya mami
  too any bad people  theres bad people everywhere  if you havent learnt how to filter the cunts then thats on you
im having mixed feelings about therapy  ive brrn hoing to this clinic for about 6months nowand blood test after blood test drug after drug nothign seems to be working on me i still feel like lothing ever fades me the only feeling i have is that this isnt a normal feeling that a human shouldnt be like this a human should have things it enjoys amybe motivations friends interests or something i just dont have any of that and the sole reason i keep living is because i dont know how not to i havent spoken to a single person besides my mom for 3 months now adn i dont even know if this counts as convefration since somethign like hello how are thigns fine yes are not really topics  i dont know nothing and i have nothign  just waiting for the moment in which my parents die so i can finally hang myselff
  gonna tell your mom to stop riding me and only take it anal  go for for it
  same
ive done so well with avoiding this divided america shit and staying friends with people i disagree with its not that its feeling like im the only one please dont ask me for more details im too tired to get in an arguement
  youre not the only one but they do seem few and far between dont they
it might sound stupid but i think i spent so much time fantasizing and making up stories in my head that nothing truly satisfies me anymore no matter what i do there is always this soulcrushing feeling that something is missing
lost enough weight that i think i look actually okay
  rhetorical question btw
the last thing i fucking need is the pity of someone i look down on today is fucking awful
im doing work experience for college and ive only a few weeks left but were doing 12 hour shifts and i pretty much live 3 full days at a time with only breaks for sleep which i barely get enough on ive to wake up tomorrow for work and i can already feel the next 3 days are going to be extremely long and stressful its not even time for bed yet but ive terrible anxiety of going in tomorrow i dont know how to deal with it and the stress and anxiety wont allow me to sleep im just so nervous about it i dont know how to cope with it i feel alone even tho i just hung out with my friendsi dont know what to do with myself
been with a girl for about a year   start losing feelings  try to break up  she says shell kill herself  stay with her  feel miserable  wat do
im pretty sure i have brain cancer  but i dont give a fuck  why would i  i care so little im not going to check myself until one of few relatives find me screwed and make an ambulance call  just fuck it you know
  i sure do
  good for you for having empathy i mean  i dont care and im just venting
  take neuro sleeps its a drink thatll get you to sleep i work 1012 hours a day nearly every single day of my life and i will for at least the next year and a half keep the future in your thoughts use xanax if you can my job prohibits me using any drugs
  life isnt that serious youre allowed to have your dignity acknowledged even by your worst enemy 
  make her uninterested in you
eh im a seasonal worker now im back to being neet in my mummys house and feeling like a worthless shit plus knowing if the people i knew in the summer would see me theyd id just lose their respect
anyone else here not passionate about anything careerwise i cant find a single career path that im passionate about      still in college which i kind of regret because i have no idea what career i want to pursue and the only reason imin college is because i felt like i had to go
  its not even the sleep its mostly the anxiety of work because its tough that gets to me but the fact that its 3 straight days of 12 hours just fuels my anxiety every minute of it and i cant relax its a job where unpredictable things happen and youve to look after people for 12 hours a day and i always fear i might do something wrong and then theres the amount of work that needs to be done im just a very nervous person and its just something i do because college requires me to
  she says im the perfect guy for her and will not give up that easy
  you think too much when i do something i just do it
i dont know what to do with my life
  what are your interests and hobbies and not everyone finds that perfect career theyre passionate about for most people a job is just a means of surviving but if it really matters to you i suggest doing some more research on all the different fields and career paths that exist
  lol take that bitch
  i feel the same way on every point you mentioned the path that i chose from complete indifference will lead me away from everything i know that that scares me but it is too late to stop it
  i know i do i dont know how to stop it tho when i tell myself to stop then the thought lingers at the back of my mind and i have to find some closure i tell myself to just get on with it and do it since i have to do it anyway but it only lasts for a moment
  maybe i should comb deeper who isnt afraid of being shoved into a job they dont like that makes up half of their day   ive already had a taste of that and its depressing work shouldnt be something you dread going to
  its a tough thing to do but i think the best way to go about it is to break up with her and report to the police that she is planning to kill herself
  work shouldnt be something you dread going to  unfortunately there are people who will try to convince you otherwise eg as my dad almost did to me we all have different priorities make sure yours dont shift just because someone else has different ones and i definitely suggest you to dig down deeper i found my current job that i love exactly that way and i would never have found out about it without scanning through the webs for hours upon hours
  maybe some positive or negative reinforcement when you overthink take away something small you enjoy and when you just go trough with it reward yourself with something small
  oh and he cant know anything about 4chan
  yes    understood
  oh and sorry for the hypocrisy my ex is that one who told me about this site    hes an avid user for years his dad abandoned him out of the country because his crazy psycho mother used him as another spouse still using him for that to this day  the boy is in his 30s now    so he came here on a regular basis from its inception i believe looking for life advice life direction what his next kink would be    the guy is really fucked up in the head and being on this site myself for the last six months  i can say with all certainty my next relationship the guy will be clueless about this place
  then you best pack up and fuck off on your high horse lass
i used to have idiotic fantasies that i could get the girl of my dreams just by being nice and respectful but after being rejected so many times i realized that this is not the case and that i would have to do some black magic psychological mind hacks to seduce a women and for that reason im out
we appreciate power    yeah i certainly do grimes i fucking feel you i just wish i had more of that shit more life more power i appreciate power which is why i wish i had more of it being a powerless ass to get kicked by every foot around me fucking sucks
ive been with gf for a year and a half now shes my first serious relationship first girl i had actual sex with we had bad times but overall its great but for some reason i cant help but wonder what its like to be with other women if i stay with her i will probably never experiment intimacy or sex with another woman im afraid i am missing something  how am i even supposed to know if im not missing anything i keep telling myself its just bullshit what matters is that youre with happy with her but its hard to keep focused and to be convinced    opinions honestly im posting on this thread because i feel too ashamed about this whole thing to make a whole thread about it
ive had a barely established relationship that ended prematurely due to my partner not being entirely comfortable with it and whilst ive come to terms with that he wasnt ready for one or something i cant stop blaming myself over it and if im honest i desperately want to go back to it because the time i spent being romantically open with him was some of the best times ive had and being without him has caused me to realise how clingy and desperate for human contact i am
that car is going to save my life if i cant buy it ill die
every time i go to church i return home more suicidal than i was before going
  had sex with 4 women overall the sex was all pretty much the same except for one who had issues with intimacy and the sex was more like masturbating with a 130lb fleshlight what makes the sex more enjoyable after hitting the baseline of decent sex is having an emotional connection if youre happy in the relationship and the sex is decent then having sex with a women who is better at sex wont be as enjoyable because there is no emotional connection imo
  could just be that youre attachment styles didnt mesh well    
im a sad kid
  but even if its not the most enjoyable how can i know im not missing something that would make me feel good maybe im just brainwashed idk its not just about the sex its about dating girls its about that feeling when youre hitting on girls sure its not a feeling that is that interesting or enjoyable but its great its fun it might be what youth is about im 21  im afraid all of this hits in 25 years when well be long married and i dont want to be that 40 years old divorced guy fucking girls younger than him am i making sense here is this just a normal thought of someone whos at a point where its stop now or never stop
  maybe i was always very touchy and wanted to hold hands and cuddle and the such and looking back on it theres a very good possibility it made him uncomfortable or he felt we where moving too fast idk
i dont think ive ever experienced love not even from someone elselike my parents  and i dont think i understand it even  im too densereadautistic to notice girls coming on to me until months later and due to my confidence issues i never initiate contact anyway  i crave friendship and companionship but when i have it i dont respect it at all or care for it    case in point i just moved away from my roommate/best friend but i dont even miss his company and ill probably never will until years later when ill regret not keeping in touch    what the fuck is wrong with me
  see    what are ya symptos lad  if you say ive occasionally got a headache then fuck you
  it is a normal thought you just gotta make that choice are you both happy how long have you been in this relationship
i developed feelings for a girl friend i had so i asked her out and she turned me down and ghosted me some months later i have to hang out with her and a group of friend for reasons so were back to talking a little bit she has a thing with a dude i think nothing official but the last two times we hang out i noticed she was staring a lot at me  why is she doing that why cant she just ignore me like she was i hate this feeling
  it could be but without knowing his side of things its impossible to tell theres nothing wrong with being touchy and cuddly some people are comfortable with that some arent
i genuinely dont want to bother with anything anymore literally everything makes me miserable my entire life from childhood has been basically empty i have no friends and never really did i have no family beyond my parents i have no meaningful social interaction of any kind i can make small talk with people sometimes but thats it i like the idea of having a social life and i know i need some degree of social interaction but im so used to being solitary that the thought of having to maintain relationships with people sounds so exhausting and pointless the concept of having friends is so alien to me that im not sure i should bother at this point
  i am happy but i dont know if i can give her enough im becoming distant because i need personal space for my own mental health  nothing against her im just easily overwhelmed i hope she is happy were both in a difficult time in our lives finishing college dont know what to do with our lives so its difficult to really know what is about us and what is about the rest of our lives you know  weve been together for more than a year and a half and living together since like 8 months
i dont know what to do i just want to figure it all out
  sadly i dont really know his side to it the whole thing was relatively abrupt and sprung from a fob situation which it then reverted to after he said he wasnt entirely comfortable with the romantic side before he just called it off all together citing primarily personal reasons that i dont really wanna get into out of respect
  fwb sorry
  i think i raped/abused my younger cousin when we were kids and only realize it now we are both guys and this shit happened 17 years ago he is 2 years younger than me    i had just started getting boners and cumming and had no idea wtf was going on one time we were wrestling and i pinned him down and then there was a magazine with some sexy women on it i basically dry humped him until i came then went to the bedroom to wash it off and thats all i remember    makes me cringe when i think about it now never had the balls to bring it up again to him and apologize
  personal space is important is she comfortable with the amount of personal space you need though
  23  best years are behind me    so what life is good until you are 20 and then you spend the next 50 years being miserable get your shit together dude you could spend an entire 10 years to lose the weight stop drinking and get therapy and you would still only be 33    seriously the view you have of life when you are that young is completely messed up you think that youre gonna die by 30 and everything is super dramatic however only once you actually reach 30 and realize you probably have at least another 30 years of your life ahead of you before you become old then things start coming into perspective
here is something people who defend canadas dystopian fucking healthcare system dont realize     in canada no one can afford cost of living because taxes are ramped up too fucking high to pay for healthcare this drives out and kills off poor people who literally die to pay for healthcare     the only people who benefit from canadas fucking healthcare system are the wealthy not the people they trample while thinking they get the glories of free medical care free yeah fucking right     fuck canada and fuck trudeau
im almost positive im pregnant again and im really nervous but also happy about it
  so the relationship sprung from a fwb situation it could be that he was comfortable being fwb and when in the relationship it was too much pressure and made him uncomfortable hard to say why things dont work out sometimes
  i dont know she gives me this space but i think shes forcing herself i dont know to what extent    i should also say that i am moving to another country for 5 months at the end of december this is what is making me think about all of this maybe im a bad person im ready to hear it but i cant help but think about hitting on girls there i probably wont do it i didnt hit on girls before being with her lol but i have the thought maybe its enough to make me question my relationship maybe its just normal
it is important to sometimes make peace with how you acted like a predator
im tired of everything feeling like a fucking game  i have to make such a huge effort just to get people to consider spending time with me but its so easy for them to disregard me im always hearing to choose those who choose you but nobody ever chooses me tired of wondering if it was something i said if i should have said something at all if im in over my head all of that shit
  when i was a teenager i was a criminal however with time i became a good person and now theres a fucking huge contrast in my mind that people cant understand    on the outside i look like a middle class guy with a good job who went to college and likes hanging out with friends and being a regular dude    on the inside however i am a fucking traumatized street kid that used to break into peoples homes to steal rob people with a knife get into fights sell drugs and run from the cops    im so fucking scared of telling anyone the truth and i dont think anyone would believe me by just seeing who i am so i keep it to myself how do you tell someone that you used to stab people for money and not have them run away from you
  shit   it discourages me from doing anything after that its not good behavior what the hell is it that makes me act that way is this just how i am i dont like that and i dont really know what to do about it
  maybe though after it when back to fwb he still wasnt entirely comfortable i guess i should be glad that were still friends and that it was nice while it lasted but i just cant stop thinking about it recently and with him saying hes worried about not being loved in a discord server were in together im not sure if its that the craving for the things to go back is born from bitterness or something thanks for listening to me ramble about this btw it means alot
i wish i would have the guts to kiss you and you would break up with your girlfriend and stay here for one more year and we could be together and happy and share an amazing time but i will probably never kiss you and if i do you will probably say no and you are going to leave in two months
my heart just got annihilated haha
  no problem glad to hear it helped
  lol and this is exactly why i will never date another low life again  
i want that girl
were enjoying the advent calendar this year hes adorable
yall know what fucking sucks when you date someone you get to know them break up and now you got this information about someone you wont see anymore and have to pretend you never met them fuck dating for real
  hmm just from my experience i became too distant from my ex and it partly caused the relationship to end there were things that she couldve worked on too but i think i was the most at fault i became infatuated with another girl but never cheated or anything she found out and i stopped but at that point it was too late it kinda just fell apart after that and we decided to break it off after 5 years i wish i focused on keeping the woman i had instead of wishing for someone else just my two cents
  511 is above average you can get lasik contacts or pick glasses that suit your face well you can sun tan in the summer no one cares if your pale in the winter there are chemical solutions for receding hair or you could just get a buzz cut you can still go to an orthodontist as an adult and you can work out    the jaw thing is the only thing that could be a problem but its probably better than you think as someone whos chronically mentally ill normally i never take the whole you can make meaningful life improvements stance but those are things you legitimately could change
im so tired of being trapped in canada i just want to be american like all my other cousins    i cant take this horrible country anymore
  we all want that girl
my despair comes from my family im 27yearsold and still taunted by them     if its not my dad being an alcoholic and wife and kidsbeater it was my older brother turning into an aggresive stealing nigger cultureadoring asshole or my moms boyfriend who was a narccisist that gave us debt and lowselfesteem or my little bro who also turned into a nigger tormented the family and eventually got psychoses and nobody is fucking helping my mom besides me because well why not im already fucked for life and i dont want her carrying all that on her shoulders but sometimes i just wish i could make it all disappear
tomorrow is the conference and what i want most is tonsee you at the end of the evening in the hallway locked out of your room id invite you in mine wed have a drink amd chat chat so long that we go to hed way too late and get almost no sleep for the next day but itd be worth it because we finally just talked    itd be positive
  git gud skrub
i was stalking one of my best friends twitter and learned that theyre likely bisexual i feel super shitty because if they wanted anyone to know i would know i feel so dishonest like this was so shitty of me i shouldnt have been stalking their twitter just bad feels all around and i definitely cant say anything about this to them
ajhhhhf fuckshit bitch fuck inj hate you i hafe goh i hate yku i fucking hate you fuck you fuck gkn
im gonna kill myself if you wont let me have sex
next time im bashing my head twice as hard until im knocked unconscious
why dont i say how i feel probably because im scared of being rash and ruining what i have  i just feel worse now that my gf doesnt realize she disrespected me or if im even justified in feeling so secretly shitty  watching tv  hot guy in a romantic movie  she comments on it has happened before but usually jokingly still not that comfortable with it  make a face at her  instantly feels the need to defend herself oh well youre hot too but hes on like a different level  just kind of let it go not happy about it but dont say anything  i feel like i should have stormed out of there i mean she had a break down once over the fact she thought i was too good for her so i would never tell her a different girl was hotter than her im not even being delusional i can realize guys are handsomer or have better bodies than me both things i work to improve but i wont deny it its just infuriating that she thinks she can basically insult me like that and worse that i didnt make a scene out of it like i wish i could now maybe its childish that i want her to feel like shit but i do feel like we have a different level of respect for each other or something sometimes i want to break it off and this is really bothering the fuck out of me
i miss you so much when we talked all day was my happiest no one makes me feel the way you do do you miss me too
at this point i genuinely think im banned from having a girlfriend i can explain to myself what im doing wrong anymore other than eternal bad luck in love life
  no it isnt youre just flinging a petty insult because you cant face the fact that youre not better than anyone else its quite apparent
i wish i were the sort of person people stuck around for  i wish i werent a backup friend the one that people might want to chill with if they have nothing better going on  i wish i could keep friendships and relationships going for more than three months before whoever it is stops returning texts and calls and starts drifting away
im sorry for having hurt you i love you more than anything but i know youre with a new guy who makes you happy ill always keep to the oath i made to forever and only be yours but i dont expect the same from you i hope you forgive me someday when the pain i caused you fades perhaps it never will and youll never forgive me but that is a consequence of my actions and ill have to sleep in the bed i made im sorry and ill always only love you
  actually the people i admire and look up to havent a clue about this place or if they do they dont frequent it    it isnt that anyone is better than anyone else because in essence were all equal    its a reality though that some of us vibrate on a higher frequency than others    like attracts like im done slumming it i can see that in my life now by who surrounds me in family and friendship    now im ready to take it to the next level and remember where i come from    its exciting
im about to be on my tryhard grind so things are about to get saucy
  i think most people have things like that in their childhood i wouldnt worry about it
ugh this is why i hate being as depressed as i am  moms little tinsel tree that turns slowly a light went out trying to fix it i just broke it more to uselessness and that little fuck up practically drove me to tears because the first thing my brain does is go right to oh look you broke it worst trying to fix it just like everything else you try to do    fuck this shit i was doing good
i cant lie /pol/ normies and redditors all btfo me but im just going to take my lumps and move forward
  its okay   once when i was a kid like 6 years old or so i went to some other kids house his little brother was there and when the other kid wasnt around i started beating him up with a tennis racket just because no other reason than being evil for being evil when he told his mom i denied the whole thing and got away with it
i put up such an angry cold front because i am sooo sooo vulnerable inside if i become attached to someone i love them forever if i get my heart broken it literally hurts im perfect prey for someone like him
  i used to pretend i had a penis and poke my friends with a chopstick lmao
ive really had enough i dont wanna wake up tomorrow
  best of luck to you fraulein
  if you tuck your dick in between your legs it looks like you have a pussy hehe
  thank youd
i need someone to take my pain away to hold me to make love to me it has been too long i need to feel hands on me and to cuddle i dont want to hookup with a random person that creeps me out i have tried that twice and couldnt go through with it im hoping this guy will give me some lessons and he is the right one to do this with i want my heart mended
i think that disraeli gears is a better album than sgt pepper
  yeah guys like to do that 
sometimes i feel like theres 2 different feelings inside of me and its always me fighting each side and i dont know what to how am i supposed to be whole when parts of me feel like im splitting apart
  muststartdoing productiveactivities
chances are that if i downed my bottle of antidepressants id either just puke them up fuck up my liver or fall into a coma or vegative state right
  you definitely wouldnt die ive tried before no effect but i think it mightve fucked up my liver a little
  are you my ex
  im sorry anon
im failing college mental health deteriorating
  this
now that the woman i planned my life around has left me ive been thinking of quitting school going to alaska to work and buy a cabin of some sorts
its kind of weird to think about you sometimes because i know we were together for awhile and talked all the time it was the most codependent shit ever couldnt go an hour without texting    now i feel like i never knew you and you seem so foreign to me like i dont get how we ended up together it doesnt make sense    i wish you well but im glad as fuck to be away from you
i need to stop reading here i must make today my last day
i miss my dad so much i really dont know how im going to live the rest of my life without him i watched high fidelity today and it was brutal on my heart
im working on myself   i dont know which makes me feel worse my partner falling for another girl in his new weekly meeting or hurting the guy i wanted and found in his absence i dont need this i need time away from both and all males a bit probably none of my girlfriends are readily available when i am and i struggle to make new friends while sober which ive been attempting to stay my hobbies can be very isolating it gets easier right just keep going
they told me you are just holding on to your anger  bitterness youre still living a self destructive path and kind of digging your own grave with shit apparently youre slowly chipping away at the shit you need to get through but you have a loooooooooooooooooong ways to go before the blindfold comes off and you can actually look at reality    i was also told youre not with anyone now if you were it might actually help you in healing    its wild man all of it
  why whatd you come across that you thot it was for you
just leave me alone please
im sorry i didnt answer your text today i just didnt want to hang out when we chilled yesterday you were so distant and it seemed like you were kinda annoyed by my presence like you wanted to be somewhere else ive never felt like that around you and as much as i tried i just couldnt reach you you wouldnt come back to me and when i dropped you off and you were talking about all the things you had to do it was like you left before you even left i felt so dejected when you got out then you want to hang out again today why why would i want to subject myself to being frozen out like that again just a day later nah its good deal with your shit then get back in contact with me
  i doubt anything is for me
  you should mind your own business
when i leave this time i will never return i cant do this again it will kill me
  true is it too depressing to read
  probably but im a curious sort
i really want kids   im scared of waiting for you to be ready  i love you so much but what if you change your mind  life is like that sometimes  if you leave me what do i do then  do i find someone to marry and have kids asap i dont want his kids i want yours if i cant be by your side then its all pointless  at the end of the day even if it kills me inside waiting is worth it  please dont leave me hanging and then abandon me
  it begins tomorrow now theres no way im no going to make any mistakes but if i never stray from the principles i will still be successful just gotta focus on getting as much shit done as possible
  the only woman in the world id ever have children with left me i hope you never have to deal with pain like this sit your man down and have a real discussion about it
  hah cute  you know hell only see you as cold and mean right  because i did that kind of act before and it backfired tremendously    you can redeem yourself right there right then in front of him or expect him to shrug you off as you keep up the act    i wouldnt recommend keeping up the act it will hurt and you will have problems

  ugh hell i even sound like her here this shit does this to you you know im usually so goddamn goofy and optimistic life of the party type but she justruins me when i take her anywhere i have to actively avoid looking at her to be fun and entertaining and have a good time after so many ruined things her not wanting to do anything but then getting mad when i go off to do things because she wanted to toodumping emotional problems i cant fix on me constantly and lately shes been harassing me in ways that are just completely unnecessary and embarassing shes sucked out all my motivation i used to be so confident but im just in so much goddamn pain and she hasnt left me alone since we got together she insists on so much goddamn time together im losing my mind and myself to this shit my wit is dulled and the feeling that life can always be made to work isgone not gone but impossibly obscured i feel like ive wasted this year i have to get away i dont care if i dont have anyone else ill make it work i just want a happy life ill still have all my friends there for me
i hated myself so much for what i did to you that i lit the back of my favorite hand on fire i didnt plan it or anything i just pulled out the lighter and did it for a ng time too l cant believe i did it at all it was like a blur things only blur like that when i feel really angry and my adrenaline spikes i really and truly must have hated myself so much   i hated myself so much that i hated myself for crying over my poor hand that i knew would never be the same i didnt think it was going to be forever and at the same time i did i marked this hand in fucking fire onpurpose so id have to see it every day for the rest of my life and remember how horrible i was to you part of it was a cry for help and part of it was me trying to tell you how much i was sorry and how much i meant it nobody would hurt themselves that much if they didnt really hate themselves and a huge part of it was just me hating myself that much and honestly wanting to hurt and scar myself forever and to remind myself if it every day and taint every day for the rest of my life with it because i fucking deserved it   ive never been that cruel to anyone or anything else in my life   i lit my arm on fire too just to make the point and i hated myself for screaming and crying over how much it hurt to lay there with that wound these scars are fucking hideous and that was the point i wont say it wasnt for other people to see at all but it was for me i wanted myself to know that i felt neverending regret for hurting you as cruelly as i did and for treating you like my dad treated me i wanted to punish myself for being stupid enough to take all that out on you
i cant even be honest with my therapist    she thinks im a loser though
  what hair treatment costs that much
im close to giving up again but i dont want to
  not sure if youre there but dont theres always better in life
  the reason why i dont seek therapy is because i have trust issues i have no trouble being honest but i have an awful time opening up because of past experiences i cant trust anyone
i was supposed to be someone  the me of 3 years ago fucked up so hard i dont think i can recover    i need to take my adhd meds again but if i do i will shorten my lifespan and be miserable the whole time    im just all out of hope i can talk the talk people want to hire me but i cant program well enough to meet their expectations
  i was 19 and stupid thats some of the most selfindulgent selfpitying emo bullshit ive ever done in my life and i hate myself for how cringy and pathetic it was that i did that but im also in awe of how horrifically cruel it was that punishment was so cruel to myself in its intent that im astonished i could do it on impulse and without premeditation   i know it worked because it still hurts the whole point was to make myself look at this ugly fucking scar every time i looked at my dominant hand for the rest of my life and feel regretful it totally worked because its almost 7 years later and im almost about to cry over it   i cant believe so did this my hands used to be so beautiful everyone used to remark on what beautiful hands i had when they held them and i set it on fire onpurpose to make it ugly forever and my hand really is going to be ugly forever because of this god im so sorry i want to apologize to myself but i hate how selfindulgent and selfpitying that would be   thats it im finally crying over it first time ever
amy is so indifferent about everything and it makes me so fucking paranoid we know each other online plan to meet next year and she always shuts down whatever i say we should see a movie when we meet idk well see do you think well break up by then idk well see we should have sex when we meet idk well see well more likely than not to nothing then yes jesus christ shes so ambiguous about everything unless its about something i dont want to hear she clearly doesnt fucking care but she wont say it i dont understand if you realistically think we wont meet then just tell me that so i dont have to be excited about it its so stressful feeling like she isnt equally as excited even if we do meet shes doing it for me and not for us fuck her ive never been successful with women and it fucking sucks im resorting to waiting a year for someone across the country and that may not even happen
  i dont know  i should be sad that were done now for real  but like ive been like mentally preparing for this exact moment for like 3 months i feel relieved  we never were in a relationship i knew both of us felt something for each other and that eventually you lost the sort of romantic feelings towards me i hated how it still felt like we had relationship issues in a friendship the way you treated me and expected me around was nothing youd expect from just a friend we both know that     i was sick of how everything in this relationship was on me if there was a problem it was on me it was always me who never tried even though the last 3 months i wanted you to show once you cared instead you took me for granted and the second you see me talking to another girl you end up all jealous and angry    funny you always did say you didnt feel anything for me in that way that i would just be a friend    and now that i finally figured out how to talk to other girls again youre jealous  im the bad guy  fuck off fuck right fucking off fuck that    i love you i still love you right now as i type this horseshit but you never made it easy for me to love you you always rejected me i kept at it slowly small gestures but i was obvious and you knew i always felt something for you but the past 5 months it felt like i was dealing with a brick wall like we could only text each other in person its like we dont know how to converse   if you had some kind of feelings for me why the fuck would you always put it down like you had no feelings at all especially when id clearly say that youre who i care about youre who i dream about    honestly i had fun flirting last night not infront of her but it was nice conversing with a girl that somehow feels natural to chat to like theres already inside jokes between us and a chemistry    shame i was flirting to your new bff the one i introduced but hey  i feel relieved at the same time as i feel sad
  so many red flags at once   went to hang out with another guy  talked shit about me  went to a crisis center to prevent killing herself    i have seen this before shes just manipulating people dont be her idiot anymore she wont kill herself she just thrives on empathetic people     shell rip you off for money on the divorce though hire a good lawyer
  she got quoted for 9k from bosley hair transplant      theres more than those 3 but yeah its bad
  definitely drop her
i guess you need to be honest with yourself one day and see the patterns in all your relationships of the past youre never content youre never committed youre always arrogant and dont appreciate what you have its your life though good luck with that as i wont be in it
i dont want the last thing i write to you to come from anger you hurt me so much over and over and i really dont know where to put that pain now or how to heal im going now you will never hear from me again i love you and i will always love you
  what makes you not want to give up      why cant you recover      you can improve yourself to make yourself more attractive      good on you
  why cant you recover  ive been three years as a neet after graduating and my productivity is so low
  ah fuck you sound like my ex i miss her so fucking much it makes me cry please give your so another chance love like that is once in a lifetime please talk to them after things have cooled down months may go by but please patch things up with them again
  thanks man still super confused whether to be sad that shes gone out of my life or be optimistic for whatever comes next    god i really am gonna hate the fact that im definitely never gonna be putting a ring on that finger cause her dad is a true badass
found out grandpa has terminal cancer  told a week later my contract isnt getting renewed at workfirst job still live at home and main source of income for the house   have been sending in job applications emailing places making calls every day while still trying to manage my savings and wanting to spend time with my grandpa as have always been super close with him and i know he doesnt have long left    i have no fucking clue what to do cause no employer seems to get back to me and im near the end of my savings and its been months now
  be optimistic one door closes another opens all that shit that time you were with her can be put to other things things that you want to do
  well it doesnt seem like that might be the career for you then i thought i was good at something tried something new and its working sorta
be at work  qt comes up and asks a question  answer it and then some  sometimes some small talk starts happening  boyfriend comes swooping in    this happens semi often even before the small talk what the fucks their deal
i just realized im a tsundere haha yikes i should probably fix that and be more politw to a pretty girl that likes me
  i dont know anything else i can do though
why are the girls on 4chan constantly lusting after guys with gfs i need to get me a bitch also so i could cheat on her kek
  same here bro i tried being a normalfag for a couple of years but that only made me more depressed im just a natural hikki with no identity
man i am alone useless and sad
  people are social creatures you neanderthal
im an idiot who gets overly emotional and burns bridges with people who genuinely care about me must stop this shit
  have you tried woodworking trucking coding
  she never wanted it to be over she wants you to stop being an insecure trash human accusing her of cheating just because she has guy friends all couples have friends of the opposite sex they spend time with its healthy bitching about your partner to anyone instead of just talking about these things and maybe doing more to make her feel wanted and less lonely if youre insecure about other guys she will feel your withdrawal and get lonely will just create a larger gap  she needs a guy who can regulate his own emotions and talk about problems like an adult good luck
  im so proud of and amazed by you o you got this
i was just jokin around but i was wrong i tried to be polite about it but the toxicity was way too much you should sort yourselves out so life will be much happier i know i have and i dont want to ruin it over hs level drama
  coding is the thing im struggling with
  women can abort even if you want the kid    you can leave even though they want it    seems fair to me
  yeah i got caught up in this for a couple years and in the past 23 months ive been actively avoiding it and its been extremely beneficial im happier get a long more and am getting more actual work done
im the mechanic  im supposed to fix things  i have all these tools  all this intuition  all this skill  and yet still everything in my life is broken  my cars  my relationships  me  nothing fucking works right
  it might not be for you then how about a server administrator even though help desk is shit at least its something i did help desk and i liked it because i talked to a lot of people and went to people and saw what they did
  cut out the relationships part and everything else will be 10 easier
  im too old for help desk  im good at managing projects just not great at executing the actual code    i just dont know how to get into management without being a low level coder first
  i was talking general relationships with friends and family which ive mostly neglected to the point of being nonexistent anyway

michelle i need to fuck you once so help me god  i wanna drink your fat juicy tits as i ram into your giant motherly labia  you are such a delicious little morsel for me i probably wouldnt finish you in one nibble  god i love you  just once if we could ever fuck for an entire day would i die happy and pretend to be in heaven
missed out on preordering this guy today and now im feeling depressed and unironically want to die right now
schizoid virgin in my late 20s  no desire to form human contact or socialize  still want a girlfriend  no clue how to get a gf without being social  my grumpy nature will scare off girls anyway
  dont worry about it its just plastic you could always ask someone to 3d print it for you or order it when its in stock again good luck anon
why teh fuck parents dont understand i need financial support now for my studies and not the day they will get old and die theyd treat me as if im a lazy ass when i had shitty jobs best grades in college got scholarships and i fucking treasure my savings like a pro  its not my money i know but whats the chance to get a successful carreer if i dont invest on it now
you guys arent assholes at all    youre just politeness impaired
  i know something you dont
  you guys have stretched your resources so incredibly thin trying to catch me that you didnt even notice your empire falling around you
  dump her
  you dumbfucks really dont get it     its not me you have to be afraid of its what im connected to
  too much of a hassle for fucking placebos    clearly a trap they have nothing inside them and when they do they are either mdma or ketamine     ill kill you mother fuckers soon enough
    i was like it was little lies in the past and i couldve called her out on it but i never did but yesterday basically we were gonna go shopping and we had to get something for her parents afterwards she was getting visibly stressed i told her to calm down were going right now she had said the mall closes at 8 i check online at a red light while were next to the mall im like babe no it says it closes at 9 we can still go and without missing a beat she goes no i texted my friend who works there they said theyre cleaning up we got to her house and outside and we talked a bit cause i wanted her to calm down before we went in with her parents i said you didnt even text your friend did you and she said no with her tail between her legs i was like i just want your honesty etc she said she was sorry i love you and we went inside at night i elaborated and she got upset i said there are other times i felt you were lying to me but i didnt want to say anything cause shes a shitty liar thats why shes mad at me right now     perhaps im too blunt but i dont see what i did wrong
  have you asked her why she does it
i gotta stop smoking weed and drinking and being retarded on the internet and streaming shows and start studying and taking care of myself and doing chores   man this is bad i think im getting emphysema
  good luck making things done is a lot more rewarding
i dont get it you guys constantly say this isnt working and weve gone too far    but then you just dont stop you keep attacking me you keep torturing me    you tell me we are going to give you your meds but then where the fuck are they the times my dad lets me have some he later gets angry and says he had no idea which is a fucking lie and it doesnt matter anyways because they are fucking fake     you tell me to be squiet to shut up but you give me no reason to you keep attacking me you keep torturing me there are a thousand ways you can get me what i want to me but you guys just dont then you drug me with other shit that i dont want or like and are all youre welcome    let me fucking go assholes this shit has been going on for way too fucking long now
why is making friends so easy for everyone but me  lectures at start of year  no one knows eachother   no oppertunity to talk during  leave   next lecture   people somehow made friends and formed groups between the end of the first lecture and the start of the second   how after a few weeks even the obviously shy/awkward ones have friends what are they doing between lectures that im not
  maybe you leave too soon when the lecture is over or you tried arriving 10 or 15 minutes before your lecture
so i basically want to know how to ask for help im currently more depressed than i have ever been i think about suicide every single day and now i actually think i might go through with it thing is this is the first time ive ever felt the urgent need to get help i never wanted people to think lesser of me for it and i never wanted to show just exactly how vulnerable i am im terrified of being trivialized or scoffed at as a person i thought about getting prescriptions under the table to somehow mitigate it im at a point where i have no close friends and pretending to be jovial or just not unhappy when around with people especially the ones i know feels like i have weights strapped to me theres nothing less charismatic than a man who can never smile or even joke around about stuff it just drags down the mood of anyone i interact with i really think my life could improve immensely if i just got some respite from the pain but i just dont know how to express that i need help and that its not a joke

  have you considered taking some normies with you when you off yourself
  find a therapist money doesnt matter if youre dead so just go to one any one     if youre offered antidepressants take them even if you have preconceptions about medication take the help preconceptions be damned they also dont matter if youre dead so you have nothing to lose     depression is treatable and after a while you will likely be in a position to reevaluate medication if you start taking some  but listen to the advice of a professional     asking for help is the first step  and you did so here so you are already on the right path just keep following it
  fuck  i cant think of any elegant/smooth/controlled way to do this  but i think luckily its one of those things that doesnt have to be done right asking for help is letting go and plunging into an uncontrolled fall doesnt have to be done right just has to be done and then u hope for the best   i rarely ask for help and when i do it feels a lot like giving up and doing something wrong but as it turns out its usually pretty easy and uncomplicated and goes ten times better than expected
ive been feeling lonely lately when im not studying or working i usually just go to the gym plan future trips and lurk 4chan i have a few close friends who i keep in contact but we live in different areas and only meet up once every few months im not close with family at all    id like to have a girlfriend but ive been burned twice so i dont think thats an option
  you might not be ready for it yet after getting burned but really you can only fill that space in your life with a loving relationship friendship is important but as you all move into adulthood the time you actually spend together will be less frequent get closer with your family too that can help but at some point when youre ready you will have to just take the risk again and try to find a girlfriend
  i cant get a girlfriend again tho i dont want to get screwed again
  you can only fill that space in your life with a loving relationship     indeed  but there must also be trust a hard thing to find in the world    that hole in a mans soul will only be filled when he accepts jesus christ as saviour until then only temporary solutions will pain for a time    to be safe for all eternity  a admit that you are a sinner who violates the will of god and that you need a saviour  b believe that jesus christ son of god  messiah died for you sins and rose again as prophesied and recorded in the word of god trust in his finished work  c call on his name ask him to save you and confess that he is lord    some resources that may help  ttborg has a verse by verse bible study for download or daily listening  chuck misslers learn the bible in 24 hours   robert breakers bible study and topical sermons     the end is nigh tomorrow may be too late
  huh
  i understand i know the feeling but you will have to get over it eventually if you dont want to be lonely not all relationships end in heartbreak people make it work and you could too
  well i feel my situation is unique i dont want kids its something im very serious about as you could imagine that is not a popular opinion especially when it comes to women but i had somehow managed to find 2 girls in the past who had both told me right at the start of dating they didnt want kids great same goals both relationships were pretty good one lasted 25 years and my last was 15 years what happened well after we became very close and formed a strong relationship both of those girls slowly started to throw in the phrase oh when we have a family one day they would make it subtle i would notice it more and more so in both instances i asked them directly if they wanted kids and both responded with oh anon youd be a great father boom fucking years of effort and investment i put to have really good relationships wasted getting close to someone is a big deal to me ive been lonely most of my life so ending something like this destroys me i cant go through this same cycle a 3rd time
  how old are you why are you so determined to not have kids
  30    because i seriously dont want kids i dont like being around them
  ignore this fag accept the darkness embrace the shadows

no advice friends
can i learn how to program at home and get a decent job i have been learning javascript online and i imagined if i get good enough could i be hired by some company do i need to take some kind of proficiency test to prove that i know the stuff
  2nd year computer science student here op also curious about how to get a job
  im a comp sci graduate but i had many professional jobs before uni in web development now im looking towards more oop lang jobs  i taught myself how to program html php css javascipt and mysql which is what you need to get a web dev job those sort of coompanies will hire you but you still need your own experience ie a portfolio of projects youve made while freelancing or just to practice  more advanced programming jobs will require a comp sci degree of some sort
  yeah i learned programming completely at home from what i found on the internet about 6 years ago since then i havent gotten any certificate or a related degree and yet ive had two jobs in related fields the first as an actual programmer and the second a more general position in which making tools is just one of my obligations
  if you get really into it you can get to a point where companies will want to hire you once youre comfortable with an initial language start a project and add it to github or join an opensource project on there and try to contribute even if they dont use your contributions you should still be able to learn from this by looking at the code they did accept if you can create something useful/provide important/significant additions to other projects you can show that too hirers as evidence youre capable
  does my project has to be something very inovative or is it enough if i solve some kind of relatively hard problem      did you just go there and say hey man i know how to program and stuff or did they give you some kind of test to solve
yo anons  21 come from a 3rdworld country never done university have a high paying job and moved to the 1st world     a portfolio  you know how an artist has a portfolio you need that we are creators this is a creative job have a github companies want passion i hear a lot of people saying i am supper passionate about programming and dont have a single line of code outside their job i dont need you to create an entire social network just make something that you are passionate about and make it into code     a good tech stack  javascript is good heck i work with it but you need something else have something to complete that python is easy it will show you are capable of making apis and whatnot  i always get asked gimme a project that i will be able to show and learn from it  that gets me a good amount of experience    grab any news site make an api get from x category n articles and return the title  date and contents  tools  flask selenium  based on that make a classification on the category of any given text via api  ex  text cannabis has been under strict federal prohibition in the united states for more than a halfcentury yet the government has been able to profit tremendously from it  albeit indirectly  via black market shipments made through the united states postal service usps  categorylaw  politics edited  tools naive bayes classifier flask edited  then  generate keywords for that article and use them to find an image in any site you like via apialso as an api  tools flaskrequeststextrank algorithm    hard mode  investigate how to do a recommendation engine of these texts get an article and return similar articles  tools up to you docsim might be usefull
  i feel like this is very helpful information but i didnt understand much of what you said  thanks tho i will look into what you said
  tldr   have a portfolio with things and ideas you find cool   dont be a one trick pony learn something more than just javascript comapnies usually try to save money by hiring multifunctional developers javascript is the frontend maybe getting something like database knowledge or backend
yes it can be done in my experience there are two ways you can get an it job  finish a cs degree get an unpaid internship prove you are good/hardworking and get offered a job its how i got my first job  no cs degree but you have a great protfolio/did freelance work how some of my friends got a job  obviously its gonna take some time if you have no formal education but if you keep learning and making stuff you wont have a problem landing an office job at some point
why are all my friends becoming one and why do they scare me
  because theyre bouncers
no they are normal security
  why are all my friends becoming one  because theyre loosers  and why do they scare me  because youre a pussy whos too scared to attack one with a broken bottle if he looks at you the wrong way
do you really need advice on this
ok thanks for the advice    and yes i needed advice on this
  to your first question because its a job  to your second question i dont know
i feel like i can be both very introvert and a very extrovert guy both things helps me a lot but in some moments that i want to be more extrovert i simply cant i cant raise the voice in a class to ask something in some cases i tend to blush my face when i talk to a girl eventhough i feel like a quite handsome and fit dude even with a guy eventhough im straight in some cases with anybody this does not help me i feel like my shyness is making me be a worst person that i could be i could be excellent in many things but this stupid thing is hard help please
  this is a straight renaissance painting of words   the embodiment of the human experience everyone
christmas party with work is thursday  i said i would attend both minigolf and the dinner afterwards  found out last week that the meal is at 8pm while minigolf finishes at like 515pm  everything is prepaid    would it be rude of me to attend minigolf i plan on smoking outside for most of it and then swap our secret santa presents then say i have a headache and go home    its organized by normie females and the whole thing is just going to be overwhelming i can tell
  going to minigolf  skippib free food  youve got your priorities all backwards here boomers i swear
  well i didnt know golf was so early and dinner so late i dont want to go to either i just didnt want to be rude but forcing us to get into work at 830am and then stick around until 11pm is depressing and id rather go home asap
  why are you such a fucking weirdo
  what do you mean how am i being weird i get drained quickly in social situations
  dont go you retarded melvin
hey look its another anon making a thread about being insecure how original    i need you guys for this one to start off i never had any approval during my childhood or teenage years my dad didnt really give a shit about me and i was a social outcast most of the time i was pretty fat and bad looking never had any interactions with girls at school and didnt have many friends either no hobbies no nothing i felt completely worthless and i always saw myself as unlovable   when i got about 16/17 however it changed a bit i gained height lost weight had to change schools and made lots of friends there and was quite popular and had girls showing interest in me also ive met my first and current gf there and were still together     now to the part where i need advice how do i deal with being so terribly insecure i might have changed but my personality has not i feel like im hideous and i dont even understand why my gf would find me attractive i love her but i always think that im not enough for her whenever she talks about a guy i get very jealous without any reason i constantly think that shes going to leave me even if there are no signs showing this whatsoever
weird flex but okay
  are you gonna help or nah
for me anon id try not to think about it too much sometimes youre mind overanalyzes stuff it happens first thing you can do is relax ive had insecureties too but i also found that actively trying to improve something you are insecure about really helps too
  yes as stupid as it sounds not thinking about it helped me but sometimes i just cant ignore those feelings then i get overwhelmed and start crying it just doesnt work
   look its another anon making a thread about being insecure how original  why even point it out youre not clever
it comes down to selfknowledge and gaining confidence anon     while not in the same boat i can feel you in certain areas     i would suggest first gaining selfknowledge understand your childhood trauma and how that has affected you over the years learn how to come to terms with this and how you can change yourself for the better through this journey you will find where the insecurities are coming from and where in your childhood it started i suggest watching/listening to sefan molyneux steven franssen coach cory wayne hes more on the dating self knowledge end cory waynes book how to be a 3 man is amazing as well     next i would suggest you start slowly overcoming your insecurities hit up /fit/ and start going into the sig threads self improvement general usually in /pol/ start hitting up the gym it might not be easy at first but this after time with enough momentum will deff help you with gaining selfconfidence     all these things i have used myself its a long journey but once you start you wont want to stop and the process youll see will be worth it    best of luck to ya anon
  god do you have to shit on everything      thank you anon
so basically i almost had a thing going with a girl i really liked back in may but she decided to stay with her bf    fair enough but i liked her enough as a person and wanted to keep in touch so i have a party coming up and i thought i had invited her via email but i dont see her email on the guest list now i want to send her an invite but i dont want to do so if she already got one and just doesnt want to show up and deleted the event    what do
  have you kept in contact since then or is this kind of an ice breaker
  she has a bf dont be a shitty human being and move on
  not for about two months and we had a mini fight
  then i would say move on anon its better for both of you
what do normal people do when theyre bored and want to meet new people  i know the meme answer is clubs or hobbies or whatever but my college doesnt have anything extracurricular at all and my hobbies arent all that social not to mention the fact that theres fuck all to do in my town
  literally anything they break the routine and admit to themselves that the pattern of instant gratification youve become so used to is unnatural unhealthy and unrelated to reality
  my college doesnt have any extracurriculars   i very much doubt that   my hobbies arent very much social  unless your hobby is watching paint dry in a dark room i very much doubt that theres no community for your hobbies     unless you live in rural alaska or something similar there are people your age you need to go out and make the effort to talk with people you need to seek social events you need to leave your comfort zone it isnt hard but if you dont make the effort you will never have friends
  fuck you too then      college having no extracurriculars  having searched both official websites checked message boards and spoken to my pdc im pretty certain theres fuck all outside my classes its not a university its a british technical college  hobbies  sure but its not like theres an easy way to find out what to do from what i can tell theres only pubs shops and a shitty library in the whole town looked in brochures and travel sites about it and theres nothing that really interests me  hobbies are vidya and cars id like to get into something like wh40k as ive some experience with scale model kits and i enjoy the lore but doesnt seem like theres anywhere around here that does that i dont really have the money for it anyway  rural alaska  worse rural england i dont even live in the nearest town i live a few miles outside in a shitty village i have friends but we dont all live that near each other and everyones busy with work and shit im an actual sperg so ive got no real idea of how to seek social events as you put it
usually just meet people online through games or online chats in general in real life though its just a matter of finding your way into conversations and stepping out of your comfort zone
  irl is my main concern literally how am i supposed to find my way into conversations
why is it so hard to let go of the outcome and tell the truth i broke up with my ex a month and a half ago and have been dating this nice girl for a bit it has gotten kinda deep with her but i still am madly in love with my ex broke up because of long distance and the fact that i wont be able to see her in more than a year i know i should stop seeing this girl and tell her the truth that my mind and heart is filled with my exs memories and love but im a damn coward and cant bring myself to tell her am i being a complete fucking asshole right now
she has a butterface but her tits look ok pic related is her tits    the fact im not really attracted to her face makes me wonder if i should do it or not
blue board but yes go for it
i keep reading people saying that they masturbate 34 or fucking 6 times a day but i cant do it more that once a day    what is wrong with me is this normal    i am circumcised do you think it has anything to do with that
i can do it 16 times in a day if i try
  your dick might be broken or low t
  actually youd be the most normal anon around here in terms of faps per day more than once is indicative of other underlying issues
  it might have to do with circumcision  more importantly why do you need to fap more than once usually ill spoil myself on a day where the missus is out all day and ive got the couch to myself but thats like one day every 90 days ill get to throw myself a fapstravaganza and thats more because i can than anything else
i also smoke do you guys think that this can cause any significant problems with erections
  i also smoke takes a bit more effort to get it up these days and when that happens id hit the pavement and pump iron
  i didnt mean weed but cigarettes marlboros
  theres nothing wrong with you nigger whoever said to you that he masturbates 6 times every day is the one with dick issues
  i smoke more than a pack a day and am the one who can jack it 16 times im also 32
  ye been smoking reds for 7 years now kicked my weed habit last jan
  fuck off from this thread you annoying unhelpful cunt
  he just basically said that the smoking may not be as relevant to ops issue cunt
  why do you need to fap more than once  not that other anon but i fap at least twice sometimes thrice a day or more and i used to fap much more  it has something to do with being a lonely piece of shit that never interacted with a female at 25
  theres no help for op unless he goes to see a doctor
op why do you wanna orgasm more than once anyway who are you competing with
  i just dont think its normal that i cant do it more than once a day i mean i sort of can but it becomes a chore the second time and i dont enjoy it as much and it doesnt get as hard as the first time im 20 yo
  im not op but my girlfriend sometimes wants to have sex more than once a night and it comes in handy then
  youre not supposed to masturbate that much one or two faps a day is normal
  you are supposed to be able to though healthy people are capable of exerting themselves beyond what they normally do in a day
  heh im  and  btw 21 y/o     when someone like  says they can jack it 16 times thats usually not consecutively yes its possible but as youve seen its pretty hard to do lol     my personal record is 12 i was 14 then with an awful lot of time one weekend even then that was spaced out over a 3 hour period so like 4 faps per hour shit     anyway it helps if youre really fucking horny till now i have problems looking women in the eye cuz my eyes dip down to their breasts its hard functioning maybe i oughta pay for a hooker one of these days i still average 4 a day if im feeling productive       if only men didnt have refractory periods
  im  and 
  so smoking really does affect erections then damn defiantly quitting now
  perhaps yere burnt out 
  yeah thats 16 times spread out pretty evenly over a day
  if only men didnt have refractory periods  yeah but its normally under an hour not a day like op
  op should be happy
  shit thats how its called  fuck i have always had long refractory periods ever since i started masturbating i dont remember i could ever masturbate more than 2 times day even in puberty this shit has me really worried
  maybe im desensitized to porn since i started masturbating really young or circumcision made me desensitized    without porn or any other visual or auditory stimulation how many times can you masturbate a day just picking it up and stroking it with your hand without even using your imagination
  bump answer this
  maybe twice been limited to once a day lately cuz of school im also circumcised btw and ive been fapping steadily since i was 13 i get lulls now and then but thats more out of stress than anything even then i still manage to jack it to avoid whatever it is im supposed to be doing     i cant call myself desensitized either anytimes a good time to fap for me i think starting next year though ill skip the selfservice and lose my vcard to any willing chicks on tinder ive been playing with myself long enough
  are you single     hubba hubba     ill keep you busy and put those 16 times to go use 
  i dont smoke and im not circumcised i cant fit in more than one sometimes two but then its really sore the next day  this is normal
  age max you ever did
wtf 16 12 i do it 2 times a day my record is 5    and i wish my sex drive was lower because thinking about sex can be a waste of time
  i also only fap 1 time per day but thats only out of fear of going bald
  op for fuck sake dude  are you worried that people on 4chan blow more cummies on themselves during a day than yourselfare you serious
  dont care about stupid 4chan fags that masturbate 16 times a day but i dont think its normal for me not ever being able to masturbate more than once or twice a day
bump
  anon youre perfectly fine masturbating once a day actually thats a little too much you could do less  its the other anons that are deranged
  youre good masturbating several times a day is a curse its such a weird problem to have you cant talk to anyone about it because its gross and embarrassing but even if you could seek help how is anybody gonna stop you from masturbating
if i like a woman and im around her my libido goes through the roof and when i get home i have to fap several times and not only thinking about her     when im not interested in anyone or im not outside around women i dont fap that much maybe thats what happening to you
  maybe i dont know but is has always been like this
  /thread
you dont sound like you have a problem my boyfriend and even myself get fatigued more than once a night except for the odd occasion
  that sounds like a healthy amount do you actually want to have to do it several times a day if so why
    have yall ever had an orgasm id cum all day if i could
20 i can do it 16 times a day like the other guy dont even need porn in fact without it i can finish in as little as a minute but when i have it i can take as long as 20 minutes anyone else here like this anteater btw
yeah thats odd but me and my gf fucked 4 times in one day just a couple days ago my legs feel like theyve been doing nothing but squats for a week best workout session ive ever had
i fap once or twice a week couldnt care less
  i am circumcised do you think it has anything to do with that  yes and protestant america is responsible we can close the case before assigning it to detective hitler
hey adv/    why does everyone in america decide what to do with their lives around cash    i feel like a weirdo following that which fills me at a personal level while juggling my finances while everyone around me looks at my desired field of competence for the money    where could one find people who appreciate less material things in life
halp
i guess i got lucky in life to not be born a burger and to mostly have classmates thus friends who arent materialistic feelsgoodman
  why did i have to be born a burger
  where are you from fucker
hey dude i feel that except i live in aus and were not as intensely materialistic here we dont fight over shit on black friday we wouldnt really even have black friday if it werent for you weird cunts    id say look to any kind of sustainability communes or communities as well as fulfilment letting go of materialist values is a good environmental move so maybe you could go on that path otherwise all your minimalists are essentially that    id give you more advice but couldnt be bothered
    fuck off retard  you act like there is some kind of noncapitalist sanctuary     move to denmark oh do i get a fucking house for free  no     niggers like you make america seem like 1984 when the whole world is in the same shit    life is shit in america i am in the same fucking boat but lets not pretend that anywhere else makes a difference  you want to live well fight here fight now  you wont so i laugh at you    the french are revolting now so why arent you
  i hate materialism as well and health care affordability i hate that to take care of myself and see the doctor/dentist for treatment i need to live i have to stress so much over whether i can afford it and how ling i can wait to see a health care professional before its horribly bad
  suck my dick idiot ill meet you outside wtih molotovs and lighters
  fuuuuck    why are so many people so blind to see that most of their misery is due to their love for huge tvs status and ridiculous vehicles    imagine if instead we spend it on things that make life meaningful and prosper like healthcare arts culture music education science and what elsewhat else
  i agree you know what things id spend money on good food and a real cozy bed not high tech cozy real soft and fluffy bunch of pillows comforter because i really value sleep and i like to cook and i take pride in making some thing delicious
lol get a job you incompetent commie fucks i wish i lived in america so i did not have to work since the age of 14 you dont have to buy cars and tvs if you dont want them dont beat the rest of us over it
what should you do when you dont want to do anything anymore
lift weights and call your mom
  take a vacation
i smoke a cig around once or twice a month should i stop cold turkey or should i keep doing it i really enjoy the taste and smell
  once a month when combined with good dieting and excercise is fine desu having 2 beers after work for 7 days straight is equally as bad
  just dont do it that probably wont get you addicted but its ultimately not worth it to smoke because it really sucks beijg addicted

my boyfriend of nearly 8 months have started noticably ignoring me and talking to me less and less as time goes on when i try to communicate with him about how it makes me feel hes quick to blame himself and give empty sorries as he doesnt try to change im starting to feel like im becoming a burden with always worrying over us and trying to make things work    he says he still loves me but those i love yous are slowly dwindling and i want nothing more but to rekindle stuff i see him soon for christmas and ill be with him for 2 weeks whats something i can do to help things a little    i know it seems like a lost cause but i really love this guy and i want to at least try to make things better
  give him good sex
  i get rejected at times real confidence killer
  your boyfriend doesnt want to have sex with you
  lose weight
  wew i am currently dieting and losing but if i lose too much ill be unhealthly underweight
  fatty cope
  maybe hes just depressed is he going though rough times because of school or work is he dissatisfied with other things in his life  in the end youll have to talk to him about it
  a few times ive been rejected kisses and sex but maybe if i worse some sexy lingerie it would help get the juices flowing
  he started streaming full time so that might be on his mind with trying to keep numbers up talking is impossible with him though since ive tried many many times
  ive been rejected kisses  thats pretty dire i wont lie
  youre his girlfriend you have the right to talk to him what the hell
  he doesnt want you anymore
  thats the feeling i get but he occasionally shows he cares and its really fucking with my head feel like one day we are fine and happy and the next i have to compete to get his attention
  he tried to say its because he didnt wsnt to make out in front of his friend during our last night together at twitchcon never stopped him before
sounds depressed he might just need some time likely not a whole lot to do with you and though you can try to talk about it and make suggestions not something you can fix    id suggest easing off and lowering your expectations in the shortterm  youre not going to snap him out of it by saying just the right thing or trying to get romantic at just the right time    how long has this been going on   do you have any mutual friends that you talk to and have you discussed it with them
  thats reasonable see how it goes in the 2 weeks youll be with him
ask him to meet for a chat if he cant give you good reasons or explain himself then thats neglect you deserve at least a this is not about you i just need some space and time for myself right now it can happen
  streamer    twitchcon  are you fucking with me what did you expect from a manchild
a few weeks ago i started dating this girl and weve really hit it off and every one of our dates has been an absolute beauty of a time    shes smart super funny edgy and really sweet her parents are good people just over protective and controlling but apparently shes dated some assholes in the past she told me yesterday that her last boyfriend groped her and even hit her across the face and it made me really upset i told her that she can tell me anything since her parents dont listen and i know that beneath the angsty humor is a lot of hurt i have issues of my own but so far ive been dealing with them without hurting anyone and i have told her barely 10 about them    how can i be a good boyfriend to her without coming off as disingenuous i really care about her and want to make her as happy as i can
it sounds like youre doing a good job buddy just keep it up
  im happy for you anon keep up the good work and just remember to stay honest and dont let the bad shit keep either of you down
tie her to the bed and rappel out the window with her tv
  thanks amigo    im not letting bad shit hold me down i just worry sometimes about her well being since she used to cut shes the sweetest girl ive ever met and youd never tell just by knowing her
  i swear my friend has that exact same stove     anyway op be careful with her youll be surprised how little abuse can affect people in reality but boy is it juicy bait for attention just make sure she actually needs help and isnt manipulating you for free attention reading your post sounds a teeny bit like a hero complex but dont worry just a bit
whenever i try to talk to my friends outside of school they always say theyre busy or they go offline i feel like none of them actually care about me until they need something
i have a big problem    i have ocd and there is one thing i particularly obsess on and that causes me the most grief i have a feet defect that has been progressively getting worse nothing can be done apart from surgery and im seeing a top doctor in june i think about it very often and check my feet every day looking at my ankle testing the ability to jump looking in my legs in the mirror etc such compulsions take a lot of my time in the morning its worst in the shower because i get to see my bare feet im often late because of it    im starting a job now and im afraid how ill make it without being late and also i worry that people will think im weird if i cant control my compulsions at work i have walked to and fro in a mall before staring at my legs in the glass im sure it looked weird not to mention the obsessions and compulsions cause me a good deal of mental distress sure my feet might be getting a bit worse but even if im not exaggerating its no reason to be tormented with anguish 24/7    what do i already take antidepressants and ive scheduled therapy
  it sounds like youre beyond the point where anything a person said could really help you time for behavioural intervention or surgery
  you need to stop doing that
  surgey  wtf like lobotomy
  youve got to be kidding me this is what ocd is like i do the same things not with feet though do i have ocd wtf i thought everyone did this how do i stop
  i think being occupied with something in this case my new job will divert my mind from the obsessions to a degree im just worried ill be coming in late or that people will think im weird  also paradoxically when another issue occupies my mind for instance when im worried about my balding the feet obsession doesnt cause me such constant distress    yes in my case its 100 ocd so if youre doing similar things with the same obsessive intensity that i do you might want to get it checked
ask me anything havent done one of these in a long time used to go on 4chan about 10 years ago when i had no life in the mood to shoot the shit and talk about life     25/f/us
  can we see them titties
  any questions that makes me believe you are 12 masturbating to pokemon will be ignored
  no id be banned this is a safe for work board
  post deleted   weird   i guess its true what they say you always come back whatve you been up to in these past 10 years
  sfw titties then
   is thataway 
  yep the ride never ends you always come back eventually   whatve you been up to past 10 yrs  working dating getting in to shape creating art and not going on 4chan
  get off 4chan you fat bastard
  that you in the pic
  no ive been told i look similar to her  does anyone have like advice questions
  i should try that i dont think i could ever leave long term though id get bored
  how do i convince my friend that fallout 3 is actually a good game
  yeah howve you found contentment in life
  thats just an excuse you wouldnt get bored trust me excelling at life is more fulfilling then browsing memes all day
  i dont think i need any advice from someone who looks like pic related you sure you dont need some
  sure how long should one pursue a woman who both said that they will never be upset at me asking them to get together as well as is seeming ghosting me like is this a challenge am i just being an asshole trying to get in touch every few days background wed been going out for a few months so its not like im trying to score the first date and cant take a hint
  im not good enough to excel at life im trying to get better
i want to give this girl i sort of date blue balls for me any advice    had sex many times  younger than you  last couple of months  if she wants to come over i dont refuse  we sleep and have sex  if i want her to come over many times she refuses   cant help it to refuse her  thinking about starting to refuse a few times even if i have no plans and blue balls    would that work to shake her up a bit  i feel like i am being played by women games   apologize if it seems like i am trying to trick her but you do it unconsciously anyways and fuck us up
  share your life with someone and share love and work hard    pic related is what i uses to look like when i was younger
  just move on and see someone else
  yeah if you resisted her a bit and showed her you have other options that would definitely ruffle her feathers to take you more seriously
  what steps do you have to take to do those
  you seem like you have low self esteem you should work on bettering yourself and if its meant to be it will happen    anyway peace this is boring /thread
  adios
25/f/us  so  why would i need advice specifically from you its as useful as asking a question to myself  sage
    where do you live exactly    what are your political views    why do you think you deserve an ama thread
i want to have sex but i dont really want a serious relationship and im behind on the learning curve because some stuff happened that stunted me what do i do
    sell me this pen in 2 sentences
    how did you lose your virginity
  youre gay if you dont buy this pen double gay if you dont reply
  realize casual sex leaves you feeling as hollow and purposeless as masturbation and feel bad  you can take my word for it or use tinder for a few months and regret not listening on top of the regret of having used tinder
  thank you dont make another thread like this please
are you a thot
  but it is not todd new vegas is way better
im lucky enough have a lot more opportunities than the average person but i always let them pass me by because i lack aggression its always been this way i remember that back in high school my parents would force me to apply to jobs at supermarkets and i would just sit there in the car having a panic attack because i didnt want to annoy the manager by taking time out of his day i actually chose my current university specifically because of its coop system where you submit resumes electronically and then the employers select students for interviews allowing me to gain work experience without approaching anyone now im nearing graduation and its time to start applying to masters programs but it still feels so presumptuous like im not passionate enough and dont deserve a reference from any of my professors despite having the highest grades in my year im also good looking enough to have women throwing themselves at me but they inevitably get frustrated when i fail to act on any of their hints things are actually at the point where i have women handing me drinks as they say youre too cautious and i still find a way to mumble and leave alone im pretty much convinced that alcohol does not work the same way on me as it does on everyone else   i think a big part of the problem is that i think too much everything thats supposed to come to people intuitively is something that i have to think about and it feels dirty in a way im clever enough that ive managed to surpass normal people in some fields like public speaking and telling jokes but in areas where analytic thought is actually a detriment im completely at a loss     im really afraid of becoming the bitter old man stuck in a job that hes way overqualified for who never took a chance and wound up alone
  some advice for you  use less text  people will read your text  they will give answers
  you sound very similar to me   what helped me tremendously was starting lifting at a gym it makes you more confident and willing to stand up for your interests
i only have only a close friend    me and my roommate get along very well and since she does not have many friends i introduced her this friend    now my friend had to come in january to see me im in another city to study but my roommate invited us to a new years party    i do not know if i will be there and he has accepted and he said that he will not be able to visit me genuary because he cant always come this far and well probably see each other in april    i feel cut off every time people end up preferring someone else to me    ps he does not like my roommate im pretty sure about that
have you ever tried that im thinking of trying it but im not even through the first uni semester i think i can take it but not really sure  if im doing it in the spring break im going to have to do it while i work most likely in a kfc or mcdonalds kitchen so is that going to be a problem  also if i did it right before the exams would it be a problem
fuck niggers
  just eat healthy no fastfood no processed shit    why is this so hard    you go starving yourself you will fail
i have a lot of experience water fasting for extended periods 34 days day 1 isnt too bad but day 2 always sucks ass as your body no longer has carbs protein and fat from the food you eat before the first day eventually your sense of hunger disappears which is pretty cool    you must be very careful though with water fasting as youll need electrolytes the most important ones are potassium magnesium and sodium   magnesium personally helps me with soreness while fasting i cant fast without it    if you dont consume enough electrolytes and dont drink enough water you may very well pass out i almost fainted 2 times and it sucked ass     just stay hydrated and properly supplemented and you shouldnt have any issues besides well the hunger
  adding on to my reply i just read how you will be fasting while working stay extra hydrated while your moving around a lot hydration is of paramount importance
can i actually starve myself to death with this method
when your poor yeah get a filter so it tastes better
  no
  need electrolytes  no you dont ive fasted before and never felt those symptoms   ive heard of people feeling faint but you just sit down a moment and then youre back to normal i really dont think you need electrolytes     one time when i was fasting i took a pinch of salt at the 3 day mark and it just ended up making me super hungry i mean more than before
  why
why is slitting your arm the least successful suicide method is it just because of the people who do it as a cry for help/attention or is it actually hard to end your life this way
  they probably dont go deep enough and the wounds are able to clot assuming it was a serious attempt the blood is very dramatic making it a great cry for attention in a nonserious attempt and finally i imagine some selfharm cases among kids caused parent freakouts that became accusations of suicide no evidence for that last one but it seems plausible to me
because faggots latched onto this method like a bunch of freebleeders on a synchronized period its not suicide its recreation
    deeply rooted selfpreservation instinct prevents people from cutting deep enough or they otherwise miscalculated the effort/depth of the cut as a result the blood clots and flow stops or slows down before enough blood is lost to cause death they just pass out and become too physically weak to finish the job someone ends up finding them and the next stop is hospital
  is it just because of the people who do it as a cry for help/attention  probably its also one of the more reversible methods and being so dramatic many people might be scared straight as soon as they see whats happening and call for help like most jumpers instantly regret doing it but cant really do anything about it by that point whereas slitters can    as far as where the statistics come from i read something that if a survey asks have you ever attempted suicide theyll get a certain amount of responses but if they ask have you ever attempted suicide with the intent to die that number is cut in half because like you said a lot of suicide attempts are more cries for help the person might genuinely feel like they want to die they might not care whether they die or not they might do something legitimately likely to kill them but while thats still suicidal its still different from a staunch attitude of this is it theres nothing beyond this moment for me and only an outside force could prevent this from happening
  i attempted to kill myself but not with the intent of dying women
man something always fucks up    my girlfriend and i have been dating for a few months she asked to take things slow so we did havent done anything sexually until recently i really started to fall for her hard shes a pretty amazing girl we recently just started having sex    the problem is she can barely take any fucking cock i guess she has a lung condition where she has problem with air capacity and she struggles to even take the head when giving a blowjob but its not just limited to that she cant handle rough sex at all and by rough im not even talking bdsm stuff just it has to be very slow all the time im so sexually frustrated right now    i feel like she tricked me into falling for her and not telling me about these issues and how it would affect things what am i supposed to just never enjoy another blowjob the rest of my life just really frustrated and i dont see any way for these things to ever improve
  she sounds cute as fuck
  men are fucking monsters
seems like youre real focused on yourself here man this relationship is already a mess
    yeah how dare you enjoy sex you monster
  this desu
one to three inhalations and then rinse the mouth thoroughly    ignore all those who say you only focus on yourself you only want sex and so on  sexuality is an important part of a relationship  also if its a medical condition you should really question her morality for hiding it  what if she hides other critical stuff  now its just a breathing problem next time its aids
  every single man
  i feel like she tricked me into falling for her and not telling me about these issues and how it would affect things    hi anon nice to meet you i cant deepthroat cock
  dude go look up tantric sex if she cant go deep maybe she can go long remember youre making love her not jacking off once youve got that in the bag work with her on her medical issues it sounds like something where patience will pay off for both of you
    now lets not be stupid not asking for seethroat ability just normal basic bjs
    that sounds like some astrology bullshit talking about colors of aura and shit fucking qi points and meridians and chakras and other stupid stuff
  yeah dude skip over the newage crap the point is to slowfuck for a few hours instead of fastfuck for a few minutes if you cant weed through the newage crap skip right to feature length japanese porn its basically the same thing
i bet u dont even suck her clit
    not every woman can fucking take that    she cant take that sort of stimulation it has to be through the hood it look some exploration but i can make her orgasm through oral every time now
what is going on here
garbage thread
      what exactly about this is cute
hes a bright and romantic but reserved guy who watched his parents go through a nasty divorce told himself hed do better than them and then basically never manned up to well even kiss a girl fast forward 35 years and you can add to that a severely ingrained narrative of being the quirky but not romantically interesting guy who miraculously failed with such a fundamental thing as having sex all while highly functioning in all other aspects ok evidently not highly functioning but you know so youll understand hes scared that somethings fundamentally wrong with him which absolutely kills me because hes a nice fucking guy who just happens to have an aptitude for being reserved and isolating himself i asked him if he wants his first sexual encounter to be with someone he wants to marry but no hes fine w/ a one night stand hes just been too shy  me im a 22 y/o female ive always been into older men but am not interested in leading a relationship with a big age gap because of the inevitable problematic dynamics ive tried it ive known said guy for a week and weve spent three nights walking and talking until dawn we talk about all sorts of stuff that people who connect or fall in love talk about except im not in love and i wont be and with an entirely cool head i can say for sure that i dont see how we could possibly have an healthy relationship with his relative lack of experience social as well as sexual id just havee too much power but some experience with me would be a step in the right direction for him rright anons    also kiddos dont fucking isolate yourselves its the only way to guarantee youll remain virgins     tldr should i a 22 y/o female snatch the virginity of a 52 y/o socially crippled romantic mainly to show him hes not undeserving or would it somehow be wrong
if i were in his position i would keep my dignity and refuse the pity sex
  also kiddos dont fucking isolate yourselves its the only way to guarantee youll remain virgins  dont tell me what to do    but some experience with me would be a step in the right direction for him rright anons  its too fucking late hes 52 hell never ever have a healthy relationship ever and you fucking him will probably make him feel worse long term some guys just arent meant to succeed
  also this dignity is an important thing for a man
  this seems ok to me as long as he understands that you are not sticking around  t 24 y/o virgin who isolates himself
  also kiddos dont fucking isolate yourselves its the only way to guarantee youll remain virgins     seriously fuck you and that useless advice     unlike most of the dudes here who have never tried and never will in my teens and twenties i tried really hard to go out and meet people i went to dance clubs concerts bars meetups took classes even went to a few fetlife munches but im too shy too scared too anxious i was always the quiet one who would introduce himself and not say anything else or just walk around the club again and again sometimes i was noticed and laughed at in the club i finally gave up at 27 im 29 now and hopeless utterly hopeless i thought exposure would help me teach me how to act and change but here i am my twenties are over     also yeah fuck the guy let him feel desirable for once if only once
  how would it be worse for him long term when you say long term do you realize youre saying possibly for the rest of his life and do you realize that may be 40 years i know we sub30s tend to think 50 y/olds are basically dead but in this day and age theyre really really not sure theres a thousand things its too late for him to change but theres still a thousand things he can do to build a betterthanmiserable existence         also i want to respect the dignity thing now weve already talked a lot i think its safe to say hes lost some dignity just looking me in the eye and telling me all this stuff about the involuntary celibacy should i just stop talking to him altogether asap to minimize dignitydamage or can i rob him of all the dignity i want as long as i only do it by talking with him or is it maybe bizarre to claim he has dignity to spare by not fucking me
  it would bring him some experience but the modest shy and inexperienced mentality may as well have seeped too far into him and it may not do much for him other it of course being pleasurable not really resolving his issues
  i think you should have sex with him solely on the basis that you are attracted to him its the only way to be respectful if you sleep with him to make him feel better thats just sad
  id agree with you but i actually found him really attractive until i found out he was a virgin at which point the attraction was dwarfed by various other emotions   so it would be sort of ironic if i followed your advice non
he could have easily found a prostitute if he wanted to during all that time you seem to want to have sex with him out of some kind of pity but he doesnt need pity really you are another succubus trying to corrupt this good man leave him alone
    if you are going to do it i suggest you do it proper make it a teaching experience and some quick thing have him rent a hotel go to dinner first and so on     i hired an escort service for that purpose and i dont have any regrets and i was/am 28 everything was in the open and it actually made everything better and more relaxing
  good point w the prostitute i thought about that too i think ill ask him why he hasnt seen one and take it from there the way i see it im basically a prostitute to him except without the money and with some conscience and care so a prostitute but better whats succubus about it if were open and honest
  fuckin helvete  oh man sex is overated af stop being bonobos and just treat sex like any other pleasure experience in life  if both agree just fuck goddamit
  the way i see it im basically a prostitute  good to see im not needed here  enjoy whore please do update us when you have a nervous breakdown after he rejects you
  go for it its your choice just make sure he knows its a one time thing and doesnt mean youll start a relationship  it probably wont change his life but im sure hed be really happy about it
  how would it be worse for him long term when you say long term do you realize youre saying possibly for the rest of his life  yes i realise this he has reached 52 without having sex because he has fundamental issues he has spent literally decades failing to overcome this happens when said issues are so deeprooted and serious theyll probably never be overcome im not saying its impossible but it is highly unlikely  what you are offering him is akin to pity sex even if you were initially attracted to him as per  giving him pity sex isnt going to fix his mental problems at all and i believe it will leave him more miserable long term your favour wont give him a meaningful relationship it wont lead to regular sex for him either except possibly with you until you move on at which point the drought may continue for the rest of his life    youre not a saint offering salvation from his sad existence youre someone offering a dying man a few drops of water
  prostitutes dont count because theres no validation  t 27 y/o virgin who would rather be a 52 y/o virgin than resort to prostitution
  i know i know its very little i was just wondering if its worse than nothing     i was hoping thered be agreement among the replies but i dont see it right now i think its appealling to decide to just talk to him some more about it and let him decide for what its worth i know he finds me attractive and that he just hasnt dared to make a move the closest he got was to shower me in compliments and reach for my hand with severely trembling hands and squeeze it ever so delicately and then let go i think i know what that means    id also want to discuss the potential emotions that can arise i just dont feel very confident that ill know how to handle the emotions that may come ie what if hell decide hell want to commit suicide if i dont stay with him forever i know ill do what ever i can for him if thats how it goes its not that its just that id really like to hear it now if you could tell me that theres a 99 chance that thats actually how it will go
  the closest he got was to shower me in compliments and reach for my hand with severely trembling hands and squeeze it ever so delicately and then let go i think i know what that means  thats cute    its just that id really like to hear it now if you could tell me that theres a 99 chance that thats actually how it will go  i cant offer any odds either way im in a similar position to him but almost half his age perhaps at 52 i will think differently unless what youre offering has a chance to lead to a genuine relationship i just dont see it helping him though however i could be wrong
hi op as a trained psychologist and older gentleman myself i highly recommend against doing this unless you can firmly establish with him that this is merely sexual practice and not meant to lead into a romantic relationship considering his probably very distorted views on sex and relationships id say youre walking on thin ice and you might damage him more in the long run than help him    what might be a better option for you is to help educate him on women and relationships maybe help him meet other women and serve as a sort of wing woman you need to start from the ground up with this sort of person before jumping into sex and thinking it will help him
  at least prostitutes get paid     i have a mother who is as sexually free as you if youre going to be doing things like this please dont have kids
  thankyou thankyou thankyousomuch i didnt really realize until you said it just now but i think with the affirmed very distorted views on sex and relationships it does make a lot of sense to go very very slow and make sure to talk a lot before establishing if sex is a good idea and if sex is a bad idea id really like to act wing woman and try to be a friend acting a wing woman i think id feel ever so slightly jealous but id feel a billion times happier to be of help    weve established that we view love differently but im not sure that he thinks im any less romantic than him i think one of the things we should establish is whether he acknowledges that he can mean a lot to me even though i dont want to marry him
  ewww whatta fuck anonette even thinking about someone dude being 52 and a virgin grosses me out so much that i nearly puke how can you even consider that for srs girl get a grip
  i think he deserves someone better matching than you if its just for sex hes better off fucking a prostitute which he wouldve done if he didnt want any more meaning to it
thottie wants to take away a dudes warlock powers  every time
fuck this shit hes 52 theres no point in trying to train him to be more outgoing and romantic with strangers please have sex with him you will bring so much joy to his disappointing life anyone acting like pity sex is a bad thing is not a virgin ive had sex exactly once and it couldve been better but i sure as hell dont regret it and it definitely didnt make my life or mental state any worse
i dont think hes actually a virgin i think its just an elaborate strategy he uses to trick women into sex
  i havent read a lot of responses in this thread but it seems full of vitriol    im as much as i hate to say this probably as close to this guy as you will get there im in my early 30s and also a kissless virgin   i am not stupid or defective i had a rough highscool time factors out of my control as a man i was proud and shy the two combined made me unwilling to compromise and as things went on well it became more awkward to say that you were a 20 something virgin so now im who i am an old virgin a man needs to seek out a partner if he wants to have one and i havent for just about 10 years now    if you want to ask anything im very drunk in vino veritas
yes  t 52 yr old virgin
if you dont fuck him i fucking will lmao insecure old virgins are hot
  fuck off dont try to steal his powers
hes a bright and romantic but reserved guy who watched his parents go through a nasty divorce told himself hed do better than them and then basically never manned up to well even kiss a girl fast forward 35 years and you can add to that a severely ingrained narrative of being the quirky but not romantically interesting guy who miraculously failed with such a fundamental thing as having sex all while highly functioning in all other aspects ok evidently not highly functioning but you know so youll understand hes scared that somethings fundamentally wrong with him which absolutely kills me because hes a nice fucking guy who just happens to have an aptitude for being reserved and isolating himself i asked him if he wants his first sexual encounter to be with someone he wants to marry but no hes fine w/ a one night stand hes just been too shy  im 23 oh dear fuck do not let this happen to me
   as a man i was proud and shy  and now youre an old virgin and its too late to be anything else how much of an idealist am i to insist that youre the sum of your actions so the second you have sex you can toss that identity right out the window how deeply does kissless old virgin tie into the rest of your life is it synonymous with having no social life no interests a dead end carreer and a mind thats constantly occupied with what went wrong before you became adolescent the fuck is going on here
  this he wont have his magic anymore
  i was going to say how could pretending to be a 52 year old virgin a winning strategy     but hes about to have a 22 year old fuck him so its something ill keep in mind when im that age around young women
thats cute you would feel really special when you do if i was a woman id probably do it     you know youre going to be the most important woman in his life forever until he dies will be a burnedin image of you your name his love for you in his mind     heh you got me picturing it in my mind looking down at him near the end of sex and watching this desperate man start cuming inside you looking in his face feeling his body tense up him inside you knowing how good hes feeling and how bad he wants you kinda hot desu
  youre undeserving of those quads degenerate tripfaggot
anyone who says she should not give him sex are traitors and should be hanged if he had dignity then she wouldnt know he was a kissless virgin do it op
  you are lighting the fuze to a dormant bomb  also no real man is going to want a used up slut later  work on fixing you
havent read thread    my 2c is that i think its a great thing that you want to do op to help out another person like that    however i would say that there is a phenomenon in human nature where the psyche can imprint/immediately fixate on the first romantic context they are put in if the mind has not been exposed to that for a long time or ever i would say there is an 8090 chance he will get attached/develop feelings from the encounter    i wont say to do it or not do it just to keep this in mind   its possible to navigate through this scenario if you are aware of it      kiddos dont fucking isolate yourself  as an excyborg i personally attest to the truth of this however the kiddos line is condescending
  quirky but not romantically interesting guy who miraculously failed with such a fundamental thing as having sex all while highly functioning in all other aspects  aptitude for being reserved and isolating himself  christ thats me so ill be a virgin at 52 as well    never manned up to well even kiss a girl  its not a matter of manning up its a matter of being romantically unlikable
just fuck me instead im not a virgin but i can pretend i am if thats your kink and dont tell my gf
  only if he pays you
  you dont really know him after a week he might be playing you whatever you end up doing a condom is a must my advice is not to do it
  just say hi brah
  your vagina isnt a tool for saving people the fact you think your pussy can liberate him and somehow improve his life is bizarre disrespectful and disgusting     learn some self respect and stop hanging out with people 30 years your senior creepy as fuck
  ymmv but i am so much happier single than ive ever been chasing girls people in general make me tired and if i didnt need money id be more than happy to just chill in my apartment alone getting wizard powers in a month
  this is the only sound reply itt
  you have the viewpoint of a child sex is extremely important especially for women
  i dont know why you get all the hate  i do think a lot of anons make good points  it would be pity sex and while he might say yes and look forward to it after the rush hed might feel like shit its hard to say  start out with the prostitute conversation  if you get inclined in offering him the sexperience make clear that you dont have feelings for him and for something long term   dont worry guys are naturally more adept to fucking without caring  and when you offer give him like a week of reconsideration so that his dick doesnt do all the thinking leading up to it
op here update   mailed the guy asking how he was doing  he replies hey name lets face it this didnt work out sincerely name  i dont know whats going on here either i read him wrong or hes in the process of demonstrating how to stay kissless  reply hey i dont have a clue why you think thats a good idea but im not looking to force you to explain though id like it if you did or to do anything you dont wanna do i just got two things i still want you to know 1 i found you attractive 2 im sorry i said you mustve been good at isolating yourself i didnt acknowledge all the time you spent not isolating yourself   no reply think about him a lot because whattheactualfuck  write again politely apologizing and adding why i didnt make a move though id wanted to and how id thought we could meet again and  move on to the next base   he replies half an hour later confessing to being hopelessly in love but he quote thought you thought it was a mistake    m y  d u d e
    only read the tldr    this is easy do you desire him do you feel attracted do you actually want the sex     if yes then yes if no then no you dont have to have sex for pity or charity
  oh you have him hooked hes just timid
  thank you for your following peanut butter maybe ill post how it goes either that or ill spook a friend with it not sure which i prefer
now im curious     how many partners have you had by the age of 22
  have sex with the guy holy shit do your bit
failed with such a fundamental thing as having sex all while highly functioning in all other aspects     by the way being shamed like this is why incels have shot up places and will continue to do so in increasing numbers
  have sex with him nothing is more empowering than sex for many men and if u really wanna go for gold fuck him again and make him learn ur body
  fuze the size of bomb  also gd isnt real jethro
  bitch you fucked up your chance to fuck a fucktard
  pleeeeease let us know
  i actually wouldnt put it like that but he did himself and i thought it was pretty key to painting the picture that hed painted himself then again my default is to say hes been unlucky and im starting to understand thats probably not one bit better    ofc were gonna go slow im not gonna be counting whether we get rid of the magic powers one hour sooner or later  i was thinking about asking he how he wants it and if he says idk im a virgin ill take my time to show him everything and let him feel everything and probably let him finger me so he knows what hes getting into and maybe tell him very explicitly what i expect from him like for example that id really rather not have a mechanical pornpounding so you know ill try to be educational and tender not to mention how much time im thinking will pass before we take our clothes off i dont think its unrealistic that ill have to hug him for an hour before he stops shaking     i think you read it wrong theres basically a flickering golden neon light flashing to be continued at the end of that
  let this virgin alone he will never satisfy a women hes weak and cant reproduce do you know what happen when you can reproduce  you dont have any descendant and thats fine because its natural selection     weak die strong survive     and youre weak to help a weak      dont reproduce with this bastard     but hes so kind and lonely hurrdurr     its not your fault that he cant handle a pussy let the nerd alone
  cant
  hes hot though  also its not the first time ive approached a guy who wouldnt have approached me in my experience those guys have had a tendency to be much better guys than the ones who have had the balls to approach me  confidence / greatness
  i told you fuck with me not some virgin come on why ruin another mans life and keep me blue balled
btw watch and learn kids  this is how women practice their power over you  this whore acts all surprised the poor sod confesses herimagine 50years no women nobody says i love you ever talks with him flirts with him    women do not have a soul so stay on your toes their holes are heaven their mind is hell they will take a shit into your heart at a whim of thought if they think its entertaining or beneficial for them
  not him but if you had trouble picking girls in hs/college you are fucked later
this is pretty lol id initially assume that this dude was just lying about it in order to get laid but hey lets give it the benefit of doubt    lady do you know how powerful saying no to a bitch is like  you think that hell jump at the chance to fuck you because there is no way hed turn you down especially because he hasnt ever had sex but no  you cant have him and your brain must be frying
i got a copy of red dead redemption 1 for my ps3 and never been able to launch it whenever i try i get a flashing black screen and it returns to the home menu on the ps3 does anyone know how to fix this
  its a disc if that helps
is there any way to actually see who viewed my facebook profile and not just some fake app where it randomizes
  no
i know there is probably no possible way to effectively increase your sense of humor but i still need to get better at giving witty comebacks or jokes/one liners or at least being faster at it  i was only ever good at sarcasm but i fucked my brain hard enough so that even these braincells would die off
how the fuck do i learn to carry a conversation im learning not to be a sperg but this shits hard
  bump
dont think too much about how they feel about it just keep topics relevent talk about stuff you like or start liking stuff that you think would be good conversation material
bump
been there before i practiced a lot with a girl from university until i became comfortable then i cave manned her ass and two years later we are still together and thinking about marriage and kids and all that cheesy shit
i need a outlet for my anger its fucking me up big time im just angry and unsatisfied all the time  i want to beat someone up
  ever try mindfulness meditation     helped me immensely   running helps me as well even though i suck at it     what exactly are you angry about
  start lifting brah
  what exactly are you angry about    i dont know im just frustrated and angry
  well the first step to stop being angry if you truly want it is to find out what youre frustrated and angry about specifically
i read anger management for dummies and it helped me a good deal
there are ppl outthere socalled moneyslave on this community there are guys how like being beat up by grill on boy
so ive had issues with my stomach for a while nothing major i guess sometimes i bleed a lot from the ass when taking a shit this time at the end i got a kind of funny feeling in my chest not painful and when i rinsed/spat into the sink there was a red tinge in my saliva  also i have the hiccups now    should i be concerned i dont have any money to see a doctor
definitely go see a doctor if you dont have money then either save up or find another way to get checked that doesnt involve you paying
  if anal blood is red it comes from a hemorrhoid or other cut near the anal opening  annoying possibly painful but not lifethreatening if the blood is dark almost shitcolored see a doctor quickly
if you regularly have blood come out of your ass go see a doctor
  red blood can also mean sth life threatening
  i dont know why people think  hey let me go ask /adv/ about this  when  go see a doctor  should always be their first reaction i know in some terrible countries that can be expensive but usually theres also a cheap/free clinicy sort of option for these kinds of questions where you can get a good answer from a professional instead of some randoms on the internet
the only women who find me attractive are old ladies 65 and preteen girls what does this mean
  whoa are you me
  it means only people who either havent learned or have forgotten standards of attractiveness call you attractive  welcome to the club
i have a good amount of friends and theyre really good they know when im down and they dont like leaving me alone and this stuff but even with friends who care about me i cant stop feeling lonely and like a piece of shit  its like im the last person they will remember for anything and maybe thats not true but sometimes when i just sit and take a long breath i think im the most lonely person in the world
and can anyone explain to me what the purpose is of penis size mocking and how do i know if im small average or big and what are the social the consequences of having a small penis
  take a standard toilet paper roll put your erect dick through it  if the head pokes out the other end fully and the roll fills out quite nicely you are good to go    penis size is something many men are insecure about so both women and men can use it as cheap ammo if they really wanna hit the mark  not sure what you mean by purpose
  well its so mainstream it must have some political ideology behind it
  you need to get off this website you crazy sperg  whats the political ideology behind bouldering gyms those are pretty mainstream right now right are you absolutely retarded  for real get the fuck outside and talk to real people asap you aspie clown
  projection 100 virtually the only reason an adult will put someone down is to throw attention off themselves alternatively is theyre just caustic in general but do care but thats not gonna fall in here with the topic of penis comparing    its what people do to feel better because a lot of men are so vapid and shallow that those five or six inches of dick are all they have and are    im almost 30 and heres what ive learned never ever underestimate how pathetic people will be in order to escape themselves
  these are objects not culture norms
  no i think its deeper than that it must have something to do with feminism i think
  pretty much a cultural norm for young people to go do sports  whats the political ideology behind that   trotskyism or what   fuck off you are insecure about your dick many men are  i am starting to suspect you dont know what a political ideology even is
men are insecure in their masculinity  fucking good is a big aspect of masculinity  people think you need a big dick to fuck good  so having a small dick means youre not really a man    pretty simple
  its too controversial i think and men are the victims and also the perpetrators are often women so there must be some underlying political ideology that regulates these types of behaviors
  if you seriously think that people were not absolutely obsessed with dicks right from the point where their brain could even formulate the thought then you need professional help
  yeah but why do women need to be so mean then and treat small dicked men as if they are rapists or pedofiles or something
  i just dont understand why am not allowed to live because of my penis size
  i notice at least on the internet a good deal if not most of the mockery comes from other men
  underlying political ideology  its called the most primal and basic foundations of human psychology  men are obsessed with our dicks we have been from the dawn of time  why not spend literally a nanosecond of thinking before formulating your moronic little theories
  yeah but why do women need to be so mean then and treat small dicked men as if they are rapists or pedofiles or something    either its them being superficial like guys who rate every facet of a womans appearance or they dont like the guy and know making fun of his dick is a brutal own
  because you are acting like an insecure creep due to shocker your crippling and quite frankly unhealthy complex  seriously see a therapist
  can anyone explain to me what the purpose is of penis size mocking  to hurt your feelings  and how do i know if im small average or big  howlongismyshlongcom  and what are the social the consequences of having a small penis  virtually none unless you date a heartless bitch even then people will likely assume shes lying
  that just looks like a natural rock formation is it actually a carving of a dick
  less of a political ideology more of a cheap method of insults
  i know i just dont know how this is beneficial in a developed society    i know that dick have grown large due sexual selection i just dont understand why people are so mean towards small dicked losers    so it socially acceptable for women to use weird insults towards men     yeah im insecure and i dont understand this type of toxic culture of dick shaming      why are sexist misandric slurs allowed then in the so calledpatriarchy
  why are sexist misandric slurs allowed then in the so calledpatriarchy    theres no contradiction patriarchy enforces a rigid concept of masculinity making fun of people who dont fit that concept is part of the patriarchy
  so small dicked men are the deplorables and need to die is that it
  how is that anything close to what i said did you think i meant patriarchy was good
  no i mean according to the patriarchy its rules
  why are sexist misandric slurs allowed then in the so calledpatriarchy  because we dont live in a patriarchy you mongoloid
  matriarchy would indeed make more sense since everything is so male unfriendly and pro woman
  yes kill yourself dicklet  you need to be 6 feet and have at least a 7 inch dick to boot to be considered a man  otherwise you are just a joke figure to ridicule  it was shown by scientists that your kind has the evolutionary benefit of being a jester of sorts which means other stronger males would not kill you since they didnt perceive you as a threat and you were amusing them and their harem of females  if one of these guys got lucky they could coerce or trick a female into getting impregnated by them before they could realize what a huge mistake that would be and therefore continue the line of small dicked manlet jesters
  its not that they need to die its just that in asserting you place in the hierarchy as a man its useful to tear down other men
  this is cuck fetish    but having a relationship or sex is not allowed if you are lower in class within the patriarchy
  we dont live in a matriarchy either you mongoloid
  but having a relationship or sex is not allowed if you are lower in class within the patriarchy    its not an iron clad law its a set of social norms obviously plenty of small dicks guys are in relationships
  no im not mongoloid you are denying the existence of small dick shaming because you are cowards and dont want to take responsibility for your toxic behaviors
  how long is small dick mocking fun generally is it permanent or temporarily
            reread this chain of replies and tell me im denying it
  this is cuck fetish  you did not understand what i was explaining  small dicked short men are at an evolutionary disadvantage obviously when it comes to sexual selection  therefore they had to adopt a different strategy  they had to appear nonthreatening to the stronger more virile men both physically and sexually so they would not consider them competition read not kill them  then the beta male could impregnate an unsuspecting female since the alpha male did not pay any attention to them and had a plethora of females to choose from  those guys were your ancestors  of course women were not happy to carry the inferior offspring so they developed an evolutionary response which is why women are repulsed by small dicked manlets and ridicule them  the only way you will ever get to sleep with a woman and only if you are one of the lucky few dicklets is through trickery and coercion never through genuine attraction  but who knows maybe there is some slag out there desperate enough to overcome her genetically programmed disgust stranger things have happened
  its pretty fun  call a man small dicked and you will be astonished at how he recoils how injured he is how he suddenly shrinks back ive been found out
  what if his dick aint small though
  why would you make fun of a big dicked stud  that doesnt make sense
  unless youve seen his dick you dont know what size it is
  they treat small dick men like rapist     where and when has this ever happened  get off /r9k/
  big dicked guy will be unaffected by mockery instantly attracting the female thats doing the mocking
  not that anon but i honestly just smirk when someone says i have a small dick its like calling a tall guy a manlet
  kek at the goebbels reference
  no i think its deeper than that it must have something to do with feminism i think    lmao or as the kids say these days kek    youve just summed up modern 4chan in one single sentence      probably because its funny i have a somewhat average chode and really it doesnt matter much if you have a smaller dick if a girl sits there and talks with you and flirts with you and brings you to her place and whatever and youre making out and youre both extremely turned on and just want to fuck and then your pants come off shes not going to be like oh my god what is that hahaha im sorry but come on that penis is slightly smaller than average oh my god im posting this on instagram right away    shell just be like eh sure why not    me and my medicore penis have gotten laid with dozens of girls    maybe if you actually have a micropenis or chronic dick cheese or a real fucked up circumcision or whatever else then yeah she might laugh at you and tell you to get out but other than that its really not a big deal
  me and my medicore penis have gotten laid with dozens of girls    you probably have a big dick and think its average from watching porn
  this is your mind on 4channel  we all need to abandon this site fast lest we become like this anon
  i hear newgrounds is making a huge comebcack we can all go there and pretend that nothing happened between 2003 and 2018
  oh my god what is that  i only have my own experience to go off of but i think youre more likely to get this kind of negative reaction from being above average than below youd be hard pressed to find a girl whos genuinely that cruel
  ive only ever seen one guys dick in porn that was about my size and all the comments were from other averagesized dick dudes saying how they finally comfortable watching a porn video that didnt give them penis envy/insecurity    i have a chode and i know its a chode even girls that i was with if we were in a deep relationship and started talking about exs and whatever id be like so hows myd dick compared to so and sos and theyd be like well it is large
  fair point actually not a whole lot of girls are into getting their cervix herniad out from a monster cock even if it looks good in porn
  supposedly even touching the cervix can be excruciatingly painful and people are complaining that the prejudices about penors and vagenes result in a lot of unwanted painful cervix pounding
  i know im just saying youre only gonna get that kind of visceral reaction when it comes from a place of legit fear not mean spirited mocking
  this op you have a serious warped sense of pple giving a shit about your junk get help
  guarantee if you are like this with people that whiny selfpity is infinitely more off putting than your dick size could ever be     you are making stupid ridiculous claims about people being cartoonishly awful because of your immature anger due to your own insecurities
be me  asianboy  depressed and stressed bc of school  too lazy to do schoolwork and go on 4chan to waste my life    what do robots

learn to love what you hate    its a lesson youre going to have to learn eventually and learning it now will allow you to get the most out of your current opportunities allowing you to secure your future
sounds like your creating your own mental downhill factory thats just going in circles and there is an easy way out of it but the more you think about it the harder it becomes
why do i want to keep on distancing myself from other people
  cause the overwhelming majority of people suck ass its ok to notice it
  you might be depressed
i have a passion for finding out peoples passwords and logging into their accounts every day just to read their private messages it started a few years ago when i had a falling out with my group of friends and used my knowledge of one persons password to uncover everyone in the groups passwords     it started out with me checking whether they were talking shit about me but now i basically just get off on the power of feeling like a puppet master watching the intimate details of their lives play out ive never told anyone i do this and i actively avoid uncovering my bfs password so i dont do the same thing    when i snoop i find a lot of shit i shouldnt  stuff like finding out someone is cheating before their partner does or stuff about my bfs past with a few friends this always puts me in a weird headspace but its been years and i cant stop logging in any advice
see if the gobermint will hire you 
thats some really creepy shit invading someones privacy is a pretty crappy thing to do    it probably makes you feel like youve got more control on your environment so you feel comfortable by knowing things you shouldnt that comfort reinforced the behavior and now here you are being a creeper    i dont really want to give you advice because breaking someones trust is something i despise it is the holidays though    my honest advice is to distance yourself from the environment you do this behavior in distance yourself from any technology/stimuli that lead to the behavior make some kind of chart that notes when you broke your abstention from this behavior and when you succeeded in abstaining    and really fuck off out of peoples lives
  i dont mean this as an insult nor is it a cheap quick joke in my opinion you would benefit greatly from seeing a psychologist you should tell them about this behavior and how you feel about it im not saying you are sick but this worries you and it may become an obsession you can not quit in the future doing this for example in the workplace could get you fired thus it is serious enough to warrant seeking help
how do you get peoples passwords
  this how do you do this it sounds like amazing power
gf and i arent working out in her head im the next messiah but shes too far gone to realize that were not in the same boat havent slept with her yet but im leaning on doing so then leaving should i just go ahead with that then leave or would that be too much of a dick move sidenote shes been suicidal before
  god damn man  look this would be a dick move if a girl does it to a guy  you know why because you have sex its fun you might get some affection and have a hell of a nice sleep and want to do that again    now for a guy to do it to a girl though  they get dicked fuck they love you for it if youre the messiah now youll be the love of her life then and then you dump her shell kill herself for sure    dont do it buy a hooker if you want to fuck desperately leave this troubled one be
  to make myself clear something goes off in their head during sex its an intense bonding experience not so much for us though
if you give any fucks about being a good person dont pump and dump its a dick move and it fuck people up if they are not already fucked up
is it normal to be completely miserable in college
yes and no    everyone feels some degree of miserableness especially grad students to a different degree but its not normal to just feel miserable youre supposed to feel a lot of things that balance it out
  i was miserable during college
depends on what youre miserable about
i have so many microsoft visual c redistributable installed and i think many of them are from things that i dont use anymore  how do identify which ones are safe to remove
  windows  this is really just a badly designed part of windows but it really doesnt slow your system down or hog resources since all of those nearly identical copies probably only take a few hundred mb about the size of a single photo or music file
i feel like i can be both very introvert and a very extrovert guy both things helps me a lot but in some moments that i want to be more extrovert i simply cant i cant raise the voice in a class to ask something in some cases i tend to blush my face when i talk to a girl eventhough i feel like a quite handsome and fit dude even with a guy eventhough im straight in some cases with anybody this does not help me i feel like my shyness is making me be a worst person that i could be i could be excellent in many things but this stupid thing is hard help please
why do i feel like everything i feel and think is because im supposed to feel/think that way  i feel like i dont have an identity of my own im just a patchwork of other peoples thoughts and conventions  i hear all this shit about how its good to be a genuine person and i feel fake and artificial i feel like im a bad person for this
is talking to a therapist an option im not a professional so i cant diagnose you but that sounds like a symptom of a complex problem
    im just a patchwork of other peoples thoughts and conventions    thats how personality works  you observe your surroundings and make up your own mind about stuff  if a person says something you may agree or disagree and have a certain reaction to stuff you take into your mind what you think is good and throw away stuff you think you dont need  everyone is like that  there is no reason to feel bad about that
  ehh the fact that youre having these thoughts and concerns makes you more self aware than most people just next time you hear about something debateable focus on forming your own opinion based on the info you can gather rather than accepting the opinion of an authority
  im currently seeing a therapist but all she does is asking me how im feeling/how ive felt in the days prior to the therapy session and telling me to reflect on my feelings i honestly dont find it very helpful      thats how personality works  sucks though      focus on forming your own opinion based on the info you can gather rather than accepting the opinion of an authority  but doesnt the info you can gather come from a sort of authority on any given subject anyway
cute picture for bumping purposes
further bumping
from what ive gathered youre looking for some all knowing unbiased composition of knowledge to supply yourself with and then create your own thoughts and opinions based on the knowledge of which is given to you    im sorry to say but that doesnt exist its practically impossible to find a source of information that isnt somewhat inherently biased      this anon pretty much hit the nail on the head dont worry about it
i licked the treading of another mans boots last night in exchange for him not sharing information about me to my job it took about 15 hours and he had me ingest as much as i could    hes an auto mechanic there was dirt and dust but also a tangy oily substance my tongue and lips were black and i couldnt wash the black off entirely afterwards even with soap     he said that i might suffer brain damage in the short term and i increased my risk of cancer     does anyone know what would actually be on an auto mechanics boots i dont feel well today and my tongue feels raw and numb still hours later am i really at risk for brain damage
  what information that youre into licking shoes
  is it pasta bait no pure crystalized retardation
  i slept with his daughter cheating on my wife
if it happens it happens never mind
  literally and figuratively got the boot idk if i should be sad or impressed
nice larp
were you hard during the experience i hope you puked all that shit up after as well
  should of told him to fuck off and continued to bang his daughter if i was the mechanic i would tell your wife anyways just to fuck you over
hes saying that mostly to fuck with you hes covered in motor oil and grease regularly as are most mechanics its not that dangerous as long as you didnt suck it into your lungs   the worst thing youd have to worry about would be antifreeze but if symptoms of that particular poison havent manifested already you should be good      you really should have just told him to fuck off if he was smaller than you you should have beaten him within an inch of his life and threatened to burn his shop down with him thrown into a car trunk if he told a soul if he was bigger you should have just bluffed it said you and/or your wife wouldnt care your employer isnt going to give a shit either way unless shes illegal or youre a pastor    you could have also just done the non pig thing and not slept around on your poor wife butif youre going for an evil run theres no point in trying to grovel out of a situation like that hes going to tell someone either way more like than not
thank you i had diarrhea today and dryness around my mouth where the black stuff was however my tongue color is normal again and im otherwise feeling ok
take your shitty gay literotica to 
  loo hes still gonna fuck you over so hard you fucking piece of shit
  no we would be grossed out by op too
  you are the containment board for disgusting people just accept it
  
  i hope he laced the boots with ricin
do you think if i could break up his marriage i could get this guy to marry me
  no
  no
  yes
  do it and post results   also i want to see a pic of you and his wife
  maybe
  but hes not gay
  dont do it
do you want to marry a guy who breaks up with his wife for the thot next door
how do i get over someone cheating on me
realize that man/woman is a piece of living shit and you deserve better that the next person wont be the same ghost the asshole    im sorry my friend i was cheated on once in my life    its cliche but time really does heal all wounds
  this    same thing happened to me it hurt my feelings pretty bad we had been dating for over a year i just said next and started talking to other girls and 5 relationships later im married finding the right one is hard
  you dont ever really get over it in my experience anyway
  internalize that the other man was better than you fuck other girls and let this be a lesson that anyone can cheat at any time and youd likely never find out unless someone just wanted to get rid of you or they fucked up     i say this as someone whos fucked peoples girlfriends and wives and they didnt give a single shit about the act
    do you think it would he toxic if you tried to get into a relationship with those girls that you know cheated on their partners wouldnt you be afraid they might cheat in you
i knew a guy who had his girlfriend of 3 years cheat on him they stayed together for a bit longer even after he found out and now the girl broke up with him yet they are still friends i honestly dont understand his mentality and why he would choose to stick around for someone that basically betrayed him     can anyone try and explain why he/the girl/ or anyone else might act un such an irrational way i know love can make people borderline retarded but is this even normal
not op but do you guys think a kiss is considered as cheating
  yes
is it a bad idea to ask a colleague out for a date how does one even go about doing it without making things akward especially if she declines
ive been sexually abused before and harassed a lot i moved to a different city a few months ago and it was a shithole didnt do my research properly i was pretty much harassed everyday even touched and my bf would just get mad at me for not defending myself for not telling them to fuck off what if they hurt me men are usually stronger and they can just drag me into an alley if they want there was a time when a guy offered me 800 for sex i tried to walk away and stop it but he insisted so much i was scared for real i called one of my friends afterwards to talk instead of my bf i felt like he would just have gotten mad at me again i never told him about it and i dont think ill ever do it and just fyi i dont dress too slutty when i go outside i dont flirt with anyone and all i did was sit down in a park to relax and that guy just came to me like that do you think it is fair that my bf gets mad at me for these things
  thats bad you should report it if it ever happens that really sucks for women idk if it ever happens to men im not innocent here i can be creepy i blame my porn addiction how do i can get help
my landlord agreed to return my deposit by the 25th and has been making excuses for not doing it for a week shes now saying that she transferred the money on thursday and doesnt know why it hasnt appeared in my account yet which is clearly bollocks she insulted me and blocked my number when i asked for evidence of this transfer how do i get my money back   pic unrelated
  small clams court also report her to housing authority and bbb
  bbb is a private company and sell businesses their ratings meaning you can purchase your way out off any shady dealing at any timedont waist your time nore put any stake in their a rated businesses
  have you tried googling it its either small claims court or maybe a specific state agency set up for such purpose
dude small claims court fucking rips those people to shreds do that immediately i think if its been past 30 days or so then shes actually in big trouble and will have to pay back more get em
  she doesnt have money to repay his deposit let alone pay off bbb
  op says bollocks    you say state agencies    clearly not in the states
  small claims court     you dont use attorneys or anything else its just the court fee and appointment   ever watch judge judy thats kind of like how small claims works two regular people regular speaking and conversation discussing a small matter before the judge if you win the loser pays the court fee if you lose well the court fee isnt much at all anyway     theres generally a money limit like under 5000 dollars since youre in the uk its probably similar just bring any evidence with you obviously your contract screenshots of sms emails whatever you have and speak your case plainly very easy and from my experience judges are very good and will grant the obvious party the victory     i sued a landlord in 2016 and won i was refunded my money released from contract and awarded 100 in damages the only thing i would have done differently is calm down i was a nervous wreck and overexplaining myself i felt like the judges questions to me was because she didnt believe my story but in reality shes just fulfilling her obligation to scrutinize me and give a fair trial to both parties
  this its generally very clear cut and often neither party even disputes the facts one of them is just stupid and delusional about their obligations  judge  did you refund the deposit  landlord  well no but irrelevant bs story    before you go to court send a registered letter so they have to sign for it and you get a receipt that they have received it demanding the money if that doesnt work you might have to pay somebody to go serve them in person if that doesnt work then you go to court
  if that doesnt work you might have to pay somebody to go serve them in person  what i mean is if they refuse to sign for it you might have to pay somebody to serve them just get proof they received it either from the post or a sheriff/whatever brit equivalent is standard police wont deal with this
  service is usually included
  oh yeah i guess im getting things jumbled you should at least send the registered letter before you officially sue them is my point you want to roll in and make it clear the facts are on your side and have real proof you made it known there was a problem they blocked my number doesnt count as proof
in the uk landlord must return it in ten days     stateside various laws depending on location
  honestly thats an unnecessary step if the law already sets a timeline as to when it must be returned i feel that since the landlord basically lied to op and subsequent blocking communication politeness can now go out the window
  yeah thats true it could save you from having to go to court though which would make it worth it small claims sucks ass  im not talking about being polite either the letter should say im demanding my money immediately and i will go to court

  all you can do is sell somehing op
maybe sell plasma or any valuables at a pawn shop beg on social media steal
  plasma  this plasma is a great way to bolster low income its keeping me afloat now find a plasma center that pays money not a blood center you can usually donate twice a week as long as you have a day in between each donation the one near me pays 5060 dollars for your first four donations and around 35 for each after that csl plasma is a fairly common one that you can find
    i lost my job since april and already sold most of my valuables just to get by its hard finding a job when the only two things you have are a high school degree and autism      is there any health requirements to donate plasma im not the most healthy person and have been lacking nutrition for several months
  yes create a tumblr to make it look believable google and browse tumblrs made by lesbians and transsexuals and socially aware preferably american young adults then make a tumblr blog like that describe yourself as a struggling but optimistic transwoman make sure that you put some mental issues as well even something as mild as anxiety follow as many sjw/lgbt blogs you can and reblog some shit then make a post about being in financial need include paypal and ask people for support if not monetary than in reblogs and kind words i can fucking guarantee you that some people will give you money
  you mostly just have to be hydrated have a resting heart rate under 100 and not have super high blood pressure you should meet the protein requirements unless your diet consists of exclusively meat or lacks any source of protein at all
  there are two simple things that would help the first is slow the bleeding cancel some of your unneeded services like netflix or other subscriptions    the second is on the income side for some small cash collect bottles and cans for slightly larger money offer to do yardwork or painting for neighbors or in affluent neighborhoods    also theres a big labor shortage in many parts of the us look for the we buy houses signs call them up and offer to do work on house fixups under someones license aps did a big show about getting work with home flippers heres the link        good luck
  they wont take plasma from people with autoimmune disorders thats all i know of

can you give me some hope /adv/ im m 26 years old and i feel like all i ever do is struggle    i have a disability that impacts my daily life to a lesser or sometimes greater extent and i that i have to plan my day to accordingly requiring strict routine yet still i am currently doing my phd working something like 4550 hours per week sometimes more i almost always did extremely well in school and university but for the longest time i felt like that was my only redeeming quality and in some cases people made an effort to make me feel like that that changed however i live alone and take good care of my flat and myself i do sports like three times a week i am not depressed or feel like it  since i work so much its hard to meet new people most people i know are living in their bubble of workpartnerclose friends that keeps them from wanting to do stuff with not so close friends or trying new things  i had many disappointments with people in the last few years including an ugly case of mobbing i solved that situation successfully which i dont think many people wouldnt have because it was an intense situation that required to have a really thick skin i really dont want conflicts with people unless i have to i just want to have a good time and some regard sometimes it feels like the more i make an effort with people the more it drives them away when i meet new people on trips i can connect really easily but at home it just doesnt seem to work with women i get along really well except for the ones im interested in from past bad experiences i sometimes feel like its impossible for me to have someone love me sometime  i see others who live life on easy mode and feel like i always have to put in 120 effort to achieve the same stuff others get without moving a finger or even just to do the same things but i also feel like if i would just stop the struggle and settle below my own standards i would regret it deeply later in life
  seems to me that you are beginning to question your own decisions and where you are at in life  most people dont go much further than a ba so im not surprised that youre finding life to be a struggle right now  youre right that most people live life in easy mode and you are right that you would deeply regret not doing great things while you still can  this is your life make it interesting and something to be proud of
  nobody lives life on easy mode everyone that seems to be on easy mode has either dealt with something traumatic in the past will in the future or currently are dealing with something some people are just better at hiding it than others
  easy mode is a myth there is no easy mode there are things which look like easy mode from an outside perspective but upon closer inspection turn out to be a different kind of hard mode if you think the people who look like they are living easy mode but assure you they are really living hard mode just like you are somehow deceiving you or are just incapable of seeing how easy their own mode is ask yourself what they stand to gain from pretending theyre living a harder life than they are why would someone who from their perspective is living an easy and carefree life ever claim to be living one of hardship
  you got type 1 diabetes brother
  thank you        i know what you mean but its not what i mean there are hardships that everyone has to go through and there are some worse that not everyone has to go through what is soulcrushing for some might be laughable for others and what is hard for these others might be completely traumatic for the first ones just because people feel the same about different things it doesnt mean that both are living life hard mode      yes
so the girl im currently seeing gave me chlamydia she says her ex called her and told her that he tested positive for it and that she should get tested she told me about this and that she also tested positive id recently started noticing something wasnt right in terms of my sexual health in recent weeks and this just confirmed it i know the disease is very treatable and im getting treatment now but going through the stress and worry of knowing i was exposed to an sti and how much worse it could have been has traumatized me and caused a lot of internal pain for me  i give her the benefit of the doubt that she didnt know she had the disease since i dont have any proof otherwise and it was her ex that supposedly gave it to her but that being said they dated for a long time and i find it hard to believe you could date someone for that long and not notice anything wrong   am i overthinking this or is there something suspicious going on what would you do in this situation im obviously pretty mad at myself for not just using protection in the first place i take full responsibility for my choice but at the same time she told me she had gotten tested after her and her bf broke up and didnt find anything which again i give her the benefit of the doubt since the test might not have checked for chlamydia but its a pretty common fucking sti and i would figure that it would be covered in most sandard std panels shes been great to me other than this but i also cant help but feel animosity towards her for this and im wondering how i should go about this relationship knowing i have these conflicted feelings
  ill make it real simple for you op you are overthinking so im gonna put things back into perspective  she told you she got tested and she was healthy  she gave you an std  she either lied about being tested or got it from him after they broke up either way id personally just drop her
  should i confront her on my suspicions or just not give a reason
  shes either lying or still fucking her ex  drop her
  no you fag ghost and forget
  there is something going on    shes fucking him been there already with two different gfs get the fuck out
make her pay for your stdtest and then dump her    next time you fuck a girl use protection and only go raw once you know her for longer
and thats why you shouldnt date sluts     man being an incel is tough better than having stds though lok
  depends on how recent it was how long have you been together    chlamydia rarely manifests symptoms in women so it is fully possible for her to carry it without knowing the one thing that would tell you if she cheated is knowing how long from fucking her ex she took before testing herself if she tested herself within 2 weeks of having sex with him it may not have showed up assuming that was the last time they had sex if she tested herself more than a month after it would absolutely have showed up     you should also not worry about not having contracted it immediately it can take many sessions before it actually transmits successfully to you     so if its a recent thing dont worry if youve been together for a while dump the hoe
  ive been seeing her since roughly august but we only started sleeping together since the end of september thereabouts
with chlamydia it can take a few weeks for symptoms to appear but sometimes they dont show up at all according to google anyway but i dont know why it wouldnt have shown up on the test unless it was within a week of her being exposed to it so she either lied about being tested she was infected and it didnt show up on the text or shes cheating with her ex i personally wouldnt break up with her over it if the relationship is going over well since its curable
be me  teachers assistant in elective class  tard kids throw chairs at ceiling vape in class and vandalize bathrooms all the time  im a good student so when teacher asks i tell him what happened  tard bro gets pissed screams about how im ruining his family name like some old fucking chineese grandpa  tard bro desperatly wants to be popular yet all my friends in senior class thing hes a fucking disgrace believes watching ben shapiro increases your iq  what should i do about this to get my retarded brother off my back i leave school in like 5 months and ive thought about just excommunicating him but my dad said he wouldnt pay for any of my college if i did that any advice

how do i work on reducing my self hate
  pin point the characteristics in which make a person likable for you not necessarily even romantically just someone you would like to be around    once youve defined these traits you want to try to do at least one thing each day which corresponds to one of those traits     ie if you admire honesty if someone is asking you how youre doing and you arent having the greatest day tell them dont just say good like most people would    try to do things to make yourself more like those traits you look for in others
  wow thats a great tip thanks    any ways to deal with a self hate wave/attack rhings that are current
  do you mean like just a sudden rush of i fucking hate myself jesus christ i want to fucking die i cant fucking take living with myself    if so then id suggest if you can feel one coming on remind yourself of the good or admirable things youve done in your life hold onto those thoughts and memories before the wave hits and it may be less severe     i do stupid shit all the time and sometimes get like that but after the wave is over i think about all the good ive done in my life and how ive become a person who i enjoy and actually have come to love    also another good tip is if you suffer from depression or keep thinking about your own issues and insecurities try helping other people with their problems and being there for them this will take your mind off your problems and instead focus it on others helping others may also lead to you finding a solution to your own problems as well

if i put my phone on airplane mode screenshot a snapchat and then delete the app will they be notified of the screenshot  i know this trick used to work im just wondering if they finally fixed this or not
  just take a picture with another devices
how would your phone download the snap if its in airplane mode
  thats fawckin stupid why i wanna see a picture of a screen i hate that shit no offense    you open the app and then turn on airplane mode open the snap screenshot delete the app turn off airplane mode
  google dummy they make apps for this
  the app doesnt need be online to know you took a screenshot youll have to reconnect to the internet eventually
  so you tested it
put your phone on airplane mode take a screenshot then youre supposed to hold the home button for 5 seconds or something which resets the app they will not be notified that you screenshotted ive done this before and its worked like a charm but its been a while so look it up on youtube because im not sure if im 100 correct
if you have an android use a remote connection tool to connect to the device from your computer and screenshot it there
  why dont you just take a picture of your phones screen with a different device you weirdo

i know /adv/ is sfw board but today its sunday so the offices are closed    i am having difficulty penetrating my girlfriend we are having this trouble since last few weeks i am a virgin and she has supposedly had sex once with a midget which she describes as very painful and wasnt a good experience     so my question is is it possible that her hymen is still intact after that one incident that it is not letting me go inside   i have a weird condition of tight foreskin that it goes down only like 1/3rd of the head so sex without a condom feels painful    i have tried pushing it hard inside getting her really really wet and adding more lube but girth of my penis already seems to big to go inside her vagina    what do any anons with experience here     also am i still a virgin even after the above described sexual experience
  multiple issues here     so my question is is it possible that her hymen is still intact after that one incident that it is not letting me go inside  im not even sure what you mean the hymen shouldnt be something completely blocking you from entering especially if she had sex before     i have a weird condition of tight foreskin that it goes down only like 1/3rd of the head so sex without a condom feels painful  have you seen a doctor about this what does he/she think     i have tried pushing it hard inside getting her really really wet and adding more lube but girth of my penis already seems to big to go inside her vagina  i assume you mean that its too painful i dont think its hymen issues as that shouldnt be so painful as to make sex impossible especially after having had sex before or having tried pushing it hard you should be able to see the hymen or she can look herself using a mirror if its there too make sure perhaps your gf is suffering from vaginitis which is basically a vaginal inflammation issue which can have all kinds of causes she should see a doctor/gynecologist     also am i still a virgin even after the above described sexual experience  well leave that to the philosophers
she might have that vaginimutus condition where her vag is just too tight idk what the cure is probably gradually using small dildo and upping the size    or also she is so nervous shes clenching her vag muscles without even knowing it thats a fucking thing women do as well
    i tried opening the petal like part of the vagina apart     pic related is what i saw on google and right side is what i saw in real    there was no hole/cavity which is denoted in black color on right side i saw a solid bulge like surface as shown in pin in right the only hole like thing i saw is below it from which a mucus like liquid was coming which i am assuming is some sort of lubricating liquid    the hymen shouldnt be something completely blocking you from entering especially if she had sex before    thats the issue we are not sure if the hymen is intact or not is the pink thing on right hymen the midget dude she had sex with went like one inch in and she made him stop so the situation is really gray and we both are very inexperienced in this      i thought that too that she is probably clenching but we are almost married now and she is very comfortable with me we clean each others nose and see each other poop without an issue so there is really no reason for her to get uncomfortable with me
  supposedly had sex once with a midget which she describes as very painful and wasnt a good experience
  have you tried putting a finger in the hymen is harder to break than some people think some women go to the dr to have it clipped
  /adv/ is sfw board  i thought sfw applied only to the images posted
  and youre right
  well it wasnt a literal midget  some 4 feet 11 inch dude       maybe i will try that the next time can you check the figure in this image     do you think the pink region is the intact hymen and it needs to be torn down    i have tried fingering the first time we tried having sex and she said it was too painful so i didnt try that after that i have only tried penile penetration ever since
  can i post the picture of vagina on some image host and put the link here
  i thought sfw applied only to the images posted  it is at least as im aware theres no rule on bad language although if youre that angry that youre typing out swear words you probably shouldnt post it at all some boards have minor rules on content for ops like on this one youre not allowed to make non advice related posts but thats the only restriction
  that does kinda sound like a hymen assuming she can have her period just fine there should be something of an opening in there though  seeing a gynecologist couldnt hurt they should be able to see whats going on and whether its normal if you cant have sex theres probably something going on     she might have that vaginimutus condition where her vag is just too tight idk what the cure is probably gradually using small dildo and upping the size   i thought that too that she is probably clenching  vaginismus can have a variety of causes from psychological issues histroy of sexual abuse or nonsexual domestic violence and stress to infections again not something you want to just screw around with but you probably want to see a doctor    i guess if you really dont want to have her see a doctor or gynecologist you could experiment a bit together but im not sure if its the best thing to do you can try to see how far you can go with just penetrating with the fingers or let her try herself if the hymen is intact after all then it could indeed hurt to break it but its probably better to ease into it going progressively further than to force through in one go when you can put like two fingers in then you should be good to slowly start trying normal penetration
do you have a drill
  yes
  well it certainly could be not the best drawing sorry    if you cant get a finger in then you absolutely wont be able to get your dick in i dont know what the heck is going on with a the midget if you cant get in then he couldnt have gotten in     she should see a doctor and they can fix that for her no problem as mentioned its not unheard of for women to have to have this procedure
  nigga you say youre a virgin but also that sex hurts without a condom   she had sex but shes a virgin     nigga fuck off this is a serious board
  i wasnt able to penetrate properly so i am not sure if i have lost my virginity or not  she says she was involved in an intercourse but as above anons are describing her hymen is intact too so she is a virgin too    nigga what seems to be confusing here
  yes no issues in her period as you can see in this image  on the right side there is a tiny opening with some mucus like stuff coming out i am assuming that is where the period blood comes out from    i will try fingering and will report it here      she suggested that there is no rush and we can do these things after our marriage as well and there is no need to be worried about anything
  dont do that op anon doesnt want to help they just want a picture they wont be able to diagnose from a picture anyways    she needs to see a gynecologist i suspect vaginismus as the issue hymens are not barriers except in usual and sometimes medically problematic situations theyre rings of tissue that stretch and do not inhibit passage    vaginismus is a condition where the vagina clamps shut as a reflex like how you blink when something moves towards your eye its an unconscious protective measure    she needs to see a professional gyno or sex therapist to confirm this in the meantime i would assume that the problem is something like vaginismus and act accordingly    vaginismus is a psychosomatic issue meaning that its the brain that is causing it its an unconscious reflex but the reflex comes from somewhere things like anxiety about sex fear of stis an upbringing that shames people for sexual acts any of these can cause a negative mental association with sex which can contribute to or cause vaginismus she needs to be comfortable to relax and to build up a new positive association    i highly suggest you not try penetration forcing penetration and causing pain will only worsen the situation trying and failing to penetrate will also deepen the anxiety that she feels surrounding penetration and again make it worse    explore other nonpenetrative sexual acts things like oral external fingering etc she needs to learn that sex is fun and that she can trust you with time and patience and a positive association with sex her body should be able to relax and gradually allow penetration first with a finger then more and then eventually penile penetration its a slow process that will take a while and any attempt to rush it is going to backfire    a sex therapist can help her figure out what is causing negative association and give you more information  an actual diagnosis of the issue    but dont post pics that wont help
  not barriers except in unusual situations
  wow anonchan  that was really helpful  i will try everything you have suggested here     this seems entirely psychological then i will try to make her feel even more comfortable around me to see if it helps the act
  if her hymen is actually something that covers the vaginal entrance then she also needs to see a doctor to diagnose and treat this
so i got crossfaded really bad and though i was awake my memory blanked out for the first hour until i started vomiting but even though my memory came back it didnt make me feel more sober i eventually fell to the floor because of how wasted i was but i still remember that just fine    so i always assumed that vomiting makes you more sober but is this actually not the case and if it isnt then why the hell is my memory of it so much better was it just that vomiting and falling down was a lot more painful so it was burned into my memory and nothing interesting happened before im just curious
  was it just that vomiting and falling down was a lot more painful so it was burned into my memory  yes    and vomiting is just the reaction of your body to something it doesnt want  it wont make you more sober because you allready have the alcohol in your blood it only prevents you from getting more drunk because you throw up the alc you got in your stomach

how fucked am i when it comes to getting a firearms license    im a 23 year old male student former military with no criminal record i figure shooting would be a good hobby to take up given how much i loved days at the range and the people i can meet    the beginning of this year i went to see a doctor who then referred me to a psychiatrist for my prolonged suppressed appetite the psychiatrist figured i was depressed and put me on various anti depressants for a couple months despite me being pretty sure i wasnt depressed     the psychiatrist i went to was a bit shady to say the least she offered no electronic payment and only cash for the copayment but she was licensed according to my insurance website and she spoke very few words and seemed to only care about getting money from her patients after a few months i decided this was pointless and stopped seeing her and quit the meds which had absolutely 0 impact on me good and bad       anyways is my record with the psychiatrist available for background checks when applying for a firearms license obviously since this was technically a mental health issue on paper am i completely barred from getting a firearm if it matters i live in new jersey
nj is a may issue state so youre probably fucked
but you can still try a lot of times in these states it comes down to the town/city youre from and its arbitrary as fuck
  those records are sealed unless youre state is violating federal law youre good to go new jersey is a corrupt shithole that hates gun owners though
  i have no idea about new jersey specifically other than that its a commie shithole but in general the only mental health thing that would prevent you from buying a gun is being involuntarily institutionalized
  this
  needing a license for a gun  extremely fucked  fuck new jersey you could live in any surrounding state and still visit there if it was that important
does it make any sense to work 2 jobs that pay the same amount im currently working as a webdev at my school ive been there for about 4 months now and i have not gotten paid yet i was supposed to be trained 6 weeks still hasnt happened and then get paid but nothing happened i was told i would start getting paid next semester also i hate this job anyway since theres absolutely no management    i wanted to also work on another campus as a webdev it pays the same but its really close to where i live about 5 min drive im still a student so ill also be juggling school work     i wanted to pad my resume so it doesnt look like shit previously i had no job experience the work load on my current job isnt bad but its kind of confusing management sucks/ no direction is this dumb should i quit my current job if i get the other job
  im currently working as a webdev at my school ive been there for about 4 months now and i have not gotten paid yet  report them to the department of labor
should i shoot myself in the head to end it quickly or shoot myself in the heart so my family can have an open casket using a sawed down singlebarrel 12 gauge for reference
  if you gave even half a fuck about your family you wouldnt shoot yourself at all
  going to kill yourself  caring about your family  pick one
    not enough to keep living might as well try and give them something
how about you dont kill yourself 
  shoot some normies and let the cops decide where youre getting shot at
  neither of those options will guarantee you an open casket op
so i like collecting stuff movies anime games books etc i feel like i am getting to attached to these things because i lack relationships with people i have a few though and trying to fill the void with things not spending much many though downloading is fine with me  i would like to detach from those materialistic things because i know deep down that they dont really matter but i am not sure if i want to get rid of them because i also losing interest in them or just because i am midly depressed and blaming my shortcomings on those mostly antisocial hobbies how do i figure this out  also a bit scared that if i actually managed to find a gf these things would made me look like retard
  if life taught me something it is that once you feel you might be too much attached to a collection of things it is time to free yourself from those things the only action to do is putting them in the trash as soon as possible you will lose yourself only to find your true self minutes later
  anon if you find a gf you should be free to show what you like and who you are to her anyway you seem to understand yourself very well blaming your short comings on your hobbies wont bring you anywhere right having hobbies is awesome and you have some and thats good  but if you are going thru some dudeism type of enlightment and really want to get rid of materialistic things well thats an enormous change be sure to think about it first and be sure you are doing it because you want it yourself not to be liked not ti normalize yourself     and if you decide to get rid of verything you can always send it to me dd
  maybe you are right i am not the same guy i was back then when i gained a lot of those things      i dont play on giving up on my hobbies or to fake my real self but there is something about having bunch of stuff that makes me feel uneasy and as i said i believe i bought a lot of those things because i tried to fill the places where people are supposed to be  also i kind of getting tired of all those hobbies i wish i was passionate about something more meaningful like sports dancing and other stuff involving people and blaming hobbies mostly likely stems from me spending too much time on them in my childhood and teenage years that it left me stunned in different aspects  i am not going for some dudeism type of enlightenment more like why should i spend money on meaningless hobbies if i could be saving up for a apparment or possibly raising kids i feel like a lot of people are spending too much time wasting on meaninless things  been thinking about charity or something sorry
  i wish i was passionate about something more meaningful like sports dancing and other stuff involving people    mmmh anon put yourself down like that while if you feel like you should have been more social than you just should have been thats true but anime games books and movies are important too there should be a balance and you were way on the loner side but experiencing alone time and spending time like that its important too  im sorry you felt like you were missing so much but i dont think you should regret all the things you got to experience well if you enjoyed them that is   anyway it seems you are heading up to a new direction anon thats awesome i hope you have good memories of the things you got to experiece and be excited for the change you are going thru    lol and dont worry donating to charity is really noble
bump
do it anon free yourself the pain from losing your materials will only exist for a short while the pain comes from losing a part of your identity however as time goes on you will come to create a new identity for yourself that is not as influenced by material things and you will feel as actualized and real as you possibly could you will recognize that the identity you had before that was so influenced by material things was not your real self becuase the self is more than a material when making changes like this its only the transition part that is hard living with too many materials is just as easy as living without them transitioning between the two states is the part you must overcome
  my father was a hoarder and i lived with the constant fear of being overwhelmed by things theres no need to get rid of your collection you just need a change in mindset and stop actively hoarding things
any lawyers or peace officers on /adv/ i live in the us in a state where weed is legal medically and recreationally and im medical marijuana patient and im curious what i can do to avoid a dui from weed since the legal 6 hours is kind of a long time to wait to drive besides the obvious like dont drive after you smoke what are some things to avoid getting fucked by the law
not driving like youre under the influence of drugs so that you dont get pulled over in the first place
  dont drive while impaired  its that simple  there is no trick to it
  spotted the narc no for real though like i dont drive stoned or anything i just have a fast metabolism and i high tolerance so driving impaired and driving legally impaired are two different things
  muh rights  muh freedoms  muh min wage job  muh hard life  fuck off retard
  knowing that the science behind testing marijuana impairment is very dicey at the moment so you first line of defense begins with convincing officers that you havent used any yet the day you get stopped also assessing the point where you need to use your right to be silent and ask to contact your attorney find a good dyi attorney and memorize their number maybe even establish a working relationship with them retain     the alternative is public transportation and get a doctors note to get a discount disability pass and let them do the driving
  pretty much this op just git gud at driving
  not that my income has anything to do with this you could say im unemployedbut as a daytrader my assets and spendable income put me in the upper middle class line  muh 30000 a year government salary
so this guy messaged me hey cutie is it better to reply saying a have a boyfriend or just not reply
  give us more information op  i presume youre femanon right first thing to establish would be whether you actually have a boyfriend or not
platinum bait
  if you dont want anything to do with him just dont reply hey cutie took no effort on his part so you dont owe him any effort in return
  why in holy fuck would you reply at all if realize you are flattered but dont step in shit when you can step around
how do you know him
  you can bet shes been pulling the guy in and now he bit
reply with hey you want a threesome with me and daddy then immediately reply with lol sorry that was for my little brother
have major anxiety issues intimacy issues and emotional turmoil that makes me treat people in a hot or cold manner where i pull them towards me then push them away or abandon them   capable of being extremely hateful and verbally abusive because i feel so vulnerable and threatened and i become rabid because i feel i have to go on the attack to protect myself   often fight with authority figures because im so volatile   girls think im a cool devilmaycare badass    i dont get it they see a bad boy but im just an emotionally broken person who lashes out because im scared of people and of intimacy i feel weak and defenseless not cool    how do i get girls to stop fetishizing my pain and realize that im not nearly as cool as they think i am
  shut the fuck up chad and enjoy the free pussy
  how do i get girls to stop  wear a facade of outward happiness/contentedness  alternatively drown your sorrows in that puss
  im the furthest thing in the world from chad friendly people that arent scared of others and embrace the world are so much cooler than me
she told me she loves me and i told her i like her too and that im really glad i met her did i fuck up this was over text and we are dating i just dont feel that way yet
  is there any reason to think you blundered
  only that she has been online and has not responded in any way im probably overthinking but i did not expect a love bomb at this point and i know it can hurt if someone doesnt feel the same
  im probably overthinking  well now that youve identified that you arent thinking reasonably about it you can let your stress go     well done
  is that a guy getting a blowjob
  i wouldnt be making threads on a mongolian basket weave forum if was a well adjusted individual that could deal with these things on his own terms
  she told me she loves me and i told her i like her too and that im really glad i met her did i fuck up  you friendzoned her  if you were dating as in kissing and holding hand she now thinks that you led her on
  no hes reading a good book
  i think thats the joke dot jay pee gee
so my birthday came up and i entered the bedroom and found that she had handcuffed herself to the bed and said that i could do whatever i wanted we established a safeword started i went a bit crazy with it and she seemed fine she never used the safeword about 30 minutes afterwards though she started crying and wouldnt talk to me im really concerned what should i do
  talk to her about it make sure shes alright from how youve described it you were in the clear so dont blame yourself
  lol wow  so time to get a new gf ypu failed that shit test like no bodies business
  some want what they dont want
  you should make her some tea and ask if you need to talk about what happened do you want to talk about my birthday if she says no the just say sorry but dont try push harder
fuckin hell op what did you do
  she sounds like a stupid bitch if she didnt use the safeword talk to her about it
  you probably didnt do aftercare
did i rape my girlfriend  who knows you didnt give us dirty details    what do i do  try to find way to make up for what you did
    what did you do
who cares what he did they had a safeword she sounds super fucking dumb
it doesnt sound like rape but comfort her ask her what you did wrong tell her its okay to feel this way and do some after care seriously this is what you do when you do rough power play stuff the dom needs to comfort the sub tell her she doesnt need to talk until shes ready and that she can shower if itll make her feel better offer to order in food and that you two can watch a disney movie or studio ghibli together quietly ask her want she needs from you now and in the future be compassionate
    i stuck as many things in my possession into as many orifices as i could excluding the mouth for this exact reason there was slapping and hair pulling i put some force behind it her ass is bright red right now and i have a really conflicted boner about it and i dont feel like i can comfort her while still having it shes staring at some scratch marks i made on her thighs for a bit i bit her clitoris really hard i put pins through her nipples and pulled a for a few seconds before i stopped  but i think the main thing were the insults shes kind of sensitive but i assumed it would be fine i said the word slut and whore a lot shes always hated the stacy party girl thing and i think implying that she is one made her upset i also kept using the word big and huge and i think she may have been concerned that i was implying she was fat
  fuck man this is just where dom play gets overrated just fuck your girlfriend if she wants to get rough smack her ass pin her wrists and maybe a bit of deep throat if you want to use dirty talk i always like to lean in and say to her tell me what you are that way she gets to decide what direction and how far she wants the dirty talk plus i find it sexier when she degrades herself     youve just described an excessive scene  why shove things up her ass its just frankly not erotic im not trying to diss your fetish out but i feel like people get carried away with the hardcore play because they forget its supposed to be erotic aggressive sure but sensual its still your girlfriend youre supposed to insert yourself as the sexy freudian father figure whos in charge not the next door neighbour who kidnaps her and locks her in the basement
  no wonder she cried after all that you humiliated the poor lady im sure when she said do whatever you want to me she didnt mean it in the most literal of sense she probably thought you would do some basic sm not enact your favorite degenerate hentai scenes shit like that youre suppose to ease a person into not full steam ahead
  she doesnt mean literally you shit lord   she means be as rough as you want but treat her human    she was probably too overwhelmed and shocked to say the safe word    i would have broken up with you you sound like a retarded man child
      i asked about it and she said i told you to do anything you wanted and you seemed like you really wanted to hurt me  its over not officially yet but i dont assume this is going to last long now i feel so shitty
  well you dun goofed up op    care for her number i will comfort her for you
  you are a sadistic individual i hope she runs
  pictured how /r9k/ would have sex with a girl
  yeah bro that relationship is toast whats your next move
  just comfort her i guess im not sure what else to do im not sure i can come up with a rebuttal because thats literally what i did
  this is the product of modern porn consumption
  no whats your next move in life be single for a while tinder  your relationship is completely fucked up beyond all recognition
get bf  hes shy but sweet  decide to help him get out of his shell  handcuff myself to the bed and tell him to have his way with me  he starts shoving objects in me and calling me a whore  scratches and slaps me and continues insults  think the worst of it is over   he surprises me with pins in my nipples  in utter shock  after a couple hours of pain and insults its over  cry   eventually break up  will never feel safe being completely vulnerable with a man ever again
  slow clap
  fuck man i cant do this i really like her still is there really nothing
  op is a fucked up person i did this for my boyfriend including telling him he could do whatever he wanted he kissed me all over and made love to me bc thats what he wanted never crossed his mind to hurt or humiliate me
  oh man did i really ruin her reading it over makes me feel so shitty what do i do there has to be something
  you really shouldnt say that shit and then get mad if it escalates have a safe word and act like adults props to op for actually trusting his gf enough to try out his fantasies how many people are never honest with what they want in the bedroom
    i entered the bedroom and found that she had handcuffed herself to the bed and said that i could do whatever i wanted  we established a safeword  i went a bit crazy with it and she seemed fine  i stuck as many things in my possession into as many orifices as i could  there was slapping and hair pulling i put some force behind it  scratch marks i made on her thighs  i bit her clitoris really hard i put pins through her nipples and pulled a for a few seconds  i said the word slut and whore a lot  i also kept using the word big and huge and i think she may have been concerned that i was implying she was fat  she never used the safeword  but ill bet that you didnt ask before doing whatever you wanted too  also what the fuck is your normal sex life like have you ever done any of the above with her  even if a woman lets you have free reign she expects you to do what you have previously done you have to remember that women are the fairer sex not the more intelligent sex so she wont say anything at the time because she doesnt want to go back on do whatever you want
  in that case she has no one to blame but herself safe words exist for a reason
  n that case she has no one to blame but herself  see  you have to remember that women are the fairer sex not the more intelligent sex so she wont say anything at the time because she doesnt want to go back on do whatever you want
  we got into scratching and shes slapped me before ive talked about a lot of it with her but i never did it
  i read that again thats not ops fault she had a way to stop and didnt use it dont do these kind of scenarios if you cant pull through he didnt rape her
wow you guys acting like op is some kind of monster  should op have gauged her reaction better probably but in this situation i feel like its 100 on the gf to ask him to stop/use the safeword how else is he to know hes crossing boundaries    ive legally raped my gf twice and she was okay with it because she had fun and knew id stop when she made it clear  op really just sit her down talk to and comfort her and most of all make sure she understands what happens in the bedroom is not a reflection of the rest of the relationship that even though you insulted and humiliated her during sex you value and respect her as a person
  you treated her like a piece of shit which sucks but then you literally stabbed her with needles  i would have gone into a panicked frenzy and definitely would have forgotten the safe word at that point  im sure she was crying and saying stop    yes you ruined her  recommend therapy tell her youre a monster and that not all men are like you and then leave her
  why didnt she use the fucking safeword then is your gf retarded this is all on her
  now this is autism
  fuck that its not ops fault his girlfriend has the emotional and mental intelligence of a child shes 100 to blame for this regardless of whether op has fucked up sexual fetishes or not
  never crossed his mind to hurt or humiliate me  how do you know  he probably saw through your lie and understood that you were only testing him
my boyfriend and i had a similar thing happen but i was the one too kinky for him    he forgot the safe word while he was panicking but i picked up on his reactions before anything happened  i stopped and asked him how he felt and if it was ok to go forward  my boyfriend wasnt stupid for forgetting the safe word but the human brain is prone to forgetting things like that in fight or flight mode     if you have hardcore kinks that inflict pain like stabbing burning and heavy humiliation talk to them first about those specific kinks someone who isnt as deep into kinks might have not even considered that being something youd try in bed     people arent perfect but as the dom its your job to be the eyes and guidance for the newbie    you blew it
dumb girlfriend and autistic degenerate boyfriend aside how do we combat the jewish porn industry having such a hold on young men nowadays its concerning that you faggots cant enjoy normal sex anymore its all anal fistings cuck shit and other degeneracy no wonder so many young people are depressed cynical and cant enjoy the simple things in life anymore
  she didnt say anything she was giving the same kind of looks she gives after we have sex after we havent been near each other for a while
  what did you do afterwards  i feel like i betrayed her so badly
  i kissed him cuddled him and made him dinner    i explained that i never want him to feel unsafe and that next time well find a middle ground that he can feel safer in and ill be able to explore my kink with him    you make your partner feel like the most loved and appreciate person on the planet and dont stop till theyre melting in your arms saying how happy they are to be yours     we finished that night watching movies and falling asleep with him being big spoon a couple weeks later we tried again based on the compromise and enjoyed ourselves
i mean hey she said do whatever you want and didnt make it clear so
  it wasnt a lie i wouldve let him do anything
  dont respond to incels    saged
  maybe you would have at the time but you were not indifferent you still hoped that he would do things you enjoyed and cared for you all the time and had he gone too far you would have resented him after like ops girlfriend as you proved by estimating she is justified to do so    you can do anything means not only that you will be be resisted but that you will not be judged and punished for what youve done its an outlandish lie everyone should be able to understand that it is not to be taken at face value which is why safewords exist too but it is still a lie
  i agree with you op you were just doing this nasty shit because you think its hot everyone wants to be a freak nowadays lmao think with your own brain next time
  fucking lol your soon to be former gf is dumb as fuck dont feel bad as she cant be much of a catch
  what the fuck did she proposed this only so that she would have something to be mad about afterwards what a dumb fucking cunt jesus
    tfw not having a slightly abusive gf that comforts you after rough sex    general question how do you talk with your partner about kinks and stuff  im kinda scared to talk about those things
  wtf thats sick dude who even does things like that to their significant others that shit aint healthy thats not how sex should look like i think you should seek some therapy because you have some disturbing issues if you get off from sadistically hurting women and think its okay to do shit like that without discussing it at length  not even a white knight but she should report you
  are you some authority on how sex is supposed to look like just cause you dont like it doesnt make it wrong   she had a safe word and didnt use it they both were consenting adults get off your high horse
  no shit she didnt use her safe word she was probably scared op will hurt her even more if she does or just shocked bdsm is one thing but doing sick shit to a person youre supposed to love is fucked up
here are some things    1 girlfriend didnt expect your kink to be that sadistic but went through with it for you because it was your birthday and your pleasure  2 girlfriend is shocked of how you treated her it hurt and humiliated her and is now ruminating and reading between the lines  3 girlfriend is shocked of your kink and how it made her feel more humiliated than hurt  4 girlfriend is shocked of your kink and herself for going through with it  5girlfriend is shocked of your kink and her enjoying if not most some parts of it but feels humiliated  6girlfriend cant get over the fact you made her feel and treated her like a stacy whore  7 she wanted to say the safeword but couldnt find the strength to do it or as you said if you filled her mouth orifice as well then she couldnt my gf told me when she lost her virginity it hurt her and she bled yet she couldnt voice it and tell him to stop tears rolled down her cheeks but her body felt weak at the new sensation of a painful sex act     also could be  ive had girls tell me that while they enjoyed more or less degrading kinks it was physically pleasurable but psychologically degrading and they felt like crying afterwards
  sadists are broken people with no empathy so it figures that theyd have trouble understanding why absolute humiliation and torture reserved for extreme sm porn would upset their partner  i bet youre one of those psychos who thinks he has to walk on eggshells around women because theyll claim rape at the drop of a hat
  she said do whatever you want they had a safe word op did nothing wrong
  legally no he is in the clear but his gf probably isnt autistic so he should take into consideration how she feels  hurr she said anything
   reserved for extreme sm porn  thats where youre wrong though she got him into a situation where it was implied she was going to tell him when they reached her limits do whatever you want to me can literally include rape play where no and physical resistance means keep going so how was he supposed to know she wasnt enjoying herself as well
  yeah i think you have to be upfront when looking for bdsm partners
  anon for normal and mentally healthy people everything in this context never means literally everything his gfs fault was not taking into consideration a possibility that her bf is a sick sadistic piece of shit she fucked up big time by trusting him basically
  so how was he supposed to know she wasnt enjoying herself as well  literal autism
  it was implied    this us why bdsm has a bad name no one with half an ounce of common sense goes all out when something is implied this type of shit must be discussed properly to avoid misunderstanding and miscommunication trying to defend a total fuck up is idiotic
  see fellas this is who women like this is who they go for the state of western women time to go mgtow
  man vows to disregard females for the seventh time this month
you can do whatever you want    this is the stupidest thing a bottom can say any sub or bottom that says they have no limits is naive    in truth you both fucked up her for not telling you her actual limits and you for not making sure what you wanted to do was ok negotiation is bdsm 101 sure negotiation isnt always sexy but its fucking important you should both be clear on what the scene is going to be like before you get into it and you should check up on the sub periodically to make sure theyre alright it can be difficult to remember to safeword out of the scene when youre in shock     all in all it sounds like a complete shit show and to the retards saying that this is a test issues like ops are what youre inviting into your life use explicit consent for this kind of shit
  dumbass she had no idea her bf is a deranged sadist because he never brought it up before
  this if i say do whatever you want to my body to my boyfriend im not going to expect him to pull out a knife and start cutting me up or eating slices of my flesh or some other sick shit to normal people that shit just means you can be a little rougher than normal not torture me physically and stick needles in my nipples and pussy ffs
yall are actong like crossing a line is an all or nothing thing op almost certainly went too far for comfort considering the way his gf is reacting but she probably didnt expect that and it may nkt have been to safeword level too far but in small gradations its easy to justify in the moment but afterward she probably thought gee that really was a bit much why did he want to do those things to me
  tbh im just tired of all the drama with women im a introvert so i dont need attention all that much i just wish there was a way to have kids without women with no social stigma
  how about being explicit in whats ok some women like being choked a bit with all the normalfag memes these days youd assume damn near every woman is into that but its not always so    if you want to roleplay the whole im at your mercy thing you should still have both partners with the same general expectations for the scene stop fucking implying shit have conversations how much rougher than normal is your sex going to be are you both on the same page because if your boyfriend has always wanted to slap you hard in the face during sex and you burst into treats when he does youve invited that upon yourself
  he didnt seem mean like all the other guys  yeah sure ive heard that before its not really hard to guess someone character just by looking at them yeah because someone who look like this is a nice guy
this is why kinks are degenerate
  seemed like you really wanted to hurt me  i dont get this shit of course he wanted to hurt you thats his thing god damn women need to stop thinking 50 shades of grey is a template for a healthy relationship
  tfw depressed cynical and cant enjoy the simple things in life anymore but dont watch porn
  its a choice men can always drop porn and just choose not to watch it
  kinks are fine people just need to stop playing games with signs and assumptions the bdsm community is all about explicit consent if the rest of the world followed that example we would see less rape shit like pic related was teaching guys that no means yes now with metoo and shit guys know that no means no but some women are still trying to play coy and undermine that
  this isnt a shit test you fucking retard failing a shit test is when a man submits to avoid conflict  op dominated her speechless    pins through her nipples  what the fuck op how does that help make either of you cum
  fuck i forgot to attach the damn image i should sleep
  holy kek id probably cry too
this is just part of girls playing into their rape fantasies dont pay it much attention i had an exgf who claimed i raped her even though she enjoyed it
  haha
  yeah you dun goffed
  what if he wanted to slice off a nipple and force you to eat it or pull your vagina outside your body and jerk off with it like a tenga egg what if he wanted to pierce one of your eyeballs with his cock    boundaries are important to establish when there are people with those fetishes and they repress them because of people like you who dont understand
  oh those poor poor people who have to hide their fetishes because the society just wont understand that the only way they can cum is to mutilate their partner wont someone think of their feels    people like you should be gassed
  im sorry youre into anal prolapse and vomit anon maybe one day your girl will let you mutilate her asshole
  said that i could do whatever i wanted  this is a test to see how well you know her and how much you respect her you failed miserably your relationship is over i dont think any formal charges will come out of this as it is difficult to prove what was agreed upon for the sake of this discussion the consensus seems to be to take your word on who instigated the cuffs but this is yet another thing that is difficult to prove
    seems like you were experimenting sexually you realized that youre not into that but you hurt her in the process we all fuck up from time to time own up to our mistakes and learn from them
  her ass is bright red right now and i have a really conflicted boner about it and i dont feel like i can comfort her while still having it  im sorry op but thats the funniest shit ive read all day
  how do i slightly abuse my husbando emotional abuse doesnt really do it for me and hes so much stronger than i am
  hot    you did nothing wrong dont worry about it      this is a test to see how well you know her and how much you respect her  lmao fuck off virgin
  unironically seek christ
  you guys are seriously overreacting
  get some help dude cause you are fucked up
  this is what happens when youre raised on internet porn
    go be gay your own way somewhere else
  the only thing you did wrong is here  i dont feel like i can comfort her while still having it  why the fuck not    i like having rough sessions with my girl where i call her a worthless dog make her crawl choke her slap her face punch her in the stomach etc she thoroughly enjoys all of it many women do its a cathartic feeling for them and they often cry afterwards but its crucial that once the sex is over you cuddle them and give them compliments so they dont think theyre actual worthless dogs if you do that theyll keep coming back for more
  she thoroughly enjoys all of it many women do    i dont think so tim stop watching so much porn and eating r9k memes
  thinks women are innocent angels who arent into rough sex  tells other people to stop eating virgin memes
  i dont think normal healthy women ie not tumblr sluts who endured child abuse multiple rapes and generally experienced spectacular lack of love and respect in their lives would enjoy being punched in the stomach and called a worthless dog for most sane chicks shit like this would be unthinkable and deeply disturbing to say at least
  ive been with more girls than the numbers of years that youve even been alive go greentext your mom or something instead      careful he might call you a roastie because you disagree with him
  exactly
  awwwww 3    hes a keeper
    im a sane boy no child abuse or anything and would completely be ok with what op did on the contrary most people would be uneasy to give me what i expect the bottom line is dont handcuff and pretend you are strong enough to take it if you arent its not my style to say its the girl fault when its not but here it is she tricked herself
i dont get why this guys relationship is necessarily over shell get over it in a few days
    agree  its a matter of discussing the event its just a misunderstanding if op says its what he thought she expected and he could completely be then the whole thing is absolutely fine
  im a sane boy and would be totally ok with having my ass stretched out to its maximal capacity my dickhead bitten and my nipples pierced and stretched with pins  doesnt sound like something a sane boy would want or enjoy you just have as pornaddled brain as op
  cringe man
  yeah abuse victims to unfortunately tend to stay with their partners      its just a misunderstanding    yeah whoops i accidentally raped you its exactly like when im groggy in the morning and use my gfs toothbrush instead of mine just a whoopsie daisy of a misunderstanding
  consenting rough sex is rape  wew
  do whatever you want to me   does whatever he wants   doesnt use safe word   yea this is bait
  did she really consent though or was she too shocked to react we cant know that
  
  this may be way out of the ballpark but here is what im guessing happened ops girlfriend probably has some kind of unresolved trauma that shes obviously trying to work out with this dominance role play thing abuse victims tend to be attracted to this kind of shit op probably acknowledges that shes a little fucked up but he goes along with it because hey she puts out and doesnt bring it up its most likely an unspoken aspect of their relationship so she misguidedly comes up with this plan that she thinks will make him happy but because of her unaddressed trauma she probably plans on just enduring it and blocking it out of her mind like she usually does they get going he gets out of hand she falls back into victim mode freezes and isnt able to say anything or move and just lets just him do his business op probably notices that something is wrong but keeps going because hes convinced himself that because she hasnt used the safe word shes fine she starts crying he plays the confused angle but he obviously feels guilty and obviously knows that he pushed it too far or else he wouldnt be here op is an insensitive prick and his girlfriend is an abused headcase who thinks that if she ignores her mental issues theyll just go away this event is just one of those times that shes unable to choke down her ptsd or whatever psychiatric issue she has like she usually does
      read the thread specifically this post        when people enter a state of shock they dont know what to do or cant do anything if the girl was aokay with it then she wouldnt be in tears and traumatized like her described
    fucking hell you guys need to stop being so soft and white knighty
  i missed the pins part i agree pulling that without previous agreement is sick the remaining im fine with it including slapping  insults    most of all it doesnt change the fact 1 it was her idea 2 she had a safeword and that is what safewords are for at the end of the day she got a few scratches for being dumb and careless and she got to know his inner fantasies its not the end of the world if you ask me although i admit im probably stronger than many when it comes to this    above all what makes me angry is comments where he should have done consensual sex instead no some people like it rough girls included and if ones handcuff herself you are safe to assume she wants it rough
   involontarily handcuffed myself accidently told my boyfriend to do everything he wants to me and accidently agree on a safeword accidently not telling him   rape
  why are you so obtuse and set on not comprehending a simple fact that everything does not literally mean everything in this context would be excused if he decided to amputate her limbs and gouge her eyes out only because she said beforehand that he can do whatever he wants with her and didnt utter the safeword
  im know im such a soibean because i dont rape my girlfriend haha i voted for hillary and play nintendo switch      she likely didnt think that her bf was a violent sadist so she didnt think that the implication of do everything he wants would include fucked physical and emotional torture she also didnt forget the safe word she was in too much shock to actually say or do anything    but no please go ahead and continue to try and justify this situation where a girl is crying after sex and its not rape
  why are pretending like he did anything close to amputating limbs and gouging out eyes
  not understanding context the sequel
  little bit of rough sex  violent sadist rapist torturer sending girl into shock  just stop posting for fucks sake its like that jew journalist claiming that shooting with an assault rifle gave him ptsd     justify this situation where a girl is crying after sex and its not rape  literally just google crying after sex
  what he did sounds quite violent especially pins and stretching part besides the point stands  everything is this context did not mean literally everything especially so because theyve never discussed stuff op did to her she probably expected some spanking because thats what passes as rough sex for most chicks
    if you are candid enough to believe everyones wet dreams is made of sweets and unicorn you will at some point make unfortunate discoveries    how difficult is it to utter no please i forgot the safe word or simply not agree on a safeword if you are afraid not to remind it so you can say no simply if you give your consent and take it back without telling how is the other supposed to know hes raping you     the most likely scenario is that she forced herself to go through this and that is not a rape if that is the case this is simply an unfortunate misunderstanding because she had to say no
  everything is this context did not mean literally everything  thats why they had a safeword  spanking what passes as rough sex for most chicks  nope    you keep acting like this girl is a helpless 2 year old kid man first time i had sex was with a 15 year old girl who wanted me to scratch her back so hard it leaves marks women know what sex is they know what rough sex is they know how to say no they know what bdsm is its all mainstream knowledge and theyre not shocked by the existance that stuff even if they dont want to do it real women arent innocent pure virgin anime women
      op himself fears for his relationship if not legal troubles and he hates himself and the girl was crying after sex likely trying to cope with this trauma and now the two of them are miserable    tell me more about how this is a winwin situation and a good thing and im wrong here please    also    how difficult is it to utter no please i forgot the safe word    again for the third time now when people go into shock theyre unable to say or do anything    the girl wasnt in shock its the jews fault    and again if everything was fine this thread wouldnt exist yall sound like r9k crossposters
    going with your assumption that everyone know what bdsm is      not every woman is into bsdm she certainly wasnt no    can you agree on that much or are you going to argue up and down the fuckin walls about this as well
  trying to cope with this trauma  people go into shock  youre never getting laid man      not every woman is into bsdm  no but knowing beforehand that it exists and cuffing herself and telling him to do whatever he wants and knowing what a safeword even is and for what purpose its used makes is more than clear enough that she wouldnt end up in a state of shock because of some rough fucking and that shed know to use to safeword to ask him to stop when she wants to you just stubbornly refuse to accept that theres people who are into rough sex    she certainly wasnt no  we dont know that theres women who cry after rougher sex and still enjoy it its hormonal and not even that rare
    i say this is unfortunate no winwin for sure but op did what he thought was ok to do and didnt mean to rape his gf    when i dont say anything as a bottom it could be as well im asking to go harder on me how could op know  maybe she was shocked but you are assuming here all we know is she didnt leave her consent aka its not rape i didnt say however the outcoming is fortunate    side note i despise r9k incels and am a happy faggot in a 2yr old relationship and if you put all your opponents in a same bag youre not worth any better
she probably realized mid sex omg i cant believe im fucking with this loser
  maybe she was shocked but you are assuming here all we know is she didnt leave her consent aka its not rape    consent is not written in stone someone can change their mind at any time it can be rape op himself feels like he fuckin raped her
  so arguing up and down the walls it is    not everyone even knows that bdsm exists because not everyone is a sex pervert who got bored of regular porn by the time they were 14 and had to get into that shit    we dont know that theres women who cry after rougher sex and still enjoy it its hormonal and not even that rare    we dont know that even though    this    op feels shitty his girl feels more than shitty but youre the only one sitting here being like nah dude its normal
  not everyone even knows that bdsm  lmao how sheltered are you    bored of regular porn  the whole slippery slope fallacy regarding porn is nonsense i had sexually sadistic tendencies even as a 12 year old kid who never even saw a porn magazine    this  if he gave her aftercare she wouldnt have complained nor have said that
only you know if it got to the point she didnt like    crying during sex happens for women its slightly normal
    at any time when it still time but she didnt she cried afterwards thats why op asked himself questions
  this ive been having rapey and sadistic tendencies as well from a young age you wouldnt know from looking at me but this shit has been on my mind since ive been 10 to 11 years old i would never act on it without a willing partner and i havent at 33 years
lmao u retarded op she just wanted anal
  this is obviously not real she would have said the safe word immediately
  gutter whore surprised shes treated as such by op  youre a degenerate but she has no right to get upset she got herself into that
  telling him he could do whatever he wanted  when you say that a guys first instinct is to do what ever the fuck he wants absolutely whatever they want that includes a hugely extensive list of things    you got lucky but i dont know anyone who could hear do whatever you want and still think theres some boundaries not to cross
no op you didnt rape her if she gave consent she may have been just overwhelmed mind sharing what all you did with her that could help us understand more
  hey op just flash the handcuffs and ask if she wants another go see how she reacts
dont listen to the people that say youre a monster like many said she didnt use the safe word politely comfort with her cuddling ie and softly talk about it but dont be too pushy
maybe she was abused sexually in the past and that reminded her of it when she didnt think it would try comforting her on that if shes comfy with talking about anything if true
it is possible to rape/abuse someone without intending to this being one example of which hell a lot of incidents of sexual assault sexual misconduct etc tends to be unintended its one of the main reasons why laws and college campuses define sexual impropriety off of whether the victim views it as such not the perpetrator even if the perp meant otherwise
theres a reason why when a woman says do what you want dont actually do what you want is commonly advised
what objects did you put in her
women and responsibility go together like matter and antimatter you shouldve expected this    gaslight her into not making accusations any way possible then find a reason to dump her
  terrible idea that would just cement accusations of abuse what op did was stupid but it wasnt illegal as long as he tells the truth hell be okay
holy damn doing all that given her reaction i dont wanna know the way she was acting during sex she was probably shaking and visibily scared  i want to puke just thinking about it i hope this really didnt happen
  would be excused if he decided to amputate her limbs and gouge her eyes out only because she said beforehand that he can do whatever he wants with her and didnt utter the safeword  yes if he gave her enough time to say the safeword beforehand
  you violated her body surely she was scared as fuck and her mind went numb she also felt cornered by her own words and probably shocked by what you were doing to her  like the other anon said everything doesnt fucking mean everything  how can someone be so unable to read such situation  op you make me sick
    op you absolute madlad so long as you arent as insane in normal life as you are in bed its fine she didnt say the safeword so its legit shell blame herself for a few days for going through with it and then return to normal just dont fucking kill her next time  i dont think shes one of the bdsm sluts though
  nice projection faggot i have some of the most vanilla fetishes of anyone i know so why not try a fallacy other than ad hom next round kay
  i unironically agree with you foids on this part
ops gf is going to break up with him and attempt to ride the cock carousel again but wont be able to enjoy sex with the chads because op ruined sex forever for her
  ffs anon you clearly deserved it
  when you say that a guys first instinct is to do what ever the fuck he wants  i would just be a little rougher maybe im boring unlike op
  she was probably too overwhelmed and shocked to say the safe word  too overwhelmed to say a word  this is just fucking stupid were talking about a fully grown adult here theres a reason safe words exist imagine how dumb this would sound if you reversed the genders
anon what was the safe word
  its still legitimate you know about the concept of fight and flight theres another response to stress which is freeze if the brain deems itself unable to fight or to flee it will freeze in response often resulting in dissociation this is a normal and natural response to stress that can happen to literally anybody including adults if youre literally tied to a bed youre gonna have a hard time getting your brain to do anything other than freeze    even with the establishment of a safeword it is good to go over stuff beforehand at the absolute least you should never ever cause bodily damage severe spanking needles bruising etc without strict discussion and consent beforehand and initiating slowly and with communication until its certain that its okay reality is very different from fantasy and things that seem okay can suddenly not be anymore    op you need to make sure you reassure her go into aftercare and make it clear that you will never do anything like this without her explicit consent to each specific act in the future you didnt intend to do harm but harm was done and its important to make sure that she knows that she is safe and can trust you thats the only way youll be able to repair this
  being unable to remember a word or to say it when you are shocked is absolutely natural its fucking stupid to think the opposite  i hope the gf gets help and dump the brainless child op is
  honestly dude its her fault for getting into that shit establishing a safe word and then not using it seems like she did it to be naughty and cool because its the in thing to be into bdsm not your fault she didnt know what she wanted op not to say you arent a total freak in bed but you did nothing wrong imo
  what is shock
  dude she literally got into this asking for him to do whatever he wanted which implies to men that the girl wants him to be rough even if she acted scared or shocked during it how the fuck would op have known without the safe word role playing exist man
she is just a retard for establishing a safe word and then not using it
  this x1000000
  even if she acted scared or shocked  im no bdsm expert but maybe op should have picked up on it  other people who do bdsm here have pretty much established that consent always takes priority
  i dont to use this word a lot but yikes good luck on tinder in the future
  i dont think an average chick would expect stuff op did rather some spanking and hair pulling
  as far as op knows this is what bdsm is i dont watch bdsm at all and sometimes women ask me to dominate i honestly have no idea what they want me to do so i just hair pull and spank like you said i assume theyre crazy maybe op was just confused    lets ask op are you into this shit or did you just do it because you were told
  you do know that the clitoris is the most sensitive part of the female body and u literally said u bit it really hard which is the worst pain u can imagine u dumb fuck head get some basic knowledge before u do this stuff
  dont let these anons torpedo your relationship you two will probably be fine if you explain yourself as truthfully as you can she will probably will forgive you just point out that you didnt mean to hurt her and that it was purely sexual in nature
  you didnt mean to hurt her  meanwhile op abused the fuck out of her  but she will probably stay with the op because thats what abuse victims usally do
  yes because physical pain is always the worst thing in the world
  she was surely visibily scared during sex abuse and prolly shaking imagine keeping going on in that situation   everthing doesnt mean everything anyone with a brain would understand thats she was too scared to call it out this was abuse hopefully this thread was made by a kid with nothing to do
  im sure she wasnt in mental anguish when her bf broke the trust and abused her like a dog
  tells him to be rough  wtf why does this hurt im leaving you  either youre retarded a troll or extremely biased
  she got exactly what she deserved out of all the people who this could have happened to she was probably the best candidate for it its hardly abuse when she deliberately and unambiguously whored herself out in the first place
  what are you about you nutjob she had sex with her bf how is that whoring herself out
  wtf are you on about
    learn how to read situations dummies also   what are different graduations of pain  imho this was abuse and some of the replies itt make me wanna puke
  i read it fine you are assuming the worst from a nervous depressive wreck i cant begin to tell you how stupid that is  in all likelihood she feels betrayed when all that went wrong was a miscommunication and wrong assumption
  in all likelihood she feels betrayed when all that went wrong was a miscommunication and wrong assumption    good you understand that this was rape tons of rape situations go like this op is retarded and couldnt notice how scared the girl was during abuse given her reaction i dont wanna even think about itprolly shaking or didnt move at all lime a corpose and he didnt stop call it for what it is otherwise you are really messed up
  i wouldny call it rape because she consented and didnt revoke the consent but it was definitely real abuse
  ah biased it is im sorry that happened to you / your loved one but it simply doesnt apply here
  op did not say that she was shaking
  how dumb do u really have to be in order to be that dumb
  mmmh i see where you are coming from but theres the possibility her mind was too numb to recall it dunno tho    nice meme response why should i be biased i dunno neither op or his now ex gf no one close to me got raped/abused i just know about average rape and abuse dinamycs which you cleary know nothing about    given her reaction im pretty positive her body was giving enough hints  anyway the fact he went on and did all that stuff taking everything literally show how much of a retard he is he shouldnt have gone full sadist
  i dont even know what to say to such hubris
  sorry i got too carried away w/ provoking i myself am not too sure how much to condemn op because what you stated   in all likelihood she feels betrayed when all that went wrong was a miscommunication and wrong assumption  but i do think op abused her  bcuz thats one of the dinamycs abuse manifests sorry for provoking you
i love how this thread is still up like two days later or whatever and op feels like he raped her and she for sure feels like she got raped but youve still got these chucklefucks running around like op did nothing wrong and i will argue about until my last breath if you disagree with me youre both a roastie and a virgin somehow
  i understand m8 its a confusing situation to say the least he certainly isnt without error but personally i dont think he intended to be abusive beyond what he thought she was allowing thats where i believe the miscommunication lies no clarification was made on what was allowed so he assumed everything was allowed a mistake for sure but an understandable one
    bf  sex  thus whoring oneself out hedonistic sex without commitment and she went the extra mile by coming up with the ridiculous tied to bedpost scenario in the first place if this were say a wife telling her husband offhandedly at one point you should surprise me sexually or something like that and then op did exactly this without warning that would be extremely fucked up and could certainly count as assault if not fitting the bill for abuse since its a oneoff event but she set up every part of this situation on her ownincluding the conditions for its end which she didnt use       it wasnt abuse by any stretch of the imagination she chose that result i said in my first post op is obviously a degenerate and that isnt in question here but he got a full green light both before and during his exploration of depravity its not his fault shes too stupid to remember the safe word      strictly referring to the boundaries of the act op didnt do anything wrong the act itself is wrong and so is the situation but thats not whats in question
  not the person youre replying to but imagine youre a girl who puts her absolute trust into someone that she thinks she knew well enough to handcuff yourself to a bed and think that like the most extreme thing hell do is stick his tongue up your asshole or something but instead he literally shoves needles in your body like some cia interrogation technique    that is perhaps not an understandable mistake to most people
  shut up i never talked to you why are you posting with a tripcode like some r9k reject
  maybe she shouldnt have handcuffed herself to the bed
  i have my own reasons although unfortunately ive seen a lot of tripfags cropping up lately call me a faggot by all means i may very well be one that doesnt mean what i post is wrong
  literally her fault if i was handcuffed to a bed and some chick put a needle near my nipple i would say the safe word
  i did imagine something like that and i still feel the same never assume these things unless you explicitly know them  its quite obvious that they havent much talked about their kinks before otherwise she would never agreed to it im not trying to shift the blame but making assumptions like that always leads to problems especially when you give such vague instructions as she did    why do you wear the tripcode it just discredits you
  lawful neutral hitler saves the day once again
  like it was said maybe 15 times throughout the thread people freeze up when theyre in shock she more than likely forgot the safe word or was unable to say it at all    you can go ahead and try to argue that she wasnt in shock at all or whatever just repeat what this entire thread already said two or three times over
  its pretty established by more experienced users here that panic makes you forget the safe word
  youre a faggot an attention whore and youre wrong bye bye now time to filter you
  thank you  the gaslighting of rape in this thread is bad ex gf felt traumatized after and op felt like he raped him wonder whats the conclusion thats why i dont feel bias saying it was rape      mmmmmh thats very well thought anon and know i understand where you are coming from  but still i do think it was given that imho everything doesnt really mean everything  i think   is ironically true   also the fact op felt like he raped her and her reaction afterwardss clear any doubt to me    i know you could it call an ugly misunderstanding but to me its very important to call it a very least abuse and even there i feel guilty bcuz to me its rape   anyway sorry for the childish way i attacked you your resposne was very mature    same resposne to hitler everything doesnt mean literally everything
    well then how about this it is literally her fault no matter how shocked she was she put herself in that situation she asked for bdsm and she got bdsm  tough titties you thought you would be cool and cute and offer your boyfriend to dominate you without even being into that maybe women should start appreciating vanilla sex instead of inviting men to do shit like this if they dont like it personally  like if you get drink and drive and then crash its your fault for drinking and driving
  why do you wear the tripcode  sparing you the boring details people are much more willing to argue about the same topic if they perceive their opponent as a new one if i have a trip repeats are much much rarer theres also the issue of impersonation and with opinions that are extreme relative to the norm its hard to tell them apart which is what got me to switch in the first place   i dont always use itbut you only notice when i do obviously its a balancing act because i cant just spew nonconstructive negativity with the trip but if i always have it regardless of its relevance that certainly is attention whoring    as to discrediting me in the logical sense it doesnt but ill give you that it comes with a steep cost the recent upsurge of tripfags on /adv/ makes me wonder if i should stop posting with the trip exclusively for a while to see how it goes      at your service  methinks im closer to chaotic neutral      thats your choice i do thank you for not asserting im wrong because im a faggot though
  no it was op fault for not understanding everything doesnt mean everything
  dumbest shit i ever heard  i bet you also think yes doesnt mean consent
  everything doesnt mean literally everything  i mean permanent physical harm is a neargiven in terms of being offlimits but there are people that get off to all sorts of things much worse than what op did the argument here is essentially that hes a rapist because he isnt telepathic which doesnt make any sense
  i actually agree she was expecting less its silly to think she didnt i just also think it was silly to explore her bfs kinks this way both parties have made a mistake but the letter of the law would side with his gf i understand the overreaction its 4chan after all it is hard to have a civilized discourse on here    you make a pretty compelling argument actually i dont fully agree but it makes sense
  she asked for bdsm    no she literally didnt      the argument here is essentially that hes a rapist because     op himself feels like he raped her youre the one trying to argue what he feels he did and what we agree he did
  how about you leave the trip on so we can go back to filtering you thanks     its a balancing act because i cant just spew nonconstructive negativity with the trip    you call yourself literally hitler and take pride in having extreme opinions go back to r9k and take your tripcode with you
  damn dude you talk really fucking gay  im gonna put a trip code on for you to block
  slow clap  these are the kind of people berating op do you really want to be on their side
    guys im sorry read the thread  it doesnt take telephaty to understand everyrhing doesnt mean shove up everything into my ass   also again given her reaction she was prolly visibly scared also learn how to read situation    sorry guys this got loopy the she wanted anal and  got the true      i understand the overreaction its 4chan after all it is hard to have a civilized discourse on here    thanks for being understanding anon however i want to not do that anymore its really unnecessary behaviour also for a better 4chan
  thank you i do apologize if the trip is annoying i already try to limit the number of tripfags in a thread and if theres more than one other i probably will take the trip off before posting    if he wants to turn himself in for rape despite getting explicit consent and not being told to stop at any point more power to him i dont mind if he gets locked up i just dont understand why the onus of the act is put solely on him    i dont take pride in having extreme opinions i take pride in not caring whether theyre called extreme or not so long as i feel theyre still justified /r9k/ is a shit board too
  no no keep the trip so we can filter you out
  making extremely addictive things incredibly easy to access leads to addiction surprisingly if youve ever had any strong addiction youd know its not as easy as just choose not to watch it
  dont worry im not abandoning it entirely not yet at least
  it is very easy but modern men lack basic willpower stamina and balls to ask out real women and have real sex
  it is very easy  if youre just going dismiss addiction so easily without even bothering to provide a counterargument youre not worth talking to my mistake
  to a better 4chan anon we dont have to be a hug box but that doesnt mean we cant be civil    i think your decorum when it comes to posting sounds reasonable personally i think the value of your words is more important that the discourse that follows idek what you were talking about originally but i feel we simply wouldnt agree on it either way
  they consciously decided to a start watching porn in the first place and b keep watching more and more of it addiction to some point is a choice many people can go cold turkey and just stop but for that you need some willpower and porn addiction is not the same as substance addiction
  cheers

has op come back to this thread or was it bait all along
cute girl at work stories thread ill start  be me  be 18  work at office supply store its a pre popular store in aus called officeworks  have a crush on girl that works in the print and copy department  she knows i like her because i told her over text but she had a bf at the time  about a week ago her bf breaks up with her  oh god oh fuck yes  one day she approaches checkouts where i am working for the day  she looks at food and i make joke about how she doesnt need it   its ironic because she is skinny af  buys chocolate balls  we joke around and have a laugh and all is good  she offers me a choccy ball  do you want a malteser  my bi polar personality kicks in  i say in a really stern voice  no i dont  she says oh and walks away    i fear i am among the rarted
  op assuming that this isnt a bait thread this happened days ago already what happened in the meantime how is your gf
if youd never done anything like this before you really should have played it safe the first time and/or checked in every now and then to remind her she can use the safeword you can integrate this into dirty talk so easily its also really important to do aftercare when youve put someone through the ringer like that when youre physically exhausted youre emotionally raw thats primo bonding time if you play your cards right but if you make a misstep it can really fuck things up
  punch her in the stomach  this is the only bit that weird me out being punched in the stomach fucking hurts
  ops girlfriend probably has some kind of unresolved trauma  indeed what kind of trauma must she have suffered to react poorly to having pins put through her nipples  
  i told you to do anything you wanted and you seemed like you really wanted to hurt me    reminds me of this  
  we cant know that  and neither can op the possibility that she experienced rape doesnt necessarily make him a rapist in this specific scenario both of them are just retards she shouldnt have set up a scenario where he thought anything was on the table and he shouldnt have gone all out and taken her saying anything at face value without ever checking in    and judging from  and  she isnt even necessarily traumatised by what he did its possible she intentionally didnt say the safeword and was just put off by what kind of kinks op revealed himself to have we simply dont know its schrodingers rape    but at the end of the day op was the one in a position of power so by default the onus was on him to keep things safe theres a legitimate scenario of forgetting the safeword or being too shocked to use it when someone you thought you could trust is suddenly coming at your tits with pins theres not really a legitimate scenario for spontaneously piercing your girlfriends flesh and never bothering to even throw in a lazy you like that for any sort of confirmation that shes okay
  this has already been said in a few different ways by other anons but im still going to try to lay it out as clearly as i can she told you to do anything you wanted because she trusted you to keep her safe even if she were to give you complete control over her you completely and utterly failed to do that based on what youve described its like you totally forgot that you were dealing with a human being let alone a girlfriend youre supposed to value above others
my friend knows someone who sells pot brownies but he wont tell me who it is so i cant buy one he said hed get me one when he gets one if i give him money but he doesnt smoke as often as i do and i want it sooner idek if hell buy one    i need to find this guys number or snapchat but dont know how to ask my friend for it    help
video games were basically my life i never developed social skills or pursued other hobbies now ive lost interest in games what do i do to pass the time ive been napping a lot lately
  how old are you
  exercise read books study languages get parttime job go out to events dont get discouradged just because it is hard in the beginning
do you not know what porn is either that or go to a library or coffee shop build your social skills
  ignore this retard porn is cancer take up a hobby or sport and invest yourself in getting good at it same thing happened to me about 3 years ago started wasting tonnes of time on youtube decided to take up boxing and obsessively pursued it training 5 days a week now i no longer feel bored i look way better and i know how to use my hands if i ever get into trouble
  archery
is it true that porn can densitize you to the point where you hardly get a boner without it    what are your experiences and how many times should i masturbate a week
it cant do that to me i look at porn for 1/2 to 8 hours a day every day
  men are so patheticthere is really nothimg more to your existence than playing with your cock
  theres nothing more to your existence than putting other people down and leeching off of them
its probably not porn but jacking off thats harmful i watch porn regularly but i never masturbate and ive never had a problem getting it up
  everybody has hobbies
  whats the point of watching porn without jacking off to it you stupid retarded bald monkey
  i jerk it 5 times or more a day usually and can still get super hard when i need to or sometimes dont need to
  you cant really listen to anyone whos younger than like 28 or something because every single one of them was raised on the internet and was watching porn since they were like 11 years old and they dont know any better theyre also still all teens and in their early 20s so of course for the most part theyre not likely have issues getting hard unless theyre really out of shape    so yes it can absolutely desensitize you and more importantly it can absolutely warp and destroy your perception of what a normal sexuality is like right down to what real sex is like thank christ i didnt start watching porn until i was like 17    i cant tell you how many times a week you should beat off you try it just stop watching porn and see how often your dick starts acting up on its own and gets in the way of you doing things and then just deal with it like the medical condition that it is
  im the first poster and im 32
i 2 times a day every day and i feel like shit 3 days into this then i stop for 23 days and go back to it i memba back when i was a young buck and i could fap ten times a day so this is what being an old bastard feels like
  right so youre about my age and unless you were one of the cool kids to get the internet back in 95 or whatever then you likely got internet at home in your late teens as well     even back then if you searched like naked boobs or whatever youd usually just get tame websites nothing like all the weird extreme shit that ends up on the front page of major porn sites because dumb zoomer teenagers are already bored with regular porn    but anyways for me its like twice a week if my boner is keeping me up at night or i get hard in the shower just by cleaning myself then i rub one out and get it over with while staring at the ceiling or the walls and thinking about my ex gf or whatever i didnt quit porn 100 but ill maybe watch it like once a month or two and then immediately regret it after i nut
    says the fucking leech who gets plowed by cum
         i too would like to hear the answer to this
  women really werent gifted with capable minds
  i can ejaculate to porn daily sometimes more than daily and still be able to pop and keep a boner for 30 minutes of sex it really depends on the person though most nofappers are low test and so any fapping at all will cause them to be shit in bed
    i just like looking at the girls imagining how they feel and watching the guy to learn how i can make a girl feel like how he she does porn is mostly a learning experience for me although it has taken a rather horny turn lately     and fuck you i just always though jacking off was weird didnt bother touching my own dick till i was like 20 or 21
  i mean that depends torture breaks people daily car crashes kill daily guns misfire fatally daily    just not all of them if you let it anything will rule you if you dont nothing can really rob you of that except hardcore drugs
  why did you 2 separate   could she not keep up with you or you stopped having interest in her
  artificial wombs and sexbots when
25  used to torrent cp at 14  torrenting hardcore porn and tons of hentai for years  years of 4 daily faps  settled to 23 faps a day now  well its not like ill ever need to get hard for a real girl anyway
yeah porn can definitely do that i can attest to it granted i was a virgin up until about two years ago and spent 5 years before that fapping probably 3x/week i believe studies show that people who look at porn are more depressed have lower testosterone levels have less physical desire for real sex and really that goku meme is funny but it does waste time i can say that while i still struggle with depression its better and everything else is as well  think of all the time you could spend learning to play an instrument perfecting your cooking skills working out or even reading a good book  good luck though anon it is an addiction and its not easy but make sure youre working out that really helped me
  sorry to tell you this but porn has a reputation for being unrealistic
    will you be my gf and keep me in a chastity cage to prevent me from playing with my cock
  wanking can desensetize you so that you cant get a boner at all happened to me ive been working the past weeks to fix that
  maybe for you mr baby dick
  its not like ill ever need to get hard for a real girl anyway  pretty much this who cares about the effects of porn when youll never have no chance with real girls anyway  oh no i dont watch porn because im saving my dick for when i meet my first woman at 40 years old  good stuff
age 31  live in apartment building   have a job making six figures   can barely afford anything sometimes since i just have to pay bills   only a few grand saved    im a loser right
  move out of the city retard
  where to i need to keep this job mb  bump
  kinda reminds me to figth club society told him all he needed was a nice apartment designer clothes and a job and he will be set for life
how to get over weird stuff ive done and move on from my past  its mainly sexual stuff weird stuff ive masturbated to and weird stuff ive done while masturbating feitsh shit tying my ankles together ass play bdsm shit  feel like a freak and i just want to be normal
  just want to be normal  but thats just denial come back to /d/ youre not alone
  that is very normal stuff lots and lots of people have experimented with that stuff they just dont talk about it in everyday conversation
  nah man it got pretty bad  i had a foot fetish and i sniffed my own socks i hoarded porn and had a lot of it used to masturbate to girls facebooks a lot traps and sissy shit armpit fetish used to join discord servers and talk about it   why am i so degenerate
  oh well tried to help guess youd better die
  wwhat 
  i jacked off once in a weird way  thats normal  nobody does this but me  they all know  lol thats all you dude
  it was a lot  like for a year i had these fetishes and i did some freaky shit    i appreciate the kind words maybe im not such a freak after all my life has been pretty stress free recently so maybe im just looking for reasons to get depressed
  have you considered building a love doll made of every weird onahole i only ask because if you can convince a manufacturer to make one id also be interested
  nigger i grew up with usenet in the 90s i was jerking off to shit in 1994 that i still wont talk about you went through an edgy phase and wanted to smell armpits its literally all in your head what youre feeling right now
  you sound quite addicted reduce watching porn to once a week max jerk off to fantasy or girls in bikini or something  you will be able to move on
  alright man thanks for the advice i hope i can move on  i didnt jerk off for a week last week and i jerked off yesterday to my imagination of me fucking a cute girl i know  it felt good and i didnt regret it afterwards  how many times jerking off in a week would you say is normal
  7
  what does this mean lol is it an insult or are you saying youre more fucked up than me
  i am the one who posted that about reducing porn i do it 45 times a week
  what does lol mean  and 4chan comes full circle
  im asking what he meant by saying about the onahole thing
  ive been on 4chan since /g/ was at one point guro then loli then technology i have seen things on the internet i cannot unsee and refuse to describe or direct the curious to i was an adult then and now i am older and a love doll with armpit vaginas nipple cunts foot pussies handginas dickpussy and additional rows of breasts isnt the end game but it is a good start am i more fucked up anon i dont consider myself fucked up at all merely less than fully satisfied    now consider yourself in context with me youre just a vanilla fuck whose done some pretty bogstandard fetish stuff youve not even begun upon the path
attention everyone    excuse me     he posted the copypasta again based and redpilled
  damn    what ive posted this before a few times but its not a copypasta
ive masturbated to extreme femdom many times and cummed in my mouth even managed to suck my cock when i was 12 its fucked but whatever you gotta accept it i guess you dont have to tell anyone
  me too not in the mouth but on my face  its not that bad to be honest  there are people who have shat in their own hand and ate it before
that stuff doesnt even sound that bad when you start learning about what the real freaks get up to it makes you feel less bad about being a freak you even become happy with the type of freak you are

how do i stop being a grumpy buzzkill normal everyday conversations bore/anger me this is mostly impacting my ability to form relationships
stop hanging out with npcs
  theyre everywhere
im planning to kill myself with helium on late january what should i do before that and wheres the best place to do it im thinking bali because its quite near to where i live and also cheap    so far ive only come up with these   leave some letter to my family and probably my recent ex that saying it wasnt their fault   selling all of my valuable stuff   deleting all of my social media and personal information on internet   probably spending a few days doing what ive always wanted to do like dancing with someone in a club or watching sunset on a beach before kms
   make sure you have all debts paid off   no unfinished business if you owe a favor do it   if theres anything anyone needs to know or needs saying nows the time   clean and organise your room / home as if you were moving   make sure all your chores are done    nobody wants to literally clean up after you once youre dead and you need to make sure everyone gets closure or theyll be bitter as fuck keep the selling / getting rid of shit on the down low cus its a fairly common sign    you shouldnt be doing this but you know that
  i dont have any debt or unfinished business with anyone that i know of and my room is always clean thanks anon
  my room is always clean  dont forget to organise it if you dont youre making someone have to go through all your sentimental shit after youve offed yourself if you label the boxes and shit like clothing paper work sentimental items itll make it much easier to get shit sorted also a will  theyll anyway be fucked up so fights will be more common make it easy for them and take away their choices even if you dont think you have much with fighting over im sure your family would probably disagree
just so you know note or not the recent ex is going to be haunted to some degree for the rest of their life theres no way a nonsociopath can avoid getting fucked up by somebody killing themselves right after they break up with them any nonshitbags in your family will wonder what they did wrong how they couldve helped you etc    also refer to my replies to a similar thread    
  dont forget to organise it  almost forgot about this one thanks atleast this way itll be easier for them to get back to their own lives      yeah i know i feel bad for her if she somehow still care for me and feel guilty for my departure altough i was already broken long before i met her
  its not necessarily even about whether she still cares about you she could think youre a piece of shit and itd still haunt her in some way guaranteed  sorry id be more gentle about this but if youre suicidal im not pulling any punches trying to persuade you
if you are doing all this preparation then you dont want to kill yourself you want attention go see a therapist
ohhh boy i need some advice baaaaaad sorry but this story is too long for greentext  basically my heart is divided between two women and i dont know what to do or who to go for i havent been in a serious relationship in years and i really want that to end     first there is k she is a friend of friends ive known her for years but most of that she has had a boyfriend they broke up a few months ago and whether it be wanting a rebound or if there were feeling all along she showed her interest in me me not being a complete idiot took notice we have kissed and made out but nothing sexual se lives 400 miles away however and i do not know how often i will ever see her though i am seeing her this weekend but i dont think sex will be involved    then theres l oh boy she is a coworker and since she has started working there about 3 years ago ive had the maddest crush on her we would flirt with each other any chance we could get until finally i asked her to lunch last valentines day she initally said yes seeming fairly excited about the idea and i thought this was it for me but a week later something happened and gave me the work is complicated line and for months after that we didnt talk it wasnt until last week that i found out she had been seeing another coworker and no one at work wanted to tell me needless to say i was devastated but i carried on now this week something had changed it seems like she is showing interest again and even in a passing comment yesterday told me he is pissing me off so much and today she recolored her hair and made sure she looked beautiful i am also getting subtle hints from other coworkers that it might be worth trying for    i have much stronger feeling for l im sorry k but if i had to chose i would chose l the chemistry is unreal but i can tell that k does care for me and is undeniably interested there is still so much to this story but that is the most of it
  not even gonna bother read this whole wall of text ill just tell you one thing if you dont know whom you like more and want to be in a relationship with you are not ready or mature enough to be in any relationship think this thru mate
  l is a backstabbing thotty and will definitely cheat on you/spread rumors and made work terrible for you her having already dated another coworker making things even worse ignore    k isnt worth dating of shes 400 miles away but if shes coming all that way to visit she def wants to fug pump n dump then wait for a new person to come into your life
in my mind people secretly judge me and i think they think im retarded ugly or what not altough no one said a single word like this im extremly isolated and i spend most of my time in front of pc despite having succesful interactions at my university i feel like there is something wrong with me i take pictures of myself all the time and at the moment i think to myself damn im ugly then i go home a couple hours passes i watch those pictures again and i look completely normal i have fears of having cross eyes bad breathe not being smart enough etc recently my mind is having trouble of gasping reality its like im living but life has changed i legit thought in todays statistic class that it doesnt matter what i or others do we are just robots and not even in control of ourselves i have a presentation coming up also and im anxious i experience anxiety daily very strongly i recently decided to quit coffee and see if it helps
  people do judge you but not as harshly as youd think think about how much it would require before youd judge someone as completely retarded or ugly would take some extreme examples and quite a bit of time to determine that right as for the presentation just go in with the mindset that what you have to say is of importance pretend if you have to you will be surprised at how people respond to your talk if you just posture and just act as if you own the fucking place
  know that one of these days youll get tired of overthinking and criticising yourself make the best of that day you can chose to engage in destructive behaviour or you can take the opportunity to improve i chose the former fyi
scared of dentist have cavities wat do
  go to dentist
  leave it  get infection  die
  bump
  cut all sugar out of your diet and clean up your diet teeth can remineralize if given the proper environment and nutrition
  me too bro except my problem is not that im scared of the dentist im scared of the cost of seeing the dentist with no insurance and im too shiftless to get insured not to mention i have to pay a fee to the irs every month for being uninsured last year which means that id have to pay for that and the monthly insurance bill in short im a lazy cheapskate who lets his teeth rot in order to save time and money
  dont fucking bs him man  yeah teeth can heal to an extent enamel can be restored but cavities dont just heal like that once theyve started its only down hill until you get treatment  you should be more concious of your sugar intake consider a trip to the restroom to rinse with water after dessert in places you cant brush      i feel this on a deep level im 29 i had a massive fear of dentists all through my life i took poor care of my teeth when i was younger which resulted in a ton of cavities now im missing a tooth and will need 45 more pulled if im being honest with myself in order to get back to a healthy mouth  but im afraid afraid of dentists and now that im older afraid of the cost  couple that with the fact that i cant stand the idea of anything less than permanent implants and well there you go    my only saving grace is that my issues are all in the back of my mouth its quite literally not visible to people unless i show them so i can at least socialize and be normal without repulsing people it is becoming increasingly difficult to eat however and i worry how much longer i can continue as normal      i went to the dentist a while back and got some very minor work done for free by college students for their graduation its really not so bad if its a minor cavity honest you will wonder what you were ever afraid of if thats all it is    fix your mouth op dont be like me i hate myself everyday because of this
  im not bsing him youve obviously never heard of weston price im not surprised though modern dentistry is scared to death of his research and has done a good job burying it cavities can be reversed
  wack im in the same fucking situation except i have healthcare just not dental care but im in pain and one tooth is infected so i need to go in soon i guess i can do a payment plan with a local dentist explain i just cant pay all at once and i really need treatment and it should go well im just worried and i have really liked time off from work too
  there are dentists who specialize in phobic patients theyll knock you out for a simple exam if you need it of course they charge more but it may be worth it
been living a fuckboy lifestyle  sometimes didnt use a condom  now diagnosed as hiv positive    is life over for me
    if you can pay for treatment youll live a long life as long as you have the money
  obviously the fuckboy lifestyle is over for you unless you want to get sued for infecting someone with hiv without them knowing
if you dont bring in a sufficientenough salary then yes youre fucked because hiv medicine is so damn expensive and you have to take it periodically so itll burn through your pockets or you could always want to die faster and more painfully    also some partners filter hiv people like you out of their dating pool so if you find your so just hope she is a fetishist or has hiv as well so good luck     tfw a hedonist gets it
how many sexual partners have you had  how many times without a condom 
    one day maybe not in the near future but some day this shit will be eliminated and we can all experience love and pleasure freely     unless you are a creepy and undesirable man who deserves to die unloved but that is a different story
  just kill yourself and get it over
  tests are not 100 reliable
  based hiv teaching fags and fuckboys their lessons
    shut the fuck up youre a bitter virgin who cant get laid and takes it out on people with a serious illness you are pathetic and should realize that every word out of your mouth smells like shit
  i do have money i just think my fucjboy lifestyle is over      this      where can i find other hiv people people dont just post about their hiv statuses in their tinder profiles      over 50 been hooking up a lot when i was on exchange i dont wear a condom around 1/4 of the time      then which tests are reliable
  at least i dont have hiv lmao
  fuck off incel faggot have a little of respect for op back to plebbit where you belong
  i have zero respect for op if anything hes given my disdain for his lifestyle legitimacy and proven me right i think you and him would both find more support on reddit
      how can one man possibly be so based
  no but thats really shitty
  this is the biggest bullshit ever did you fuck someone in the ass without an condom
  which test are reliable  multiple tests actually that is a matter of probabilities
  search in the net i am sure there are sites that help hiv people hook up
  your only worth will be getting fucked in the anus by other gays from this point forward
you deserve it talk shit get hit it took getting hiv to make you realise this was an unhealthy lifestyle
i think of her and think about pic related    i think about my future and think about pic related    i think about everything and it always comes back to pic related    i go to college i workout i have friends but i still can never stop thinking about pic related and how im not happy
  you probably have real depression go to see a psychiatrist
  you are ungrateful the worst kind of person there can be
  damn bro now im thinking about the pic related i guess its like a virus
how the fuck do i get rid of my moms friend shes been here for a hour shes so fucking annoying
  what do you mean
move out you fat neet
  fuck her
she wont shut the fuck up and her baby is screaming im getting fucking mad because i can here them even with headphones on
  kill/abduct them
how do you guys deal with bad thoughts  ive always had them and sometimes acted on them   im over 30 and i like to use young 1820 y/o fucked up girls like not rape but have unhealthy sexually relations i also think about this alot  even now ive met this awsome girl my age great sex and chemestry and all that i stil think about them young nasty girls lolfucking them up the butt while chocking themam i sick
  no you are honese every man want to grab and impregnate a young girl it is our primary biological directive after all up the butt and choking is just an additional anomaly aka fetish     anyone else denying it is a liar
  thanks man i guess i knew that allready but still its good to hear
is it normal to blackout from an orgasm my bf was out cold for about a minute while we fucked and for a dumb moment i was worried i killed him or something
  is it normal to blackout  it is not causes can be varied and some can be serious consult a physician
  not a bad way to go
no he should get that looked into
this is low key bait next posts will reveal ops bf is passing out from blood loss because he has a third leg
  sometimes i get dizzy and see black for a few seconds but ive never heard of guys passing out
how do you fight ocd i know its just going throught the intrusive thoughts but its a lot easier said than done    anyone with any past experience who can help me out
  my wife has some mild ocd shes not medicated but she feels the need to constantly pluck hair from her face visit her relatives or else they might die and shell cook food over and over thinking she messed it up and has to start again    ive just told her to be open with me about her feelings and not to hide it when shes having an episode we talk through it and normally shes able to see shes just acting weird and things arent as bad as she thinks and we should just continue with whatever it was we were doing
multiple therapists and professionals suspect that i have a foodrelated form of ocd i was a bit surprised but not that much because the one im seeing currently already knows im anorexic and bulimic
i havent fallen in love since 3 years ago and i think i wont be able to fall in love for some years to come does anyone here live like this is this normal
yeah i fell in gay love for a guy 10 years ago after feeling id never fall in love amd havent felt that way since it didnt work out and it feels bad but i think existence is so short and meaningless that well be ok bro/sis 
dude what three years is like yesterday
  im actually ok with this and im sorry that it made you feel bad but im curious to see if this is normal im a bro btw    it feels like it is some time but i have the impression that it seems longer than it really is because ive seen people falling in love and having relationships several times during that period of 3 years
  its alright man do you think you can live without an so if so dont worry about finding one just live life the way you want to live it whatever happens happens    if you dont think you can live without an so and worry about going back to an empty bed every night try to find things to distract yourself with dont think about it too hard just try to ignore it i recently realized i was not made for love and will never find anyone that is compatible with me but my own selfindulgence is not why im here i use that fact to distract myself from it all find something that makes you happy and try not to think about it at all    im sorry i wish i could provide better advice but for now this is all i can give
  for now im good without an so i have 2 main distractions which are music listening and producing and my college course maybe this one shouldnt be considered as a distraction but more as a priority i wonder if i didnt have those two things would i fall in love 3 years ago and more time ago i wasnt in college i wasnt deep into music and i was in love much more regularly
    dont be sorry pain isnt bad or good it just is feelings owe us no reason explanation or benefit remember that
  whether you allow yourself to fall in love and create opportunities for love to flourish is entirely up to you if you have those things youre focusing on and would rather not fall in love keep on them if you want to fall in love then perhaps move away from whatever isnt a priority and allow yourself more time to create those opportunities
i have never been in love since my middle school crush i am 31
say someone wanted to kill their gfs dog what would that person do
they would kill a dog which is a crime in many countries
  hit it in the head with a brick of it looks anything like the one in your picture
  why do you want to kill said dog op
  if  you mean until it looks like that picture
  xylitol is extremely poisonous to dogs buy a pack of mints or something made from xylitol itll be a goner basically the dog gets drunk and dies
  this is a horrible method its not just like getting drunk it willcause the dog to seize and its organs to shut down itll shit and vomit everywhere     take the dog to the countryside and leave it there
plenty of common food items for humans are toxic to dogs like  said though it will be a pretty miserable end for the dog pretty much any of these can lead to vomiting or possibly diarrhea and eventual death dark chocolate grapes  raisins onions garlic avocado dont ask me how much because i have no idea also theres the classic antifreeze poisoning
if they attempted to yes
take it out on her and kill her leave the innocent dog alone you prick
  wife grew up on a farm an saw this all the time just because you dont see what happens to the dog doesnt mean that it doesnt have a horrible death coyotes would tear dogs into shreds others would starve to death and eventually die wondering why their owners cared so little about them
why the fuck do you wanna kill some poor dog you asshole just fucking sell the dog or something behind her back or something good luck because if she ever finds out shell dump you in an instant pets win 99 of the time over significant others
hit up friend after not seeing her for months  we talked everyday  only irl friend  would ask her to hang like just once or twice a month since august  sorry anon cant hang im busy studying  same excuse every time  conniptionsjpg  try one more time  invite her to show  offer ride and pay for her ticket  says sure the day before  day of show  wait all day to receive response  nothing  too upset to go to show  receive shitty excuse text  say fuck it im done  finally just say how i feel for once  now feeling guilt  how do i stop feeling guilty for deciding not to put with this kind of bullshit anymore i should add there were no romantic feelings i just wanted a friend
make a new friend guilt gone
its done stop talking to her youve made your bed now lay in it    the worst thing you can do in this situation is back down and try and make things the way they once were they never will be the same again save yourself the pain
  you shouldnt feel guilty at all about losing such a shitty friend it will pass if you let it
  just wanted a friend   get some bros then lol
  bros only started hitting me up when they found out i bought a car
  dont feel any fucking guilt for what you did stop communicating with her and go do other things
  by making another friend like    said    also take a good note on this that you should never trust girls to just show up they are flaky as fuck and throw bullshit like this on the regular offer to pick them up and if they put obstacles or excuses in front of you for that then they definitely didnt want to actually go anyway they were just enjoying the emotional ride of being asked to do something
  this if youre not going on a date with a girl hell even if you are sometimes theres a good chance they might come up with some excuse some girls just want to be polite and dont want to outright say they dont want to go somewhere but they appreciate the fact they were asked so they dont wanna seem mean or whatever its frustrating sure but dealing with women can be that way if you dont know what youre doing
  why didnt you hang out with them then
  pro tip dont make friends with girls  even asshole bros are better    this bitch said my roommates and i watched spongebob she chose that over a show that was paid for already dude how are you feeling any guilt right now
  cut communication and go do other things
she probably realized you were disgusting incel dreaming of having sex with her girls can smell desperation from miles away
  with that sort of behavior she probably wanted you to leave her alone as well that situation she left you in is just way too ice frigid cold for this im sorry stuff in that text i mean really i knew you bought me a ticket but you arent important enough for me to tell you i dont feel like going anymore because spongebob and even i cant believe she said this shit nusery rhymes on fucking youtube     give girls like one or two chances to hang with you then back off bud you cannot bond with them like guys where you can just keep trying and prove yourself
  sounds like she cares about her future more than your friendship anon tbh sounds like a reasonable perspective to me and i can totally relate to her lame excuse watching tv on the couch is a great way to unwind while conserving energy for more studying    even if she is full of shit theres no use getting too mad about it thats not going to help the situation and its not like there arent plenty of other people to hang out with oh wait    maybe the reason you dont have more friends is because you take this friendship business too seriously enjoy whatever opportunities you do get to spend time with people but dont expect as much from them in terms of commitment
i know im late but i learned a saying recently about girls    if they like you then they will make time no matter what for you even if theyre mid shower and hear the special ringtone they made for you go off they will jump out naked just to talk with you so obviously she doesnt like you that much bud no one is studying that hard with not one ounce of free time
  fuck that cunt leave me alone is a good place to leave it do not ever communicate with her again purge her from your thoughts and move on
  this
  precisely i know a girl that i asked out a year ago who responds to my text 10 hours or a whole day later giving me one word answers and sometimes not replying at all for days until i say something again weve gone on a few dates and it she seems nice but maybe thats her nature that shes just too nice and doesnt want to turn guys down often     i feel the same as op ive met worse girls who dont even dare to be seen in public with me but talk to me on the phone some girls just like the thrill ride of an instant gratification being wooed up for a temporary moment    truly these girls are a waste of fucking time
  dont feel bad dude grow a fucking spine shes a fucking bitch for doing that to you and theres no way around that
  every single time one of your cucks posts a screenshot of a convo the content is so cringy that it makes me livid
  you type like a female version of those guys on /r9k/
  yep this if she wants to make it work she will  otherwise all likelihood is she wants it to work for her
  case closed
  didnt you make this thread yesterday op     if yes then my advice is still the same plenty of fish in the sea if she wants anything or has any value for you shell come back if she doesnt you dodged a bullet
  case closed
you did well op
case closed
  you sound like a complete tool
  not op but i had something similar happen    constantly tried to get this girl i liked to hang out long story short she would agree and dodge going through with it one year later we end up working at the same place again opposite shifts but we see each other and she keeps going out of her way to talk to me i dont get it she either likes me because she sees ive changed or knows she can get attention from me
i got prank called by a restricted number from girls likely coworkers but i cant say for certain this whole thing has got me peeved and i wanna get back at them any advice or should i ask /b/
let it go but download a call recorder app and if it happens again contact the police non emergency line and state your being harassed
  will do anon
    wow you guys sure are two bitter assholes why not take it as the prank it was and joke back with them while on the call
  op sounds like he might literally have some form of autism
  depends on how actually mean the prank was  from his post it could very well be 50 autism or 50 actually being bullied at work    who knows
  it is not autistic to be annoyed by the insult of practical jokes it is a simple assertion of dignity
  corrective rape is the solution to uppity girls
  is it autistic to be annoyed by a strangers post on a imageboard full of autists
  no but it is natural to be annoyed by people who toss the word autistic around so loosely
  not op but fuck you and fuck your underage bullshit heres a relevant story   play eve online back in school/early uni   form a group of friends   later meet all but 1 joker guy irl   group becomes friends do yearly gettogethers with sos n shit   shit is good for 8 years or so   the one guy noone met trolls one of the group via sms pretending to be a girl friendly bants   sms is read by his gf instead   gf tries to message back using her phone exposing her cell number   joker keeps going trolling despite the pleads to stop   its a joke relax guys   friends gf has doubts that retards like this exist doesnt fully buy the story even tho all of us confirm   2 years pass   guy gets sum media recognition   joker goes into comment section and pretends hes a girl in relationship with him   confront joker bout this shit he denies it   next day friends gf receives prank phone call where a woman accuses her of stealing her man they married at this time   joker denies its him   everyone fucking knows its him   we fucking ban him from everywhere   joker floods everyone for weekend calling them white knights n shit   later calls to apologize to both the guy and his gf   too little too late  and thats how you loose your friends that you knew for half your life so yeah keep those pranks going its all a joke xddd
  calm down big boy all i did was ask a joke question and im not throwing around the word autist loosely everyday you see people with actual autism on this site so thats just a fact
  ok
  any advice  stop being a cry baby bitch and go to the gym
i wanna make a dating site but dont really know much about programming i know html and css well enough but never had a reason to program anything for any websites what language would be best to learn first for making a site like this php or javascript why
  tell us about your dating site idea
  do you have a friend who knows about programming who might be interested
  i dont have any revolutionary ideas or anything if thats what youre asking just a basic site is all i need to make if you must know i wanna make a dating site specifically for those into femdom ive seen one or two sites try it but they shut down rather quickly it just seems like a niche that i would like to fill as i havent found much of anything most dom/sub sites are scams or full of maledom from what ive found      i dont not one thats done this kind of programming anyways only programmer i know used perl to try and make a vn in high school and hasnt done anything since
  this might be one of those if you have to ask you cant kind of questions start smaller than trying to make a complex website with users and interactions between them
  its really an end goal sort of thing for me i have issue trying to learn something without having something to apply it to i have no intention of rushing things i know this sort of thing is delicate with all the user information its more just needing to know which direction to start in for me
  what i really meant to get at is that you will need to know how to google answers to your coding questions ignore the backend for now work on some simpler static websites in html/css and get that down properly first then worry about php
  ahh yeah i know how to google for specific things this just seems like such a broad question that i thought it best to ask advice i attempted to google a few various things but without knowing any specific details of my request i was just lead to a bunch of listicle shit about the best people or services to hire for shit back when i first learned html and css i was able to google specific problems and return with a result pretty easily
  javascript for a website is best
so ive always had big problems with studying and starting and finishing pretty much anything i think i may have had adhd since childhood and im pretty sure i do since most of the symptoms match  i want to visit a psychiatrist but mom is just fucking mad at me for not trying hard enough thinks i just dont have a work ethic calls me a parasite and says im doing it on to torment her and that im perfectly healthy but purposefully being a piece of shit the thing is i get wheres she coming from but i just cant fucking do it man most of things i do take considerable effort my assignments are always late and every day feels like im just fighting with myself  im tired anons i dont really know what to do now other than suffer maybe im not ill and maybe i am just a piece of shit i dont know im tired
do you jerk off how often srs question
  answer this op
  yeah its hard to avoid procrastinating  im just really bad at working now it seems
  usually about oncethrice per month i have some hormonal disorders too and pretty much no sex drive i dont really mind
when making a big decision is going with your gut feeling a meme or is there actually a valid reason for going with your gut
  youre a meme
  if things can be measured around the decision then that will help and you should be aware of it eg if you are moving somewhere new you should see what the new costs are in that area    but most decisions cant boil down to numbers so in the end you have to go with what you think will make you happiest
  ive made gut choices for a lifetime and now im jobless and suicidal  use your brain
hey turn the lights back on xont leave wojack all alone in the dark it gives him an existential crisis
this isnt /r9k/  you arent asking for advice  get the fuck out
  no leave it off so we can spot the glowers
when people ask me to go do something like go out for drinks or whatever i get paranoid and think they are joking and wont turn up just to prank me    whats wrong with me
h
  you have a low trust in people due to past experiences
having to explain the people that i dont drink smoke or go to parties  and no i dont want sex outside if a relationship  you have it easier
  you sound boring as fuck
either this     or you have low selfesteem  or both
i recently got ditched and i dont understand why    i dont say this on behalf of myself just what other people tell me im very caring in a relationship i like to spoil the person alot and i dont fear communicating everything like things i didnt like jealously anything like that i always find a way to put it in words and i rarely get to the point of fighting but even when i do i sit with the person ask if its a nice time to give the person a chance to procrastinate talking about it which happens alot and calmly try to address the situation without ever raising my voice my problem is anxiety but even then i take a beating for the person and control it for the both of us    well my last relationship ended with the person saying im too perfect and that i was never the problem but still couldnt go on the person slowly took distance and the more i told him id be here to support him always the more he went away i dont want to be spoiled im not used to things this perfect i feel fucking worthless and feel like ill never find a relationship where the person will like the way i am or wont step on me for being like that whats the worth in a relationship if you cant fight every week and hit your wife with an alcohol bottle because she keeps arguing right nice people arent fun or gives you any adrenaline rush i guess    where is my place in this should i change the way i am give less attention to my partner and demand more act more cold   theres no such a thing like a perfect relationship i guess but you can make it very close with communication and understanding the person but is that even possible
  you just need to find the right person for you    im the same way and i have had this problem twice its because the person you are with is too insecure and is afraid that youll realize how much better you are and leave so they decide to leave first and not get hurt which they will be anyway
one relationship failing is not a reason to abandon your values he was probably being genuine when he said im not used to things this perfect broken people tend to gravitate towards broken relationships     i feel fucking worthless and feel like ill never find a relationship where the person will like the way i am  this is the only thing id recommend changing a scarcity mentality when it comes to finding a romantic partner only leads to suffering there are plenty of fish in the sea theyre not always easy to find and you wont always find good ones but im certain there are many people out there that would love to have you in their life     dont give up hope due to bad experiences and try not to be results oriented just because you could have done something to make that relationship work doesnt mean you were doing something wrong you can only stick to your values and hope for the best
  its probably just an excuse for having met someone new/more interesting and the lack off guts to address it   like the other anon said dont sweat it you seem like a good person focus on your own well being and try to move on
  you made a boring gf thats all
get someone you rightfully deserve that wont do highschool level shit like call the cops on you whilst lying
theres a truth about human relationships which is not selfevident  people want to be challenged and loved at the same time a relationship with only positive interaction is bound to fail as much as a relationship with only negative interaction  mostly positive interaction is good but stability is boring people want to be bitten from time to time
  too nice is lies you are either ugly insufferable or unfuckable
  its probably just an excuse for having met someone new/more interesting and the lack off guts to address it    possible      its because the person you are with is too insecure and is afraid that youll realize how much better you are and leave so they decide to leave first and not get hurt which they will be anyway    probable      theres a truth about human relationships which is not selfevident  people want to be challenged and loved at the same time    correct      one relationship failing is not a reason to abandon your values he was probably being genuine when he said im not used to things this perfect broken people tend to gravitate towards broken relationships    also correct and related    based on info so far and assuming op is not crazy bitch then the dude is a child who is too afraid to face the responsibility of someone who was actually serious relationship material afraid of being judged afraid of putting in the work on himself and/or lazy as well
  its because the person you are with is too insecure and is afraid that youll realize how much better you are and leave  he was extremely insecure and beaten by life in multiple ways but i gave him reassurance often i never expected that would still be how things ended i was the one to break up actually in the terms that if he was going to stay closed in his own world and not accept any help like it has been for the past months i couldnt help      broken people tend to gravitate towards broken relationships   all the talk about treating a bruised dog is not worth it in the end     im just wondering and learning with that i dont mind helping a partner with problems and it makes for a strong bond sometimes but if i ever get in a situation like that again its better to let it go in the start        i actually wish those were concrete reasons because then id have clarification but its not even that    thanks to everyone btw im getting over it
  cope
  so you broke up not him this whole thread is a lie     based thot always bending the truth
  all the talk about treating a bruised dog is not worth it in the end    well not literally an actual abused dog benefits greatly from rehab    but its just an analogy when used for people whos troubles are far more complex
  so you broke up not him this whole thread is a lie  based thot always bending the truth    not op    i think youre over emphasizing the event of breaking up as a formal announcement/declaration if someone renders themselves completely unavailable to the partner that is functionally no different than breaking up with them because the terms of the relationship have dissolved from their mutualness
  a little bit of a white knight shines through just a lil bit we only have her word she did say she was ditched turns out she broke up weather he really was emotionally already broken up is up to debate we have her feeling of being kept at distance against the fact that she broke up without proof facts beat assumptions
  mostly positive interaction is good but stability is boring people want to be bitten from time to time  wish that could be skipped with a strong bond and a strong friendship/eroticism i really dont understand why stability is boring if you have a nice relationship and do things all the time      or youre just unlucky enough and never find someone like that anon the world is full of nice people and you should give it a try anyway as i mentioned before its not me saying that its what other people keep telling me      i dont want to see him as any of that when he was older and more mature isnt it very rare for a guy to be like that      with basic reading comprehension and being less autistic about that thot thing you would know why i broke up the person became insufferably distant only showing his face to apologize for not being able to communicate properly but never doing it no matter how much time passed by besides that its like the other anon said absolutely no mutualness    im not shunning anyone here is that common in /adv/ im just seeking clarification on why something like that could happen and i have no reason to lie if im suffering with that if i was the problem or went annoying or insufferable at any point i wouldnt be wasting my time writing here because id know the problem he told me i was never the problem many times     i lost time of my life dedicating myself to that      yes actual abused doggos deserve all the care in this world too    as for the analogy thats what i tried to do he really went through alot in life and relationships but i saw him so happy with me in the start i never thought hed start acting like that
  i am going through the same thing but with genders reversed i fell in love with a girl troubled by her selfperceived inadequacy which i honestly am baffled by i dont see the faults she thinks she has at all and some that she actually kinda does have are nothing serious and could be easily overcome   like its crazy how closely your story matches mine the girl broke up with me however and not the other way round like you she told me that she couldnt love me and that every time she saw how caring i was about her every time i gave her little gifts that i thought up relating to some discussion we had or some little word she dropped here and there it made her hate me more and more and in the end simply had no fond feelings left and so left me i have no fucking idea how that came about i dont understand what kind of twisted logic could turn gifts kind words and other manifestations of genuine love from my heart into that  all im left with in my case is regret that ive caused this to happen i cant imagine what she went through and i was the cause of it i dont know what i did wrong and i dont know what i could do differently that wouldnt go against my conscience the communication thing i basically stated that one outright as soon as we went into the relationship phase and in the end that was the one thing that didnt happen she kept this problem bottled up inside and even when i sensed something wrong and asked her about it she went no its fine youre worrying too much i can handle this on my own three days later she breaks up with me because of that bottledup problem frankly i feel very inadequate because of it  i know this post doesnt help at all but at least now you know you arent alone in this there must be others who have figured this out and they can probably help you all i can say is that being kind to your so and other people is definitely not wrong keep it up
  were left trapped with this thought about what could we have done but thats so distressing if there was something we could do they should have asked for help and been open about it because we did our part in asking and offering help i too heard the i can handle this on my own but in the end thats what happened and the most disturbing thing is that it was really sudden    even your words i dont see the faults she thinks she has at all and some that she actually kinda does have are nothing serious and could be easily overcome are absolutely exactly what i felt    i can only seriously hope you also find peace from that and lots of happiness anon this really sucks
you said you take a beating for the person which suggests you might be a doormat which could be the reason boundaries my dear
  its a very odd feeling isnt it im not a social person the friends i have right now are the same group ive had for 12 years now with this relationship i really thought i could make a difference in the girls life  make her better help her with her problems we can build a healthy relationship of mutual respect and care and all of that stuff i thought and even though its over now i still get the craving to ask and see if theyre dealing with it alright and all though i know i shouldnt do that i dont even know how to build a new relationship again  hell i wish i could give you a hug of solidarity or something youll do good in life eventually i bet
  mememe my time my feelings i want this want that sure nice gal
  lol fucking thots  anon   is 100 correct all your posts are written in a deceptive fashion   i broke up the person became insufferably distant  i got ditched   i almost fell for your bullshit too youre just shifting the blame to make yourself the victim youre so full of shit  should i change the way i am give less attention to my partner and demand more act more cold   also you have to be 18 to post on 4chan no adult would post such highschool level garbage like this youre clearly a child
hey yo so im rethinking my life ive just become unhappy so whatre some things big or little that you guys do that make you happy just working on a list of things to mix up my days ya know what they say monotony is depressing
working out i dont mean becoming a beefcake but working out a little is fantastic for you
try cleaning out shit you dont need maybe try writing some fiction try reading weird books try mepalomar working out will make you feel like god try talking to people even if you dont like it youd be surprised where it can lead you if you dont know how look up the are method and form methods
  find stuff that interests you perhaps something that may be long term  learn an instrument a longterm workout goal yielding results find something online  these days you can literally occupy yourself and learn so much with the available resources online that you are bound to find something that makes your time worthwhile for you

my flatmate has a new girlfriend he hasnt introduced me to her or vice versa theyve been together for already two weeks and they usually try to be at home while im working i can hear them having sex and chatting at night though     what is happening here /adv/ is she actually a hooker and my flatmate doesnt want me to know or what
  i dont think there really needs to be an explanation unless hes really going out of his way to keep you two apart or keep her secret he probably just hasnt given it a second thought  two weeks is not a long time to be with a new girlfriend hes probably not serious enough about her to introduce her to all his friends yet you happen to share his living space so youre gonna witness his dates  hookups but he has no social obligation to introduce you to her yet
if theyre being too loud you can just tell him its normal     flip the situation around and youd also want to know if you were being too loud so just treat others as you would like to be
  maybe i unconsciously scared away his last gf
  i dont know m8 what makes you think that i doubt it unless youre really creepy
  were from different countries maybe there was a cultural shock that caused the relationship to fail
  i think its more likely that it had nothing at all to do with you you are overthinking this whole situation and the best course of action is to chill out and do nothing
  ok but meanwhile i will still feel so jealous of him   fat and bald gets lots of pussy  i dont get as much
  jealous of him  back up from this situation and focus on jealousy in general     jealousy is a very harmful emotion and you should work to control it dont see approval in others and dont desire things you dont deserve     want a fancy car work for it  lots of girls work for it  any thing else yeah you know    jealousy is a female emotion because women arent able to work during pregnancy and breastfeeding they experience a sense of evolutionary desperation it manifests as jealousy but since youre a capable man you dont need this emotion     but i  no what ever excuse you might be impulsed to say is wrong men figure it out women stay desperate dont be jealous nor make excuses just figure it out thats how you stop being jealous
what kind of a career choice is considerable if the only thing youre good at/motivated to do is making memes/posting mildly entertaining content online

  why do you have a psychologist
yo /adv/ i got this entrance exam for this really nice high school coming up and i was wondering if you guys have tips to not lose my cool just in case thanks in advance
how do i defeat an inferiority complex im 51 i have small 45 penis when erect i could go on and on about the things i dont like about myself the point is how do ignore the things i cant change and work on what i can most of the time it doesnt bother me but i have those moments where it makes me feel like utter shit
i have those moments where it makes me feel like utter shit  weve noticed go to the gym  inb4 one of the excuses you always make  stop being a baby and go get in shape ive seen you post your face and yes even that will improve if you work out
oh god this fucking guy again dude get a fucking hobby you spend all your time posting on 4chan about your dick go read a book draw go for a jog learn a programming language just do something other than talk about your dick size and height on the internet
  i do need to start working out but i never heard how it could fix ones face how can i stay dedicated because i tend to fall out after a few days      i do have hobbies and other shit i do i just dont talk about it here because thats not a problem for me
you do not have a complex    youre literally inferior to 99 of every guy in the room  get used to it or shoot up your school
  even if i were to get used to it what would be the point
  if you cant get used to it you can either kill yourself or shoot up your school you fucking idiot leave this board you chump
  it takes some willpower you have to make an agreement with yourself to go when youve scheduled to go after a while it gets easier
  so im supposed to do what exactly after i get over it how exactly does one get over these things
bro learn to eat py like a champ and how to use your fingers gently and how to please a woman that way then after she is fully satisfied then its your turn and she wont care if you have a small penis plus trim your pubes it makes your penis look bigger just be confident and approach any woman you want to and have some balls and ask some woman out for a drinkeventually you will luck out
  you just learn to live being in the bottom  learn your place stupid twink  settle with ugly women or whatever
  thanks are theyre any particular pointers about eating out/fingering you can give me
  not him but in general you should pay special attention to her clit and talk to her about what she likes honestly just look up some guides theres plenty of them and they go into more detail than a 4chan post can do justice
  hahaha stupid manlets when will they learn
  stop shitposting
  but i never heard how it could fix ones face  your face is part of your body dipshit modifying the very properties of the shit that covers your skeleton will affect it
  why would gay men or ugly women want me if i am inferior
  inferior men  average woman basic
  this guy is a committed fucking loser originally i thought maybe hed get it now i think when he finally stops posting itll be because he an heroed
  hello op is faggot and posts this whining shit constantly thanks for playing though
  fuck you you dont know shot about me you should anhero you peice if human garbage
what ethnicity are you
  white
  this sorry dude its game over
  prove it
  this is pretty harsh but mostly right    you cant do anything about your height or your dong length my only advice would be hormone therapy and be a pretty cute girl
  but i dont want to be a girl and i find trans women disgusting plus my family would disown me
  dont listen to these retards youll find someone eventually if you work on yourself
  oh i know all about you try to post something to surprise us when you post this same thread again
  stop having issues  how about you actually give good advice instead
hello /adv/ i wanted to learn how one become politician seems this is the only way to fix ones country my country is full of corrupts who doesnt and i am getting fed up of it so how do i become one am 22   assad is a medical doctor before be the president of syria  mahathir is a medical doctor before be the pm of malaysia  trump is a real estate manager before be president of usa  also how do they do it can one just switch career to be a politician  picnotrelated
  usually lawyers you run for local office and work your way up
  i have variocele
  with the pic you post i thought this was a good thread for me cuz when i have seks i always have my left nut to go up and it kind on embarrassing and it hurt a bit
  work as a volunteer for a local politician or party you support do so well that they put you on salary do your job so well that you develop the respect of the party offer to run for a minor office win the election do so well in office that the party will support you for a higher office repeat that step until you get somewhere where you can make a real difference    that is essentially the process margaret thatcher and barack obama followed
  if you have a strong message that the people can relate to and the funds to advertise yourself then pull a donald trump    if you dont have a strong message but have the money to advertise lies pull a hillary clinton    if you have a strong message but dont have to the money to advertise yourself start locally like being campaign staff or working for your mayor etc make connections and go up from there    if you dont have a strong message nor the money to advertise lies then dont get into politics
  since you seem to know please tell us what is trumps message
  america first
    1/2    which country anon  if you dont want to say does your country have some semblance of institutions judicial system somewhat functioning departments etc or is it just coup central where the leadership could flip at any second    in the case of the first youll want to do what the other anon said before    have money  have a message  ideally both    without money it makes your job hard so try to ally yourself with those with money to make your life easier but obviously if youre an anticorruption crusader maybe not the best idea   that being said you can try to build a grassroots movement though this may be difficult if there are entrenched elements in your society ie religious fundamentalism like in indonesia oligarchy in eastern europe/cis   lastly you can work your way up the ranks of a political party in a dominant party system such as singapore malaysia until recently japan etc working up the ranks of the main party and eventually becoming the leader or influential may be easier than trying to work within an opposition party that has never held office especially in poorer states who have never had a transition between parties the problem with this route is that it is easy to be tempted by the same fruits that countless politicians have fallen to corruption is one of the most difficult things to resist as it doesnt just come in the form of bribes but blackmail among others be prepared to fess up to your misdeeds or pray that no one finds them
  he learn from history that immigration/emigration destroy nations and inevitably create racial conflicts and tensions learn more about cycle of empires and you will know what trump is trying to do but i am not 100 on trump wagon since he and the others are attacking syria but at this point i think trump is being held hostage
      2/2    alternatively if you have money or are working towards it become prominent make a fortune with a new type of instant food or something your job with prominence is to become familiar to the general public and gain their trust or at least get them to acknowledge you similar to trump in a way once you have enough traction you can attempt a run and who knows maybe youll be swept into office in a single blow like macron or trump    if you live in a coup happy country lmao the military may be a better option convincing a portion of the top brass after you gain sufficient reputation that a junta would be effective in retaking control organise a coup by taking control of all the vital arteries of the state media military government buildings and politicians etc once that is accomplished set about building your national salvation council and set about saving your country      challenge mode install yourself as monarch and see how long you can last the last instituted empire was in the central african republic
  i currently pursuing a degree in computer science but i will try to run for local party    dont self check go to local clinic and have your doctor check    if it hurts go to local clinic and perform testicular check    if i volunteer what kind of jobs that i will received is there a site that i can see the list of jobs or something    yes i have a strong message i guess i will pull a trump for now i have to improve my public speaking skill    i live in malaysia i am getting sick of these racial tensions in my country that has stunned the growth economically and intellectually     also am i a bad guy i am chinese and i want to go into politics and rise to the top and provide privileges to my chinese people more than the son of soil / original people / malay people of malaysia  how do you get there in the first place  we chinese enter malaysia by the brits bringing us to tap rubber trees  why do you want to get rid of the original people malay  because i dont want to go to singapore or china i like it here it is where i grew up  i dont think i am a bad guy i do this for my people chinese
  malaysianchinese here too well half which state you in    in all honesty the transition to pakatan raykat means that change is likely on the horizon malaysia at least is a more functioning country then say indonesia/burma/etc meaning there is still hope while i dont think you are at all the bad guy for wanting to look out for our brothers and sisters especially after all the shit the malays put us through ask yourself this can you see a malaysia like the one they portray on billboards all happy and smiling racially harmonious    for me its tough to see at times especially with the fact that malaysia is a nation of 3 races but whenever i go back and talk to the people on the ground malay indian chinese i have hope that all the barriers can be set aside for a greater good because deep down we all dont hate each other as much as we like to think    if anything work to improve our community our standing to make us not only proud to be malaysianchinese but proud to be malaysian from there you can have the moral fibre and foundation to set the country on the right course

  i am in penang do you think dap or mca have any meaningful plans i think i want to join their fight but i dont think they can ever win malaysia     btw what do you mean you are halfchinese    i have already some triads connections so i think i can handle myself
may as well use this topic for myself since its the pic    my right testicle has been hurting whenever my penis feels any sensation like arousal or something i guess would make more blood go to it for the last two days its not an intense pain but its noticeable enough to be a bother should i see a doctor
right so im a pretty average teen in my part of the world 61 170lbs probably a 75/10 quite good grades at school and all the rest of it but im a bit introverted    i have a fair amount of friends and they all have gfs    not too long ago i was in a club and met a girl i hadnt seen since middleschool she was always pretty very friendly an an allround nice person we chatted and danced a bit and after a bit we made out great    since then weve been texting rather frequently and agreed we should do something together our interest line up quite well but im absolutely terrified of fucking it up as this is my first decent chance in a long time i really want to date her but im just too anxious and cant seem to grow a pair help
you got this man just believe in yourself if you love yourself others will too and better to have tried and failed than to not have tried at all
you might fuck it up     meaning you might embarrassing yourself or do something stupid that makes her not like you really its possible   now take all the bubbly lovey fear you have and turn it into motivation     i really dont want to fuck this up  love this feeling youll only feel it as you dont really know her if you become friends you wont feel it anymore the only time is now embrace and cherish that youre in this phase and love every moment about it the only reason you even feel this way is because you like her so much find the fun inside these feelings and it will radiate outward 
so far ive gotten the majority of my shopping done for christmas but i havent gotten my mom much    shes your stereotypical mom  she loves alexa facebook her iphone but shes not tech oriented at all she likes picture related shit a lot    shes got a electronic picture frame that shows the pictures shes taken from an sd card    anyone else have the same mom anyone know what theyre getting their mom for christmas this shit gets harder and harder every year
  i was thinking of getting her one of those flash drives you plug into your phone and it backs up all the photos to make pc transfer easier etc
get her perfume  tech sounds silly
  my moms devoutly religious so i usually get her some christianrelated thing and she eats it up pic related is a plaque i got her last year
  my gift to everyone is being out of town for the holidays
my mom keeps venting personal relationship stuff about my dad to me and it makes me uncomfortable i barely see or talk to him and feel like its inappropriate that she complains about him to me we already dont have a good relationship and hearing about their petty relationship issues from the inside makes me view him weird how do i navigate the conversation when she starts complaining about him since she is very sensitive and will hang up if she feels offended im her daughter but basically her only friend mfw
try listening and giving feedback while not necessarily taking his side  sure its weird but youre an adult you can handle it  i understand it feels awkward but if i were you i wouldnt have the heart to tell her to stop as cynical as it sounds parents love their children much more than children love their parents that means that what you feel might be a bit offensive might be a massive blow to her  what kind of things is she saying about him its entirely more reasonable to not want to hear about actual bedroom problems and you can say that much to her but other than that it might hurt her bad if you ask her not to talk about it

tldr any advice for a cheap place to live and still have a workshop    fellow single makers living on their own what advice do you have for someone whos looking for a new place to live at first i wanted to get an apartment with a detached garage sounded perfect but unfortunately only places with a really high base rent even give you the option ive looked on sites like zillow and apartmetnscom for cheap townhouses but havent found anything     another option is getting a 2 bedroom apartment and converting one of the bedrooms to a workshop but i feel like the noise would be an issue maybe not    any advice living in phoenix az if that helps
find a roomshare with a garage on craigslist then when you inquire tell the owner that youre interested in renting a room plus the garage for yourself offer a few hundred bucks a month and it should be easy remember that men who rent out rooms in their house especially in a psychopathic hellhole like phoenix love money or at least theyre doing for money so offering a few hundred bucks on top of a room should be super easy in your area youre lucky to live in basically a giant suburb         i lived in phoenix last year in a roomshare with 3 furries one of them did this and rented the whole garage to himself so he can work on an online business
  furries    youve unsold me on this suggestion so hard
  i deliberately searched for a furry house maybe i shouldve clarified that
dumb question that i cannot find on google anywhere sorry  how long do small hemorrhoids take to go down completely and will my butthole ever look the same i just need some peace of mind that my ass will go back to normal it doesnt hurt or itch or anything like that just ugly and im pretty pissed about it    serious thread
  ive had small ones before your butthole returns to normal anon give it a few weeks
im depressed everyday i wake up with the shittiest feeling  always on my phone chatting with random people from the internet  introvert af cant talk about personal stuff with people i know irl dont have a skill almost all my friends have mental illnesses too and sometimes it makes me even more depressed cant stand my family even one second more because they make noise all the time  i have hard adhd and its a small house  very unhappy in general  always trying to find flaws in people who seem happy listening to music all day  thinking about suicide whenever im bored which happens often  but never commit it failing in every single test because i have absolutely no will to study for them  feeling garbage about the future like there wont be an end to this  what should i do  i want to get out of this  killing myself is not an option because im a giant pussy i want to figure it out  i want to be joyful again
  internet socializing  honestly senpai getting out to a park and people watching over a juice box or something is better social contact than that internet interactions are decrepit because theres none of the actual meat of an interaction none of the good stuff  its like if you said youre cooking steak but just fried up a bone technically thats part of it but come on man you know what we mean at least the people watching is like going and watching steaks get made youre doing something forwardmoving    innuhnet sucks because a lot of people use it to compensate for their shortcomings rather than their circumstances
  dont see the path to a good life as a massive task where you have to solve every issue at once  make small changes over periods of a few days/weeks/months for example start going on runs every now and again the endorphin rush will improve your mental well being and put you in a good mood   another small change could be showering once a day if you dont already to help you feel fresh and going on walks around by yourself around your neighbourhood being outside even on your own could brighten your mood  maybe buy some fresh clothing  this sounds retarded but if you smile a bit more around people theyll like being around you looking gloomy is off putting to people it will seem tough in the moment but it will pay off in the long wrong when it gives your more people supporting you    ive found that the best way of tackling this sort of thing for me at least is not being overwhelemed by wanting to fix everything but making gradual changes of extended periods of time that ease you slowly into a better lifestyle  literally anything you think you could be doing better no matter how small like how you cook or whatever  maybe just doing 10 minutes of extra study a day than you do at the moment just 10 mins or more its your freetime its not much but it will help your grades and help you feel a little more accomplished    maybe learn an instrument music is good for venting worries    that all sounds pretty futile the sorts of things youve heard millions of times before and sounds a bit fucking gay mate but for me its taking baby steps to gradually ease myself into better habits that makes me happier     good luck anon   youve survived all of your worst days youre doing great
unironically all the advice 90 will ever actually need courtesy of miyamoto musashi    accept everything just the way it is    do not seek pleasure for its own sake    do not under any circumstances depend on a partial feeling    think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world    be detached from desire your whole life long    do not regret what you have done    never be jealous    never let yourself be saddened by a separation    resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself or others    do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love    in all things have no preferences    be indifferent to where you live    do not pursue the taste of good food    do not hold on to possessions you no longer need    do not act following customary beliefs    do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful    do not fear death    do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age    respect buddha and the gods without counting on their help    you may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honour    never stray from the way
    i liked reading the book of five rings as much as anyone else but alot of this advice is pretty shitty have no preferences accept absolutely everything the way that it is lmao
  in all things have no preferences  so like does this mean i shouldnt prefer to listen to his advice
  this is good advice but most people on here wont understand what it actually encompasses
good advice is advice which is likely to actually help the person this is just a list of extreme and unrealistic objectives that 99 of the world will immediately tune out to bad advice
my life changed summer of 2016 when i met my soul mate our eyes locked and immediately my broken and damaged heart was rebuilt and given away again fell for each other instantly literally inseparable when i was in his arms i was home nothing could hurt me when i was in them life would stop and the feeling of happiness and security filled my heart i lied to him about a dark battle ive been a slave too selfishly allowed him to fall for a sliver of who i really am and kept that side hidden all of that blew up in my face i took him for granted and he gave up on us when the mask was ripped off and the damage had become too much he let go at the beginning he gave me his whole heart and i couldnt give him mine until my secrets were out on the table after pushing him to his breaking point i was ready to give him my entire heart and love him the way he deserved it didnt work that way because he lost all respect love and over all every feeling he had towards me we tried so many times to get back together to rebuild our foundation it could never be rebuilt due to lack of trust on his part being there wasnt anything to keep him happy other then sex he became emotionally abusive both of us are adults are recognize that if both of us couldnt forgive one another and put 100 percent into this it couldnt ever work he knew he didnt want to put his all into because when he did i spit on the love and effort we both tried being with other people and we gravitated back to each other that was stupid to do because that became another thing to fight about he lied about his fling and thankfully fb allowed me to find out the truth knowing how bad we were we shouldve never got back together but we did he got with me out of pity and led me to believe he was still in love this was the last time we would ever try fixing the shattered dead pitiful relationship i souped to such a low and became irate he wanted to be done and i
  is this pasta tldr
e and i was so selfish i couldnt let him leave me i begged cried and even showed up to his apt to drop off every memory of us gifts recipets lingire and bday gifts i bought him hoping he would change his mind i stayed in the parking lot for over 4 hours crying and thinking i just couldnt accept he didnt want anything to do with me ended up in jail that night and sitting in there i had an epiphany i forced myself to accept what my life had become and it needed to be changed after a ton of hard work and determination i am stable i have learned to love myself and never stop doing the right thing had i not lied he would still be in my life maybe not as a so but as a friend not having him in my life at all is killing me inside i have no desire to be with a new person or even hook up with anyone idk why im taking it so hard we used to email one another and honestly it was the best fucking thing he found it in his heart to give me that little bit of happiness of keeping general communication last month he had a change of heart and completely cut all communication with me my brain can comprehend why he doesnt want to talk to me but my heart and soul are broke ive never had anyone care about me the way he did no one to be as patient as him he was the only person to make me feel comfortable in my own skin and accepted my quarky annoying habits he taught me so much and reminded me of stuff i already knew i looked up to him and at times even a little jealous of the happiness that he was always filled with i hurt someone that didnt deserve to be hurt he was innocent and i brought him down to such a low point i regret so many choices ive made these last few years i broke his heart when all he was asking for was mine in return i broke every promise i made to him remorse fills my heart as the emptiness reminds me that ill be alone for a long long
  keep yourself busy anon   he probably wont ever want to talk to you again if you caused that much pain hang in there and with time the pain wont be so bad maybe at that point youll be numb to the idea of him fucking a new chick who will be hotter and better then you

call him and beg for forgiveness that always works i love when my ex gf calls me bawling her eyes out begging for my attention   get a real kick out of it its quite the comedy
  yeah i did the same thing to the love of my life as well i broke my own heart and now shes with a more compatible man and im alone and feeling like a ghost guess were just gonna have to act our age get the fuck over it and move on op i dont think youll ever get over it the scar will always remain but youll eventually regain some happiness eventually
  op here      not sure why there are 3 other ops      thank you for taking the time to read this novel anon i feel so lost without him in my life ive finally become an admirable young woman with her shit together i shouldve been this version of me a long long time ago sadly it took a while for me to actually want it i cant help but feel worthlessnow that im ready to give him my entire heart and love himhe wont accept hes right for what he did it takes strength and courage to walk away from someone you love he did love me there is no doubt about that this man put his all into us and my happiness you know how i thanked him for that by lying to him and taking him for granted i cant imagine the pain that hes felt but i can bet that its the same amount of pain that ive felt this last 10 months i feel like im stuck in fantasy land because i am still hopeful that he will miss me then get curious and email me to see how im doing then i come back to the real world where that agonizing pain in my heart and the emptiness in my soul are present   i suppose youre right we just have to act our age and eventually get the fuck over it its so much easier said then done i know he is happier without methats the only thing that brings a tad bit of comfort knowing that he is happy i just wish i could let him go the way he did me to completely sever all communication close off any emotions and forget that i was ever part of his life how did he teach his brain and heart to do that or did i push him to that did i really make it that easy for him to just let go so easily i wish the pain would ease up just a teeny bit
  he probably thinks about you some but he doesnt want to be hurt by you again when you fuck people over like that no matter what they say about loving you it makes the love for you in their heart diminish eventually they simply dont give a shit about you thats what happened to me my ex doesnt give a flying fuck about me while im stuck loving her you just gotta find something to focus on and move on life doesnt always work out and being alone as an adult because of mistakes is a harsh reality i hope you get well
she is out of my league she does not share the same feelings as me sheisnotintomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee    how can i move on from this
  find a new girl to reject you
i struggle very badly with focusing on studying i get so fucking bored just sitting there reading and reviewing half the time i read i dont even really remember it long term i just remember it for the test coming up i need help to change myself so i can actually pass college     i cant study in groups because my class is small and the people in it are very weird    my only thought it going to the library leaving my phone in the car and studying which doesnt sound too bad desu     like i have a test coming up tuesday and instead of studying im on 4chan and playing games with friends
its human  you need to see the bigger picture to keep up the effort   basically you need a good fucking reason to put in the required effort or you wont do it   would you run up a mountain just because someone told you so probably not   would you run up that same mountain if your asshat classmate proclaimed that you couldnt do it  in front of your cute classmate changes have risen significantly that you might actually do it     would you put in the effort to learn to get good grades to get some boring ass job that wont even pay your studen loans thatl leave you half broke and stressed out of your mind   hell fucking no only an idiot would not toss everything away and go do something fun instead     you need bright plans for your future and a tomorrow worth moving your ass for i cant tell you what that is for you but im sure youll figure something out     good luck
if anyone here is interested in getting a girls attention in both the right and wrong ways you may want to consider finding out if one of the ones you like is getting hit by their current fling or not schedule him an ass whooping and send him off to find someone else if you can shell be emotional and may not be that pleased with you at first but just give it time also make sure he isnt like some kind of made mafia type if your just a small fish cause that doesnt work for you in the end if you dont have your own connections ya know most police cant do it themselves because of their jobs but most really want to beat the guys who hit women even when they sometimes really deserve it
when a stuck up whores mom tells you a secret that she wants to be a trophy wife well you end up giving her what she wants accidentally and get a win sometimes /shrug

i cant fall asleep on sunday evenings last night ive pulled my 6th all nighter sunday and im a literal wreck what can i do to make this stop
  dont sleep so late sunday morning
  are you sleeping in really late on saturday and sunday   i tend to drink alot on friday nights stay up until the early hours of the morning sleep away almost my entire saturday stay up late saturday night then sleep in fairly late on sunday and it sure as fuck screws me up sunday night  develop better sleep discipline on the weekend and it should help you get to sleep sunday night
      i wake up at around 8 in the morning i do go out with friends on friday but im not a heavy drinker and i dont get very strong hangovers i go to sleep at 10 pm on sunday
be me   have that one friend that says they will kill themselves all the fucking time  annoyedmp3  friend texts me   im going to kill my self  kek and tell them to do it pussy  next day  no response from them via text or call  walk to their house not there  didnt like them cause they where an asshole so dont care but in a way i do  what do this shit was a week ago and havent heard jack from this person since
if you turn it off you will sleep better because it does not emit cellphone radiations if an emergency happens you are offline landline and second phone not available    if you keep it on you get microwaved all night who knows what that does to your body if an emergency happens you are available 24/7      what and why would you choose
  leaving it on for 8 hours more a day is a negligible difference and regardless i am still subjected to the same radiation from others phones   so on
fuck it im thinking of an heroin so might as well keep my phone on
why do you need to turn it off its true that you sleep better if youre not on your phone right before sleep but youd just need to put it to the side and read a book for a half hour and youll sleep much better if youre worried about emergencies your phone will still be on  cellphone radiations  pretty sure theyre negligible there is radiation coming from everywhere these days hell knowing phones these days they probably still radiate something even when theyre off
  i leave it on and set alarms on it     the only reason cellular radiation from something small like a cellphone would be important is if you didnt get worse radiation by being outside during the day or in general above water or if the environment wasnt filled with smog and the food you ate wasnt actively trying to kill you    not saying you shouldnt attempt to live a healthy life within the ways that are possible for you but cutting out negligable dangers at the expense of something tangible isnt the most logical course either
  i leave mine switched on 24/7 for work call outs or a family emergency my office phone diverts to my mobile when im not there provided i remember to set it before i leave as well turning it off really isnt an option     if youre concerned about radiation or whatever the 16 hours a day when its either in your pocket or your hand are a much larger problem than the 8 hours when its on the bedside table a couple of feet away  inverse square law and all that
  radiowaves aint shit but that doesnt mean to keep it as close as possible either    i used to shut mine off but important texts get lost in the clouds maybe just keep it on a desk across the room thats what i do
cellphone radiations  you didnt pass high school science classes did you
mfw my router/modem is less than 1 meter away from my computer  how worried should i be
  between what china and india are doing to our environment i promise you the only thing ill miss by dying early is a bunch of miserable geriatrics and our eventual planetary death    frankly it doesnt matter what i choose thirty years hence our planet will be a dried out husk like some sort of discarded fruit nothing will make any difference and my health declining or otherwise will only determine if im able to haul sandbags into walls as nature openly rebels to get us off like the bad rash we are    trust anything you do as a white person and you think its bad asia has done phenomenally worse and whats better than that is the smug fucking cunts theyve normalized it and made it acceptable in their countries    have fun were all in the same pool wading silently for death
  you must be fun at parties
  off i work in a field in which people dont have any regard about respect and decency so the may and they do call at literally every hour of the day and night i do have a landline for true aka family and close friends emergencies tho
  you must be fun at funerals
  i know youre right but why did you put your trip on for this faggot
  not op but my hs classes were shit  idk about ap but honors classes didnt go in depth at all   in physics i remember learnung definitions but we never did any significant calculations
i absolutely sleep better when i turn my phone off before bed the waves that they emit keep you awake     keep it off and use an actual alarm clock to wake up
  its not about waking up its about being available for emergencies death accidents and so on
  everyone here is talking about fucking radiation and shit   phones need to be turned off before bed because of how fucking parasitic they are  your brain cannot sleep if it sees a shiny screen full of information a few minutes before it needs to turn off  never look at your addiction device before you want to sleep    all these millennial faggots complain about sleep but press their fagphones into their eyeballs  1 hour before sleep turn off your phone 100 off nothing has more priority what can be  take our a book a paper book  and read it for the 1 hour  then sleep fully for the 8 hours before you need to wake up    fuck this new zoomer shit of omg im so tired omg i spent 4 hours on facebook y m i so tired  fuck off retards
im a textbook example of avdp but i thrive off of general adversity ive thought about joining the military for a while do you guys think itll help
no a political party would be better
  how so
i dropped out of college and i dont know where to meet girls anymore i go to concerts and stuff but theyre not the kind im interested in  where do i meet normal/well adjusted girls
  church
  hobbies sport groups
  bars support groups youd think everyone at a support group would be all messed up and thus not very attractive but thats where youre wrong speaking from experience fampai
  why are welladjusted people at a support group
  because theyre all better now but that also usually means theyre not single  its a decent way to meet females
  are there any attractive girls at autism support groups
  they wont put out and if they did i would feel bad about it
  are those lions doing capoeira
normal/well adjusted girls
just go spend all your time in the college library take your lunch your device your books backpack and wait
  i want normal well adjusted women for my fuck toys   if youre that desperate to meet a good a woman dont be that guy for fucks sake if youre looking for a more libertine women in general to settle down with then id suggest looking at women involved in volunteer work of some kind
neet because no job wants me  gained a lot of weight in the last few months  sleep 12 hours a day cant help it i set alarms and try to stay up but im too exhausted and go back to bed  dont feel like doing anything not even talk to family anymore literally sleep eat and watch youtube for days on end  is this depression what do
lose virginity to cute girl  midtwenties because i didnt have the time for a relationship or bothering with women  cum in her  we hug for a bit  unsure how to proceed   offer her a high five and say teamwork  she looks at me like a little kid offering her a crude drawing theyre really proud of   smiles sighs and says makes the dream work before high fiving me back     took me a bit to figure out that she was giving off a particular vibe im autistic was what i did awkward would that drive off a girl
  yes and depends on girl if you hadnt already guaranteed a relationship with myself and done that it would probably seal the deal for me but women act differently so eh
why did you cum inside did you fall for im such a whore im constantly on pills meme
  she had cramps before and said fuck it covered under my insurance anyway
  lol
i feel like a sad guy im well off and money i have but i dont have is friends i just moved from cambodia to the states in texas and nobody like me so far i feel i feel like i cant speak good english is the reason im laughed are all americans make all forign people sad like me is this why donald j trump was elected because of race i hear you states dont like forigners but maybe someday all will make happy
  yep time to take english classes and learn to speak without an accent youll never be accepted if simply trying to understand you is a massive challenge its not unique or interesting
id also look into working out if you have the time the spend the next 6 months on really working on yourself gym and healthy eating trust me you wont regret it and the girls will be interested
challenge my view   most people are just a drainage of time it is not worth to become friends with them what for to chill it is not productive in any sense whatsoever   my goal in life is self seeking and realisation   i rarely feel lonely and if i do  i just call my girlfriend   or do drugs which is far more fascinating   i see no point in forming a friendship with anyone i do not need any support not to say that i dont interact with people or am a shutin no it is easy and fine but beyond university  it is not worth my time  even if i try as i have done sooner or later i just feel this is pointless talk why the fuck am i sitting here with a person who listens to trap music follows politics and eats meat   though i am open to the possibility of forming a friendship with an exceptional person being friendless at the moment i am completely content  but why are so many people seeking friendship and moreover feel depressed due to the lack of it   maybe i am just missing something
  but why are so many people seeking friendship and moreover feel depressed due to the lack of it  because they arent edgy autists unlike yourself anon
  this is hardly an answer rather than describing an anonymous person id better hear your reasons why you do actually go out and seek friendships in fact the solely purpose of this thread was to create motivation for myself in that area
what if you need to carry some furniture or your car breaks in the middle of the road maybe call a friend
  i carry it myself or i call a service and pay them it is as simple as that
this is how i felt after i graduated high school i regretted it in about 6 months ive finally went to college and made friends op trust me you think its liberating to be without friends but its very lonely very lonely
  id better hear your reasons why you do actually go out and seek friendships   in fact the solely purpose of this thread was to create motivation for myself in that area    what motivation would you need to go out and seek other people when youre already content with yourself doubtless youll have more snappy comebacks ready for every other response thatll pop in here    i guess ill chip in anyway because i sometimes still feel that way yes people are exhausting yes they feel like a waste of time but to me thats the whole point anyway ive cooped myself up in here for two years now and i can only remain fascinated with myself for so long    when you have no one to share this life with youre as good as dead i feel cherish the people closest to you even the drugs will lose their luster sooner or later
  youre trying to challenge people to change a view that is highly subjective people seek friends for a variety of different reasons support giving support feeling of unity killing loneliness you can achieve most of these without having a circle of friends i for once have literally zero close acquaintances and am relatively fine with it though sometimes it feels cold it is neither necessary nor overrated because it depends on the individuals need for social activity and living in a society is already enough for some to fill the the natural desire for community   btw you have a gf thats still a friend so dont get cocky your gf already satisfies your social needs so you are fine with it
  you dont want friends so nothing any of us says will change your mind frankly you dont sound like you would be a good friend anyway
  i feel the exact same way but thats only because i have had friends and went through the experience of  man i really wanna go home instead of being in this fucking restaurant with these people who dont add much to my life  but people who have grown up without friends dont know that feeling all they see are movies tv shows anime manga comics webcomics of groups of friends having a ball they yearn for those experiences you cant just tell people that friends are a waste of time they have to live it
  when you have no one to share this life with youre as good as dead  while i dont completely agree there is some validity but for me the sharing is limited to a girlfriend or in the future wife future children and family i am questioning friendships here and not an absolute solitude more specifically friendships in a current world for example there are definitely advantages to forming friendships as a monk in a temple or in the wildness
  but why are so many people seeking friendship and moreover feel depressed due to the lack of it   maybe i am just missing something    yeah you are newsflash  humans are social animals and have evolved that way over millions of years humans want friends the way bees want to make honey and birds want to make nests cooperation is a massive survival advantage and the strongest cooperation is love and friendship its not just sentimental goo its the reason we dominate the planet    honestly though you just sound like someone with a superiority complex really pretentious so what if they like trap music so what if they follow politics maybe youre wrong to be dismissive of it you really think anyone who deviates from your idea of perfect is beneath you and unworthy
  you dont necessarily need friends to fill the gap of community
  but for me the sharing is limited to a girlfriend or in the future wife future children and family  keep them close then they can be your friends too    i am questioning friendships here and not an absolute solitude  friendships are fickle little things so the ones that stick are absolute gifts of the thirtysomething people i spent my high school years with i only keep in touch with three of them now once in a while ill comb through my friend list on facebook and delete the people i have no reason to keep in touch with hmm that should be everyone but the aforementioned three by now along with my brother and other relatives    i know my time here at university to be temporary and i feel ive overstayed my welcome to be of any use or help to anybody now i just really want my degree both so my parents stop nagging me and i can move on with my life    i dont know but you sound like someone who fiercely values their privacy and thats perfectly fine youre not obliged to talk to everyone you see     as for why people would be depressed due to a lack of friends i dont know some people i know find being alone to be extremely uncomfortable it really depends for myself the air heres just really fucking dead i want a change of pace
  so what if they like trap music so what if they follow politics maybe youre wrong to be dismissive of it  to me it just says volumes about their personality thats all i cannot be friends with those people  maybe it is pretentious i dont deny it  but anyone who deviates from my personal standards is not worth my time simple as that   and this is what i am discussing here  there is no way i am compromising my views on the world for the sake of mere companionship i see no benefits in friends who do not align with my values and i am looking for reasons to change my view but it appears to be hard truth be told   the reason we dominate the planet  do you really think that in my opinion people are not only not dominating they have in fact sunk much deeper than anyone else and made everything worse by going away from nature and happiness it initially gave us   people are the saddest creatures on earth the only ones who work and suffer by the way
  ill preface my comment by saying i do not have friends because i am smart    now then people make friends or otherwise have the desire to do so because theyre helpless slaves to the matrix and they see friends as a way to become wealthy connections or happy indulge in sin
you are not missing anything and you are correct in this viewpoint  it is not wise to know many people and it is best to work on and and take care of yourself first and foremost  it holds true every thing you could ever want or be you already have and are  nothing else necessary in this life of sin except your own divine self
  christ youre a fucking psycho
  you sound pretty self centered
for me personally i like my friends i enjoy their company and care about them and i would like to think they feel the same about me i have what feels like a fairly small group of friends and i dont see them all that often but i feel like its a matter of quality over quantity ive also never gone out of my way to find friends but rather made connections with people i already spent time naturally which developed into friendships    yes people can sometimes be tiring but you sometimes have to make effort for what you find important and i very rarely feel like that effort isnt worth it    all that being said though if youre truly satisfied with how your social life is at this point in time then i dont feel theres anything wrong with not seeking friends from what ive seen nobody could convince you otherwise at the end of the day everybody is different and other people clearly arent wired the same way you are provided you dont end up some rapist or murderer then id say thats not inherently a bad thing
  well yeah there you have it you are pretentious closed minded and entitled not an insult i am half of that and i dont see how thats wrong   it is but a matter of personal preference  the soul is egoistic and if your ego doesnt align with friendshipship then thats fine i mean you have a gf at least so you do have some urges imo its all meaningless in the long run but friends are a great way to connect or feel like i have something that matters but i have a family thats enough for me     in my opinion people are not only not dominating they have in fact sunk much deeper than anyone else and made everything worse by going away from nature and happiness it initially gave us   people are the saddest creatures on earth the only ones who work and suffer by the way  because we bacame more egoistic/intelligent
  wubalubadabdab
  i am looking for reasons to change my view  be honest with yourself then do you want friends or not a simple yes or no will suffice
  but why are so many people seeking friendship and moreover feel depressed due to the lack of it   they dont know whats like having friends and once they find some and the novelty wear off and realize its fucking nothing they go back to being depressed      its the reason we dominate the planet  and fucking it up and making a global modern civilization where everyone is equally miserable and dissatisfied with life        shhhh weaklings cant even stand a crack in the matrix
  actually thinking about this right now reading this thread as well as making some research has helped me to come to a decision which is   i decide that having one or another friendship in life is important   i conclude that yes i do want a friend or another besides my relationship with a woman however an important factor is  it really has to be a right person   as long as this person has not appeared in my life i will find much more satisfaction being without any friends rather than creating artificial friendships with people who are not on the same wavelength with me just for the sake of it there i have it for me the discussion is over
  /thread
  challenge my view  why  youre on 4chan this isnt new youll gymnast and damage control your way out of anything we say     i mean fuck youre on 4chan making this thread youre clearly antisocial so why the fuck would i damn other people by telling you to engage them  if youre antisocial be antisocial stay that way dont try to fucking be something you arent    christ youre a fucking idiot typing up a wall of text to say im antisocial
  whoa based
  christ  thats a greek word with an english translation next time you feel like speaking greek why not use it    anointed one
  christ youre a fucking idiot  be careful he might punish you
to me it just says volumes about their personality thats all i cannot be friends with those people  maybe it is pretentious i dont deny it  but anyone who deviates from my personal standards is not worth my time simple as that   and this is what i am discussing here  there is no way i am compromising my views on the world for the sake of mere companionship i see no benefits in friends who do not align with my values and i am looking for reasons to change my view but it appears to be hard truth be told     its actually a stimulating thing to have people around you who challenge your views and i dont just mean people who have pseudointellectual debates what you want here is utterly boring practically a clone of yourself if you only want those who think exactly like you at worst youll never have friends and at best youll fail to grow as a person    do you really think that in my opinion people are not only not dominating they have in fact sunk much deeper than anyone else and made everything worse by going away from nature and happiness it initially gave us     look you can get all contrarian and reinterpret what dominate means to say that were not fine we both know what im actually talking about though which is our proliferation and ability to massively change our environment like no other species is due to our ability to cooperate that isnt disputable its just a fact    people are the saddest creatures on earth the only ones who work and suffer by the way    humans are the only creatures to work the only creatures to suffer literally every animal works and suffers
  our proliferation and ability to massively change our environment like no other species is due to our ability to cooperate  like an ant people like you are ants to me
  its a lucky thing youre friendless and the only person subjected to your edge is some thot
  im14andthisisdeep
  sometimes friends can be the light on your life
  you sound like someone with a diagnosable personality disorder do you ever feel guilt or remorse over the actions you do if they seem to hurt others do you understand what the other person is feeling when someone else has been hurt by your actions do you ever feel like it is your fault for upsetting them or is it predominantly their fault for being upset
  sounds like something an ant would broadcast through scent to be accepted by the hive
  he sounds like an edgelord teenager nothing to see here
  ants dont live in hives retard
stimulus   thus introvert/extrovert
  think about friends differently think about friends as closer connections with more benefits think of anyone you know as connection and you will see that any connection has benefits connections are mere tools to help you get what you want even within your family just dont let them know and feel like they are tools
  why do you have a girlfriend then i sometimes wonder if i should bother finding a gf for the same reasons
  you know an awful lot about ants dont you
  btw you have a gf thats still a friend so dont get cocky your gf already satisfies your social needs so you are fine with it    this your girlfriend is clearly fulfilling the friend role for you
  the point of friendship is not being productive its the pleasure of company    its pointless if you cant enjoy it
somehow i highly doubt that this dude has a gf i bet nobody wants to be around so youre pretending your friendlessness is by choice i truly feel bad for you op
when you meet like minded folk you feel enrich your life youll see friends can be bretty good
im starting to take clonazepam solution any advice im a little scared
  spray toward your earlobes and hold it im just saying it look likes a nasal spray also try and find things to do instead of sulking about after taking your medicine    inhale through the nose exhale through mouth    tim pool discord call him a faggot
  its an oral solution i should take one drop with liquid
  everything else applies however alcohol is a depressant but based on the fact youre taking an antianxiety thing youre probably 13 so who cares just dont overdose then
how about you ask for a doctor that prescribed it   
fell for the pill jew  too late for you you dont deserve any advice
  oh shit you right op has to prove it works
  ive only ever taken pill form for me it works great     there shouldnt be much to be afraid of itll probably make you a bit sleepy are you taking this longterm because any benzodiazepine carries the risk of addiction make sure to communicate with your doctor about whats going on and dont abuse your med
  its been prescribed for a month of usage three drops a day day/noon/night
  im 20 i ask because of the fact that ive never taken any benzos
  may i ask what for seizures or just some sort of panic disorder
  im afraid i might be allergic to them
  panic disorder ive been prescribed paroxetine too
  the only way you can know if youre allergic is to try it have some benadryl on hand if youre that worried
  maybe you should couple it with just giving yourself time to think and not overdoing it on projects
  yeah take it as prescribed and you should be fine
  i just have to take a quarter of a 20mg pill during the night

learn how to put on makeup   dress yourself better   take that shit off your neck also idk if you wear them in public but if you want a guy to talk to you youll need clear ears so lose the dollar store earplugs as well     anyway aside from that the most important thing actually is to be a good person and give more than you take what makes men love women is beauty and behavior since we live highpopulation lives theres beauty everywhere so the only thing that separates women apart from one another is your behavior learn virtue and be a good person     really adhere to it and carve virtue into your soul this is so lacking in women right now that if you are virtuous a man will easily forgive mistakes in your past or defects in your looks/personality virtue begets love the more virtuous someone is the more love they get compare this to say sex appeal or money sex and money may be great for attraction but would you stop loving someone just because they grow old or bankrupt well not if they are virtuous   would you stop loving someone if they embraced vice told lies ate like a pig coward really bad temper or bad to kids well duh   so learn that virtuelove and your problem will solve itself very quickly

together 15 years  shes always struggled with feeling lonely mild depression has trouble making/keeping friends  relationship was great but she has always been extremely insecure something ive tried to help her with but i know confidence comes from oneself  communication issues on top of that stemming from her upbringing shes admitted these are faults but has never tried fixing them has ruined relationships before with this admitted to self harm early in relationship but unrelated to us  she didnt mention this until i was already in love with her  her insecurities have blown a couple normally fixable issues out of proportion doesnt talk about it or confront the issue instead dwells on it for months and then by the time shes told me damage is done most of which have been miscommunications on her part  practically begged her to go to therapy many times before we end up breaking up  told me her solution to the stress is by disconnecting from the relationship altogether  break up was mutual because while we didnt want to she cant handle her problems and i cant commit to someone who solves problems by ignoring them and pulling away  heres the kicker  keep line of communication via messenger in case if the other needs to talk she mentions shes going to check out therapy tells me to give her time but she needs to be away from romance period my impression stupid me that means she wants to try again when she gets better  she immediately changes personalities when we talk post breakup responses are long but are lacking any empathy or courtesy  tells me pic related only a chunk of the stuff shes said to me  a couple weeks and a visit to her sister and she tells me that she thinks she just loved the idea of what we could be and not what we were feels her life has gone unaffected since we broke up    1/2
2/3    pushes idea that me not being affectionate enough something we could have worked on if she brought it up is why she gave up and not the fact that her communication is pisspoor    i dont want to get back with her at all i love her but shes too fucked up for any nonprofessional to help i can accept that and i believe myself to have been a good guy through to the end so i can comfortably leave with no real regrets of action during the relationship this word doc i wrote essentially says what i feel that her preexisting insecurities and communication issues have inflated the issue so bad that she couldnt that its easier for her to cut off what she said was her best and healthiest relationship because she couldnt confront the issue that i feel its horribly unfair to propose i was the issue when she knows i would have been willing to make compromises and work to make her happy as i always have in the past i suggest that its an 80/20 of her personal battles/actual relationship conflicts being the problem at hand but its easier for her to leave on the note of it just didnt work out hes too physically distant part of me truly thinks shes falsifying the reason for the breakup and i feel the need to defend myself on it her saying im cold disregards everything else ive done to express love to her she just focused on the one thing she felt she wasnt getting which she was just cuddling for a couple hours at a time and i cant fall asleep wrapped up in each others arms because im a light sleeper and ignored every other thing ive done for her
i dont see how the relationship could get any worse if copy pasted that document into a fb message and sent it as my final nail the coffin i think thats what i need to move on to know that whats said is said and that theres no coming back from it none of the contents are deliberately hurtful or phrased maliciously but i feel are harsh truths that she can either take into consideration or ignore but im tired of her living in my head rent free because i cant believe that she actually told me out of all the times she was worried in the past that i was going to break up with her for her selfproclaimed issues that she is now chalking it up as me not being intimate enough and that she wasnt even willing to try to work to fix it    at this point i think i can admit that this is for my mental health now ive accepted this is the reality and that all her feelings for me are lost thats not what bothers me what keeps me up is that she left it on that note something thats far from the truth i think i can fully leave this to rest if i send this    is there any real reason not to if the relationship is already dead in the dirt
i dont see why not she is perfectly content in sharing her perceived gripes with your guys relationship you can share yours as well
ive been in a long distance relationship with my gf for the past few months but it still feels like i dont really know her that well  she did mention a few things but nothing really concrete
have you tried asking
  i dont really know how to even ask her
  say can you open up to me more
  but it feels like that would sound too insecure
  tough shit there is no other way
  and how do i ask for pics of her tits
  hey send me a hot pic
  but when i do that she just sent normal pic
  hey send me a hot titty pic
stop with the fucking anime pictures    grow a spine
  but she already acts bothered when i ask for normal pic so idk if asking that directly is a good idea      whats wrong with anime pictures
  then dont ask
  but i wanna see tits
  anime website
  but she already acts bothered when i ask for normal pic  youre being catfished my dude
  maybe try to open up and then ask her what about you or something like that
  what do you mean how am i being catfished when i already met her and went out and had sex with her more than once
you call her your gf but you have never met her
    
  long distance relationship  hahahaha shes opening up to chad already dont worry anon
  wao youre a dork lol     ok but for real you guys have common interests maybe start with that and maybe ask what she likes most about it ask her how her day is if anything notable happened ask how shes taking it or how she felt about it
what should i choose as my degree out of these 3 and why im interested in both math and cs as well as academia and postgrad in these fields but also want an easy out into industry if it turns out im too retarded for postgrad    1 bsc mathematics pure honours  2 bsc computer science minor in math  3 double degree in math and computer science 5 years honours in math    pic related
computer science if you want to make any kind of money you can ignore the math    if you want to spend your life in a 5x10 office with nearly 80 of the rooms volume taken up by your useless notes on new theories you cant find proofs for and 10 of it full of papers you need to grade from undergraduates that dont give a single shit about your field while you manage to take the extra 10 up with your coffee machine and broken chair the department cant afford to fix then be a math major    this is from personal experience btw i do consulting for several companies now in software development but i have my math phd collecting dust in my closet at home
  do my chances of landing upper tier software jobs rd machine learning etc improve if i pair cs with maths or is it not worth my time and money i really dont want to be stuck in a menial web dev job
  but also want an easy out into industry if it turns out im too retarded for postgrad  3 double degree in math and computer science 5 years honours in math
how do you know if youre cut out for a math major  im very interested in some ideas of mathematics mathematical physics and computational theory but im not naturally talented in math
  itt op goes to school at gm_construct
  i topped both of my extension math classes in senior high school however the school wasnt one of the more competitive in my state thats why i am somewhat hesitant    another option i have is to start the cs degree and do the first year math courses and then transfer into the double degree if my marks are good in those math classes
  that kid who noclipped into the skybox so he could tbag the whole map
  oh this brings back memories   would also really like to know this
  it really helps i personally found a lot of satisfaction doing pure math and cs together emphasis on theoretical cs skipped some of the easy stuff for grad level stuff complexity theory is a rabbit hole to many fun problems that were hidden inbetween all the problems described by math and science up till now
  hows the academics there rigorous it has a bit of reputation as a party school and allegedly the minge scene is unreal
do girls/women want boyfriends or replacement dads
validation
  replacement dads
  this but they also want to be throat fucked    i learned this from videos
  im starting to literally think this way  and im not sure if its a good point or not but it seems like it this day and age desu
nah they just want your soul thats all 
  an emotional and financial crutch
  i think women tend to want different things personally since my dad was around so i dont have daddy issues
  they want a man who will always be above them which translates to a father figure
  exactly someone above them w cash a future etc someone to spoil them even   maybe head pats
  pic related is literally you
typical frustrated male cynicism itt    women want a man who secure with himself who is capable kind welladjusted and worthy of admiration and respect a man who can take care of others and provide security and stability its also a bonus if he can also be fun talented and looks decent
      this is some incel bullshit ive been with dozens of girls and only one was subconsciously using me as her replacement dad
  then why the duck they gotta call me daddy when we fuck shits disgusting and its happened with three different girls now  not op btw
  ive been with dozens of girls and thats never happened to me once stop hooking up with girls who have down syndrome
reassurement and safety i think men expect that too i just want to feel safe and trust both my husbands words and actions yeah he has never done anything bad but he lies a lot for no reason so its hard for me to trust his words anyway i think you need that safety because it is already hard to deal with life to just add more to it with an asshole of a husband wish things were easier for me
  where do i find these jezebels thats my fetish
  ill tell you a truth a real one  women want power    it doesnt matter what form it takes think of any way power takes form a woman will want that physical monetary social intellectual  it doesnt matter what kind of power you can think of the general idea is attractive as hell to women    to put it basically is there something about yourself that you use to beat someone then thats what women are attracted to you about
  ive been with dozens of girls
  where2find girls without extra chromosomes
  i dont think op is a hivemind of women
  oops meant for 
    this nonsexually they need a replacement dad sexually they need a guy to dominate them
  this is correct    t guy with a lot of experience
  whats the problem its hot just relax and enjoy it or just tell her to call you something else if it bothers you so much
  girls want to call their boyfriends daddy all the time  get disturbed when i want to call them mommy    fuck these double standards i wont let them get away with this
  do girls/women want boyfriends or replacement dads    do boys/men want girlfriends or replacement moms
  the last thing i want is another mom
  above 6ft  positive canthal tilt  big jaw  big chin  prominent eyebrow ridges  hairy eyebrows  thick hair  good hairline  wide shoulders  narrow waist  decent dick  big social circle and dominant within it  good wealth  lifestyle    in that order
generalizations and blackandwhite thinking are for people that are some combination of lazy naive and emotional  i could approach crush like a regular person but thats too scary so im better off pretending that humans/girls are just scripted video game puzzles that i can prep time and think my way through  it feels safe and comfy now but mark my words if you dont grow out of it this kind of cognitive process will hold you back at best and backfire terribly at worst get off the internet and rethink your life
  i jus want someone to touch pp
  this /thread
  then how come vegeta has more fangirls than goku
  you can have all of this but if you have a voice like ben shapiro its over when you open your mouth
it shares an answer with do boys/women want boyfriends or replacement moms  that answer is healthy functioning ones will prefer the former others the latter
for several months ive been ignoring my mother as she begs to talk about me we live in separate countries so instant messaging is the only way we have to talk to each other and every single time i check my phone theres a message from her such as please please please contact me my boy or whatever  i understand that she got a bum rap in life and that i am her firstborn therefore her everything and it breaks her heart that i wont talk to her but she not only had me with a guy who already had caused a single motherhood even if he couldnt keep a job and spent the day drinking she still separated me with my father leading to an unstable and isolated early upbringing that im sure we will eventually find is the cause of autism shipped me away to to her mother when my relationship with my stepfather reached peak toxicity around the age of 13 failed to mention that her mother was batshit insane and the cause of everything so far and after i managed to conquer neethood and find a parttime job at age 21 when she comes over to bury her father and my last remaining male role model she has the nerve to chastise me for drinking alcohol like my father did   im not sure which of these specific snippets caused me to quit responding to her all together but im sure if i respond to any of her hi how are yous ill quickly find out again   of course im a monster for the way im treating my own mother i dont hear the end of it i can tell you but how do i reconcile all of this and reestablish a healthy relationship with her
implying your father wanted anything to do with you
  i hear he actually tried to reach out to me several times but the looney bin that is my family thwarted him for reasons that dont quite make sense
none of that seems like its her fault  dont be a dick talk to her
  if i could simply talk to her like that i think i would have already even if i cant blame her for these things it doesnt mean i dont still suffer through them today or that she can help to remind me why
woman here im turning 30 in a few weeks no boyfriend no kids i feel as if its over for me by now ive lost about 90 of my eggs my blissful youth has come to an end    should i just have a onenight stand with a nice guy when im ovulating and raise the child on my own money isnt an issue for me and i live in a country where the gov pays women to reproduce and gives new mothers a good amount of maternity leave health care here is obviously free too my only issue is im quite religious and im not sure gd would forgive me for having a bastard child should i go for it anyway
anyone
god will forgive you do what you need to do
why is it so hard for you to meet a man
  god would forgive you but he loves you and what he really wants is whats best for you and your child    think about the child not just yourself a twoparent home is the best environment a kid can be raised in motherhood isnt just about providing you with fulfillment its about taking care of your child
  i have pretty severe social anxiety i feel disgusting all the time
  christ this is depressing i dont think its fair for that kid
    oh you should work on that then find a man     btw if you get pregnant by a man who does not want to be a dad youre gonna fuck his life up and raise a child who will be full of resentment     t a dad
    moreover if you cant enjoy life alone you wont enjoy it in a relationship either
  i came from an intact family parents are still married after 30 years together both my brother and i turned out okay children who come from closeknit families tend to become more compassionate people when they grow up so thats one thing im keeping on my mind
30 years old woman who is considering a one night stand baby    thanks for playing but you already hit the wall no guy would want someone who is that old when men are looking for women that are in their early 20s to mid 20s your fertility is probably already gone as we speak so why bother    i would recommended naming your first cat either snowballs or whiskers as they are both good cat names
  god will forgive you but your child wont
    i do okay by myself its when im in public that i tremble i always feel like a failure i always feel as if im never good enough ive been suicidal before
  too late
  lmao i know plenty of women who got married and got pregnant naturally in their 30s yall acting like its impossible are fucked
  not sure gd would forgive me for having a bastard child    god wouldnt care if you had a kid the sin in the situation is the having sex out of wedlock    dont do it 100 years of psychological research has shown that children that grow up without a father are royally fucked in myriads of ways the plague killing our society is not homosexuality or anything like that its millions of people growing up psychologically damaged from not having a father    the entire black community is what it is for pretty much this reason alone    do not add to the suffering by having a kid on your own you are sacrificing their wellbeing and quality of life for your own selfish emotionality    further having and raising a kid is hard as balls and its going to be depressing as fuck to go through the torture of pregnancy without a husband to care for you youll also feel like shit when you go to childrearing support institutions like daycares etc and see the other girls there who have men to love and support them and their children also the harsh truth is that once you have a child your desirability to men plummets through the floor    i say focus on getting a man 30 is not that bad you can still do it look into perhaps freezing your eggs so that you have more time to do what you need to do in relation to your biological clock      why dont you have a boyfriend do you really feel like you have zero prospects in this context what are the issues
a child doesnt fix ones life   youll only fuck it up and then hate yourself even more go to therapy and make an effort to better yourself only then will you be happy with yourself   also doesnt matter how much money you have the fact that you dont have the support of a man who loves you is what will make your life hell while raising that kid  aka nothing will change  if you have the balls to have a onenight stand then you sure as hell have balls to meet somebody just get off your ass and put in the work   t a mom
thats fucking awful anon i would hate to be your kid    just adopt a dog and work on yourself
  try your local church but whatever you do if you want a kid make sure they have a father
  im jewish
  you know i had a hunch given that you wrote gd instead of god but really i dont know how it is for jews but is not your local community of faithful a possible option
my mom got married when she was 33 and had me at 35 its not too late for you but what you need to do is focus on getting better mentally because you wont be a good mother if you hate yourself and think youre disgusting youll pass that self hatred down to your children please get into therapy
as long as you shave your box and have a sense of humor ill date you    t 27yo/m
  synagogue then
  ill give you my aryan seed if you let me call you an untermensch whore while wearing a nazi uniform
  i live in a jewish neighbourhood but im new here and not exactly in the crowd religious jews dont really date anyway
  being a strong career women    you ask for this enjoy your cats and dildos why did you waste your best years on a career just to have mr goldstein boss you around also the kid is going to hate you for not giving him a father figure
  me at 35    are you even healthy i would be scare having a baby that late in life
i bet op is in australia     am i right
  yeah i was perfectly healthy when i was born and still am never had any major issues
  canada
  in that case just find some lonely cuck theyre all over the place
  and you want to pass that on to progeny because
  well you got lucky because more things can go wrong the more you wait to have babies
canadian eh post a pic     also i can get where you coming from i got anxiety disorders but mine are medicated so im doing slightly ok i just dont agree on you having a kid without the male in the childs life that will fuck him up and he will prob get into criminal shit possibly drugs and what not in life not good to go solo with a kid
honestly you can speed up the process if you do want a man in your life plenty of people meet date for a short time then marry and have kids all within a couple of years and then work out the long term relationship issues after the honeymoon chemicals wear off
  first and foremost youve hit the wall    second it would selfish to have a child without a father being involved youre better off getting cats    lastly if youre really desperate go get a cuck
god doesnt want you to reproduce take the hint
  gd  how large are your breasts
  yeah might as well get knocked up or get sperm donations how did it ever come to this anon
  not terribly large        okay      i have pretty bad social anxiety as ive previously stated i always feel like im ugly or doing something wrong i feel as if i would function better if i were raising a child on my own rather than having to serve a husband as well
  you might function better but statistically speaking your kid will suffer greatly for it
  you honestly doubt my abilities as a mother
  considering they are hereto completely untested i would say yes nice digits tho
  raising kids arent a walk in the park  get a pet
  maybe youd have a man if you didnt buy into that religious bullshit  god will put someone special in your life they said    toilet full of diarrhea is what that is    ita not to late however    spend your sundays going skiiing youll have a bf in a month
  moreover if you cant enjoy life alone you wont enjoy it in a relationship either    probably not as a parent either        you should work on that and try to get into a relationship if you love your kid you should want to at least try to give it the best shot by having two parents      i do okay by myself its when im in public that i tremble i always feel like a failure i always feel as if im never good enough ive been suicidal before    yeah a kid is only going to make that worse and by factors
is there anyone in this thread who is a single parent
  you dont need to serve a husband raising a kid is group effort for the benefit of everyone
  are you illiterate the downs syndrome incidence at 35 is 1/350 by your own chart thats less than 03 chance    if he had a 997 chance of being fine in the first place he didnt get lucky it was the overwhelmingly most likely outcome in the first place youre acting as if its the norm for 35 year olds to give birth to mutants obviously not true
  get a cat
if youre serious i can help im looking for a jewish woman to bear my children ive given up on relationships but absolutely not on having kids i really want them even if ill never see them   im considering becoming a sperm donor actually    anyway my email is paradisetribepmme  im in europe but i can easily fly to canada to help you
  if you hadnt spent your 20s whoring yourself you wouldnt be in this situation deal with it
  please do leave europe and never come back keep your genes out
  my only issue is im quite religious  please dont reproduce
  you cant say the truth like that it may hurt her feelings
  im also terrified of dying alone and childless will you be visiting america anytime soon  t 31yo virgin
  undefeated
  apparently people cant apply statistics to reality moreover nearly not enough is known about paternal age influence articles that can easily be found one click away would prove that it is most likely a combination of both partners age     out of sheer statistics it is more likely for a young couple to give birth to a toddler with down syndrome if they have many kids comparing to a 35 years old couple giving birth to a single child
  woman here  sure sweetie 
  gd  kill yourself also kill yourself for considering being a single mom on purpose youre hurting yourself your child and your country
  god would forgive but this doesnt mean she should willingly sin thinking he would
  male here 30 no wife no kids happy af
wouldnt god give you a baby and a husband by now lol
all these lecithin boys spouting shit about forgiveness have never seen a bible once in their lives  a bastard is not welcome in the congregation of the lord even after ten generating shall his line be cut off from the congregation of the lord
    american anon again thinking about cuddling you and planting my goy seed in your soft fluffy belly
  citing old testament doesnt have to be relevant at all to christianity particularily not deuturonomy
  fuck yes you think people perceive you as a failure now how will you react when little billy throws a tantrum in a store and every judging eye is on you then will you freak the hell out and ignore your child because muh social anxiety jesus listen to what everyone else is saying work on your mental health first and then decide if you want a child or not preferably with a partner who could actually help you    this is some special kind of stupid right here
  op is a jew you fucking retard  and furthermore jesus did not abolish the law of the covenant
  that depends fully on wether you adhere to covenant theology dispentionalism and a bunch of other things know that there is something commonly accepted as ceremonial law basically preparation for the coming amongst the midst of the jews    i didnt catch that she is jewish but i can tell that you arent a brother
  we dont need even more single moms raising broken children     t had a non regular relationship with my father and he had too little influence on my upbringing now im a weak bitch fixing what other boys developed naturally
  did you ride the cock carousel or are you a strong independent career wymon or just a sperg autist bipolar whatever noone would/should date
  i have pretty severe social anxiety i feel disgusting all the time    thats a pretty serious problem and it will definitely affect your child  how long have you felt like this what have you done to work on getting better  any therapy would you ever discuss these things with your rabbi
    dammit i want to cuddle and tell you everything will be ok
  nice larp r9k is that way 
  ill marry you im turning 30 in a few months and ive got nothing going on im not bad looking but im a broke loser ill be a mail order husband from america
  if you want to give your child a shit life by raising him as a single mother then go ahead dont think youll be any different from the others because you wont
  dont hsve any advice other than to listen to what people have said abeloving yourself before you can love a child just want you to know ill be praying for you op
literally has people wanting to marry her itt  ignores them  roastie ghosti
  then so will your child you should be sterilized fuck ups shouldnt breed
  beware my stand the wall
  did you try to engage in a monogamous relationship throughout your 20s or did you lead a promiscuous lifestyle
  having a kid wont solve your problems lady
  please listen to   its unconscionable to create sentient life on your own the government pays you to do it because theyve literally already borrowed against a future childs income to pay for things and they need new life to keep their credit rating is that really the kind of help you want in creating a life worthy of love please do not do it without the love and expressed commitment of another person
op why wont you take any of the suitors itt
periods more likely to be raped weaker than men ages like milk not taken seriously in anything being attracted to men menopause being shorter on average hit the wall by 30 risk of rape by third worlders cant do any fitness mode outside of cardio bunny without looking like shite     incels lied being a woman is the hard mode
  dont raise a child without a father one of the worst things you could do
  you have social anxiety raising a child requires a lot of social interaction youll pass that on to your child and make them suffer too do you feel okay subjecting another soul to suffering
  yeah a kid is only going to make that worse and by factors    not op here but why do you think that  maybe she wouldnt feel miserable if she had a boyfriend and kids ever thought of that     maybe its part of the reason shes miserable 
  should i just have a onenight stand with a nice guy when im ovulating and raise the child on my own  youre a fucking psycho literally deserve to just live with cats stay away from all men and women for that matter
  youre a femincel life as a women isnt hard if youre attractive and have a sweet personality
  when your 40 and tired that kid is going to exhaust you kids need a daddy get out more and tell the guys you are just looking for the real thing
  denying your child of a father  scum
  you should do it you will love your baby more then anything else in the world its the most amazing life changing experience to become a mother at least it was for me as long as you love and care about your child and do your best by him or her it will be ok my children are my only reason for living i love them more then life itself and would do literally anything for them the moment i delivered them and held them in my arms for the first time were the happiest in my life i cant even explain how overwhelming and complete my love for them is
  do not do this do not   being a single mother or a mother at all is not a game it is a matter of the innocent life of another human being not just yours   many people are in this thread are saying that a father needs to be present but its not just about a father its about having grandparents aunts uncles cousins friends really anyone who can help out it really does take a village to raise a healthy child and if you do not have any kind of support network do not have a child    being a single mom wont entitle you to some kind of special treatment or advantages it will be a constant struggle that you do not seem ready for if you need unconditional love get a dog dont bring an innocent child into an unstable situation
  no you do not need a village thats what shitty parents who own their kids off on everyone say and maybe she dosent want special treatment from others maybe she wants to just love a child all these people who dont have children giving advice are talking out of your asses
  it actually take an entire nation working in unison usually in cooperation with other nations to raise a child i dont know how old the phrase it takes a villiage is but it certainly isnt about pawning off anything
  i live in a country where the gov pays women to reproduce and gives new mothers a good amount of maternity leave health care here is obviously free too  gd bless the state for enabling the destruction of the family unit
  now though it takes a solar system to raise a child
  good moms are able to become the sun and manipulate gravity and electromagnetism on a massive scale if necessary
  it dosent ive raised 2 kids who are happy healthy great kids and i dont have anyone else who helps i was raised in a two parent house and lots of extended family guess what i hated it my parents fought all the time and my extended family didnt help with anything all a kid really needs is someone who is 100 there for them who loves them whole heartedly and dose the very best they can my them your child is your responsibility not a bunch of random other peoples there are plenty of single parents out there who raise good kids as long as the parent really tries their best to support and love their kid the child will be ok you dont need aunts or grandparents to raise a happy child thats nice to have i guess but its not necessary
  jesus christ dont do get knocked up with some nice guys baby you will fuck up his life if youre not upfront with him about your intention to get pregnant
fuck god get a sperm donor
  yes thats it become a single mother fulfill the prophecy of the true uberthot why are women so fucking retarded make sure you have a kid with a black guy if youre going to do it single mom with a mixed race kid is the best way to secure your lonliness for life a white one will do if not but mixed has maximum effect for the most efficient high class male repellent work on improving yourself take up a hobby and get good at it be someone worth settling down with its not too late to find a decent guy but you wont get him feeling sorry for yourself and if youre having casual sex at all stop
  children are a million times more fulfilling in life then a guy is i would rather have my kids any day then a man they make me happier then any man ever could love for your partner is great and all but it pales in comparison to love for your child
  kids without father figures in their life are drastically more likely to commit crime and suffer from emotional instability and anger issues if you love your kids you should strive to provide the best environment possible for them to grow up in
  how are people this selfish  youre going to bring a person into this world just so you dont have to be lonely anymore
  those statistics do not take into account the type of mother those kids grew up with if mommy was a junky whore yah your going to grow up with issues they say its because their was not a dad around but in actuality thats only a small part of the reason the person has issues there are other people who were grew up with only a mom and the mom was a good stable parent and the kid turned into a fine adult it has everything to do with the parent that is there being a good one and taking care of the child in a proper way providing them with stability and love even if it is just the one parent and the child if your a hard working caring single parent your kid will most likely turn out ok if your a selfish shit parent who doesnt really care about the childs wellbeing are more busy finding new dicks to hop on your kid will have issues
  op i suggest you have a look at the outcomes of kids raised by a single mother versus kids raised by a couple    its totally selfish on your part to do this
  yes people are incredibly lazy and amoral some people dont even give a shit if their child has one attentive parent let alone two but you already knew that right
  what is wrong with making a life if your willing to give your everything to care for and love it maybe your mom should not have had you why did she want a baby o to love and raise and take care of just like every other parent who sets out to have a baby your point is invalid
should i become a single mother    have you considered lowering your standards instead ive heard this story before woman considers making herself a single mother on purpose because she cant get a man of the 98th percentile because those men already have kids you had to secure a mate in your mid 20s to have your pick of those men securing a husband involves looking for husband material not fuckbuddy material    there is not a shortage of single men just a shortage of attractive wealthy accomplished popular men who are also single flush your disney dreams down the toilet and start dating mere mortals
  just because other people do it that makes it acceptable      making a baby just to fill a void in your life is very different from making a baby from the love of two people who come together
  the workload and time constraints alone make it so that a child who has two parents is vastly better off than a child who has one hell id like to see how threeparent households work out i guess children who are also raised by grandparents as well as the mother and the father would be examples of this    believing in anything else is just fantasy maybe if a single mother could clone herself like in multiplicity it would be a good idea    at the very least live in a rich area where the public schools are exceptional since the average american public school is bad
  also note that children are supposed to grow up in highly social environments if youre a single mother who labors to survive with one child imagine how often thet child will be lonely    the only times the child will not be lonely are when a the grandparents are covering for you b the nursery is covering for you c the public school is covering for you d your boss gives you off from work    what percentage of the timr will the child feel like they have an immediate family the more you labor to try and pay for your existence and the childs existence the longer you will be away from the child    women without fathers are liable to be victimized men without fathers dont learn fair play recipe for a serial killer its very bad even mice learn fair play and nurseries are opting for kids to just never touch or challenge each other daycare operators cant play with the kid either becaude people are worried about pederasts who do exist
  well i raised two after my husband died and i can tell you my kids have had way happier better childhoods with just me taking care of them then i did with two parents i worked at a daycare when my kids were little so i could be there for them all the time they are happy smart healthy kids i am so proud of them we dont have extended family they have me and i have them and thats the only close people who were around when they were growing up now that they are older they have friends and such all imsaying is that its totally possible to raise good kids by yourself its not easy you have to give 110 all the time to do right by them but its totally worth it my kids are my everything and i can see why op would want the fulfillment in life that carring for a child brings she should have that if shes willing to do everything it takes to provide for and love a child she will have to work really hard at it but like i said its worth it
  nobody believes a parents assessment of their own children theyre too biased
  yeah its possible for a single mother situation to be good what people are saying is that its generally better to have more than one person supporting the childs continued growth    by the way many nurseries dont let you do that now i have a friend who works in childcare and she hasnt found a single one that would permit that    finding a cohesive relationship is hard in our society where everyone is free to make their own relationship rules but if op cant find a husband it could still be a sign of emotional issues or being overly stressed by life as it already is    thats another difference between you and op you were married and you really knew the father
  your not a parent are you most of what you said is wrong and made up to push your worped sense of what parenthood is like you can work jobs that let you spend time with your kids you just have to be smart and pick the right job the stuff about serial killers is laughable there have only been a few hundred serial killers threw out modern history many of whom had two parents but millions of boys who grew up with only a mother and turned out fine or at least were not murderers again if a mother is a good mother and teaches her daughter not to be a victim she will most likely not be one if the mother is a shity mother who dose not take the time to teach that lesson them the daughter will have problems its ridiculous that you are acting like its impossible to be a good single parent its very possible hard and not an easy task by any means but it is 100 posible if you work hard at it and always put your childs needs first
  they are a students have lots of friends no behavior issues i did get them counseling for a time when their dad passed they were 2 and 4 years old and saw a counselor for about 8 months after it happened but other then that and obviously still missing there dad or what it would have been like if he had gotten to still be with us they have not had any issues they are 14 and 16 now     it is difficult to find a job that will accommodate a childs needs to but its not impossible you do bring up valid points that this girl should really look at herself and think fully if she will be up to the task i just dont think its fair how many people write her want for a child off and act like its impossible to be a good single parent
  im not sure gd would forgive me  he wont  be a roastie get the toasty
  if the mom is a good mom and teaches the kid good things then everything is okay  first off this isnt about how good the mom is its about whether or not the mom should purposely have a fatherless child    there have been plenty of serial killers besides the ones who get rotation on the history channelobviously the likelihood of raising some kind of murderer is very small but if you think about it logically the same set of variables that dramatically increase the likelihood of a serial killer why would you subject a kid to that    and if you gave a shit about the actual likely outcomes higher rates of mental illness poor performance in school poverty low education youd start to see the faces of some people you know in real life in those statistics    you have no first hand experience with the problem  yeah the statisticians corrections officers policy makers lawyers and social workers just pick up the pieces of the foolish choices people made they have no firsthand experiende in causing the problems theyve been tasked with cleaning up    you have show no caution about being a single parent no inquisitiveness about the downsides thats ignorance    with hard work  this is a phony saying obviously we wouldnt have anything if someone didnt work for it but simply working hard isnt going to ensure that everything is fine and anything is possible    i never said once that its impossible to be a good single parent by the way good parents are rare at lower incone strata though honestly and you know plenty of rich ones are bad too i see two parent households blatantly fuck up all the time ive never seen a single parent pull it off    divorced with split custody is different
  but next youll say im superficial and that income doesnt matter meanwhile the average american high school is a glorified daycare where students can buy drugs
  you sound like your just against having kids in general and are making up reason why no one should have them because x y and z could go wrong the serial killers thing is so out your ass its funny the majority of documented serial killers came from two patent households usually ones that were abusive the ones that didnt stemmed from deeply rooted neurologic disorders that had nothing to do with their up bring you need to read more up on this before you try to spout off on the topic money definitely has a big part in the quality of a kids childhood thats why i said you have to be smart enough to go after the right job and hard working enough to make sure your child is provided for and still gets the time and parental attention they need there is nothing wrong with having a baby by yourself if you know you can provide that if you disagree fine but i think your wrong and your not going to change my mind
  my dad was shot when i was 1 in australia    growing up my mother was surrounding me with father figures and i am one of the most privilaged humans on the planet  i still have no idea how to turn off a certian side of me thats basicly a bitch only having my sweet mother never provided me with any teeth boys walked over me as i was too nice     humans always get fucked up without balance anyone who disagrees is not gona make it
  try to figure out a way to adopt a child
woman here im turning 30 in a few weeks no boyfriend no kids i feel as if its over for me by now ive lost about 90 of my eggs my blissful youth has come to an end  im turning 30   its over for me  ive lost about 90 of my eggs    white women be like
  this is the best answer  id just like to add that while twoparent homes are the best you can still make it a good home trough effort for example having some kind of uncle drop by once a week to provide a positive male rolemodel
my absolute favorite are the ass blasted neets who think women shouldnt be allowed to have careers my guess is because they think those jobs would go to them when in reality absolutely no one would be interested in employing them
  to be fair according to statistics men are leaving the workforce at roughly the same rate women are joining it whats even more is that women dont marry down economically speaking while men do so now you have a bunch of single adults who probably arent going to have kids or get married most likely because so many women are going into the workforce
this is bait from reddit  i googled the text
my view may be out dated but its not your fault in a way because men are suppose to provide for you and you belong in the home doing the opposite is bad for society sure its not wrong for women to work but to put her career over family is dare i say evil
hey /adv/ never been on this board before but i trust this place slightly more than any other board     i recently had a big surgery and got these tramadol pills 50mg each i didnt use them much during the bulk of the recovery because i had percocet which is much stronger now the pain is pretty much all gone and im bored how many of these things do i have to take for a decent high something akin to the percocet without killing me on the spot preferably just looking to get the nice tingly fun feeling and watch some movies the recommended dosage is 1 per 46 hours if that helps    i dont have an addiction or anything but i like trying out recreational drugs sometimes maybe once a month or so
max dose is 400mg for 24 hours dont go over 400mg
start low to see if you feel sick or anything 150200 mg 34 pills should be fine take 3 then an hour later take another one or two depending on how you feel
  over 400 mg  seizure for many ppl    if u unlucky u could get seizure at lower dose than that    mixing with other drugs also lowers seizure treshole enjoy
note that you really damage your liver once you get past 300mg so dont do that too often if you build tolerance to it
  solid plan thank you      interesting thing i only have two percocets left but i might dedicate one to trying a 1 percocet  3 tramadol mixture      good thing to know is that 300mg per day
  i live in a 3rd worls cunt and people here take this shit to get high   i usually take a single pill but its red and has 225 written on one side and an x on the opposite   when i started out i only took half of that pill and it used to hit pretty strong
  thats probably 225mg id imagine which is about 4 and a half of these bad boys i have
  yeah i get where youre coming from but the shit we have here comes in different tabs and a different pill shape/color which is why im concerned about my experiences ability to translate over to yours  pic related its referred to as strawberry on the street here but like in arabic
  nvm i just realized tramadol is the name of the compound in the drug not the brand sorry ive been trying to sleepfor the past 6 hours
  hah youre fine the pills i have are tramadol but the brand name is ultram i think were talking about the same thing
tramadol is some of the shittiest shit ive ever taken but my body doesnt respond well to opiates for some reason
opiates are a slippery slope just be careful buddy addiction and liver damage are no fun
  yeah im not interested in the liver damage part how can i avoid that as best as possible aside from yknow not taking triple the recommended dosage    i dont think ill have problems with the addiction necessarily im keeping myself in check
ok so its late at night what should i say out of context to them
say fuck this shit im gonna go bone my girlfriend then go do that and leave that shitty gaymer scum platform behind
somebody help i woke up feeling feverishand i feel as though somebody has stolen half if my active thoughts my mind is as if someone had ripped it inhalf like page in two and im haveing trouble coordinating my thoughts into one my every action and thought is painful to think about i dont do drugs but i have a bit of a cold since 2 dayz ago either way i feel awful panicky and hyperaware and never happened before its like bad trip and decisions are very difficult to think about somebody help hold my hand it feels pathetic and dont want to bother anyone but i figured you fags wouldnt mind is this what a panic attack feels like how snowflaky of me fml for being such a pussy if thats the case
peace is a lie theres only passion
  ive had fevers like this where its impossible to concentrate on thoughts and shit    whats your temperature
ive noticed about a month ago that one of my close relatives in their early 60s is more forgetful than usual and occasionally seems to be having trouble doing simple tasks they used to do seamlessly for instance asking me for help navigating their computer even though i know them to be tech savvy im starting to suspect onset dementia    is there cause for worry if i must voice my concerns how can i do it without hurting their feelings especially knowing i might be wrong is there anything i can do to help them
kinda hard to brainwash myself and be happy when youre too redpilled its just that come on how can you believe anything in bible but yknow im kinda wondering if i started believing in god or jesus or whatever will the suffering be lessen
follow your heart
  alright fuck this shitty pride where do i start this kinda feel degrading
is it better to imbibe your own delusional obsession ceaselessly or simply give in to reality early and ask her to break your heart
latter
why not presenting yourself in a way that would lead her to say yes a lumberjack shirt with the sleeves rolled up never hurt anybody
  hurts trees
  shes many years taken
  thats right we should ban assault shirts and limit them to seven buttons
  married if not shes not taken but chances are youre even more of a dildo than the guy shes with so it doesnt matter either way
  ive never met the guy shes with but if i ever did see them together i think it would kill me maybe i am a dildo and dont deserve anyone
  not necessarily but you need to find another less taken woman to serve as their doormat
  is the doormat life the only future i have ahead of me
first off i have no clue if i should post this here or not and apologies for any mistakes i make  so for quite some time ive had no real relationship or at least one like this im finally starting to get a girl and i feel like were getting close but i really cant tell for sure  i suppose since i have no clue what to add ill just answer questions after i post this
protip if you want advice you should ask a question d
  how do i improve this relationship and how do i avoid ruining it
to keep things brief ive been taking vyvanse 30mg for my adhd for a little over a year it helps me focus on the insane amount of work i have to do im an actuarial student and also to control my depressive feelings    now im graduating i have a job lined up and i feel more depressed and unattentive than ever before i dont know if my medicine isnt working as well of its just the stress of the situation but i feel like i cant get the shit done that i need to do either way i just lay on my bed all day and then feel like shit at night because i didnt get my work done    what do i do here guys my psychiatrist doesnt want to up my dosage even after i told him about this mostly because of the side effects of my current dosage basically im such a faggot that i forget to eat alot of times and ive lost 25 pounds in the last 6 months    should i look into getting antidepressants or something instead im worried about starting a new medication right as my new job is coming up i dont want to deal with some potentially weird side effects at this really critical point in my life but i also dont want to risk these current feelings screwing me over
  no idea about adhd but side effects for antidepressants arent debilitating or anything you will just have to switch medications if youre having a bad reaction i think its worth trying something if youve stopped functioning
  side effects for antidepressants arent debilitating    frightening and appalling that people still actually believe this
  fellow adhd college student here i usually just take a small break when i have a ton of work and either read a book or play video games for a little bit not saying you have to do those two things but try doing something that takes your mind off the stress for awhile
my girlfriend will use heart emojis when liking certain mens posts on fb and it makes me really jealous i havent told her it bothers me but i feel i shouldnt have to im not going around using heart emojis on womens fb    am i being irrationally jealous
i dont have any advice but i just want to say this is hilarious i cant believe shit like this is important on any level nowadays lmao social media man
delete all social media and you dont have to think about it anymore
  you are literally retarded
  lmao    my best friend is a woman and she always hearts my posts shes not interested in me and im not interested in her give it a rest man    i havent told her it bothers me  and dont youll come off as terribly insecure
  i would say no because im old fashioned but my girlfriend wouldnt send other men hearts anyway she gets mad when other dudes try to get familiar with her    yall needa date women who arent constantly in need of a cult of worshiping men surrounding them
  honestly i heart react almost everything on facebook mostly its just like i love this but i cant say that i dont have a little bit of flirt in it when i heart react a girls picture     id be uncomfortable with it too its kinda like shes showing interest
i just watched pic related and i think i will end up like the main character i see people around me getting into relationships while im just too shy to even talk to peoplei subconsciously push people away while life goes on at an extremely fast rate im still young at 21 but i feel like this how do i prevent myself from dying alone
should i get gifts for coworkers
  if you like them
  would it be wrong to get gifts for only 2 of them i have like 30 coworkers but 2 of them have been above the others
  would it be wrong to get gifts for only 2 of them   no
  would it be weird to give a gift i made one of them likes to cook and i woodwork and made a spatula that ive never used that i want to give them  ive never given or received a gift outside of my immediate family and we havent done gifts for 3 years so i dont know
  would it be weird to give a gift i made  as long as its not complete shit i have faith in your handiwork though if theres anything cooks love besides food its kitchenware
    not if its something you already like to do    if you learned that shit just to give them a gift that is weird    otherwise tis the season anon    and the fact is we spend a huge chunk of our lives with our coworkers so it shouldnt be unusual at all to try and make those relationships flourish
  thanks anon pic related
  not bad at all wouldnt mind gifting that to my brother if i knew my way around tools
    thanks anons  last question how should i gift it take them to my car after work
  bit too weird just hand it to them after work simply say hey i got you something
  thanks  merry christmas
  you too mate
  i cook and i approve this message
  do you think this is good enough for a gift  
  very much so id almost feel bad about actually using it if its as polished as it looks but as a gift it would be great regardless the kind of utensil you keep hanging on the rack to remind you that youve got a friend out there
    if you like doing this shit you should sell some of this shit     looks good enough to me for a side hustle    feliz navidad
  the others might take exception but thats not your fault
recently our grandmother died and we sold her house and shipped all her shit from one state to another these aaa moving faggots broker your loads out and wreck your shit anyway items are missing among them 2 firearms ww2 relics but functioning this took place across state lines my main question is do i need to get the atf involved
  call the police and file a report
  yes
  this also post an articulate yelp review warning others about their company
  definitly will going to consult a lawyer prior though it is fucking insane the damage done and fuckery through out there are already terrible reviews i didnt hire these ass hats      will be doing this soon trying to assess all the damages
for as long as i can remember ive had these soft but large blobs of skin on my anus they dont itch or hurt and arent sensitive to touch but they definitely have nerves in them they also get large after bowel movements    my gp said he doesnt think theyre hemorrhoids and he referred me to a dermatologist who just shrugged and said theyre fine she didnt seem to know what they are either and just told me to take the triamcinolone cream i was prescribed    i dont think theyre fine im bi and its causing me a lot of stress and anxiety because i think theyre hideous and would sooner just not have a sex life i have never seen an ass have these things on them before i dont even know what im asking /adv/ but i feel like doctors arent seeing what im seeing and like im crazy i go to the gym im a healthy weight otherwise physically very healthy but im at a loss when it comes to these things    any advice on how to handle this and potentially treat them ive been thinking of placing tight bands around them to remove em like skin tags    ill attach a link here instead of posting the pic because its very nsfw and pretty gross thanks    
ive had one of these for awhile started like a year ago and it hurt at first so i thought it was hemorroids it doesnt hurt anymore and i forget its there unless im wiping and i feel it it also gets large after i take a shit but i only have 1 and im straight so i dont really worry about it yours looks alot more noticable if youre taking up the ass i guess it matters but idk what to tell you
bump
  i dont know why i looked at that     is going to a cosmetic dermatologist out of the question
how to understand english talk
  listening to it
how about learn english
read sherlock
first understand self
not be retarded sorry op
assuming you can already read english try watching tv shows in english even childrens shows with subtitles on and try to follow on also maybe hire a tutor to help you learn english
they have apps and shit for that now op try duolinguo or whatever insipid app people are using these days instead of reading a book taking a class or just looking up lessons on youtube    alternatively you could find a work of fiction that exists both in your home language and in english and use it to gain some familiarity for the language it makes it pretty easy to make the connections between words in a naturalfeeling sort of way especially if the work is something you know well or have watched/read a lot then the whole way through youll be like oh x in my language means y in english
how important is a father figure or is it just a meme
10/10 important
my dad wasnt really around ever because he was always working he still is im actually jealous when i see other people get along with their dads
  not that we dont get along but just dont know each other and im hoping we could bond more all the time i honestly dont want to know about celebrities because theres too much talking shit going on so idk whos side to take when im asked what i think of them   thats a tangent damn im really not here and i have tinnitus from overly loud music and a lot of ailments im going to die young at this rate no more music
a father figure  its just an antilesbian meme  myth
conservative meme
tfw 8 year old half brothers dad killed himself while our mom was still pregnant
    i think it might matter but maybe im blaming others for my own problems maybe my situation wouldve been fine i hadnt screwed up but idk what to do about that i need help with that
  i hate my father because he was never there for me when i needed him the most  so most of my childhood was crying because my dad would leave get drunk and come till 5pm the next day while i stay home panicking about what might have happened to him  so yes a father figure is important to help your child and to love them
  retard
  when i was young i remember i always admired my dad so much i thought he was the greatest he had an ability to assert dominance in the household without ever raising his voice that my mum never had i wanted to be just like him and that to a large extent has shaped who i am today id hate to imagine a childhood without him in it
guy here    ive never had a strong masculine presence in my entire life i was basically raised by women many of whom were/are dysfunctional in some respect    its set me back in major ways ive never had any strong guidance in my life so ive pretty much just trudged along figuring things out as i go because of this im waaaay behind people my age in terms of life advancement
  dont worry about masculinity man i struggle with that too
woman here my dad was present but absent at the same time he was also an asshole towards my mom and everyone else i recently discovered i have huge trust issues because of him cant trust men like i trust women its now up to me to fix it i am almost there but its been really really hard for me
father figures have been the most important thing in my life so that i dont become a chick with daddy issues since my own dad was gone for like 56 years i think theyre very important mothers do their best but they absolutely cannot fill the same role as a dad men are women are just too different and while i love my mother she is unfortunately the strict bitchy neverproudofyou parent and i and a lot of people need something to balance that out   bond with some male bosses teachers grandparents etc find a mentor when you find that one you really mesh with its fantastic
  probably more important than a mother honestly
  does this also apply if you were forced to live with your abusive mentally ill father every other week because he had joint custody also had to live with him for extended points of time when my mom was homeless
  muh anecdote
  same experience here
  what
  yea
1 raising a child one parent is like trying to go through life with one hand two is the norm for a reason    2 when pervs and assholes are thinking about targeting a vulnerable young person the first thing they worry about is the young persons father the mother isnt even on the list of concerns    3 acting like men arent good for anything is just called sour grapes its the equivalent of bitcheswhores memes
  he posted statistics not one persons story
it matters but everyone is different just because you have a shitty father figure doesnt mean youll turn out bad    life has many doors
ive only had girlfriends with absent fathers and thats saying something
yes its important probably one of the most important things in growing up is to have a father bond i think women want to cover you in a comfortable blanket of love and that doesnt prepare you for independence
while my father was around i was pretty ballsy and used to chase around after girls in kindergarten    he left when i started grade school and i became more and more shy got overweight and had very few friends    he became more active when i got to midteens but by that point hed just prostrate me about my lifestyle
my father was a narcissist and a hoarder when he died it was so liberating i wish i had grown up without
  this nice job anon
i would have preferred not to have a father because my father was shitty he actively tried to destroy my confidence and the only reason why im relatively stable now is because im selfaware and worked on my stability i think that fathers are important to a child but only the good ones its better not to have a father than to have a shitty one
  statistically you are fucked  you end up as a thug a drug addict and in very extreme cases you become a pathetic weeb who posts on 4channel
  waaaay  gay or bi
  same i have bipolar after all the stress unable to hold a job especially not if they know im mentally ill i am just probably suicide before 30 im in my early 20s
    same here  ive been looking for father figures in professors at college lately
  father figures are cool but not integral for development whats most important is being your own man and happy with yourself
  i think very important just because being a single mom raising one/two children is really fucking hard if you have a full time job at the same time and just being two people will greatly reduce the work load while also improving the amount of attention each child can get    t raised by single mom and a failure
  same im on the path to hating men and realised that men can be fucking inferior after seeing my father goddamn i hate most males so much
  same here  i feel i never learned how to be a man and it drives me crazy because i have no idea how to approach women
all these bipolar children from broken families claiming father figures arent important  lol i love this website sometimes
  i see you have no brothers then
    depends on how good your mother is/was    t raised by single mom who had her shit together and became a success
  martial arts teachers are good too as external father figures
statistically its important but that doesnt mean you automatically have some hidden issues that you didnt know about just because your dad was gone  dontknow if that counts as a meme or not
  men can be fucking inferior  men can be  yes people can be good and bad welcome to being an adult
it obviously has an effect on you during your upbringing but using your father or lack of father as an excuse for shitty behavior is pure cope
  social structures older than civilization itself were constructed for the purpose of spiting muff masticaters   sure    id find lesbians insisting they exist as an unwavering identity less laughable if they didnt regularly show an abject irreverence and skepticism for everything that makes up the identity of half the fucking species    thank you for voluntarily removing yourself from the gene pool we dont need more bitter selfobsessed people
  thats definitely part of it  ever seen diamond is unbreakable its really cool because both the protagonist and the bad guy are from a single parent home the protagonists mother is this little battle axe that badgers him relentlessly to do the shit hes supposed to do while the villains father constantly tries to cover for his son and protect him  thats a duality i see all the time in single parenting they either shoulder up the responsibilities of both halves and let their kid figure out the genderspecific stuff on their own or theyre apathetic and enable the shit out of them
  same 3/3 were either bipolar and sexual bipolar insecure and suicidal or just emotionally unstable
its important but its not an excuse    at one point who you are is your responsibility theres no such thing as    im not that type of person/i cant do that because i didnt have a father growing up    once youre an adult
i have 2 young girls i havnt seen in about 4 years now one of them is 4 years old the other is 8 or 9 i only spent about a year of time with the 4 year old the mother is a fucking nightmare and i have an urge to choke her to death every time i see her or even hear her voice ive kinda just wrote the kids off and i tell people i have no kids hope they turn out alright should i try and be involved when they are older and can reach out to me and if so what should i tell them
be me  dad abandoned me  my stepdad hit my mom  fucking hate man  i am on the verge of transitioning to female because of this
  you sound like a turbofaggot
  because of this im waaaay behind people my age in terms of life advancement  huge ditto    my mother is a nutcase ripped my father out of my life at a young age my entire adult life has felt like a late bloomer im always years behind peers my age im 27 now and still working very hard to close the gap but damn its hard youre really on your own and have to learn most lessons in life the hard way
hijacking this thread for my own related question how important is a mother figure  t had a dad only see my mom every 5 years
  i had a brother like you  please dont follow in his footsteps i know how much that experience tears you up inside but you have to find a way to take back the things you feel he stole from you there are very positive forms of masculinity and im sure you have that inside you somewhere
  isnt that a prerequisite to being here
  hell be more adjusted assuming his dad is normal
  hell be more adjusted  im asking this from a female perspective in case that makes any difference
  youd know more about it than most of us    ive heard of single dads raising little tomboys think scout from to kill a mockingbird but i dont know what that lack of a nurturer does to girls    same thing do you feel like you never learned how to be motherly
  very positive forms of masculinity  such as
  oh so a girl being raised without a mother or more adjusted by a females standard i wouldnt know about the girl being raised without a mother but id say a guy would be at bare minimum equally adjusted by anyones standard
  well this just doesnt seem very common and i dont feel like i know a lot about it either but i certainly am more manly than the average girl in the sense that i do dress much like a guy and dont have many girly interests either  do you feel like you never learned how to be motherly  im starting to think this is part of the reason why im so bad with kids and why i feel so awkward around them anyway thanks for the insight
  anger that doesnt result in destruction  the drive and ambition to earn the things you want the cavalier playfulness to shake off your rejections and losses and the emotional fortitude to be a rock for people around you  the feeling of confidence and pride that comes from developing your physical abilities seeing all these weird and fascinating shapes form in your arms that you had no idea were even there     above all the pure strength of will to be alone and downtrodden and still thank god that you were given this little chunk of space and time to live
  extremely
hi /adv/ ive just finished taking my a levels im not sure how well i did so im having a hard time narrowing down the options i have for a degree if i do make it to university so for all the university students/ degree holders out there a few questions    what course did you take why did you choose it  do you like it is the curriculum tough  hows life in general  are you thinking of furthering your studies  for those who have graduated where did your education lead you do you do anything related to your degree for a living    feel free to leave any other advice you might have given to your younger self and thank you in advance
  what course did you take why did you choose it  some it course did it because it looked easy and i had a passing interest in a few fields and didnt want to do computer science specifically   do you like it is the curriculum tough  it was alright the curriculum was easy smashed it with little to no effort in 3 years  hows life in general  alright buying a house soon  are you thinking of furthering your studies  no cv has hit the point where it would be a waste of money  for those who have graduated where did your education lead you do you do anything related to your degree for a living  absolutely not work for a bank analysing their risk    use uni for networking mate its who you know not what you know and get a 21 minimum feel free to ask any more questions
what the other anon said it doesnt really matter what degree you do as long as you take the appropriate measures like making connections and putting yourself out there i did well in college and still fail to obtain a career and only make 10/hour because i simply went home after classes because of an hour and ten minute commute most people who major in something dont even work in that specific area the only time you want to major in something specific is if you want to be a doctor lawyer or aerospace engineer as those require specifics and not generalities like most other fields
if so does this fall under that category
  yes its real but in your case she just isnt interested in you
i should also add she sent me this before pic related i mean i dont know if im looking for a relationship as of right now i love being your friend i just want to be completely honest with you im not mentally strong right now ive been struggling with anxiety and depression and its just been a really hard time     also after pic related she told me as long as we are friends and still can hang out that would be great 
  no she found a chad instead of you
  nah    someone either likes you or they dont once they start giving excuses about why they cant be with you thats a hard no sorry anon
  this
  i feel that too but to her credit she has been struggling with that stuff ive seen it and heard it from her parents who im cool with
  i mean its nice to have hope but as loathe as i am to say it without exception this sort of thing has never panned out well for me or anyone ive known just recently my sister gave the whole not ready for a relationship bs to a guy friend and started dating someone else like to weeks after its an excuse    whatever investment you have in this person is going to be better spent on another
  as long as we are friends and still can hang out that would be great  fuck this bitch she is trying to play you she gets all the perks why you wonder what is going through her mind  just drop her it will be better for you in the long run
    shes not interested in you but you already know that    she wants to remain friends id say keep her as a friend i the current girl im dating right now is my girl just because i befriend girls im not interested i met her through a girl i didnt like but she liked me tho lol    so even if she friend zones you its always good to have female friends
yes it is real it can be as simple as something super fucked is going on/just happened now is not the time family members get cancer and die all the time or maybe theyre just too damn busy because the multiple job hustle is hell but it aint permanent either    never assume anything you have no reason to assume if theres breadcrumbs sure but doubting people without reason to do so is the functional definition of paranoia
its a rejection and she doesnt like you romantically shes trying to let you down gently by suggesting this isnt the right time obviously you two could potentially get together in the future just like in the future you could potentially go to mars it doesnt mean shit i dont want to make assumptions because maybe she is dealing with some serious stuff and cant focus on relationships at the moment but if she really did like you then she would try to make it work
  the blue bubble is your message dont gaslight that could be a start
    op here you guys think similarly to me im not banking on still being with her but im staying in the loop she actually does have her plate full schools been tough and she plays college basketball so shes dealing with that on top of being hurt a lot and other family stuff so im still texting her and hanging out with her genuinely i want her to get better for her wellbeing if we still talk after then thats icing on the cake i really do like her but ive always had bad luck with girls so ill go on with my life      yeah the blue bubble is me
  having your plate full doesnt mean shit if people can enter into long distance relationships where they dont see each other for months on end she could easily be in a relationship with you i think you should distance yourself a bit from this girl because youre falling into the usual trap of having feelings for a close friend thats not going to go anywhere you dont have to cut her off but dont be her emotional tampon i genuinely hope you find a new girl who actually likes you and doesnt give you excuses
how should one approach extreme envy
there are people better than you and that person youre envious of just try to improve yourself dont try to outdo everyone
  im trying but that envy still stings inside
  who do you envy and why is it because you want to stand out do they threaten you in a way
  i envy more than one person i feel this way mostly because im a looser and useless
  maybe youre too hard on yourself perhaps you look at other people and assume theyre better than you in every way when they have their own issues too its great that youre improving yourself you may get to a point where none of this phases you anymore because youre proud of how far youve come
  just remind yourself theres nothing you can do
  i know that theyre not flawless some even confine with me whats going on in their lives i know about their insecurities and i recognize their weakness but i still know that when it comes to things they and i can bring to the table comparatively theyre going to win   you may get to a point where none of this phases you anymore because youre proud of how far youve come   thats what im aiming for
  i tried that already
    work on letting things go yeah its really hard selfexamination/selfcorrection might help youre not jealous for no reason youve got some issue with some thing somehow to do with the person/people youre jealous of where youre in the wrong and they didnt do anything so you just have to adjust your attitude i lived my whole life with a bad attitude and im a fucking loser so believe me when i tell you its the attitude
  i know its that attitude its not like i lash out at these people ive been self examining for a while now and thats how i reached this conclusion ive been happier than ive been in a while i just cant seem to help myself when it comes to this     thank you btw
  i frequently feel that my efforts to improve myself and my position in life are fruitless  theres nothing you can do  makes me want to give up on trying not give up noticing the growth of others

i have seen  fat people getting gf  short people getting gf  average people getting gf  poor people getting gf  but i have never ever seen an awkward guy with a gf and im one of them is it game over for me i feel its the worst personality trait a man could have
  youll only have access to dominant psychotic girls who abuse you emotionally even worse if youre actually a doormat
  its possible just get an awkward gf as well friend of mine got one and he is awkward as hell they met at a party and just started talking and both just wanted a relationship so bad theyre not in love but dont expect her to be 8/10
meanwhile a short guy a poor guy and a fat guy are making the same thread truth is you can be in a relationship even if youre short fat poor awkward whatever
  yeah im the most awkward dude youll ever meet yet i got myself a gf you just have to know how to convince her to believe you are awesome eventually fuck her real good create a bond bang you got yourself a gf    now lasting more than 1 year or 2 thats another story but i really doubt you want to be in a relationship for more than 1 year after that things start going downhill and the amount of sex you get per week gets reduced to 1 or 2 times per week
  im as awkward as they come and i have a gf the only asterisk is that she is even more awkward than me
  i am an awkward guy that got a girlfriend out of sheer circumstance  described it deadon regardless i still love her but only after we split she taught me some things    all other times i was too focused on my small penis and other insecurities to bother hitting on the two other girls who i know liked me plus i didnt want them to know i was an awful druggie back then    hoo boy the drugs really did me in im more awkward than ever

adv/ what are some good majors to take for medschool also is it possible to enter medschool by taking all prerequisites at a community college     im in not a good financial spot at 27 with a part time job and taking prereqs i already have a business major but i dont feel like following that path anymore its not about the money but the journey    pic very related i am an anxious fuck
  supposedly english is in demand though that might just be a meme  anything but premed though premeds are useless
  i suppose if things dont turn out english is still a good major for other jobs
    there are two choices here    either you take an easy degree or a harder degree    easy degrees include biology chemistry anatomy/phy biochemistry medicinal biochemistry biomedical sciences insert any major that has low credits that can easily fit in premed courses    hard majors biomedical engineering chemical engineering etc    either you do an easy major and you work your ass off or you end up being a research aide for 30k a year    with a hard major its tougher but if you have a good work ethic you can do it im doing bme with premed so i can gain a wider knowledge of the devices that i may use in medical school and beyond all depends on you chief
  engineering is a hard degree    im lmaoing at your life right now
oh pee    med schools honestly dont care what you study only that you take the premed courses and score well in all of your classes    then study hard and kill the mcat    then get patient care exposure
    if you say so
  wait what really    i always had this impression that med school acceptance was incredibly elitist to clarify i am not aiming for the best med school i just want to be an md and have the capacity to cure others
the other thread is dying so lets start a new one
i have extreme anxiety and literally no one will prescribe me benzodiazepines i have tried countless other things over the years and nothing works at an all time low barely leave my room now zero friends cannot set my mind to anything and get it done i panic over literally the smallest things or the most far fetched terrible things that probably wont happen to me this is just not a life worth living lol    i have seen so many doctors over the past 2 years and i just dont know if i can do it anymore
i cant stop obsessing over somebody but i have this gut feeling its unrequited i feel angry inadequate frustrated and anxious since i cant see them in person how can i prevent my mood from being so dependent on them i dont show them at all i need validation but i feel that whenever they say something it isnt genuine im suspicious and its having an impact on my mood       what have the doctors said when you requested them
  because theyre highly addictive ive just been shut down every time warned of the risks and rerouted onto different antidepressants ssris snris atypicals etc ive been up all night having really horrible anxiety as usual im thinking of going in to see a doctor tomorrow and flat out asking to try a lowdosage of benzodiazepines but i feel like im going to get shut down again which is funny because last time i stepped into a doctors office i was told to go to hospital immediately because she thought i was going to kill myself lol    theres no winning
  you should tell them about it and ask  thats the only way for you to get to know if its genuine or not
  good luck i hope you can find a doctor that can listen      im afraid that my suspicions will be right but i know what youre suggesting is right to do i just wanted to enjoy it a little longer ill see if i can pull up the courage to ask thank you
i wanted to be friends with an older kid when i was 8 and in turn was molested by him for his friendship and subsequently bullied through highschool by him the hate and need for revenge is consuming me 30 years later ihave his address and want to write his wife a letter and ruin his fucking life or just put a bullet in him its driving me insane the thought of revenge sounds like it will stop the nagging need to do something about it any thoughts
i am sexually attracted to this girl but feel guilty even thinking about masturbating to her
  different anon cannot stress enough how much you should definitely tell them good luck
  reposting my problem from the deleto thread    everyone seems to magically make friends between lectures one lecture everyone is strangers and no one talks next lecture everyone seems to be sorted into friend groups when and where did this happen between lectures making friends seems ezpz for everyone but me even the obviously shy/awkward/autistic people seem to be able to do it 
  i dont fit in with these neerrrrdddsssss
i just ruined a relationship by asking for pics of tits
fell in love with a girl who lives overseas  kinda want to date around during my undergrad years instead of being exclusive to someone i wont see for years  but also want to be serious with this truly special girl  god is cruel
im stuck in a relationship with a 5/10 annoying roastie who only wants dick and everytime ive tried to leave her shes been manipulative
    ill teach you my ways  make yourself unappealing to her  knowing what she dislikes start to slowly change and say its who you are deep down say you feel like a women and want a sex change there goes the dick say you need to find yourself and want to travel the world for a year say you joined religion    and get evidence of manipulation and take it to police and get a restraining order like this isnt hard just tedious
  drug her knock her up in her sleep disappear because she obvs just wants your baby
my parents divorced when i was 5   my father became a kind of homeless captain after that and i didnt see him for a very long time   mom got a new boyfriend who was running from a criminal life he had money  he went on to destroy any kind of self worth i had between the ages of 618   physical and mental abuse were also very regular and my mom participated   they split up when my mom cheated   i had to live with him for a few years because i got addicted to smoking weed and was too much for my mom to handle i guess   ive attended 8 different high schools and a few more places for troubled youth  never really made any lasting friends because of the moving and general mental health issues   i dont really blame anyone nor am i mad this all happened i guess ive just never drank the koolaid so many people get to enjoy
i caught my girlfriend receiving messages on tinder a few months ago ive noticed shes been clearing her phones notifications when she never did that before shes been rushing me off to bed the second i seem tired so i cant help but think she wants some alone time with her technology i really want to die
the thing is i know your organization relies heavily on the need to know basis that no one has all the answers most of them dont even know why they are there     meaning the odds of him not knowing what i am and where i came from are extremely slim the odds of this being edited are extremely high     they might not think i listen but i know who they are i know what i am and im telling you freaks i have eyes in the back of my head
  fucking talk to her about it
  yeah i actually didnt think of that  i thought of going to the cops but it kust seems like its not necessary    i guess i have to make her lose all attraction to me in a way that wont make me look retarded aka acting like a tranny
hes gotten much better hes not holding onto this underlying seething rage he once was when this shit first went down    i mean hes still selfish and spoiled i fear thats a trait that is embedded in the dna from youkid wont even share a taste of his advent calendar chocolate this year lol he will not share toys unless its his one best friend    hes a good kid though despite everything as soon as hes old enough hell learn how to give back and do community service he might be selfish but hes going to learn about hard work not being entitled and thinking of your fellow human being    i got this dudehes going to be ok hell be better than ok hes going to change the world
you were talking to other men behind my back throughout our relationship and then blamed it on me i dont hate you but im really fucking mad
ive finally accepted that if you want to talk to me youll contact me im hurt and broken but i have to keep going or ill never heal and whats left of my youth will be wasted
i havent seen an old friend in about 5 years ive known her since we were 13 were both 26 i had her over my house and she was going through my things grabbed my phone and went through my pictures playing with my boyfriends things when i kept telling her not to it was like watching after a kid it was super cringey and uncomfortable with my other friends there now she told me i need to accept her for who she is because shes autistic this is the first time ive heard this because i honestly just think she has an untreated personality disorder
im so in love with you
im pregnant and my husband is so man i really dont want to but im thinking about terminating the pregnancy so that my husband dosent hate me im so sad i feel like my heart is breaking i dont know what to do
  what if i think the same
  if you want to keep it then keep it you shouldnt do things you dont like just because other people might hate you if he gets mad he gets mad the world doesnt end
i find its getting harder to buy a hotwheel he doesnt already have    then i think about all the ones you still had over there i wonder what you did with all his stuff     knowing your mom shed want to have a garage sale and make some money get rid of all reminders and get cash thats her    you i bet it killed you to think about it i bet you wanted to hold on to everything of his then when you realized his clothes wont fit him any more reality mightve set in that mustve sucked    hes into different things now but still loves his cars
i wish someone on this fucking gay earth actually gave a shit about me i try to be social but nobody ever initiates anything with me i just feel like at best im an occasional intrusion in other peoples lives like they only bother to talk to me because they have nothing better to do at that particular moment and arent actually interested in me    i know its a counterproductive attitude to have but the longer this shit goes on the more im beginning to just resent everybody
some days i think that ill just end up marrying the first girl that sticks around long enough because why not we will grow old and die together and i will be neither happy nor unhappy i wont have any special connection with her but its just more convenient to have her around than to separate i dont think ive ever felt anything for a girl other than lust and tolerance
  in my case shes blocked me on all fronts and even told me she didnt want to contact me at all ive waited for 2 weeks hoping that shed change her mind but my fear that shes moving on for good is starting to become a reality to me i built my future around her and now im lost wandering like a ghost
  we already have 2 kids im pretty sure he will leave me if i keep this baby i dont have the means to support 3 children by myself my children are the most important people in the world to me i love them more then life itself the thought of killing my child inside me makes me feel physically sick and like the most monstrous thing i could ever do i dont know if i could live with myself if i did it but i also dont know how i will provide for 3 children if i dont i feel so sick and upset
  you get what you ask for dont expect people to invite you to things if you dont reach out to them
i often think you might try to come back at some point for shared custody    it would be a legal battle because im not supportive of sharing custody with you like i once was hes been through hell and im not about to let him go through that again    so if youre thinking about playing daddy again in the future please be advised that youre gonna have to prove your committed to it i will not allow you to waltz back into his life only to abandon him again    this means graduation from the ordered program this means completing a parenting class this means child support and retroactive support     of course before all that first and foremost you cant be living with your mother and whoever or where ever you claim to live you better believe it will have to be proven and not just on paper only you already know ill hire pi to investigate i have the full support of my family now although their stance is that you should never be allowed to im not that hard never say never i just think you have a lot to prove before it would happen    ive got the support of his doctors therapists and teachers willing to state the progress hes made and their input on how detrimental it would be if you returned uncommitted     just something to consider friend
  i had this happen too  i just talked to her anyway and now were working out our differences    gl anon
  do you have family or friends that could help you also talk to social sevices there are plenty of programs that will help you get back on your feet
  no i dont have any friends or family
everything i ever want is always out of my reach  sometimes it gets close just to tease me  love and happiness  but all i get is money and power  peace and relaxation  all i get is anger and anxiety    i hate how i can never be the man i want to be  whos fault is that  mine
  btw my mom aborted a kid after having 3 because my dad was pissed about it no big surprise they split a year or two after shes almost 60 and it still fucks with her we found out about it eventually and it fucked with us two   do what you feel you have to but dont ever think its an easier route
  i tried talking to her anyways but she vehemently doesnt want to talk to me she said she already started dating another guy i fucked up so now im paying for it i really wish i could make her see how much i truly love her
  i know its not i miscarried a year before i had my first child it was the worst experience of my life and that wasnt even something that i intentionally caused and now that i have kids a 1yo and a 3yo and know how amazing and important to me they are i know it would literally kill me inside to get an abortion i dont think i could live with myself or ever forgive my husband i feel like i already cant forgive him for wanting me to get one its like he doesnt love me or our children i dont know that our marriage will make it either way at this point im so sorry your mom went through that im sorry for the toll it took on your family
  ive had similar thing happen to me 2 and i waited as well funny how we say things in a heat of a moment and with time our faults get clearer well find someone new and better hopefully atleast thats what i keep telling myself
  youre an alpha anon
  thank you anon if anything at least it serves as an example  there are lots of programs really look into them before making a decision that way you really know which choice is best for you
  thanks i will i just dont understand why hes like this what is so horrible about our children that he cant stand the idea of 1 more i told him id get my tubes tied after if i have this baby so we wont have anymore i told him ill work extra shifts to help out more financially i already do 100 of the child care for our other 2 kids this baby would be the same i dont understand why he even told me he wanted to marry me and have a family in the first place if he hates kids so much i feel like my whole life is fucked up now and not what i ever wanted or planned for it to be and even worse my kids lives are going to be messed up because i picked the wrong man to have them with they deserve a father who loves them not one who resents and ignores them sorry to go one like this i feel like im losing my mind from sadness like i cant breath i feel so guilty that my kids lives are going to be messed up
see cute girl on okc  holy shit this profile is practically tailored to everything i look for in a girl  the way okc works now means there is basically a 0 chance ill ever get to meet her    actually ruined my morning a bit i hate that website
i wanna be with you and i got feelings for you we act like a couple and you say you like me even love me but on social media youre different saying your friends have someone and you dont posting pictures of yourself posting subs even found you on tinder im gonna cut you off at some point for sure but if you proved to me that you wanna be with me truly then i might have to rethink all you gotta do is try
fuck commitment issues fuck insecurity fuck self sabotage we love each other and the nonreasons you gave me were just excuses for your fears we couldve been happy if you just were brave enough you know you miss me and youre just burying it deep down im hurting and i really need you to get your head outta your ass and start being a man i fucking miss you
why why does everyone i ever talk to start to hate me/despise me over time so sick of people always talking bad about me for no reason at all im always nice and i never talk badly about anyone i ever meet i didnt really realise that everyone that i thought were friendly towards me treated me like shit aswell i only realised it when i became a neet i was so fucking stupidgoddamnit once i even tried befriending several females just because i wanted friends and i got talked behind my backcalled a creep/scary all i ever wanted was some female friends i was never romantically interested in them i dont understand why people are like this even if im nice and friendly and do nothing wrong people treat me like shitbut not directly to my face people have some kind of hatred for me they are always nice the first few times i meet them/talk to them but they always change somehow and start hating me/talking bad about me everyone pretends to be someone theyre not and have nasty personalities and lie alot im sick of people fuck everyone in this society fucking retarded normalfaggots living a fake life
  ik they are so reluctant to give controlled substances     they probably think you are exhibiting drug seeking behavior have you ever been intervened for benzodiazepine abuse well man i got news for u if u go to prison they will give u all the benzos u want 2mg klonopins 3x a day but there isnt much weed    but my late old granny would always be speeding around on addy and vyvanse she had a prescription for both simultaneously smoking weed on top of it 2 she went to a special doctor where you pay for a script like 300 dollars a visit
  it sounds like hes selfish to me  just do the best you can everyone fucks up their kids to some extent just try to do what will fuck them up the least
  ehh give both you and her some time see if shes really important enough to you to take her back when her guy inevitably fucks up
  if shes happier with him than me than so be it i dont care what happens to me as long as shes happy the selfish side of me wants her to be happy with me but shes her own person i really do want her back but i gotta act like a man through this instead of a spoiled brat
  lost my virginity on saturday night to a girl from my anxiety management course we had dinner watched netflix for a bit went to bed with her and had sex afterwards we cleaned up and cuddled for 3 hours which was better than the sex
  why do you feel the need to get this off your chest
  ive never been able to do something like that and i dont have many people to talk to about achievements like that
  gratz nerd
  putting pp in a vulnerable girl  achievement  bad news anon
  thanks    which would be
why can i feel both smothered and lonely
  hes saying that fucking a girl whos clearly unstable enough to go to an anxiety management course is nothing to brag about
paxx prentis got to be an addict for 10 years now hes not i use for 1 day and u ship me to rehab fuck that checked myself right out of that bitch walked downtown and hopped a bus went camping and got crossfaded for the rest of the summer u know how much sex i had when u got 1000 gabapentin on hand none saw some girl alone and on the phone in the park at 2 am i should have raped the bitch but i rode on by fuckin 15 gabapentin deep they came and hauled him out in cuffs and left me with a quarter of weed they did not even confiscate it or search he is here with me now he received a 2 1/2 month sentence    here are some quotes from u  coffee is a slow road to the grave  bitch i dont think 2 cups of half caf will kill me so stfu  not a druggie alcoholic like u  ok i see u underage drinking and i fed u mxe and u ate that shit up like it was ur slop i had to hear about how u acted weird the rest of the night  congrats on maxing runescape btw bud love u in spite of everythin 120 slayer when
  
  kill her
  i dont feel like one
i really dont like this board its a bunch of people who have no business giving advice selfrighteously and condescendingly giving each other advice people who use the terms chad and stacy seriously
  wow hate to point out the obvious here but it sounds like shes kind of upset/lonely that you havent made it official have you asked her to be your gf
  yet here you are its your choice whether you take the advice or not so act like an adult eh
i just want to apologise to everyone for my recent and less recent bad behavior i know this may not make up for it but going forward im going to try my hardest and respect myself and others as much as i can just today i started by waking up at 5 am this will be my wakeup time from now on
  one of these is the actual feeling the other is an emotional response you know how very insecure people present arrogantly same shit probably youre really lonely and your subconscious defends itself by pushing people away feeling smothered in effect feeling smothered is self sabotage which is a subconscious knee jerk response to the thing you actually need low self esteem selfperception of deserving happiness and attachment issues are probably topics to explore
me gf doesnt talk enough i think i have to break up with her  she loves me a lot but i just cant deal with the amount of silence in our relationship  sorry i need to text throughout the day  i cant really be with someone who i see once a week and text maybe 5 times a day
  i rarely come here and never for advice because im not looking for advice or a blog to narcissism all over you should feel bad if you come here seriously
  
  any thoughts  yeah get the fuck over it  or put a nail in his tires just deep enough that he had to fill them up every couple days  then when he finally gets them worked on  hit him again  its frustrating  and if hes that much of a psychopath he will probably snap  thats what you need to do  make him snap in public or in front of his family  or you could just get over it
  is her name julie if so how does my dick taste
  some of the pussiest advice ive ever heard      yeah i wouldnt allow him to be the mechanism that ruins your life once and for all if your murder him but send the wife a letter she probably has suspicions and you may be able to plant a seed that destroys the relationship also one thing that bullies cant stand is when former victims come back and stand up to them maybe bait him in public quietly where no one can hear you and get him to swing
my friends that i live with have become ultra sensitive lately they started hanging out by themselves out of nowhere ignoring me and not even saying hi unless i walk into them we share a house and if i make a joke they get all sensitive and get offended and either dont talk to me for the rest of the week or just act cold and dismissive instead of playing along like we used to thing is ive done nothing different in the recent weeks but last week they started getting all weird and bitchy towards me when i expected them to play along with my jokes like we did prior to last week i dont get it i feel guilty for some reason but i know its them that changed their behavior even if we manage to hang out for a day they either talk amongst themselves more or prefer each others company more or they just pull out their phones and act like theyre not interested in talking to me why do i feel guilty tho should i it really gets to me the way they start acting like they need drama and wont grow out of it but i refuse to play along if they want to spend more time alone fine but just tell me dont ignore me and talk about it behind my back expecting me to know whats going on like im some mind reader they probably expect an apology too man they used to be good friends of mine now im considering cutting contact with them what a shame to be honest
  how does waking up every morning at 5am have anything to do with respecting others
leave me the fuck alone i dont even know who you are but youre a creep
im scared i have some crazy stalker and if its who i think it is hes a rapist
tired of my parents and i have no relationship with any of my extended family i have no friends or girlfriend never have and likely never will because im so used to a solitary and loveless life i have absolutely no real academic or career goals i just generally have no real ties to anyone or anything i just want to take what money i have and get the fuck out of here work random shitty jobs here and there to keep myself afloat and just experience the world or something and then when im done ill kill myself
  it takes one to know one
  that is the dumbest expression ever
  its true you are just not aware of it  
so now ive established i have a stalker with 100 certainty the next question is who is it i swear if you come near me i will kill you
  nerve struck
  do it     and find the easiest tolerable goal to pursue for you and start there bigger goals come easier after you get some small ones out of the way thats how you find direction nothing wrong with just experiencing the world thats kindof the whole point    i think once you start what you want maybe the prospect of killing yourself will get ever more distant until you just let life take its course and move through it     be a fish  go with the flow and if you have an idea of what you want  go try the worst thing that happens is you get an experience
  im not a creep youre the creep creepy stalker
  not yet you think its that obvious
how do i tell if my cologne is too strong    i put one spray on my chest but then the scent is in my nostrils literally all day
  do you not want people to smell your cologne
  i want it to be subtle    like a person giving me a hug would smell it but not everyone in a 2m radius
leave me the fuck alone michael
this creepy schizophrenic has hacked me he screwed his now deceased mom with dementia and sent me pictures then started hacking me and harassing me everywhere i went he wont stop 
  its a little ironic that youre calling everyone a narcissist yet youre the one here shaming people and trying to make people feel guilty for posting advice     there are people who are condescending and give advice in that fashion but its not the majority this board is like any other thing in life there are a handful of good posters a majority of average posts and a handful of purely venomous people     some people here have nowhere to turn and people who give advice anonymously are about as far as you can get from narcissistic they have no notoriety to gain no one is paying people here to give advice like a therapist and counselor and the majority of people that give advice are doing it because they want to and for little other reason i would even go as far as to say that /adv/ is one of the last somewhat decent communities left on the net
shes clearly pretty shy but im paranoid she might be annoyed by me we didnt talk a lot but she seemed to enjoy when we did yet she hasnt ever tried to talk to me on her own maybe i shouldve shown more of an interest or maybe she just hates me and i wasted all of this time whatever who cares anymore
  ask her
my life just fell apart my girlfriend is moving away and i dont know what to do with myself she said that she happy about it because she gets to have a new beginning and that she felt trapped in the city we live in however im just crushed im wondering if i ever meant anything to her since she didnt hesitate at all what the hell am i supposed to do with myself now
  ill talk to her tomorrow if/when i see her and see how she reacts i guess
i dont want to ever work another day in my life  ive considered quitting my job the gym and all other outside activities and sitting in the couch till i die of thirst
please like me and show me affection so i feel validated
im paranoid
  shut up sit down you want to feel validated by others everybody does it feels great heres the catch you gotta earn it otherwise its pity and youll know its pity and itll only make you hungrier what do you think you could to to have people validate you willingly and spontaneously something which will make people appreciate you then go do that do it great no excuses    desire for validation can be seen in one of two ways either youre driven to dysfunction until you are given validation and use it as fuel for awhile or youre driven to validation using the lack of validation as a driver in one scenario youre sad and yearning until somehow you get validation in the other youre driven forward by the same need and use it to be better to truly earn that validation and love learn an instrument write a book go to the gym whatever just do it so well with such passion that people will want to validate you somewhere in this process you stop caring about validation because you start being able to validate yourself and then its exercise over

i fucking hate my bbw fetish so much  i literally am not attracted to any form of human other than a fat woman  but its so disgusting fatness is not sexy it is harmful it causes diseases it makes people slow and weak and unhappy  i feel ashamed and depressed every time i masturbate  i feel like a necrophile except theyre actually better than me they fetishize dead bodies while i fetishize people dying dying from the horrible scourge on the planet that is obesity  i hate it so much
look you fucking asshole ive done nothing wrong you on the other hand are going to prison
dear r    i miss you    d
i just think its bullshit that i have to waste what precious little time i have on this earth lining the coffers of some rich fuck while i make enough just to get by
  you dont have to work to enrich someone else make a promise to yourself to never to work for another man again and follow through with it
unironically lonely and horny  just gotta keep moving forward eventually one day ill get that spark with someone till then just improve yourself
this is on /lit/ but fuck it im posting it here too since /adv/ might have different types of advice with managing this uncomfortable anxiety shit and controlling myself in the future    tfw i started writing a passive aggressive sentence or two about some students feedback calling a central character in my unfinished story derivative of frankenstein accidentally sent it i then found myself writing 4 emails trying to apologize explain to them not try and explain their criticism any more even though it probably wouldve been better to just leave it as is or not try to apologize so fucking hard since it was only passive aggressive any way and he probably couldve even read the tone that well  tfw i wrote all that immature selfconscious shit despite the fact that im trying to start a writing club  he didnt even hate everything i wrote just the central element that isnt even halfway finished  god fucking damn it im such a child now i have to wait to see if he emails me back  what the hell have i done
  def send the wife a letter murder is not a crime people get free w
20   the age you can drink around here is 18  im not really used to beer   if feel like im being looked down upon sometimes cause i dont drink it the fact gets me feeling a bit paranoia whats you guys take on people like me that dont like beer  you guys subscribe to the saying that goes something like  i dont trust a man who doesnt drink
my ex boyfriend is not over me  he always obviously internet stalks me but never owned up to it  at first i was mad because things i was writing anonymously were being read by people in my real life and then i used it as a cope for still having him in my life in a way and then i felt mad again that he wanted to only be half way in my life to see how i was feeling and now its like a game to me i know he will read everything so no matter what i write it will affect him in some way
  anguirus   i see youre a man of culture    ill speak frankly liking beer and being an adult are seen as the same due to how a regular person gets older they enjoy bitter tastes more and more  like coffee  or just vegetables    if you met a person who said ew i dont eat vegetables youd think theyre a childish moron  same thing with beer    when youre young it tastes bitter like brussel sprouts  but as you get older brussel sprouts are sweet and tasty     like beer
  how did your relationship with him end
  i see
  no thats just the /r9k/ rejects trying to get attention
girls flirt with me constantly im not a chad but im just being myself the problem is that i dont want a relationship with anyone and its been this way for several years now i feel like im missing the boat on romance however i suffer from bipolar disorder and its not well managed i dont feel comfortable bringing someone into my life for them to watch me self destruct     its odd though since ive taken myself off the market and stopped putting effort into my appearance im suddenly attractive granted i brush my teeth religiously and wear a little bit of cologne but oily hair and twice worn clothes seem to be drawing girls in
i honestly need some kind of sexual release trying to ignore it is only making me miserable i never be rid of all of this stupid fucking baggage from that whore forcing herself on me the neighborhood girls holding me down so one could kiss me or my mom trying to enmesh herself with me as a teenager if i dont have good ol consensual sex with an adult woman im tired of trying to bury an integral part if myself due to mistreatment and im tired of trying to talk it out with a therapist i need this part of my life to be over i need my body to fuck off with the hormones too
    wow how can i even put it into words because there were a lot of reasons i would sum it up as not a lack of strong feelings for each other but rather a lack of confidence in ourselves in fear of disappointing the other we have talked about this years after the fact and neither of us wanted it to end but i think the timing was just not right and now its like for some reason impossible to start over     for now i consider him my guardian  theres really no other way to call it
i really dislike the stress that comes with aging if you dont do certain things by whatever age then you think that youre defective i get that you cant wait forever on things and that there are limits but isnt most of it just made up bullshit by society am i not seeing this right or what the more i think about life the more i realize its all not as serious as we make it out to be
    have you tried masturbation  its hard at first after sexual trauma but you begin to realize your sexuality is in your control also i always tell people to find an artistic outlet to be able to get built up emotions out in a way that you enjoy i like writing and music a lot of people also do art and dance
  then my advice would be to make all of your social media private and block or remove him from all of your profiles hes hurting and depressed and is throwing himself into the emotional wood chipper by checking up on you through social media social media is an unnatural construct which makes it extremely difficult for people to end a relationship help him out and finish him off if you care about him give him a clean end
i really want to be a mommy  please make a mom  i want to be the mom of your kids  it drives me more and more wild every night  i would never force a pregnancy on you so im still taking birth control but the second you say go im off the pill and on you till weve got a big happy family
hmm i just noticed at work the only two girls i really talk to are both asian now i really could give less of a shit what the other girls think but what if they notice and start thinking i have some ulterior motive am i just overthinking
how do i become asexual without cutting my dick off
  i live with my sister and shes a mother  weve been looking after he kid for about 2 years now    haha you dont want this fucking fetish bitches want the feeling of yeah i get it big fucking belly of nigger who filled you up    but once you get to screaming shitting monster
no fapping makes me more assertive which in turn triggers the anxiety ridden part of me sometimes     it sucks cuz fapping makes me feel like shit and not fapping makes me crazy ive noticed patterns in my behavior when it comes to fap/nofap in the last few months     so here i am freaking out over a girl when literally every other part of my life is more important other than living through it i havent had much success in foguring out a solution to this besides fapping  its fucking interesting
    neither of us have social media  this is an anonymous language learning site and i am not leaving because i enjoy learning there he can choose to do what he wants it is not my responsibility to make life choices for him he can talk to me if it wants or he can disappear if he wants    also i didnt really ask for opinions from people who dont know the situation this thread is just for writing our own isnt it
  i use to take care of infants for a living for years i know what im getting into and what i want
  then do it  im glad youre there i have a lot of respect for people like you     ive been dad 2 for 3 years now ive taken care of him for these years part time  and the first few years i have to say are tumultuous to say the least     hes 6 now and im a little ashamed that i like him a lot now than when he was 2   he says im his best friend now and whenever he leaves i need to cry a little bit just because of that im ok though i am strong for him a role model even though his parents are
  it sounds like he has a good influence    im just waiting for my man to be ready i want kids but i specifically want to build a family with him hes an amazing person and everything id be looking for in a husband and father to my children     its happening in the next few years im just so ready now but i respect his feelings im willing to wait for him
  i love you too i hope you slept well
  your post is public realm and is subject to people replying to it on here if you want to keep it private then keep it private    as far as responsibility is concerned you can do whatever you like your statement that you were starting to see it as a game seemed cruel to me so i decided to figure out what was going on since this language learning site isnt exactly what one would consider social media then things are a little different but his feelings shouldnt be treated as a game
  like i said i am an uncle i love my nephew so very fucking much   but i am not his father and the division between his mother and father hurts him it hurts me too    marry your man if you cannot do that dont have a kid     i have to emphasize this between my current experience with my nephew and my own as a man marry your partner become a stable couple then have kids dont have kids when you dont have a stable father/mother situation  it was screwed up when i was a kid    and i hate telling my nephew the kiddo that i love more than anything that when he gets sad about how his parents are doing i tell him theyre just having a discussion but they still love you  he sags when i tell him that he knows its bullshit he hugs me tighter after those nights    dont ever do that to a kid i want my son to be as happy as he can ever be and having his mom and dad fight is not how you do that  only have kids if you can be sure that you will be a pair forever
  life keeps getting worse and worse the older i get the less motivation i have to get my life on track im ugly and have only gotten laid once which wasnt ever worth the trouble i work my ass off for a dead end job and i got nothing to live for at this point the only girls to ever show interest in me were bat shit crazy or fat as shit yet i still managed to fuck things up when doea this life thing get better
i fucking did it mom i dont give a fuck about you i hope you burn in hell i released those tapes of you admitting to cheating on dad with three guys    i fucking hate you mom you make me feel nothing but rage
    i dont mind replies otherwise i wouldnt have replied initially but im not asking for advice you are seeing 1 puzzle piece and not the other 999 pieces its unfair to offer advice hes the one playing games he admitted he was testing me and yet i am finding ways to cope with it on my end how ak i responsible for his emotions thats really not fair to me and my own mental wellbeing since i didnt ask for advice dont assume the situation because you really have no idea
  the marriage dynamic is a big part of the wait we both agreed we need to be married before kids happen     i want my children to have a life with strong loving caring parents who are in it through thick and thin
  i masturbate plenty i lose control over it if i get in a similar situation ie being in the presence of a living breathing woman and feeling sexual arousal a creative outlet is probably a good idea schoolwork and exercise alone probably arent enough
  i never said you were responsible for his feelings but you are responsible for your actions that deliberately manipulate the emotions of another human being    your original post didnt mention him contacting you and you made it seems as the communication was onesided where he stalked while you posted now the story has changed so yes i dont know what to believe so i will step out of this discussion i picked up on an item that seemed to me to be a cruel way to treat someone and its my nature to come to the defense of those who are aggressed upon thats all
  you might grow old with that  i am not a woman im just gauging this off my sisters attempts  its not well     its all rap filled basters with get the money nigga songs  its shit its all shit  i hate letting my nephew listen to the radio  my sister lets him on the ride home from school  and all he hears is bullshit     he listen to dj kaled and thinks its the pinnacle of music  i hate it
   youre personified evil really
feminists both the male and female kind really are starting to piss me off    look ive been a nasty little beta for a long time im always shy around girls i dont think they owe me anything and i cant handle rejection so i dont even try    but assuming i do try and then i try to get help for it when things go awry    what did you do    oh i hit on this girl at the gym    what the fuck dont you know girls hate that shit its so annoying theyre there to work out not be a piece of meat    bbut i thought the advice women always give on how to meet girls is to get a hobby so you can bond over a common interest    no they hate it trust me    then i read things in other threads on advice where girls are complaining that guys are ignoring them and theyll be kissless forever    i even had a professor who was taken aback by the culture where i live in which he questioned why the hell the boys werent asking the girls out in the area and making it sound like boys were scared of girls in order to comfort some girl that was feeling blue over that no bf feel    like what the fuck    its like you try to do the things youre told to do by women to meet girls and then youre doing wrong you ignore their advice and youre also doing wrong    so much for internet advice from women on how to meet girls
  no offense but your family sounds like low class trash    i have had a good amount of time and experience to have a solid point of view
i found out that my ex is stalking me on social media and using a fake account i should just block it and move on but its satisfying to know that they broke my heart and are now obsessed with tracking what i put out there into the world im guessing thats the intent but maybe not its just really confusing to me i wish they would leave me alone as they were the one didnt want me im happier now years later im single they are married is it regret anyone have any experiences like this
why are all the op images not showing on /adv/  this isnt happening on any other board just here
  its your adblocker
  i wont say its trash weve fallen middle class  and thats the primary target of that lower class music
  more like cockblocker its just a bunch of dick pix
  people social media stalk for many different reasons none of them are healthy some types of stalking are done because the person is clinging on to the person or the past thats no longer others are more nefarious where a narcissistic person will overtly stalk you in a way that you will know its them in an attempt to suck you back into an abusive relationship  an instinctual narcissistic technique known as hoovering     either way you should block them for your own health and move on with your life as i mentioned a little earlier in this thread social media makes it exponentially more difficult to end relationships something that was hard enough to do before its advent so its best to block/remove him from anything where he can check up on you and vice versa
  i dont think so every other board is fine i whitelisted 4channel anyways but it didnt change anything im getting connnection error messages anytime i try to reply or update a page too
  its definitely your adblocker your filter isnt set up correctly /adv/ triggers the advertisement flag for adblockers so its blocked by default
  all that happened to me because of adblock now i turned it off and can reply to you without cutting and pasting it at the top

the gas station shop girl is pretty cute and she responded positively when i gave her a small compliment today but how the fuck do i proceed withour being creepy having a chat is not really an option since there are always customers and her coworker who may be her mom around    i mean im not a faggit i could just ask her out or ask if shes taken or whatever and take the rejection but i go there often since its the closest gas station and store to my home and it would be weird going there again after trying to hit on the attendant and getting rejected right am i overthinking it
  you need to be over 18 to post here
i think i was supposed to start getting things off my chest years ago but i never did now its all piling up on me and i feel smothered by myself every day i just stow the baggage away somewhere i cant confront it so i just put it aside for the time being and get on with life this isnt solving the problem at all instead its building up to a massive meltdown which i think has already begun i really really dont want to have a job right now i want to give the finger to my employers and march out of there once outside i dont want to stop marching i just want to keep roaming forever with no direction i have a few hobbies that id love to take more seriously but even those my getaways from responsibility and stress are being infected by the creeping numbness i want to scream fuuuuuuuuuck but i never do i want to cry like a baby but i never do sometimes acts of violence come to mind im not sure what outlet what release i really need to get it off my chest
its fine keep projecting
    what im probably older than you are do you want to see my passport mister internet police officer
  oh youre older  then why do you act like a 16 year old niggerfaggot who gets his dick hard over a random woman while hes on the fucking job no less
  then why do you act like a 16 year old niggerfaggot who gets his dick hard over a random woman while hes on the fucking job no less    you realize that nearly all women are random before you talk to them i seriously find shut ins and their trollish behavior hilarious
  then why do you act like a 16 year old niggerfaggot who gets his dick hard over a random woman    because im a man although im 27 and my dick doesnt get hard as easily as it used to so she might have to pet it first she just has a nice vibe to her that i dont get with most other random women so id like to get to know her    i dont understand why you have a problem with that
i feel like my thoughts and self are dominated by my family    i came back from a trip overseas and am convinced this is the case    i may be the eldest son but im not tied down by any burden so i shouldnt be acting like this
yes i am absolutely positively cheating on you   we havent had sex we havent kissed  theres been no physical intimacy   but you were just absent
i just moved back to my hometown after accepting a big girl job here that basically has me set assuming i dont botch it and get fired right away    after being away from home and getting to experiencing creating my image exactly how i want with new people im struggling with being in a place where people know the old me im put off of using tinder because i dont want to run into people from high school that i have no desire to see i havent used a dating site since the last time i lived here years ago when okc told me my perfect match was the ex i had just broken up with i like most of my coworkers but theyre old or my age with multiple young kids so we have completely different lives and interests    anyone in this town that i was close to has long since moved and i have no desire to be social my mom is my only friend at this point the one upside is getting to know her as an adult rather than some 22 y/o scrub living in her house i knew i hated this place i should have just stayed broke and happy at my old job
  but you were just absent  no thanks to you
  call it what you want its still betrayal dont expect him to ever trust you or want anything to do with you ever again
  i was absent because you werent there either would you even call it a relationship we were just flings thats all
just because a text doesnt directly interest you doesnt mean you just get to ignore it and send me a shitty meme a few hours later you fucking autist
  that pisses me off greatly as well anon at least you get a message back
  im sorry i was absent i deserve to be cheated on for that every woman should be loved properly
  being absent doesnt mean you deserve infidelity from your partner your partner should have communicated her feelings to you and then ended the relationship before hurting you like that
say means out of your mouth dumb shit
  you are a literal cuck
  yes it does it means i was selfish and not thinking about her at all
  im just simply a good guy
4chan culture teaches guys to be exactly what women dont want its funny
  she was being selfish and not thinking of you either but instead of leaving it there she decided to break the trust of your relationship as well as your selfrespect from the way youre acting    guilt and shame are mind killers and allowing them to overtake your thoughts will only further the progress of the grave youre digging for yourself human beings fuck up all the time anon i would even go as far to say its what we do best  dont let the echoes past mistakes consume your mind especially when youre not the only one at fault not by a mile
i unblock him he calls tells me hell call me back he doesnt i block him again but then i call him at 1am when im in bed thinking about him he doesnt answer this guy has fucked my brain he gives me nothing but his gorgeous body to kiss all over and his dick to suck im just a lump of flesh for him to fuck im nothing to him
  youre projecting a whole lot onto me i have great selfrespect i wouldnt lose that because someone cheated on me i broke the trust too by letting her down in the first place you gotta man up and take it on the chin when you do something wrong that causes an effect in another such as this
  im not projecting anything im explaining to you whats going through your mind and youre experiencing cognitive dissonance because of it if you had selfrespect you wouldnt be beating yourself down and saying you deserve to be abused thats the epitome of having a lack of selfrespect     theres a difference between accepting what happened and selfflagellating over past mistakes youre definitely expressing the later here life happens and its easy to get disconnected from your partner because of life stressors work money or anything else that comes up that doesnt mean you deserve to be punished for it becoming disconnected is not a breach of trust but a breakdown of communication and the dynamics of the relationship itself its something that can be repaired with time and effort a break of trust on the other hand is a death shot for almost all relationships
  and modern mainstream culture teaches women to be exactly what men dislike
  yes both of you are right
everyday it feels like im wasting my life doing nothing and everything id like to do seems impossible for me im stuck in a loophole life keeps getting shittier each moment i realise im a waste of life
  you are projecting i have great selfrespect i dont feel guilty nothing like that i just know that my neglect and absence caused her to cheat this is called maturity but you wouldnt understand that yet
    whatsluts you mean to tell me that men dont like skin
  they may have led to her infidelity but you didnt deserve that anyway believe what you will i believe your words deceive your true feelings and your defensive nature only reinforces it theres nothing more i can say good luck anon
  no one dang
    oh again you misunderstand im not defensive or deceptive i am truthful if i do something wrong i deserve the consequences i dont turn back on that woman and say its all your fault i stand strong and understand that what i did was what brought on the situation this is what being a real man is
  you fuck and forget sluts you dont wife one up
  a real cuck
  im not a 15 year old kid on 4chan if thats what you mean
  16 then
  which makes your statement that men dislike it very untrue
  lmao you dont think very far ahead do you
  im a mature man unlike you i take responsibility for my actions it seems like boys these days are unable to do that its a toxic culture of no personal accountability and blaming your own mistakes on others
  you must be gay if you dislike fucking
im down in the shit and if youre down in the shit i feel you if you feel like shit if you feel you look like shit if you feel shitty all the time i fucking feel you    im in the shit too and i dont know when or how im going to release myself from this if youre in that mindset or something similar know that some schlubby fuckhead in flyover country gets you and wishes you well
    shut up shut the fuck up
  you sound angry
  pretty much all the role models to these boys like trump and assange are like that its not really dependent on age id say its more about good character
  stop fucking larping this is whats wrong with gioyc threads just grown ass people pretending to have arguments holy fuck
  yeah if you blame other people for all your mistakes you never learn and grow as a person
  role models  trump assange  youre retarded
  whats larping
  maga dude
im afraid that my life is as good as it will ever get and it is only downhill from here waking up just seems like a chore
being responsible is horrible and ridiculous and i feel like i got tricked into it i was perfectly happy being a degenerate broke ass party slut being financially stable in the suburbs is a joke this is hell im one more dumbass comment about my lawn being overgrown from my shitty old neighbor away from going back to sleeping in my car in bar parking lots fuck the american dream and fuck me for falling for the meme
jk
you played me like a fool and so ill fit the role and plod along like a fool but this time oblivious to your existence rather than to your twofaced enticement
the man i love doesnt exist he never existed
for those that tried to compassionately understand me which is impossible thank you i will always love you
  you hurt him so bad he died and no longer exists
so in a few months i close the distance with my ldr gf im fucking terrified
  i hurt men by pretending they were this imaginary guy i loved so fucking unfair to them all i was horrible to themall over what an illusion
  did you ever get to know them you should get to know a him by the way not a them its a him that youll be spending the rest of your life with
  yeah i mean if i spent time with them i loved them but not the way i loved this fucking ghost of a person
  i feel slightly better
  i dont know what you mean maybe hes a ghost because you havent said what you meant
  i like to think that i am a coping mechanism probably
  careful you can be permanently marked as drug seeking in some countries shrinks are self righteous idiots but id still encourage you to try and find a path that doesnt include benzodiazepines theyre no joke    im starting to think that i cant deny it anymore i think i like men i really want to suppress this shit gdi i feel so guilty for getting off to gay porn
  he isnt real im insane
  the men you projected him onto were real
  sadly true
  i need a consistent set of life rules to follow but gödels incompleteness theorem says that no logical system can be both consistent and complete
  what did the imaginary guy manifest himself out of an anime or something
  the rules change and so can never be complete theyre consistent in their presence
    sounds like you just need to man up and clean your room buckaroonie
  im getting there i just want some hard and fast rules to live my life by and i dont mean the ten commandments i mean things like a set bedtime etc things i always do
  out of anons i call it collective anons its like picking a good trait from every ex of yours and combining them all the shitty ones werent him im the weirdest girl to exist i know
idiot
the front situation for me is a disaster ive made some mistakes everything now is on a knife edge my life outcome especially    oddly i like the man ive become i went from a monster to something better than that stumbling tripping its tough to remember how to live laughing crying anger learning how to cope with these has been a challenge     i miss my loyal doggo too she helped me through the worst of it    even in this dark hour i am optimistic while being scared of my own room what a strange feeling perhaps this is the only place i really feel at home when things are falling apart
  hag
im slowly erasing you from existence thats the power of imagination
im at a loss this girl and i are slowly developing feelings for one another but shes mentioned that shes not ready for a relationship but she follows me around like a puppy we both clearly impact one another im debating on trying to accept a version of reality where she just drops off the face of the earth because i cant help but think she will in the past shes avoided things that were too difficult to deal with by avoiding them me included but she always apologies afterwards     actions speak louder than words and she wants my attention   ive never been able to read her     i dont know if i really want an answer even
  dont expect perfection  instead seek to constantly improve   start with a basic formula something you can follow without too much challenge and work your way up   what helped me was setting aside 1 hour blocks for specific things i needed to do but didnt necessarily want on my free days
  gay
jesus christ life is hard these days
im so tired and idk wtf is wrong with my lungs
  sow
/gioyc/ youve known me for eons  why am i so full of hate its not me is it this world just sucks if were being realistic about it
what mental disorder is it called where you feel disconnected from and lose interest in your loved ones and society overall ive always had social and mental issues but i thought i was getting better a couple years ago now i have no friends and no desire to make any more i can barely make myself do girlfriend things for my bf and have even thought about breaking up so i dont have to be around his family at christmas and buy them gifts i feel totally disconnected from him i dont even talk to my own family when i have to see them i feel like they are all a family and i am intruding small things feel like too much effort making this post feels like effort applying to jobs is effort that i know will be fruitless i have a hard time even keeping a handle on the housework and barely care for my pets i dont even play the online game i like very well anymore i am only happy if i am drunk or high and even then i am not happy just not feeling like me anymore i dont know what to do at this point i tried to get a psych diagnosis but whenever i go to therapy i become robotic and put on a secretarymask so they think im fine or misdiagnose me i got a bill for over 1000 despite them saying they accepted my insurance and they werent even sure if they knew what is wrong with me i also have a hard time explaining emotions or even knowing what i am feeling i feel like to get help from therapy they expect so fucking much from you i just dont have it in me to try again for the umpteenth fucking time i just feel like giving up and hanging myself
  could be borderline autism shizoid pd or shizophrenia or disassociation personality disorder
  its called realising life is pretty meaningless so when u r drunk or high you forget about it all im in the same spot and have no idea what to do but hanging myself isnt an option yet
no one will ever truly unconditionally love me ill never have a partner i just left my girlfriend that i love dearly because she was abusive now im 25 and alone fucking mentally ill and traumatized with mommy and self esteem issues and no one will ever fucking want me i just want someone to hold me and play with my hair and tell me they love me
  yeah he was writing the diagnosis on the spot in front of me asking for my help in choosing words the psych i saw was a total quack normalfag that heard the things i told them but had no ability to absorb them and analyze them you know like i hired him to do so now ive got my mom mad at me because that was supposed to give an answer/starting point to begin treatment and cost a bunch of moneytime but i just feel even more confused and hopeless than before thinking about just seeing my gp and getting some anxiety meds to robotify myself but am afraid of wasting money on a drs visit and not getting meds and my give a fuck meter is pretty low right now i feel like i could easily just rot and get drunk for the rest of my life
  you know it feel weird that youre a female i always think of others anons as men    eitherway just go and listen to their bullshit so you can get some feelgood pills  after a couple of months they suggest some sort of therapy that can make you some friends its 90 bs anyways
hey god buddy throw me a bone today will ya
im a criminal and i almost committed murderthe guy lived i wish i had died at birth my belief is that theres no soul inside me since i feel like an empty husk i have been called a lot of things including narcoleptic autistic and schizophrenic i dont think i have any of those issues but you can never be sure i guess my hope is one day finding a girl who can tolerate my terrible toxic personality
  im also a drug addict and an alcoholic but i feel like those are minor issues
its getting real hard for me to move on from you
my girlfriend is a financial disappointment she has a crappy job finished school 2 years ago but hasnt got her degree her resume was a joke i offered to help her with that to get her in the right track but she lost interest rather quickly    her mother controls her financially and she has paid like 20 of all dates sex is great and we know each other perfectly we been together for so long that i feel kind of invested in her also im no chad so i would struggle to get another girl in my life shes 26 im 25
i sometimes wish we never met i could tell there would be pain from the second we met eyes it doesnt hurt yet but its only a matter of time we will hurt one another and we will miss one another but well both be too stubborn to reach out
  why do you have to
today is my birthday
  addiction changes your brain chemistry most of your other problems probably stem from those minor ones
  happy birthday
  thank you anon
a boring uneventful halfassed finale actually pretty fitting for our story     i cant say im surprised at the event but im surprised at what im feeling ill get over it in a few days of no contact now that i have the evidence as closure but it does sting in the moment im honestly not too upset about it ending neither of us were really putting too much effort in and it makes sense why we werent very compatible and both of us knew that im just upset about being strung along like that im upset because you felt the need to go around my back with what i would have been fine with upfront im not even really upset with you im upset with myself for thinking maybe you were better than you were so long ill see you in my memories
  i have an internet addiction  i dont know why  im in no position to go cold turkey on this  fuck
  i thought i was too i went on a vacation for 4 weeks and i did completely fine with almost no internet useage besides fap material on my phone
  what did they do
first time ive been back to this facility since the last time i was here and you kept him home from school sick i couldnt reach anyone to tell me he was ok and i had to get dcf detective involved to check on his wellbeing almost 4 hours away and you wanted to fuck with me on his wellbeing amused i guess    its nice to travel again and know he is safe in good hands and i can check on him at anytime and i do frequently you are so narcissistic you believed i was so interested in you because i checked on him so much  dumbass i hate to break it to you honey you are not all that i harass everyone who has him in their care lol the nice thing is they dont make me feel bad about it    im thankful to be able to focus on work now and not deal with anxiety and ptsd symptoms     im kicking ass at my job now and they notice    im so happy and content now and coming here today was just another big huge yeplife is sweet without you
fuck   i keep telling myself to get over you that we shouldnt do this   then you do something to bring me back onboard
  because theres no reason for me to stay and hope that she will like me back
  happy birthday d
to anyone taking notes was i avoiding asking her out because im not confident that she is interested in me and am too pussy to take rejection because i had fallen in love with the idea of her being available and by breaking the illusion either way i lose because i still harbor feelings for the 40 year old single mother who almost took my virginity or because i actually believe that through some trans dimensional plot device that she really is my demon waifu that i kind of abandoned after i got a job
fifth option is that i dont want any girlfriend at all because autism and romance dont mix and i feel like id be a waste of any womans time its probably that one isnt it
another option is that she could be one of those college bisexuals and i fear that in my telling her that is a crock of horseshit that i would end up losing her
peekaboo
  i can see you
  and i know what you do
i would like  to say  things go  both ways
to anyone taking notes context is almost never a bad idea    this is a anonymous board with fluctuating attendance theres a very good chance youre thread could die before anyone whjo remembers your old thread checks in
  i thought it would be amusing to someone who recognizes my style of writing and my general insanity but i guess not   anyway   shes super cute  appears shy and innocent  has that moe factor going on  appears untaken even though weve been staring at each other for many moons  never is around when i get a good spirit to ask her out  when she is around im always upset   to the point that i cant formulate a sentence that i can use to lead into anything  even if i can she does a cute thing or makes a cute noise that throws me off    like just yesterday i had an earlier shift than normal and she came in later  was working the front line of a retail store alone on an abnormally busy weekday  pissed off at management at corporate america and at the archetypical dumb consumer  she came over to collect trash from registers  helped her out since everything slowed down  how are you i asked  good how are you  hanging in there barely  whenever we work together it seems to be a bad day  she made a heartwarming sheepish sound of agreement  awkwardly tried to marry a waste basket i was holding with a bag she had  she escapes for now  that was the most interaction weve had since we opened together many moons ago  i know ill ask her about it before i leave  clocking out way out of building happens to pass her  she notices me coming towards her  she yawns and turns away right as i go out of the door    thats the best ive done since i decided that i wanted to go out with her specifically its been comparatively a short time to how long ive been passively interested in her and also everyone else at the store but i still see her too many times for there to be an excuse to win her over i must first win over myself which is where this thread comes in
just talk to her for a while  doubt shes gonna accept a date out of the blue  girls are not aliens bro
how do i manage having several hobbies/learning several things at once if you do how do you do it
  im trying it myself  i want to learn chinese and i have the textbook and everything still cant find the time of day to study i dont know how people do it
set aside an hour or two on the weekend after work during the week keep doing it     t person who keeps bees learned japanese worked 30 hours a week and studied at uni full time all at once
  it manages itself focus on one hobby specifically then after a while youll get sick of it then move onto another hobby   sometimes i go weeks without touching a subject then one day ill just roll out of bed and spend the afternoon on it some hobbies fall by the wayward others pop up every six months or so and yet others tend to stick around   its evolution baby natural selection at work
the first time i ever found a question so perfect for me    i have so many hobbies i enjoy learning new things and im a fast learner so i can always add more and more and they help each other in a way i mean at this point i have literally 50 hobbies     they are my passion so i find the time i dont do everything everyday because i would burn out i do what i need to work on or what i feel in the mood for as for time i wor very short part time hours freelance and my other work are my hobbies so it pays for itself     you gotta have some skills to work to sustain yourself on a less busy schedule you cant super excel at one thing and have time for anything else so you choose what to focus on for a while
  it sounds like you do 40 of those things maybe once a year and call that a hobby
do i have bad taste in girls every girl i liked either ended up a slut or fat
well given all we know about you is that you post on 4chan we can assume that you have some sort of emotional issue also the fact that you post on /adv/ doesnt say much about your selfrespect or intelligence you are probably just as fucked as the girls you are in to
  you know i think it might be because i fall in love with any girl that pays me any attention    i must be fucked in the head
  ended up fat  haha what
  it sounds like you already have this one figured out
  yeah not even joking for whatever reason girls i liked started normal weight ended up fat after seeing them again in a few years
  same here something about that is really hot to me like theyve been naughty
how do i get a swastica tattoo on my chest    i live in america i just figured most tattoo parlors might not be too keen on doing it or i might just encounter other problems
im pretty sure thats illegal like a hate crime or something dont do it
  find an artist that openly shows examples of confederate flags    be warned however if you ever get stuck in prison youll be expected to live the life of what that tattoo means
some will do it you need to figure out where though even though im an extreme liberal and dont support it just eyeball people who have similar tattoos and ask them where they got it done
  funny im wanting to do it to immortalize my hate for the extreme liberals your rhetoric and censorship is evil i will not sit idly by and watch you seek the literal death and destruction of me and my people
  goofy reply i could point holes in your logic all day but it doesnt matter because kiddo ive been on the chans for years and i dont really care you have your views and i have mine you asked for advice and i gave it which is ask around  also nazis literally seek death of others underaged faggo
  stfu gaylord       say its hindu or some shit they have a ton of swastika like symbols
  do you even know what liberal means
  i could point holes in your logic all day but it doesnt matter because kiddo ive been on the chans for years and i dont really care  tips fedora
  he says also being on 4chan
  the swastika is a hindu symbol for peace ircc but turned backwards so its actually a different symbol
stick n poke
    does he even know what literal means
  the meaning of the direction is not universal you can find buddhist temples with swastikas with both directions
  oh yeah thatll work the tattooist will totally think youre expressing your appreciation of ancient hindu philosophy
replying to bait threads without saying should be a bannable offense on /adv/
  nobody is trying to kill you alex jones instead of buying a shitty tattoo youll regret in 510 years just buy some weed and chill the fuck out
  based and redpilled
  its america   you can do it
since getting swastika tattoos is often hard the nazi types often have a guy that picked up the trade himself so you should check around with nazi groups and see if they can refer you
  you get those in prison
  i got mine in sq state prison
  pic or larp
  chest  fag put it on your arm where it belongs
  my violence would be self defense          there are endless articles in liberal news about white men needing to be killed oppressed or castrated racism against whites and sexism against males is not only being perpetuated in liberal media but it is not condemned either its championed and growing    so yes i mean literal    also keep in mind i said extreme liberals whether or not you are extreme your party is being dominated by the extremists though    not only are they extremely violent but they censor everything even moderate liberals  see my original pic for the thread  everything is also either racist sexist or homophobic if it disagrees with their views they push extreme prejudice against people i used to be so kind and passive but no matter how open minded i was liberals would treat me like shit now that they seek my literal death i offer nothing to them but my hatred
hey guys i spent a while hanging out with this girl not dating or boning and she spent the last month driving me to the bring of mass murder so i told her to fuck off and i blocked her problem is i have school with her and a couple classes right next to her   what the fuck am i gonna do now  my plan a is to just pretend we never hung out and ignore eachother but shes a fucking idiot so i think shes gonna try shit    gif unrelated
  just ignore her if she presses shit just tell her you thought you made it clear that you were done with this
  fair enough do you think id be able to keep some mutual friends they mostly hang out with her because of our schedules and i think shes been talking shit for the past few months its out of character for me to act like a total douche so i think they might be sus of her
  who cares if they ditch that quick they werent friends any good friend would get the words from you rather than her most guys who hang around and hang off every word a girl says are just in it to get a crack at her pussy anyway and shes probably well aware of it    better to just purge it and never look back if people dont wanna be your friend after then thats on them dawg it aint on you theyre on their own cuff to act like the adults they want to be treated as
  fair enough thanks for the advice dude probably not gonna see her ever again anyway so she can go fuck a cactus
i wouldnt say im the bottom for the barrel level of social skills on the spectrum of things ive seen people on here that are far worse but my problem is that i grew up with two close friends since elementary school and weve had a unique social dynamic ive been on 4chan for the past 7 years and alot of our discussions are very abnormal compared to most friend groups very 4chanesque stuff video games racist shit edgy shit and while we have matured since the middle school days the discussions and how i explain certain things are still very 4chan like and immature as that has been how ive honed in my social skills over the years when talking to a group of normal people about our financial habits i described myself as a high level jew which just came off the top of my head and was answered with stares and weird faces directed towards me i can operate at a basic level just fine however in other forms such as parties social meetups with friends of friends who i have to meet new people in my classes and the like i have this anxiety and fear that i will say some dumb shit because a lot of the time i have and have noticed it     thankfully i met two normie girls in my senior year of high school that i spent a lot of time with however i get as though i improved my confidence in being in normie situations without improving my speech all that much in general im 20 now and the types of discussions i see other people my age have are staggeringly different  muchore articulate easier flowing engaging and less all around weird are there any sources i can use to essentially be less weird and therefore awkward while also imrpoving on just how to talk to anyone without really thinking about it im pretty bad at articulating my thoughts into words so any help would be very much appreciated
  i described myself as a high level jew  based
  bump im in the same boat friend
bump im really good at writing but terrible at talking  probably nothing to do but practice
  yeah it sucks because we live in a social world people see charisma and a nice smile as trustworthy traits despite the fact that many nontrustworthy people use the same traits to take advantage of people while quite people who cant put on a friendly face as easily make people nervous as such its important to get better at socializing to do well i have spent so much of my life trying to fight this idea but intheend its true charisma can trump qualifications and if youre anything like me you wont even want to socialize which makes fighting inept social skills that much harder     with all that being said despite what some might say youre not entirely fucked if youre not a great socializer depending on your goals ie if youre doing this for professional reasons and not because your lonely just learn to filter yourself try to smile when people talk and other things like that around the office then get good at what you do we live in time when you can get a lot done from behind a computer and not physically working with people put in the work now to get really good at something you like once you manage to get a chance somewhere and this can take awhile and be quite demoralizing as interviewers hire those they like over whats on a resume particularly for entry level employees but once you make it and show them you provide a service others cant they wont care that your weird as shit
anybody ever made a discord server especially without a very specific point to it how is it how do you manage it
    its hard harvesting all autists meme power but doable
  i was asking in general not for a link
  its nice and comfy but only as long its small 2030 members who regularly post
  you dont make server alive without shilling it all day every day
  wrong
  ive got a discord server i run for anons on here and /v/ we mostly just support one another and talk about vidya and other activities pretty small right now so fairly inactive but i dont go posting it out in public just for protection of the integrity of the server and fellow anons in the server i usually give it privately to an anon after talking to them and getting to know them a bit basically if they arent looking for trouble and theyre not a pain in the ass bonus points if they want to be there for fellow anons i send the invite after a conversation or two with them    if you have problems keeping order set up a rules channel make it so only owners and admins or mods can post there and viewable by all the rest
  so how can i get an invite
i have one with about 120 people in it it took a while for it to get going but now it is pretty active and i didnt need to shill it all too often

caring too much about the opinion of other people    im a simple guy i dont really give a shit about what anyone says but my gf is the exact opposite shes very upset when somebody says anything bad about her her friends are really nice they dont do such things but her family is pretty toxic telling things like youve gained a lot of weight or your makeup looks terrible today   i dont know how to support her in these situations i told her that those things arent true in my opinion and that it doesnt matter what other people think anyway but that doesnt really help her what do i do
  let her do her
  how is that supposed to help
can you run away  those persons are very toxic    story
like this girl for most of the school year  she dummy thicc for an eighth grader  she gets a boyfriend  fuckjpeg  later that year  in the only class i have with her  boyfriend doesnt have this class  fuckyesjpeg  showing her a vid on my phone   she asks me if i have game pigeon on my phone    i say yes  grabs my phone and puts in her number  wtfjpeg   play games constantly and talk  boyfriend could beat the shit out of me and isnt afraid to   did i get friendzoned  advice
  8th grade   please for the love of god leave this website i grew up on 4chan as well and i can say it has done a lot of harm to my social life you still have a chance forget everything about this place and go be a normal kid  as for your question she obviously likes you but that doesnt guarantee shit if you really like her you should let her know how you feel casually dont be autistic and be prepared to deal with her bf if you dont really like her that much just forget it and move on  seriously though nothing good will come of posting here
  definitely gonna second this i know its all fun and games right now op and 4chan is really cool or the only place you can express yourself or whatever else but i started coming here around when i was 14 and im only now at 22 starting to recover from the mental diseases this place will infect you with if you need girl advice honestly just ask your parents or something most people here have been single and alone for most of their lives so theyre probably not the best people to listen to on the matter
im just gonna assume youre autistic
just how do you guys cope up with debilitating depression lost my job my closest friends dont want to come near me and im always feeling down whenever im alone or by myself i do have a girlfriend i can relate to and a family by my side but it hurts to be like this when i havent done anything wrong ive been browsing /pol/ as a means of outlet but at the end of the day you just reflect that youve wasted your time doing nothing what do you guys do to battle such things as depression and degeneracy of the world at the same time feels hopeless    inb4 an hero  inb4 kill urself    im not at that stage yet not even taking meds because they should be taken as a last resort when youre about to lose your mind
  just fucking do it pussy you wont
  do what
  by posting on /b/ or /r9k/ and not shitting up /pol/ w blog threads faggot kys saged
  take comfort in the fact that whatever happens you will die eventually on a geological timescale we are all going to die really soon so no need to anhero just take physical risks and dangerous jobs maybe you will be lucky and get killed at work then they cant say it was suicide i tried this and did not die so it doesnt always work either way i accept god wants me to stick around but i will die and be off this faggot earth eventually just got to be patient and do what you can in the meantime
  theres no way i know other than trying to improve yourself doing something useful with your free time maybe go to gym practice some sport something like that something thatll make you feel proud of yourself if your close friends dont want to be near you then they werent really your friends in the first place the solution is to find and make other friends meet new people    when i was younger and had depression i started going out with friends meeting new people trying to learn new stuff such as learning how to play musical instruments etc at the end of the day my mind was busy enough to not think about being sad
  i cope with nationalist politics
  resist the urge to isolate and hunker down at home   i get into some bad funks and always feel better after a day of work or at least getting out and going for a long walk inna woods god built nature to sooth us in a mysterious way i believe there is restorative value in the color green  my faith helps me a lot as i review scripture that reminds me that a god adores us and b we arent supposed to be entirely content and happy here the world has been corrupted and life sucks equally for everyone from timetotime you arent being singled out to get a shittier deal that the rest of the population challenge those thoughts that counter points a and b above fake it til you make it as they say theres wisdom in that lead your body and brain into a different way of looking at your circumstances and your reality will follow  expose yourself to more oxygen and the color green  best wishes anon this too shall pass
  i had terrible bipolar disorder and devastating depression i saw a doctor and got on medicine and i am now healthy and happy  its not normal to have crippling depression its a medical problem
  when it hits especially hard i isolate myself as much as i can dont know it this can be helped
  im not at that stage yet not even taking meds because they should be taken as a last resort when youre about to lose your mind  what the fuck ive seen this post before
  lol i have hereditary major depressive disorder  its so bad i cant even experience most emotions  i had sex a week ago  although i got hard i literally felt nothing  i ate some top quality food today  legitimately could not even taste it  i recently hit a massive pr at the gym and felt absolutely zero elation afterwards i was a blank canvas emotionally  my brain is literally fucking broken mate  and you know what i still function  i put in the effort to find a purpose in my life and i now pursue that venture relentlessly  if you feel literally anything and somehow manage to let those emotions get the best of you then theres no way to put it  youre a bitch  man up and do what needs to be done  if theres nothing that needs to be done then make something up  theres always something that needs to be done  always    take effective action and be stronger    it isnt impossible just hard    but when youre elderly and laying on your deathbed youll be proud that you took action while you still could    be stronger than your emotions and utilise your days to the fullest  your depression aka bitchmade melancholy will disappear and youll become a new man    take action
i am depressed because i have vitiligo and it makes me want to kill myself
  stop consuming media that tells you feel this way or that men arent supposed to feel very much and definitely not supposed to think about how we feel we are supposed to act    just keep busy at literally anything at all youll find you that nothing is either good or bad but thinking makes it so
  serious question desu did you do a lot of x back in the day i know a few people who have feels like yours and they have a history of using a lot of that type of drug and they appear to have burned out the part of their brain that can experience pleasure and/or joy
  at least you have a family and a girlfriend rejoice many dont have that privilege and are drowning in alcohol and drugs in addition
  want to stop being depressed  1 cut all junk from your diet and eat healthy   2 start getting exercise even simply walking for 20 minutes can improve your mental health  3 dont masturbate all the time   4 dont do drugs yes that includes alcohol  5 think positive   6 get off the internet unless youre using it to learn or for work
  jokes on you i never had any friend  we can be frens
  cold and flu tablets when youre feeling like shit cold and flu tablets the good ones you have to hand over ure drivers license for not the shit herbal crap  try it youll see it does work feels like someone just gave you a vacation from the fucking depression  only take the amount you are supposed to take for a cold
    you should see a doctor about it i hit rock bottom lost job lost girlfriend became recluse stopped exercising and started drinking before i finally admitted i needed help always telling myself that id snap out of it but never could and just saw the days go by and that made me feel worse and worse    so the doctor asked a bunch of questions and did some tests then recommended i go on meds and make some changes to go with them the way he explained it is that my brain chemistry got out of whack and the meds are helping to recalibrate it    medication has to be backed by other things though and those are forcing myself to exercise watching and reading comedy and lastly dietary change  im on a ketogenic diet which assists with the production of neurotransmitter chemicals    my biggest regret is that i took so long to seek help thats time ill never get back
  what do cold and flu tablets do
exercise  sleep  doing something productive  not eating garbage    until you have all the above sorted out stop looking for other solutions like drugs (((prescription drugs))) orgies crime sex changes joining the circus an hero beta uprising etc    after youve really tried all the above and youre still fucked time to worry
  try it nothing to lose everything to gain do the day and night ones take the night ones at 5pm
  i smoke cigarettes i work outside i try to stay active the three things that cause depression are environment eating/sleeping patterns and a lack of goals
  what caused your depression kill it or destroy it
keep your personal problems in their proper place
  seems you and i are in the same boat maybe i should take your advice into consideration so i wont end up regretting all the time lost
  search rodney dangerfield on youtube and immerse yourself in a few hours of his material
    also you mentioned the losing girlfriend part but not the losing friends part i reckon you had social support when you hit rock bottom at least i have no friends now so i have no one to lean on during my times of need
  not op but you dont know how much this helps me  god bless brother
  fucking christfags are a cancer on the earth kys
  fuckin this for sure
  sounds like regular old sadness to me op if your lethargy leads to a state of near catatonia for more than 12 hours then you have pretty serious depression    take some time to cry identify your issues or maybe someome elses and youll be over it with time
  faggot earth   lmao
dont feel bad for wasting your time on 4chan or whatever life is meaningless so why not do meaningless shit and not feel guilty about it    try to find a friend or some sort of social interaction as well it may mean going out but it will help in the long run maybe even reconnecting with old friends you once had    also antidepressants are a scam
  i dated a girl with vitiligo once and i found her very attractive
    you need to start doing stuff that makes you better anything produce something learn a language read a non fiction book write yourself     you need to start training your body cardio and muscle mass both this is the most important thing it helps to activate your brains happiness generation again     what worked for me i had very bad depression i had no gf did have friends and family did not want to see friends tho locked myself in my apartment and wasted time failed all of my responsibilities in life the last thing i tried was enlisting in the army i can act quite well could even do that while depressed i faked that i was well cheated through 3 shrinks i had official depression i had to convince them i was well in the army i understood how little my problems really were if i have a bed and warm water from sink and some food then all other problems are actually quite small the hardships in the army made me appreciate the little things     and the very last thing get antidepressants but this is the very last thing i promise you antidepressants alone make things worse you need to understand that doing stuff and developing your skills and your mind is the thing that gets rid of depression the meds only enable you to do those things the meds only give you reach so you can reach the real cure    i was depressed 3 years ago still in the army rising fast in the best physical and mental form of my life also the smartest i have ever been i have the woman of my dreams i am the happiest i have ever been    you can do it man please listen to me
i make plans of all the expensive corrective surgeries i want to undergo that i cant afford
  announcing a sage is a bannable offense
  take some time to cry  not everyone can dude
    in theory yes but then so is racism
i relocated and i have a nice not much older than me female neighbor with a little daughter    she seem kinda extroverted and in need of attention since i dont think shes working at the moment and is at home with her daughter all the time her boyfriend does not live with her and she said to me i will see him very rarely i think they broke up or something    my dad and mom are helping me moving house we and her always exchange some words like good neighbors she also autoinvited to go out for lunch one of these days    what to do i kinda like her but i also fear people like that
  extroverted women will fuck you up     the amount of sex positive idgaf bs a woman had to swallow for her to be extroverted and outgoing is enough to disqualify her from pretty much all sexual interaction    female chads are hyper sluts avoid
  i dont necessarily want a relationship with her she already has a daughter and this is a real turn down for me    i wanna just be a good neighbor primarily i just dont want that she come every 5 min at my door asking for inane bullshit
  im over 30 and alone i have to train myself somehow    i would like to hear some less extreme opinion than yours tho
  shes just excited that she has a new neighbor just roll with it for now take her up on that lunch and get to know her unless shes super into you or insane the incessant checking up on you will die down in a week or two i feel you in that im scared of hypersocial women but its good to have a neighbor like that ill bet you 20 bucks shell bake you some really good christmas cookies in a few weeks
  she already gave coffee to my dad and the tiler guy  i was absent coz they called me at work    feels bad but i will probably reveal myself as the boring person i am and she will lose interest coz i cant keep up the facade for long time
  so what is your ideal outcome of this situation a close friend a fwb or just a comfortable neighborly relationship because as long as youre not a shitty neighbor she will still enjoy your company even if you are as boring as you say you are yeah shes probably gonna lose interest because after a while youll be all moved in and will no longer be a new neighbor but i thought thats what you wanted
  i will be alone in that house my parents are only helping me relocate    i dont know wat i want coz i fantasize about her sometimes but when i see her kinda vanishes
  well if you dont know what you want from her then just see how things shake out like i said before take her up on that lunch and just talk about where youre from what you do for a living hobbies etc etc dont try to impress her or swoon her just listen and act interested you may end up getting along really well and there may even be a romantic spark or maybe you just dont mesh that well and you can settle for being nice neighbors    basically dont preoccupy yourself with making a grand first impression and dont set wild expectations for this new relationship even if you dont end up as close friends having a friendly neighbor has big upsides
  yeah you are right i dont care about anything most of the time but since i have been a failure with girls in general all my life im kinda anxious for nothing    imagine seeing all your once friends getting bfs and gfs all your life and you got nothing coz you are too much of a coward plus i look pretty young for my age and that gives me nerves coz people get weirded out when i reveal it
recently out of 4 year relationship so i have no idea how to flirt im going to a party for a club at school next weekend how do i be an alpha chad and get fucked
be confident be funny and dont mention 4chan also dont mention anything racist/sexist knowing you incels
be confident be funny and dont mention 4chan also dont mention anything racist/sexist knowing you incels 
    honestly good advice fitting double post
it was a discussion at work today about how some of us break up with girlfriends most guys said they take them to dinner tell her during the meal or slightly after and literally watch her break down and throw fits     is this what you normies do    i was like fuck that i call her or text and say its not working out and leave it as this you got to be crazy to do it in public area and in person who knows what could happen to you worst case is she will attempt to kill your ass
i do it in public out of the blue to make it seem random and catch them off guard i always make sure to push an uncomfortable boundary the morning before the big game so theyre extra hurt right after i break the good news i put on dark sunglasses so they dont have the opportunity to look me in the eyes   but thats just me phone is probably more convenient
do it in her/your house  dont drag it get to the point i wanna break up with you then explain why it isnt working for you  offer your support if she refuses ask if you should leave  only leave when shes cool with it and clearly doesnt want you there anymore    not that hard man breakup texts are shit
  what a chad
  this is the way to do it its insensitive to do it in public as shell probably get upset and its embarrassing to be so outwardly emotional in public
does anyone here actually do it over a meal at a restaurant
  after a blowjob make sure to cum on her face too
  this what are you incels on about why would date someone whos emotionally unstable to the point of a public freakout
how do i deal with dying alone
  with some rare exceptions of group suicide we all die alone
deal with it or not the outcome will be the same eventually
you wont feel the same after dying
  just die  everything will work itself out afterwards
  thats the worst huh your choice in the matter is nonexistent once we realize this we truly are free to live our lives in pursuit of true meaning
  so i should just kill myself and get it over with
  yeah but youre too scared and it wont happen for you youre unfortunately going to be alive for a long time
  do it faggot  make sure you take as many normies with you as possible
  not if i have anything to say about it      where should i go for the highest normie population
  you dont  1 you do everything in your power to change this  2 you will not cope and go psychotic or kill yourself    pick option 1 bro
  dont fix what aint broke  college campus or high school with a good ol ar15  high school is better i think because its more closed so its harder for normies to just spread out in all directions  make sure you carry a sidearm as well  and make sure your guns are well lubricated and mantained before the big day  car into crowd also works but unless you got a big truck with tons of torque it will barely kill more than 23 normies
  fpbp
  how about spending decades studying viral biology and then wipe out all life
  too conspicuous they wont let you theyll take away your researc and make it into a bioweapon instead  better to storm into a high school and put some bullets in some roasties and chads before anyone knows whats happening  or better yet drive your truck through some concert or gathering and turn some roasties into paste
  you get used to it
  take comfort knowing that everyone dies alone former cna here nobody goes at the same time and i dont care if you both by some miracle did die in the same bed at the same moment the final complete death experience is utterly and totally alone and if thats a fact of life then emotions about it are as childish and stupid as being angry that water is wet or fire is hot
  make friends
  not op but can you share the recipe for making friends  or maybe i can buy them ready instead of making them myself
it makes me sick this whole shit is just making me insane i cant sleep anymore i cant eat properly    its about a guy i wanted to ask something he interpreted it as a question for romantic shit and simply ran away acted highly autistic the following week he came up to me after a lesson waited till everyobody got outside and wanted to give me some kind of letterhe just like stood in front of me with the letter there was literally nobody there anymore but i still remembered the way he acted i didnt even look him in the eyes i just straight stood up and went away i was pissed at the way he treated me   i stalked up his social media and i saw right after he suddently posted some depressive shit listened to emotionalaggressive metal core for a year he listened to house and suddently metal core since then he distanced himself was kind of sad since then and i keep on crushing my mind what on god damn earth was in that letter he came up with it makes me crazy i am on the verge of just messaging him on social media and justify apologize i feel so bad and i get nightmares about it it literally haunts me forever what do
  men are good at getting over shit like this just ignore him and move on with your life if he tries anything just speak to the dean he would be removed so fast
as much as i want to tell you to throw the poor guy a bone just leave him be if he hasnt learned to deal with this kind of thing already he should getting shit on when youre trying to tell someone you like them is just part of being a man
this reads as you are way to obsessed with him what he does and what he feels for actually not really caring about him
  tell the cops he tried to rape you  hell be kicked out of the school and you wont have to deal with him anymore for years untill the trial happens but hell propably have offed himself by then
  but i feel so sorry i cant deal with it it haunts me it makes me sick literally it completely makes me unable to handle anything anymore i feel this endless sea of regret
  what are you regretting you roastie  leading him on because i doubt that no woman has ever regretted that  rejecting him no way because as you said hes a fucking socially awkward autist so you wouldnt give him the time of day anyway  so what exactly are you regretting
  listen i was an idiot in the guys place too although not fuckin autistic i wrote a godawful letter to someone and gave them a chocolate cake on valentines and shit    they never gave me confirmation and cause of that both of us suffered i cant really tell whether youre talking about something recent or long ago but if its recent turn him down and give him something solid so that he can turn away if its long ago apologise and just say whatever you wanted to say and never talk to him again hell probably be mad but in the end it will give both of you closure
  unless you plan on dating him leaving him be is the best thing for him
  i am incredibly sorry my soul cries in an endless cycle i feel this pain of doing someone injustice
  you sound even more autistic than he is  maybe you should date him youd make a nice fit for each other
  why do i sound autistic is empathy conscience and regret autistic i am not a bad person
  you must be a extroverted feeler look lady dont give this guy any sort of sign you like him you will regret it just ignore him men are good at getting over stuff just as long as you dont embarrass him on purpose
  well just apologize to him
  you are a woman so youre a bad person by definition  anyway as the other anons said dont lead him on anymore and certainly dont embarass him in front of others  or just report him for raping you because hurting your feeling by existing must surely be some kind of rape right
  look lady dont give this guy any sort of sign you like him you will regret it just ignore him  but why i cant live with knowing i hurt someone deeply    i would never embarass him thats not what i would ever want to happen to someone everybody deserves good in life i love to help out and make other peoples life alot better it stresses me out to a max when i dont get along with somebody
  what
  you didnt hurt him deeply  men get rejected on a daily basis and sometimes even in harder situations
  you dont owe this guy shit he would appreciate if you just ignored him and not try to embarrass him just tell him im not interested if you truly want to say something but i cant stress this enough dont give this guy a inch if you dont like him some men take that as a sign that he needs to just try harder we dont want this guy to get kicked out of school for harassment dont string him along if you feel like lying just say you have a boyfriend
  oh jesus how much shall i tell that i would never embarass someone in public
  just gotta make sure because alot of women do that and then they ask why these guys wanna shoot up a school
  wait what how did he treat you that deserved a harsh/cold treatment from you     from what you said i simply gathered that he stood in front of you awkwardly hardly a reason any ire on your part particularily if you identified that he was weird/autistic/whatever
should have read the letter but you acted autistic    and even more so by making a thread on a japense sushi forum
  and once again it is all about how bad you feel fuck off thot
  he said go away no thanks i was really like i wanted to tell you that and he just responded with i said no thanks other people started getting involved and called me out on harassing other people thats why i felt so much shame
  ah well youre definitely in a pickle then in that situation listen to me tune everyone else out its shitty that happened for the both of you he is special and hes gonna feel bad no matter what in this case that you feel bad is a good sign so take that with you thanks bad feeling you showed me who i was just now leave the situation behind but what you learned with you you will try to sacrifice your wellbeing in order to avoid such a situation again not at any cost of course    feeling ouchie no ouchie want do good good good feeling is good no ouchie good girl am yes
  are you that dumb op who keeps posting about getting rejected by an autistic guy
  so should i randomly and out of the blue tell him everything that i feel sorry and shit
  may we see whats in the letter
  nah
  thats the point of it i dont even know what was in that damn letter
  maybe idk that depends on your own social skills if you think you can get past his defensive wall and on an emotional level put him at ease with the situation yeah sure why not but if not perhaps tell one of the parents what happened so that they can handle it on their end probably understand him well enough to connect
  yeah like can we all read it post it here maybe thx
  its on social media i can post here what i thought of
  lmao get over yourself or go see a doc why are you obsessing back over it if you find it repulsive why the fuck would you message him back dumb cunt
    oh you never took it nvm
  youre crazier than him
  its guilt nothing more than that
  some chick told me i looked like a creep after i started talkig to her in a bar another one looked at me like i had just insulted her and basically ran away after i walked up to her and said hi in a club tons of guys experience harsh rejection thats just how it is its alright that youre conscious of that youve rejected him in a bad way you shouldnt feel bad for it though just take it as a learning experience
  i can recognize your writing style get some life and stop obsessing over that autism we get that youre thirsty for him but dawg
its important for you that others know where you are coming from and to have it acknowledged that you were doing your best to be considerate and would not intentionally inflict pain on another person    you cant always clarify this though some people will think you are just an asshole and talking to them about it will not get you very far  im guessing you sense there will be further communication problems if you try to apologize and you will end up feeling worse  you have convinced yourself that you could have said or done something differently and that it is your fault that he felt bad    really he just blindsided you and made you feel uncomfortable with his spergy social skills and you reacted in an anxious state when your brain was not operating at full power  if you do intend to apologize i would recommend phrasing it less like an apology and more something along the lines of i didnt mean to offend/upset you but you offended/upset me and i reacted while feeling alarmed and angry    its good to be considerate and compassionate but you can not control the outcome of all your actions or how theyll affect other people you are not ultimately responsible for another persons feelings
  i know
  i see sorry for calling you crazy tough situation but i think best is to not reply yes you didnt respond perfectly on the spot but replying now would only make yourself feel better at the expense of leading him on if you really feel the need to apologize id avoid social media and instead ask him in person to give you a second chance in reading his letter then react however you need in front of him this option takes more effort but may comfort him more as well as release your guilt do not contact through social media because for him thats like opening a secret back door
  ok just saw this   in this case go away its a red flag to react that emotional publicly over who is essentially a stranger/acquaintance youve already tried to apologize hell get over it without your help
that guy sounds like an incel desu  you should report him for harassment even if its a fake report his life will be ruined by the time the truth comes out
  calls someone incel  suggests a way to be a bigger incel  hope youre ironic
  doesnt matter what happens to him afterwards as long as his life is ruined which is pretty easy to do  i bet that little incel shit also browses this site
  earth to you anon youre a bigger incel than him grow up
  no we arent were good at becoming alcoholics when we have our hopes raised and then smashed
  what does it mean that i open a secret back door
  like what kind of back door
  it just means theres a chance hell use social media to try to contact you repeatedly
  t triggered roastie
  test
  i cant live with knowing i hurt someone deeply  yes you can and you will living with the choices weve made is part of being an adult if you are ever in that situation again youll have the opportunity to choose differently

  how long ago did you break up
what are some major red flags when dating a woman
  in your pic  having a tinder profile  tattoos  piercings    massive red flags   single mother  polyamorous  lgbtbbq nonsense    defcon 1 thermonuclear mistake  single mother with mutt kid
  drexel girls are nuts in all of the wrong ways i have yet to meet a normal one
if she doesnt have many friends
pointing out individual redflags would take 23 posts     but generally speaking     any signs of mental illness or trauma  androgeninized physical and mental features   bad family
  druggy especially the type of druggy who brags about being a druggy  gossiping  being a feminist
  this holy shit this
  gossiping  anon
  open to anything other than indefinite monogamy with someone she loves and respects so that counts out bisexual nothing against gay people does any illegal drug or drinks heavily is attending pregrad is obese has children uses filters has no friends from more than six months ago has no job
  tinder profile is a no go from the start if her phone is attached to her and she never leaves it on the side ever or always leaves it face down likewise if she seems overly interested if your phone goes off obsessions with charitiesor any other form of exaggerated public displays of empathy brightly colored hair overweight or unemployed you want an independant girl one who can look after herself so you can actually respect her rather than seeing her as inferior
spend 12 months dating different girls  find someone with the right personality  spend another 12 months to get nudes  tits and or vagene look awful  make your excuses and end the dating  repeat  there must be a more effective method
  posting this bait  lmao why though
you guys are dumb everyone has a tinder profile these days its fast becoming the norm for women to use it for whatever they want including dating
  i dont use tinder and i dont think i would date a woman that does
im surprised no one posted  is female    i guess the split really did make this site a better place
  this     your narrow worldview/the norm   having tinder at all is a red flag
  tattoos  piercings  marxism  political correctness
  everyone has a tinder profile   thats not true
  everyone has a tinder profile  no only degenerates
    this tinder even leaves up old unused profiles to fool people into thinking its more popular than it is the whole thing is disgusting
  how do you get your old tinder account deleted
  i dont know ive never had one
by red flags i assume you mean indicators of a deeper possible incompatibility as opposed to a legitimate dealbreaker mine are    really proud that they vote for x party  really proud that they dont vote at all  gets pissy about having to tip  complains about having no money but spends like a retard  has to have it be worth her while to spend money on you  makes constant remarks about how she wants to die  texts while driving  uncontrollable road rage    these work for men too
lying of any sort  cant stand it especially if its stupid little things that dont make sense to lie about it makes me trust her less feeling that if she lies about tiny things she will for sure lie about big things  fake orgasming  its obnoxious and it makes it difficult to tell if youre actually good at sex/making her satisfied ive heard horror stories from guys where they thought they were good for years and it turns out they were garbage cans in bed their women eventually left them after they never got better after literally never once honestly telling them what they wanted in bed fuck that shit    materialism  any for of materialistic behavior is a major turn off and red flag for me i come from a wealthy family my mother and sister are repugnant brats and spoiled beyond reason i hate how materialistic they are i ghost anybodynot just women in my life who are materialistic    no education  if you havent been to grad school im not interested any retard with half a brain can get a bachelors these days you dont need to have completed a masters but at least show that little bit of extra effort to make yourself better in life education isnt just about money its about the knowledge you obtain from your education that shit will affect your every single decision i want the person i marry to be an intelligent wellrounded mother also smart chicks are sexy    i have a few more but these are a good starting point
  single mom  no goals  no hobbies  no intelligence     find a girl that has a more interesting life than you
  any guy friends
      several women i know have it and they are decidedly not sluts you can actually use it for dating you know
  severa that you knowl/the majority  tinder has a reputation as a hookup app and men and women who use it should be judged in that light
never date superficial people theyll either dump you for someone hotter in less than a year or spend their life with you wandering from purchase to purchase and mindlessly doing what theyre supposed to until they have a mid/late life crisis dump their mom wanted grandkids on you and fuck off for weeks or cheat on you so they can find themselves superficial people are generally very vague and undifferentiated because theyre too vapid and just plain stupid to figure out what they actually like watch out for things like ill listen to everything but country and rap lol or an obsessive need to watch every tv show for no other reason than its new this is a unisex post
coloured hair aposematism has never let me down  drugs even weed but then again i cant associate with anyone into that shit cause of my profession  they have kids in their early 20s and before theyre even fucking 20  they announce their shitty gender identity  they announce their politics off the bat too  off the top of my head but theres probably a fuckton more out there to watch out for
what do you think about women you put much emphasis on their social media profiles
  fpbp
yall making this shit complicated    biggest and only red flags are  she doesnt listen to you  she refuses to compromise   all that other shit can be fixed easily
  i personally really do not like it and am sensitive to noticing it i will give some time before deciding if im being overly judgemental or if my instincts are right but i would not date a person that does this i do not judge them as for who they are i just know they wont be a good match for me personally
one of my friends wants to dye her hair pink for a little bit can you elaborate on why this is an issue i really do need the insight im crushing on her a bit
  dyed hair isnt a sign of anything anymore its become so common that it doesnt even matter
  i think dying your hair in a unnatural color shows that you want to deviate from conservative social norms and are attention seeking
if she has a bad sexual history really big deal     if she makes too many excuses misattributes blame or gaslights     if when presented with vice or virtue she tilts toward vice
one thing i never understod was why women use dark or black lipstick  isnt the point of lipstick to make the lips bright red to simulare sexual excitement or sometbing
  because its hot
 grill here i promise lads    from what i notice from other girls its if theyre really fucking gossipy then theyre gonna shittalk you behind your back and probs abandon you or use you loyalty is important unless you wanna get trust issues for life    also i only dyed my hair purple bc of an anime character lmao
  she smokes  and has tattoos    pretty much this im a simple man
  not to me but fair enough
when you notice she has a bulge
kid out of wedlock will want you to help pay her debts like car repair or new cellphoneold guy will almost certainly continue to hang around biological father of kid and she will probably still let him screw her
  lol i have 2 kids with a girl and i do exactly this shes married and im married he raised both of my kids and i screw his wife i hate her fucking guts but whatever i might let him know one day just in an attempt to ruin her life and i know she has the same thought in the back of her mind
  it isnt the autists on here just associate it with feminism which they cant mention without entering pantsshiting rage
just want someone to understand feel like ive explained my depersonalisation/ anxiety issues to everyone and i hate to burden people but i just want it to stop want someone to understand will i really be like this forever  i know this isnt advice sorry
  whats on your mind anon you afraid to take the next step in life late on your mortgage work problems what triggers the anxiety when do you notice when its the worst     btw you havent explained to me anything yet so id like to say that a false advertisement      lay it on me pal
  i know what depersonalization is like i understand ive suffered from it myself now what are you going to do
my gf is from a 3rd world country in sea where her family is upper middle class and shes sent to my country where she studies at a graduate level even though shes upper middle class the disparity between our currencies makes it that even the basic needs here become obscenely expensive to her family minimum wage here is 20 times her citys since shes the oldest of 5 and her youngest sibling is about to start university soon she asked her parents to stop sending her money for her living costs they now only cover her tuition and shes working in the uni to cover her living costs due to visa restrictions which doesnt pay her much    weve been dating for 3 years now even before she came into this country now that her financial situation is like this she has started to accept help and gifts from friends some are from her girl friends yes but most of them are from her guy friends she hangs out with other international students who are often obscenely rich and it starts to get to me how these guys have been sending her gifts and even taking her out for lunch/dinner and paying for them they give her shit like branded bags winter clothes accessories even send groceries to her place more than anything its the taking her out for lunch/dinner that bothers me it feels like theyre taking out my gf for a date    ive told my gf about this and it caused a big fight she got angry and accused me of not having a conscience that i would prefer to see her starve or be cold during winter than have my masculinity wounded i think its ridiculous its not like other people dont have to go through the same thing people go through graduate school having to support themselves and go into debt shes luckier in that her parents are paying for her tuition other people can survive just fine without having to rely on other guys and whoring around for food so why the fuck do i have to stand this what do you all think and how can i get her to understand my point
  dating a third worlder
  at least shes much prettier than the landwhale white girls here
  sea girls are notorious for cheating idk why the fuck you decided to unironically commit to one and shes accepting gifts and going to dinners with these guys wew lad i dont know how to tell you this but youre getting cucked
  thats interesting im asian american and my parents come from sea too ive never heard this stuff about sea girls being cheaters ive always heard the opposite    also no i made sure she always gets home right after those lunch/dinners and they never last more than a couple of hours i dont think she has time to cheat
  shes fucking them right now  i dont think you understand the reality of this situation  break up and get your dick checked for diseases
  even if she wasnt cheating thats fucked up the fact that you even check up on her that much or feel anxious enough to check speaks volumes    you do not trust her that alone is enough reason to break up with her    what are you going to do when shes your wife and still accepting gifts from strange men
  shes emotionally cheating at best id dump a girl just for going to dinner with a random guy in fact id probably dump her too for accepting gifts from random guys too you cant keep tabs on her 24/7 id cut my losses now youre already controlling her by making sure she doesnt go anywhere after these dinners its just going to make her want to rebel more dump this girl
  ive also heard the opposite about sea girls its just /adv/s no 1 response dont mind it but yeah fucked up that she is accepting those gifts/dinners but on the other hand if i was a poor pretty girl in in a rich country i wouldnt say i wouldnt do the same
  weve been dating for 3 years now even before she came into this country  you met her online or while you were traveling not sure what she is up to but her actions sound fishy seems like she wanted to use you as a stepping stone to move abroad or to get a future spouse visa   do those rich international students have western citizenship if not it seems like she is with you to get that future spouse visa while being with those guys to get money and expensive gifts be careful op she sounds like she may trade up in the dating game at some point
i payed often for my poor student friends when youre hanging out and get hungry it sucks too much you can not grab a bite to eat just because your friend is poor
she is not doing candlelight dinners in an evening gown i suppose
  nah i would be worried if her parents arent rich she has a students visa that they paid for and weve discussed marriage but she said she doesnt want to be married before shes 30 and has a stable job she has been trying to sway me into moving to her home country if we do get married because she said her family would buy her a house there and they can get us house maids we met online but she already had plans to go to my country for studies paid for by her parents even before we met  i do worry about that though im uneducated only graduated high school i used to be more athletic but now im no longer exercising regularly my family is nowhere near as rich as hers and definitely nowhere near as rich as those guys who keep on buying her lunch and dinner it honestly has been something im rather insecure about because my economic status is very different than how shes been brought up       yeah i think its fucked up too she tried to argue that the difference between other people and her is that shes an international student so my country and her country dont offer her any student loans she cant ask for a scholarship because in her home country her family is considered rich even though theyre not when converted into my local currency she also gets limited in terms of work hours and where she can work because she comes into the country with a students visa  either way i still think its still not an excuse for her to rely on other guys like that i grew up impoverished too and my family didnt always have food to eat if we can do it why cant she
  nah its mostly the local asian restaurants or fast food joints
  trust your gut op lest you end with more heartbreak down the line commit to the breakup deal with it move on and find someone else make it simple make it clean and get it done    or    fuck her silly women who are fucked well by their boyfriends usually have no intention of cheating but then again youre asian so idk if a 4 inch penis will do the job
  kek she is cheating on you obviously
  this is very true    also i dont get why you dont just pay for her groceries instead
  ok this extra info changes things how did you guys meet online via an online dating website or as online friends initially  well shes not that poor then that makes accepting those expensive gifts from other guys fishier i agree with the other anon here that rich people may be willing to pay for their poor friends expenses but the fact that shes not truly that poor makes things a bit fishy you also need to bear in mind that they are paying for branded bags which arent necessities for survival it seems like they like her more than just a friend  anyway what is your relationship with her like before she started meeting these rich international students what do you guys tend to talk about or do
funny how everyone is saying she must be cheating because shes going to dinner a girl said she found out her boyfriend was going out for dinner with another girl and keeping it secret in another thread and the advice was he knew youd blow up about it and create a problem and he wants to see his friend without having to fight you over it    so girl goes out to dinner with male friend and lets him pay for her and buy her gifts  shes cheating    guy goes out for dinner with female friend and lets her pay for him and buy him gifts  girl is a controlling harpy who wont let him have friends    whats with the double standard
  i dont think she is cheating at least at this point i guess it is possible for rich people to pay for their poor friends meals but its the fact that they are paying for her when shes not truly that poor and theyre buying her things which are not necessities for survival which make things fishy  if ops girlfriend is so open about how these rich guy are buying her gifts shes probably not cheating maybe shes simply leading those guys on for expensive gifts and dont see that as a problem maybe she is playing games and wants to get op to treat her like a princess too i really dont know
  i have the money but i dont think i should be paying for the groceries of a girlfriend i do pay for dates sometimes but i dont want to spoil her and do it every time      we were online friends for over a year before we began dating yeah i agree i think its ridiculous rather than accepting the gifts of other guys she could have just called her parents and ask for the money that they usually send her for her living costs she gave an excuse that she cant do that because shes the eldest and they have to pay for her siblings tuition and needs too but thats not enough imo were always really close we talk about a lot of random things lots of dates she used to pay more for our dates than she does now   i honestly would rather not get the advice to break up with her because shes really the only girl who has been with me through my darkest years and moments in life i used to be quite popular and never got interested with getting tied down but when i got depressed unemployed and lost everything no one else stayed with me other than her i do believe shes loyal just because she never had to choose an unemployed uneducated bum in the first place but she did
  how did you find out those rich guys were buying her all these gifts did she tell you without you asking or only told you when you asked about it    she got angry and accused me of not having a conscience that i would prefer to see her starve or be cold during winter than have my masculinity wounded  ironic she said that when she could afford paying for those dates have you explained how those rich guys will probably see her as leading them on even if she has no interest in really being with them    did you guys have an arguments before this one i have no idea what her intentions are as your situation is so unique is there the possibility she is only using those rich guys for their money and sees you as a trophy boyfriend of some sort
  she could pay for dates with me when her parents still sent her money but she has asked them to stop sending her money so they can pay for her siblings instead so now she hasnt been paying for our dates though i do make sure she at least pays for her share sometimes i have told her but she continued to deny it and claimed that her friends have never been inappropriate with her    yes she told me when she gets gifts she tells me too if shes about to go out with her friends and she tells me if they treat her    we do get into arguments but never angry or in this manner we mostly argue over stuff like how we view religion were both agnostics but she sympathizes with theists whereas i dont or about some athletes about cultural values we never argued as in fight    i have no idea if she does thats a possibility but im definitely no trophy boyfriend material now that i havent been exercising much
  ok this extra info is important  im chinese im not sure how things work in se asian cultures but at least in chinese culture it is quite common for girls to lead guys on without sex to use them they like the idea of leading guys on as they enjoy the attention it boosts their self esteem and the guys often buy the girls expensive gifts as they try to impress them   i highly suspect your girlfriend is doing something similar because it sounds so oddly familiar to this chinese relationship trend if this is the case do i think she is cheating on you by having sex with those rich guys probably not most likely she is just leading them on with some flirting and fake interest  i suspect she is angry as she doesnt want to admit she is using rich guys for their money admitting that will imply she is not as kindhearted as she appears i guess a lot of people dont like to be called out as being selfish and manipulative she sounds like she is being defensive so blames you instead  there is the possibility she sees you as a trophy boyfriend i am not sure what race are you but some do put white guys on a pedestal in asia as they are stereotyped as more attractive wealthy and romantic some also assume half white half asian are all automatically very attractive i am not sure if she wants kids but there is the possibility she wants a trophy foreign husband and beautiful children i guess this comes as a culture shock to you as these asians rarely admit these feelings in public  i am not really there do i cant be sure what is going on this is just my best way to explain what you are experiencing only you can judge what is going on maybe i missed some details which changes everything  and honestly do you like the idea of being with her and living in se asia how shes accepting expensive gifts from rich guys lets you see a snapshot of her personality do you still want to be with her
  adding to this i saw you talking about how you dont want to break up with her i can understand that from what youve written you had always seen her as a girl with a nice personality and it must hurt to realise she may not be as nice as she seems    only you know the full details of what happened so only you can make that decision you also need to think about what may happen in the future if you stay with her vs if you break up
  im asian american my parents came from sea im not mixed yeah just like you said she is ethnic chinese though she wasnt born and raised in china shes a 5th generation chinese immigrant in her country her ancestors came during world war 2    this is what im honestly confused about i would definitely say that its her personality if she had done this all the time while weve been dating but she didnt if anything while she had money she would treat me and her friends im just really annoyed that now that she doesnt get money from her parents she choose to accept gifts and free food from guys tbf also from girls but its mostly guys who treat her     i agree too thats definitely why it annoys me it feels like shes willing to go out with these guys even though imo its inappropriate i dont think she should go get free food from those guys while shes in a relationship and her excuse that she has no money now cant get loans cant get scholarships is weak i think thats not enough of an excuse to receive those    i honestly dont know about living with her in sea she said she wouldnt mind staying if i dont want to move but she would rather we move to her home country i dont really like her country and how conservative it is though
  ok so shes one of those chinesefilipina does her family know about you if they do do they like you
  her country is pretty close to philippines so i guess they would have similar cultures yeah they know about me theyre not happy that shes with an american and not a chinese guy from her home country her parents dont like mainland guys but they were polite to me i guess im better in their eyes than the white guy she used to briefly date before me so they dont complain much to her
  do they mind how youre less wealthy than her
  i earn more money than she would even after she graduates with a phd and earn more than her dad does thats definitely not an issue
  everyone really is terrible huh
  is anything like that with reverse gender   my bf is sweet and such but sometimes it bothers me how he talks about my light skin im not even white/pale but hispanic with light skin
  well maybe she is just using those rich guys and girls for money
  maybe either way id like her to stop and i want to know a way to convince her to
  after the additional info op gave i dont think this may be the case    thats possible it is sort of like internalised racism what race is he
  chinese
  she may not be cheating but shes still a bit of a whore
  i think most asian people just prefer light skin regardless of the race chinese girls in my gfs country are also fethisized because they have lighter skin i dont think it necessarily have anything to do with your race though you should tell your boyfriend if it bothers you
  yes i agree colourism exists in chinese culture    does he praise you for having western features is he whitewashed
  not really he has mentioned how he wishes he was lighter skin or korean/japanese i dont really mention anything race wise but i do call him attractive i might be over worrying about it if its a cultural thing   he was born and raised on usa his parents were born in china
  thats a bit sad my gf said that because of racism in her home country some chinese people also dont want to admit their chinese ethnicity shes very proudly chinese though and i respect that about her
ive never heard of needing designer bags and gourmet food to survive maybe she should be dating one of those obscenely rich dudes
  ive had a sea girlfriend they dont cheat and have all my respect on that departament    op your girl is in a rough spot if you dont like what she has to do which is also not easy on her then you need to man up and earn enough to support you both during these school years    there is no other way around wanting to have your masculinity intact on this situation and behaving like a little kid unable to provide for others
  i earn more than enough to support both of us i just dont think i should be supporting a girlfriend financially she can simply ask for money from her parents but she refuses to she can also go deal with the consequences of her choice and stretch her budget     what i want is to get her to agree with me and stop accepting gifts from others and going for free lunch/dinner with them
  i agree about the bags but tbf to her she doesnt go to gourmet places they have several asian restaurants they go to and fast food joints apparently international students are really interested in american fast food joints
bump i still havent gotten answers on my question
  could be internalised colourism does he find white girls more attractive than other girls
falling for the asian girl meme    by far the most materialistic women on earth
  im asian too get out with that racist bs at least they arent white landwhale dykes
  just say you dont want the guys to mistake her as being interested in them as this may lead to jealousy anger and violence
  she claimed that theyre just friends and they have never done or said anything inappropriate thats when she accused me of preferring to see her starving and cold in winter than to have my masculinity wounded
willingly getting cucked   welp  and anon it sounds like these people are her sugar daddies men dont gift women branded handbags just because
  exactly this is what i told her she has gotten 2 bags so far and their excuse is that they were buying bags for souvenirs to their moms aunts grandmas and that they just bought 1 more for her sure asians do often buy branded stuff to bring home to their family but that doesnt mean she gets a bag that costs hundreds of dollars out of it
bump
  what are you bumping your own thread for you already got all the advice you need fucking act on it now pussy no guy is spending money on your girl because of her nice personality shes literally going on dates and telling you about them and all you can do is write blog posts about it on an anonymous forum dont ever bump this shitty cuck thread again
  okay lets look at it this way if you were married you wouldnt have dinner with or accept gifts from other men its ridiculously inappropriate so if youre not married but have a commitment what are the rules
  she wont/doesnt respect u soon/idiot
  southeast asia  turn 360 degrees and walk out the door  i havent met a seasian who isnt a selfserving hedonist at best theyre smart enough to disguise it but even thats asking for a fucking lot out of sea
well maybe she isnt cheating on you but she might leave you because youre becoming insecure and keep arguing with her
  360 degrees would be the same direction bro
  are my memes finally so spicy are my memes truly so antiquated
  shes a golddigger every thirdworlder is theyre crazy whores that dont deserve to be breathing the same air as us get rid of that thot
i massaged a dude i like  and who has been acting hot and cold and kinda aloof lately  that i wont bother him anymore and he should message me first if he wants to  would it be completely out of line to send him some memes from time to time
yeah if youre gonna say something like that follow through and dont bother him
  it would not be completely out of line but it wont get the result youre hoping for if you keep chasing after his attention when youre not being acknowledged or respected he will respect you less and less it will just get worse stick to your guns and stay quiet unless he chases after you again i would suggest that you move on and meet a new guy who values your company a little more
dont do it you kinda have to double down on this hell act if hes interested trust me    for what its worth you sound like an extremely sweet woman you cant stay mad at him without the urge to fill his inbox with silly shit bubbling up thats adorable and really fucking gay
  i know it is gay but i really care about him even just as a friend and he has been through some rough time lately i just want to cheer him up a bit and most people enjoy memes
  how long have you known him
  over a year but lately we havent spoken much
  how long has it been since you told him to message you do you know if hes seeing anyone
  if youre going to pull the  i just wont bother you anymore  bullshit then you should at least mean it    dont be a drama queen
  almost 3 weeks ago hes had a girlfriend but from what i gather he is single now
  go tell him youre sorry and ask if you can come over
  i cant do that i wont be in his state for nex 3 or 4 months
  then yeah just let it sit and dont text back for now  if hes going through as much shit as you say an ldr probably isnt something hes going to be interested in
  do you think it would be better to wait some time maybe two or three months and then send him something lighthearted or should i just leave him alone forever
if you want him too much he wont feel like youre a catch and hell desire to do better than you     honesty is the best policy tell him you love his attention and if he ever wants to talk to you or message you anything to just go for it    to me it sounds like you dont care so much if he likes you just you want to keep a conversation running and /or get attention from him so whatever is honest i would say that
  i think if youre going to be seeing him anyway leaving things until you see each other in person would be fine gives him time to get his head off of that other girl before you saunter up in a lowcut top    if its some deal where youre not going to be together unless you make up over those 3/4 months youre out of state go ahead and text him now maybe asking him how hes been and letting him vent instead of pinging him with a bunch of memes    the advice people gave you about respect doesnt really matter too much in this situation hell either be grateful for the conversation or his respect will dwindle while having absolutely no consequence on your social life
  how can i even text him now after saying these things i said them in the first place because im a bit sensitive and felt like im bothering him because sometimes he wouldnt text back but now given his lack of response i feel like it just confirms that he doesnt want to hear from me i dont know i feel so conflicted and unsure im such a dumbass
  i dont wanna talk if you dont  but please dont mind me as i keep pushing for contact anyway
  he will literally think you cant hold your word and he will know you will run to him no matter how cold he is  i know you want to but dont do it anonnette     find other ways to show your memes like join a discord or upload them to imgur or something or reddit
    maybe hes just as lost and confused on the other end feeling like you hate him now  juggling all that with whatever bullshit hes dealing with in real life must really suck  yeah you should just contact him openly and honestly maybe tell him how bad youve got it for him and how you just felt rejected even if he didnt say anything overt    dont try to play games with guys just be straight its both a net and a filter as genuinely masculine men appreciate it
as a kid i would take face my fav or other small things to tear apart bugs slowly and always fantasized about doing the same to people now that feeling is still in there but i learned to have control over these impulsive thoughts and they been around since i was about 8 or youngeri used to not fit in because i was just so fucked like looking at other people thinking theyre looking at me and i was just completely paranoid about it every day of school since 5th grade pretty much i used to have ocd or at least now i dont notice much of the symptoms because i shut most of them off a few years back after fearing of being at school for so long and so much fucked up shit at home i would turn off my emotions and not see it different since i was young i would always see more into the future than in the present after smoking weed and being high every day for about a year and a half maybe i touched my sensitive side but but boarders around it because i coudlnt stand the thought of being weak and worrying to much about feelings and soon that sensitive compassionate side like well if i were to describe it i would say the part of me when i was 7 that wanted to be a girl never left but at this point for me strongly going against having any feelings towards it and now that along with a lot of ignored emotions have split into different parts like yesterday when i was at the gym while being high working out and relaxing i overheard a guy like 13 feet away saying i need to work on chest day while i was doing lats and throughout that day i kept thinking about it hundreds nd hundreds of times and kept imaging different scenarios over and over again and some of me brutally killing himlost my train of thought at this point
thought of something elsesometimes when im getting really pissed off as soon as i bite my tongue i just wanna kill and cause sufferingive had a sex addiction since i was 14 which kept getting stronger and stronger and now im 19 and ive developed lots of different tastes some fucked up ones which is want to leave buried so i can get past the past and lot let it put its foot in the door because there is no room for it in my life and never should have been
now im wondering if im not even properl6 expressing myself for me to speak about another side of myself and not feel that side
how do i learn to sell im an introvert 95 tech worker and i want to start a side hustle have some fun make some more cash and improve my life
dropped out of collage as a freshman and bummed around working/mooching i just got a rich girl pregnant she is gainfully employed and we will be getting married on the 10th i am 26     i am in the national guard as a 68w and i want to go to medschool but it looks like i need a four year degree to go to the two schools that are near me     my stats  i got a 31 on the act when i was 17   the army taught me how to care about stupid stuff  ive been told that im good at my job  i am apparently too stupid to know how to prevent a pregnancy   i have a md friend who hooks me up with a high dose of adderall and i have a waver from my unit to use it     my plan get a 4 year degree in two or three years and go to med school using the national guards absurdly generous med student program which will pay me tuition 1000 bucks a month for whatever i wantbooks and possibly partial rent in exchange for staying in the guard for seven years as a doctor     the guard and my soon to be wife will float me through the undergrad stuff    i think i would function better if i did the work online that way i dont need to be around zoomers     is this possible i understand that organic chemistry has labs and such
  no reputable med school will take you without close to a 40 record from a real college
  not unless you are black so op be black
im so messed up    my relationship with my mother was so fucked up and i did not realise it because of my autism diagnosis    i wanted to be a goth because of southpark and my mother encouraged it buying me a studded collar people made fun of me and then she did too  as a teenager things got weirdly boderling sexual between her she would make me let her squeeze my ass boils and say i cant complain because im not being raped  she was completely controlling and had to be at all my appointments and meetings and she would not get me have privacy it was hard to have time to masturbate  i resembled my father so i think it was some weird thing about that im female though    i was 21 before i began to break her control    my sister was treated horribly because my mother only wanted to pay attention to me and my mental issues
so what advice do you want
  just want to be told i can get over it
it will take timer and work but you can move past this ive seen some people with very deep trauma move on and heal theyll always have scars but they have moved past it and repaired their lives and their selves and can live happy fulfilling lives    you can too op it might not be easy but you can
  i had a pretty similar situation with my mother op  honestly now that its already in the past and youre loosened out of her control there isnt much too worry about youre already probably less messed up and more dependable than you were before dwelling wont really help much in anything   youll get better about it
  im not sure if you can my man sometimes everythings fucked up and thats just the way it is
  ive got some bad news and some good news bad news is your destiny is in your hands good news is your destiny is in hour hands
i also wanted to say she gasslights people all the time and it always confused me because of my apparent autism that she may not believe actually exists idk    shes accused me of being a paedophile multiple times with gasslighting phrases it all started when i tried to tell her i felt guilty about drawing fucked up hentai she assumed i was a pedo because i would not actually tell her i said ive drawn bad things and i felt so bad and embarrassed that i wanted to die and she assumed it meant i was a pedo
  need a husband
hey op dont fret i have the same history    thousands down the drain years wasted nothing to show for myself it doesnt matter because one day you will get out of this and move on with your life
  you can get over it
  god i wish i had a pedo gf to straight shota role play with
some dude posted a gif/webm of what could be considered illegal on the politically incorrect board a girl dry humping a pillow  my friend clicked on it is he fucked he is fucking panicking
  he probably wouldve gotten away with it if you hadnt made this thread and incriminated him the nsa has geolocated your ip address and the fbi is en route to your friends house right now get ready to rot in prison you sick pervert fuck
tfw reading this post has made me an accomplice in ops treacherous crimes and i can hear the police helicopters outside my house right now
  please focus on the question at hand
im 31 and my girlfriend is 25 shes the first younger girl ive met that isnt insufferable but of course everyone she knows is the typical lena dunham level brainwashed social media obsessed substance lacking fake pretentious adult brats that everyone thinks of when the word millenial is mentioned i want to be able to integrate into her social life so that its not a problem when they want to be at the house or when i have to be around them/deal with their existence    most of them seem to know whats good but only pretend to be interested unless it gains them maximal likes and attention its really annoying because you think someone might be cool only to realize that its surface thin because literally everything about these peoples interests is focused on getting attention and direct approval from their other brainwashed robot peers they relate to even real music interest is faked for attention and this is one of the biggest differences i see between the people i grew up with and the younger crowd when i was in hs all the cool kids were in punk bands and metal bands and actually had music related hobbies and interests that they devoted a significant amount of their time on now it seems like all the younger adults focus their time and energy on making themselves seem like part of that because they perceive them as social cliques to improve the appearance of their faux personality traits and social media facades    my friends and people my age are infinitely more genuine and interesting than all these younger folks im meeting and its making me wonder if im just better off reestablishing the connections i had with some of them rather than attempting to make new friends with the people my gf knows i wish they were actually cool but start talking to them for a little about something they claim is an interest of theirs only to find they were full of shit and fake af im sick of these ppl they really are a cancer on society how do i deal with having to be around them
the only thing you can really do is nod along and tolerate them while theyre around everything else will come across as condescending do you have friends of your own that you can hang out with as a couple
  for fucks sake people like you are so annoying its not the generation people just suck in general ive seen the exact things you complain about with the roles swapped    the major difference is simply that people dont go out as much for hobbies because of the internet
  yeah shes told me that some of them think im pretentious which is hilarious because theyre the ones who act like that the reason is because i criticize their fake shit to their face and prove to them that they dont know what theyre talking about when they bring something up that i actually know about    for example last night my gfs one friend and bf were trying to be edgy and wanted to watch the film salo at the house and i was like is that really something you get friends together to watch thats more like something youd watch in film studies class or to understand more about pasolinis work they acted like i just directly offended them and i know why first of all because they were proud that they discovered something different and were planning on using it to make themselves look good and also because i proved to them that my film interest is above and beyond theirs which is limited to look at me instagram i found an 80s horror film on vhs at goodwill    but im the prententious one    and yeah i dont see any problems with my gf and my friends getting along but i doubt my friends would like hers that much they would see through the bullshit like me i just cant believe how terrible the personalities of these younger ones are i thought people my age were bad but i guess i had no idea how bad an entire generation of people could be
  you sound awful and pretentious    imagine caring what movie a group of friends watch together    inb4 zoomer    im 28
  if any hobbies are on the internet then chances are theyre fake hobbies like prentending to be a music nerd but never learning to play an instrument or go to shows etc
  wow youre actually retarded    i enjoy literature but i couldnt write a book
  just be mature and stop being confrontational its pointless
  the film in question is about a group of italian fascists who kidnap some teenagers and force them to eat shit the entire way through not sitting through that again so that my gfs friends can feel edgy and important not in my house
  yes ive seen it you sound like youre old in age but super immature who cares like i said im older and my friends and i watch awful movies and good movies together just for the experience   i dont think her friends need to grow the fuck up you do   you dont want them watching it in your house just say that dont attack how they hang out with friends   i honestly cant imagine caring that much
  okay this one dude whos my girlfriends best friends boyfriend had pictures of his john coltrane lps on his instagram so when i first met him in person one of the first things i said was i used to collect blue note too he had no idea what i was talking about
  yes thats lame but youre still a stuck up cunt     get over yourself
  to be honest a lot of older millennials are like this as well its only more evident with the new generation because of social media you cant expect better from people so why get mad
    i care because i want to be able to find people with genuine interests i can relate to and its annoying to have to filter through the facades and fakery if theyd just stop prentending to like cool stuff then id just ignore them altogether
  you could lead by example instead if you avoided being confrontational your qualities and genuine person would surface and they would surely appreciate it
  really well put and im sure im mostly being a purist and its making me come off as prententious i guess i should be glad that people are showing any interest at all in those things because the majority of the populace doesnt even know it exists i just dont like when ppl use things i care a lot about for personal vanity or self image its almost offensive because most of that stuff is stuff ive liked and never talked to anyone else about so when i find someone who knows im excited to share the interest only to realize its not really an interest of theirs but something theyre using to project an image of themselves its more disappointing than anything
  find a new group of friends what youre describing is definitely a millennial problem but there are quite a lot of them that arent hipsters wholl make you watch movies about eating shit youre older than them nobodys forcing you to hang out or date young people
  like the other anon said youre a pretentious retard i participate in online art communities yet still draw both digitally and with traditional mediums i guess its not real though
  my biggest problem is not being able to keep my mouth shut when someone acts that way ive always been critically and sometimes brutally honest with everyone and some people hate that because they perceive it as a personal attack and yeah i realize that it all boils down to a battle of whos a bigger stuck up prick than the other but i always come out on top so wheres the incentive to change if im winning every battle not looking like a dick isnt enough to me i just have to be right and thats all that matters i know its a personality flaw
  if you had a genuine interest yourself you would have already tracked down where other people with genuine interest congregate you hypocritical sperg
  thats not what i meant and you know it you have a real interest in art so you are warranted the acceptance in the community wheras someone who wants to look like an artist by painting kanye west lyrics over top prints of bob ross paintings doesnt deserve the community acceptance    genuine people will always be able to easily recognize the poseurs and should do their part in putting those people in their place so they dont ruin said communities
ive seen a girl with her bf outside a restaurant im about to go in she was questioning whether or not it would look cute on instagram whilst looking through the window he was like im hungry i dont care anymore     ive even noticed it with the type of men women are attracted to like how can attractiveness be something thats currently in fashion its crazy r
  i already have enough friends who share genuine interests its not a matter of making new ones rather than having to deal with seeing them and hearing about them all the time because thats who my gf is friends with
  step 1 date girl who has literally physically had less time to mature than you    step 2 complain about how shes less mature    step 3 claim that your girl is so mature for her age    congratulations you are a fucking living cliche if you want to know how your life will continue just watch any movie in which youre there
  i care because i want to be able to find people with genuine interests i can relate to and its annoying to have to filter through the facades and fakery  your literal words you fucking psycho imagine being so addicted to shitposting that you perform doublethink on yourself just win an argument
  you have people with genuine interests /your/ friends those are /her/ friends
people are enjoying these things the wrong way
  what i meant is i want to find people in her circle that i relate to the thing tgat annoys me is the fact that they seem like the people i grew up with but once you get to know them for just a little you realize thats not the case
  true as this is its something you have to deal with its no fun but it must be done
  this
  i just had a short hospital stay one young nurse seemed perplexed while watching fox news of alaska earthquake she said she doesnt understand or follow the news whatever that meant i think a lot of her confusion is too much sociai media and shit like cnn
why do women prefer bad boys
its not bad boys as much as emotionally/psychologically strong men who are assertive and know what they want    usually men fall on either side of the spectrum from being a cushy chubby soft cuck to a hardass alpha if forced to choose women would choose the later    however im a dude but i think i speak for most women when i say that most girls want someone kinda in between someone who is emotionally open and sensitive to a degree but has their shit together is confident and doesnt rely on them for their happiness    /thread btw
  when do the incels plan to stop cross boarding and stay on /pol/ and /r9k/
  this
  so why do good girls like bad guys i had this question for a real long time
bad boy or a sweet guy that treats here like a queen  ill admit im pretty much a niceguy by many peoples standards but even i know that treating a girl like a queen is weird and unnatural if your friends treated you like that youd be supremely uncomfortable
why is op so homosexual
  because opposites attract same reason bad girls want good guys and good guys want bad girls and bad guys want good girls
well whats your definition of a bad boy i assure you the only women who want guys who legitimately treat them like shit are probably crazy or really desperate i dont think i want a bad boy but im not attracted to a basedboy nice guy either i dont want to be worshipped and i dont want to wear the pants in a relationship ya feel im not gonna tolerate him treating me like scum but i do want someone who can jokingly mess with me and correct me without being afraid of hurting my feelings or something maybe youre just misinterpreting the bad boys or looking at the wrong women
  bad girls want good guys
  youre a fucking idiot    is tik tok memeing you kys
is this why charlottesville happened     oh shit women like bad men what if i were fucking evil what if i were a nazi that would make women wet right    no dipshits we dont like bad boys
  reported not an advice request
yeah we all like bad boys just walk up to the girl you like and call her a cunt it will work it has to
dont know some just do mostly when younger knew a girl in high school was in love with her so hot she could get older guys/ criminal types white though i never had a chance saw her a few years later waitressing at some coffee shop black eye  worn out looking again 20 years later reeking of booze in line buying beer at 8 am and looking almost unrecognizable horrific
we all know the answer stop asking
  being such an incel that even niceguys know youre a retard
    women arent attracted to bad boys theyre attracted to guys with confidence it just so happens that the bad boytypes tend to have more of that or at least they seem like they do
  whats this gif from
  if im such a fucking idiot why dont you prove me wrong stupid ass
misplaced sense of paternal protection bad boys provide a sense of security  she thinks they can protect her and her children because who is going to threaten you when youre with the top of the food chain
  top of the food chain would be a competent guy thats good at everything smart fit tall handsome earns good money etc not some bad boy
  add charismatic funny sociable to that list too
  this anon get it right girls started to hit on me the moment i gave 0 fucks about them and did whatever i please
  ironically a dude i know did something similar to this and it did in fact work wish i had the screenshots
this isnt /r9k/  you arent asking for advice  get the fuck out
  bawww
  im not bawwing ive been posting the same exact phrase multiple times a day because you faggots are ruining this board  moot gave /r9k/ back to you so you should leave  this website hates you
where can i meet a cute girl thats as geeky about video games and anime as me  i run into nothing but whores that i want nothing to do with   i genuinely want something serious and permanent   i make good money   attractive enough   so where can i find my dork of a soul mate
  waono
  find a girl  give her weed  let her watch konosuba or jojo or some shit  dump her when she gets too degenerete  repeat
  the internet or conventions
  not possible women arent as geeky as men youll never find a woman who is just a geeky man with a pussy
  i dont like online dating people front themselves differently on the internet   but youre onto something about the conventions 
conventions are your best bet if you want a high chance of meeting someone as nerdy as you
  he said not a whore anon
    hey if you want to find anywhere else that has a bigger amount of nerdy girls be my guest     also im sure you can spot a regular con goer vs a thot at a con
      i love the postive feedback from you guys i think ill head to the next convention in my range       lol
do you know of any trustworthy rc vendors located in europe  i am primarily interested in finding dpt dipt and 6apb but any vendor you know is helpful no matter what exactly they sell thanks in advance
just buy etizolam is it scheduled in europe yet
etizolam isnt scheduled here to my knowledge the thing is im not looking for benzodiazepines
  obviously smokey chem site
  i would try canadian sites extremely high quality and they offer stuff not found on european sites lysegi bcls and chemlogix
  what does that pill do
hmmm guess they are worth a shot  the shipping is probably gonna be expensive tho  also what are your thoughts on legalsilkroadnl 
i guess this is technically asking for advice but wouldnt it be better to post this in the science board
yeah ive been asking myself that before choosing to post here  dunno really i considered that im primarily asking for advice so
  ive never heard of them but i would try rt the only good threads there are rc vendors and rc sources and sometimes you get discount codes the shipping probably wouldnt be too bad canadian sites are extremely cheap like 14 usd for 250 mg 4acodmt
i forgot to mention one detail  in my country suspicious parcels that come from outside of europe tend to dissapear that is they keep the stuff for drug testing and conclude they shouldnt send it even if they are unscheduled  for example i bought bearblend from the us and it never arrived supposedly its still being tested they are taking their time since this is the fourth month  also ive been asked for a prescription when i ordered some modafinil from india  this is why id rather order from an european store
im not sure if i can trust all of the retailers listed at lizardlabseu  only tried 1plsdto very good experiences with them btw
to make a long story short i read a lot of hentai many times in a story they will lick each other and say oh so this is the taste of tsumasan and when my girlfriend and i made out for the first time i went down to suck on her pussy can i remove your panties she nodded yes so i put my tongue on her clitorous and said mmmm so this is your secret taste and then she pulled her pants up and said i think thats enough really nervously and left did i irredeemably f up
the only thing dumber than thinking real sex is like porn is thinking real sex is like hentai youre a fucking idiot op lol
you fucked up anon
  you gotta sense the mood anon and she may have been under the impression you were making light of it basically theres a time and a place and her hips should be moving on their own before the intimacy is casual enough for hentaitier banter
  oh my fucking god did this actually happen how did you not realize that hentai is basically 100 wrong for me it was obvious when i first saw characters saying no im gonna cum its a fantasy man dont do hentai with a real woman unless you agree to do some weird roleplay with hentai tropes beforehand
  girlfriend and i made out for the first time    how you gonna make out with her once and then immediately go to munch some carpet thats where you fucked up not whatever dumb shit you said
  going down on a girl on the first date  motherfucker what is wrong with you
my condolences
this girl made the right move jesus christ dude this is your secret taste fuck my sides are in orbit that is all kinds of creepy and gross
    it wasnt our first kiss but our second
i cringed
  oh well that changes nothing
  you might be able to salvage this if shell listen to your explanation about how and why youre a dumbass you clearly had an in given that she was dropping panties after 2 kisses
what are some alternative causes to joint/knuckle pain that isnt arthritis  i have a recurring dull pain in the knuckle of my right index finger it used to be a few times a year but its much more common now  its more often on days im really stressed out/anxious  there is no swelling just a dull pain and stiffness and its not nearly as often on my left index finger
  might just be some kind of old injury that never properly healed i cracked my tailbone as a kid it never really affected me but now if i sit or sleep wrong i have a limp    it might also be tendonitis do you often clench your hands when youre stressed or upset
    youve probably sprained it or pulled a tendon sometime in the past and the old injury acts up i busted a knee years back and every now and then it acts the same theres dull pain and stiffness especially if i do something strenuous or unusual with it a doctor said nothing can be about it now since its years old if the pain gets worse wrap it up to prevent movement for a while and it should pass regular movement helps with stiffness
    youre probably right about it being an old injury thanks
does it seem right for a normal guy to be in a relationship with a girl on the spectrum
depends on his sexuality if hes masculine enough he wouldnt be interested but on the spectrum could easily become trans male
op you mean the autism spectrum right
  which spectrum
i dont see why not its not like being autistic means youre a child
yes i mean the autism spectrum
i never liked social interaction ever i always felt uncomfortable in these situations and apart from that all these years being fucked over and made fun by people for no reason how can people stand eachother and here is another example  i had this cool friend that we used to talk about the girls we were dating at the time etc he is a cool guy dont get me wrong but all i feel for him these days is disgust and pitty more disgust tho
  just that you ask this question because you can not answer it yourself makes you social you want to share or acquire knowledge that alone makes you social because it makes you dependent of other views and opinions to achieve a goal or even a common goal which in turn can help others achieve theirs
  i dont want to be social nor do i need other people per say i see you guys more like an ai than human and if there is one thing ive learned is that people should be used not for a common goal but only your goal  and to acquire knowledge you dont need to talk to others there are plenty of books etc
  books  that were written by other people
humans arent social because im shy    lol
  /thread
  and yet here you are
youre a pseud  humans babies cant live alone in the wild they depend on their mothers and the group people need to be socialized to learn language how to use tools etc  the fact that you know the same language as me means youve been socialized if you know how to cook youve been socialized if you say youve learned something from a book someone has written that  humans are the definition of social animals    a nonsocial animal is something like a lizard which is born into the world alone and eats and survives by itself right away
  just because you dont want to be doesnt mean you arent stop acting so childish about this we all have a social instinct if we didnt society would never have formed you have that instinct too it just seems like your reward centers in your brain have associated people with danger or pain due to past experiences that sucks but youre still going to find yourself lonely and depressed without others
  shy  i never said i was shy i was very friendly to say the truth but always got treated like shit for no fucking reason other than appearence      you dont need others to be happy also even tho i learned english and other stuff from books does not means that i need people to me they are like tools so yes in a sense people are necessary but just enough to realize something nothing more
  and thats completely ok and people around you should be of that opinion as well that it is ok for you to not interact unless you want to and on your terms
  youre socializing right now by talking with us about things
  we can survive in elevators without killing or hurting one another you might not enjoy social interaction but youre at least able to socialize being able to go to the store and buy something with the help of other people is social its not social in the aspect that we think about because its a lot less than what we expect from a person but it is social on a basic level
  i dont see you as people per say more as it
    humans are social animals some humans are just mentally disabled in the social department such as yourself its called autism dont worry too much about it and do what you enjoy
  some humans are just mentally disabled in the social department such as yourself   its called autism
    what so funny anon you know im not wrong
  oh im not op i just kekd
itt op performs mental gymnastics trying to justify his special snowflake syndrome nothing to see here anons
  because historically humans have always been able to overcome difficulties through cooperation its the only reason weve evolved to our current state even now you depend on many people you dont even know because we all have our role in our society the fact that youre socially retarded doesnt mean anything youre the exception here not everyone else
ok so im a girl  not that hot dresses like a punkect and theres this dude on which i have a crush on that likes me back yesterday he got shitfaced drunk and confessed to me  the problem is that i cant be with him because whe are in the same class everyday for 6 hours and my good friends liked him too  i literally started crying because of it so im kind of fucked i dont want to say no to him but im forced to   how do i stop flirting with him and if it happens say no to him and not make it wierd     pic was me yesterday night
  that show looks so cool but ive never seen it jojos bizarre adventure whats it about i dont want to google it and get spoiled
  so youre saying no because your friends like him too
  your reasoning is stupid like straight rucking stupid    ask him out dumbass
  yeah theyre my good friends and between girls theres more of this taboo you cant go for your friends ex
  why didnt you mention hes your friends ex  also did all of you agree to this truth between all of you  how would she/they react  im only asking these questions to see if youre screwed or not
  you sound like youre 15 just ask him out jesus shit like this doesnt even matter

  holy red flags batman
is it normal that adderall makes you very tired and sluggish i switched from ritalin to adderall and ill take it and fall asleep
  maybe your bodys just exhausted from you practically overclocking your brain
  its not that much of a difference i take 40mg ir overclock is an understatement i feel like it mellows me out
  how long have you slept
  about 5 hours the last few nights ive just been too spaced out to actually fall asleep to be honest
  retard    tell the doctor theyll swap your meds
  i dont understand what theyd swap it with
  nigger      exam week for you too should be nice to finally get some quality sleep soon
  oh no i take these every day for years ive never not taken medication
  i miss ritalin
  im considering quitting it for a few days as i hear taking stimulants on poor sleep doesnt help
i took adderall at one point in my adult life for adhd and it worked in the veryshort term ever since i stopped ive had serious motivation problems it killed my motivation and it never came back   just be careful listen to your doctor     also im just going to point out adderall has a very high street price guys often get it for free from their health insurance then turn around and sell it on the street just a random fact i know
  ritalin  i hate that drug they put me on it as a kid for a few years and it stunted my growth i was so angry when my mother told me that
  i hear taking stimulants on poor sleep doesnt help  as someone who takes coffee and cigarettes more than food i can confirm i sleep better when i wean them off at least 4 hours before bed
  sorry to hear that for that one semester when i had my hands on it my mind finally shut the fuck up for once i felt at peace
  pharmacyfag on rotation here    methylphenidate is an addictive substance like    said your brain is tired    just like with caffiene when you put some into your body your body works to get it out of your body which is why you need more and more until youre drinking 12 cups a day just like with cocaine marijuana xanax and other abused drugs your sluggish tiredness fatigue is your body finding the right metabolism to get the substance out of you    my advice is to stop taking that shit half of the fucking drugs that psychiatrists perscribe is really bad for you but good for the corporations that pay them to perscribe you them    blah blah blah i cant focus  eat some fucking vegetables you pussy
  stop taking that shit  drink lots of water every day  sleep 8 hours of more every day  take creatine every day
  i eat fine actually i am completely fine now i think my dose is just too high i hear vyvanse is 100x better but i dont have insurance
hi   have you ever feel this feeling when you have all off work to do but you cant make it i have very big problem with laziness i just not feel approaching cunt i always distracted on my phone and other can you give me advice how you fight with laziness
your english is shit dawg   but what i always tell myself is the hardest part of getting something done is starting it if you can get started on something then finishing it should be easy
alright there /adv/  im in a but of a predicament   lets start at the beginning  be me  be 5th grade  have crush on grill  known her since i was like 6 lets call her p  at middle school tour day thing  see p  get happy  friend sees p  he knows her  oshitmp4  ff to on the bus later that day  tell my friend i like p  hes surprised but its cool  ff to now  be me  middle school  start to develop feeling for another grill  lets call her v  vs a solid 10/10 to me  ps about a 75  i havent lost feelings for p either  what should i do fellas
on friday i had my second date with a girl i met online so no prior contact to these the first date went great and i think she was interested i walked her home but i didnt hug or kiss her    the second date was similar but before parting she initiated a hug with me shes quite shy so it took me by surprise slightly    im just worried that my fear of initiating contact is going to make her lose interest or even think i just want to be friends is initiating a hug a good sign i feel like the most appropriate place to go in for a kiss is just before we part but theres a height difference which makes this tricky    basically what the fuck do i do next time
sorry escalation
  just do whatever comes naturally
  i cant do that being a sperg comes naturally
  initiated a hug  thats a good sign when you two are alone and the mood feels right like when sitting on the couch move your body in closer to her then after a short while turn to look at her and wait to see how she reacts if shes looking at you back without turning away go for the kiss
since ive only got an iphone i cant download the tumblr app but when i use the website i cannot access adult content at all and i dont know why i have both safe searches turned off im logged in i just dont understand and was hoping maybe someone here did
    i dont get it
  not using tumblr will unironically improve the quality of your life
  thanks anon
  this
maybe the gayness sensor in your iphone detected youre not gay enough to be allowed access to tumblr     but dont worry the hormone dispensers behind the microphone slot will change that soon enough because apple
ive wanted to be a toilet slave for quite some time now but im afraid of the possible negative effects on my health from consuming feces does anyone have any experience with this
guaranteed to get e coli
  it seems that this is practiced by a fairly decent sized group of people they cant all be getting sick every time
  wtf is wrong with you you abomination
    if you ever watch scat porn they all end up puking  its a natural reaction which keeps you safe  i cant imagine a massive 3 pound dump in your stomach can be healthy but if you puke it up afterwards there will be no harm     the greatest danger is not natural bacteria but diseases and parasites dont eat indian poo is what i am saying
  nothing at all whats wrong with you
  he isnt exaggerating literally everyone has active living e coli bacteria in their digestive system it is actually the reason hand washing after using the toilet is a thing     basically every food borne illness you can get is in the human intestine and the only thing stopping it from making you sick is that it cant travel back up into your stomach    if you ingest feces you are ruining that protection system it would be safer to eat animal shit every disease holding in your bowels is there because it thrives in humans human poop is the perfect storm of making you sick exactly because you are human too
  if you ever watch scat porn they all end up puking  i never really noticed anyone puking afterword
  common sense tells me this is the case but it makes me wonder how so many people practice this
polio enough said
  1 fake poop  2 precautionary measures such as powerful antibiotics and purging off screen and immediate and frequent doctor checkups after it is ingested  3 theyre getting sick as fuck and you have no idea because the incubation period for most diseases is 3 days to 2 weeks and the scat porn youre watching doesnt include that kind of follow up
  you want to eat shit    youwant to eat shit    no really you want to fucking eat shit
anyone have any first hand experiences
  im glad you are able to read
  try asking in one of gifs scat threads
  unfortunately you are unable to think
  good tip thanks
  a clever reply
  feces is full of bacteria such as ecoli and can spread a bunch of other nasty stuff one of the biggest causes of disease in human history is the improper handling of human waste ie shitting in the village water source shitting where you eat shitting and failing to wash your hands etc    do yourself a favor and live a normal life
  and immediate and frequent doctor checkups after it is ingested    cracking up imagining that doctor putting his head in his hands whenever the shit eater books a checkup
  they probs like about their job tell their doctor theyre a janitor or mental facility orderly or something that explains semi frequently accidentally possibly ingesting human shit
ask  
  hello john another accident at work  you wouldnt believe it doc i was cleaning the ladies bathroom and slipped on the wet floor fell face first into a clogged toilet and swallowed some feces  hmmm 3rd time in as many months isnt it  its a dangerous job doc
  not that im proud of entering a thread about eating shit but i feel obligated to say that most e coli in human intestines is commensal and nonpathogenic it wont hurt you    if the intestinal bacteria are not hurting the host they most likely will not hurt a new human host either though an unhealthy persons intestinal bacteria would most likely carry health problems over to a new host
  please dont defend the poop eater coliform bacteria can still cause severe problems when being transferred from one person to another even when not producing shiga this is currently a big concern in medicine where certain varieties of sanitation resistant ecoli can be transferred between patients through endoscopy equipment
  not here to shame your fetish op but fantasies may best stay fantasies sometimes apart from the obvious health reasons youre doing things to yourselves which are psychologically damaging dont fall for a sexpositive narrative where every fetish is supposedly ok in a controlled setting people get off to needles blood play racist abuse extreme physical abuse these fetishes normalize this behaviour and hurt you in unexpected ways
shit is literally human waste dump of all kind of toxic shit your body doesnt want  anon questions if your body wants to get rid of it
  kek
  but if you puke it up afterwards there will be no harm  frequent vomiting does cause its own issues like ruining your teeth and your esophagus
i will never understand this fetish
how do you deal with ghosting  heres my situation    hit it off super well with girl   set date for saturday   ghosts me for a day and says it was due to depression  spend a ton of time talking next day and do voice chat  suddenly dont hear from her for 3 days now    i see so many mixed opinions on this some say to cut your losses and move on since if they care they will reach out others say to go ahead and give them one last shot what do you all do    personally i was planning to send her a message just before saturday to see if shes still down to meet but at this point i feel like that would be pointless she hasnt removed me at all on the dating app we met on or on discord which we been talking through so i am conflicted
  cut your losses lots of fish in the sea
  due to depression  instant redflag if i ever saw one
    thats probably fair to do        it is but id be willing to put up with it depending on the severity
  no not the depression itself my gf is on meds too but her depression has practically never affected us in any way    the instant muh depression excuse is the real redflag here
  this isnt ghosting but a girl that changed her mind
  777  get used to being ghosted  women have more opinions on dating apps then men do just have another girl ready when one doesnt work out thats life of a man
  how do you deal with ghosting    when someone ghosts me ill simply deny their existence and move on i always assume they ghosted me for a reason and therefore should not take any more of my time    met this girl a while back at a bouldergym we had some nice talks and i mustered up the courage to ask her number for the first time in forever and got it sent her a text never got a reply never talked to her again    shes still at the same gym but i just dont engage with her at all she doesnt engage with me either so im sure she had her reasons not something for me to worry too much about neither should you
  how do you deal with ghosting  accept you fucked up somewhere  if you were ghosted its because you became boring or didnt progress things  if you are going to start talking to a woman you need a date night in mind and to be free for the next so many days/nights you then need to ask her out on a date night/for coffee/to an interesting date that will be an experience for her and take it from there  women are being bombarded with messages emojis and friend requests all of the time women can get bored of you and move on to the next chat until they get what they like
    we had one set but it was unfortunately a whole week out so i am not sure what to do in that situation because our schedules just didnt meet till then do i just leave things be till its date time
alright so basically pocrastination is ruining my lifei only sleep 2 hours each day becuase of it and feel like shit and get bad gradesi remember about a year ago i didnt pocrastinate for a semester and got really good grades but i just couldnt keep it up  pic unrelated
  halflife of college student 1 semester  catalysts to shorten halflife vidya fap 4chan
no advice gg
  stop being a faggot and just do it  get rid of the cancerous shit that you are doing now thats just wasting your time  vidya jacking off youtube etc
i have too much free time and i dont know how to spend it theres countless hobbies i could try but why bother i want to spend my time in a way that valuable that actually matters i dont see how i could do that reading writing learning an instrument painting drawing it all seems useless im doing well in college go on dates hang out with friends often go to the gym regularly so i feel like theres nothing i could really work on but i want to spend my time on something better than entertainment i just dont really value anything that much
  build industrial quality machinery like a solar array supercritical co2 extractor or a liquid nitrogen generator do the impossible right in your backyard
  help the poor
should i take a break from college if im currently failing and not confident in my ability to get my act together for the next semester
  do what you want youre already fucked you fell for the college meme
  yes  you also shouldnt do anything entertainment related until youve fixed yourself
i came in here to say yes even drop out its not worth it but looks like im not the only one sharing this opinion anymore   sweet
  youre already fucked you fell for the college meme  explain
  college is a load of bullshit
no but instead sell your consoles and whatever pc u use for gaming  time wasting    do your essays in the college library to not get distracted    go flip burgers for christmas break if you want motivation to study    read jordan peterson 12 rules helped me atleast
realize that you have only one life and your peers are gonna start graduating earlier than you since you are dicking around and wasting your time
  professor writing here    a break is a legitimate choice for some just be sure of two things    1 dont just disappear arrange with your college for a furlough or whatever they call it that will guarantee you reacceptance when you return    2 use the time constructively get counseling if you need it to make you fitter to return
at party  friends on about how i want to go pull girl was my friend  her friends overhear and tell her  conversation is really awkward  in physics next day  ranting to friend  he responds at 50000db  shes in my physics  she hears  would prefer to be friends than nothing
dont fit in anywhere in life or online    hate reddit  too normie for 4chan  too autistic for real life/facebook  what can i do 
  too normie for 4chan  and yet youre here gtfo
  is that a guy next to pepe
  to where     im only here because its the least shit out them all and as you proved i dont fit in
  perhaps you should take comfort in your friends rather than in groups or places
  friends have a life too though
  so youre telling me you guys never hang out together online or in person you never make time for one another
  what boards do you go to some are less autistic than others
  pick up a book retard
how well do you know yourself op what is defining your inability to fit in somewhere are your tastes so refined and delicate that it requires a level of elitism im sure there are groups for that online discords maybe are you just socially unprepared for interaction then an anonymous place like this should suit you how about youre unsure of what you like then a hobby based group may interest you on reddit tumblr twitter facebook instagram pinterest hate all of them because they are huge dumpster fires that shit up everything they touch then youre shit out of luck because iirc and chat rooms are dead web circles and link chains are dead interest based groups and clubs are dead everything niche strange and alluring that made the internet so wonderful is dead you might as well get used to it or take up a real hobby    tldr internet is fail and made of aids go outside and do something else
find a niche enough subreddit or just get yourself together and socialize more
  even if she is she is cute enough    and op dude just to not be entirely off topic here you are not too normie for this place you just think it because you still want to be accepted which is fine just dont let others run your life for you
  we are half normal  
how can you be a normie if you dont fit in  are you a nonvirgin if you are then you have no problems fitting in it seems
  dont fit in anywhere  only bricks fit in anon     dont aspire to be a brick aspire to be a cornerstone you stupid ass hoe
  discord shilling  i sincerely wish this could be moderated off the board echo chambers do nothing good for anyone
  this   fuck off were full normie fag
my best friend says she has lost any emotions due to heavily abusive and toxic relationship what can she do to regain emotions she says she feels numb and metioned a state of derealization     workout wont help and nothings filling her with anything atm idk what to do its really hard for her right now and i want to help in some way    shes beginning to isolate herself from everyone
  she should talk to a therapist theyre literally professionals whose job it is to help with this stuff
  unironically and possibly exclusively this
i went down this road not too long ago myself and i would say im not fully out of it yet but im better than i was    the isolation is a selfpreservation tactic and for those with heightened empathy its necessary to disconnect from others to understand what you are feeling without having to sort out what youre picking up off other people its easy to get lost in that isolation though and its easy to have these feelings impact your job and family life as well    what she needs to do is make sure she goes full no contact with her ex continued contact with her abusive ex will only further her current state i would even recommend removing all social media as it only heightens depression having peoples glossy fake and overlyproduced lives shoved down your throat this might seem counterintuitive to recovering from isolation but i believe it helped me a lot by not being on social media    what she needs to avoid doing is getting into another relationship while shes still recovering to try to ease the pain depression and feeling of isolation i attempted to push through and dated a few people i ended up running into another girl who was just like my abusive ex and i ripped myself open again in a 6 month whirlwind relationship which was something i would have never done in the past    what helped me was staying out of relationships taking time to meditate in nature and away from people and finding alan watts on youtube i am still single and even though my family pressures me to find someone im going to let things go where they may instead of forcing the issue    i hope this helps and hopefully your friend finds her peace
hi    i bought a plane ticket to go to canada at the end of the month i payed they sent me a confirmation but no eticket its just mentioned no ticket will be given to you or something similar  what does that mean will i have to pick up my ticket at the airport where i didnt go on a flight since i like like 14
  most likely you need to check in online 24hrs before the flight departs then you can print/load onto your phone a boarding pass
you need to check in online where did you buy it which company is it  they are tricky motherfuckers need to know when can you check in online
  i wish i was warned lol where will i do that on the website of the company
  exactly go to their main webpage and look for check in    youll need a full name and a code of some kind which you should have in your confirmation email punch that in and youll have options to obtain your passes
  i have all of this in front of me now thanks dude i had no idea i had to do that i feel better     heres a cool picture to thank you
which airline did you book with the airline directly or a third party regardless you should have a booking reference code that you can use to check on the airlines website
so my gf told me yesterday shes going somewhere and wont tell me where she said she cant text me either while shes gone    is that something i need to worry about should i at least try to text her something  dont wanna seem like a weirdo worrying
  checked    do you trust her  yes  then dont worry about it  no  then ask her where shes going firmly if she refuses to say break it off
  gf doesnt tell you where she is going or is located when you ask  wont be able to text you   you should worry about this this is a problem in itself aside from being a massive red flag and a sign that shes cheating
  wait a month afterwards and if she doesnt tell you go ahead and break up
  how long will she be gone she could be christmas shopping for you or something
         well technically i didnt ask her i didnt want her to think i was too nosy        i kinda think maybe its a school thing she has to go to
  shed be able to text while christmas shopping and any normal person would say im christmas shopping unless ops gf is buying him a fucking yacht from a yacht dealer inside of a faraday cage and cant give away information otherwise the surprise would be ruined shes cheating on him or doing something of a lesser degree
  asking about what someone will be up to   nosy  underage people arent allowed to post on 4channel
  its not nosy because saying youre doing something and wont be able to text during it is an interesting thing in itself
  what could that even mean
ops gf is getting deep dicked right now
  hey anon i will be gone tomorrow and wont be able to answer texts  oh what will you be doing
  in all likelihood this
  tyrone
  if its a school thing why is it such a big secret youre gf is testing you and finding how easy it is to cheat before you find out shes one step away from just fucking tyrone in your bed and waiting for you to come home jfc get some self respect anon
  well op did say he never asked her so she probably is just doing something dumb
  fair enough i see that now i hope for the best
im just a freaking worrier ive had some bad relationships in the past and im just constantly afraid im gonna fuck up     i think this chick is perfect too good for me
  if you said you havent asked her then ask her anon if she still wont budge then let her do what shes gonna do desu you cant stop her and trying to will make you look like a bitch only option  that point is start mentally breaking up w this girl so later it wont hurt as much its unfortunate but the reality still wish you the best tho
  shes gone already its too late to ask
  oh goddamn well in your shoes id just keep this scenario in mind and be on the lookout for more red flags dont let it consume you to the point you think everything is a red flag though just dont be an idiot and dont let yourself get walked all over like i saidself respect
  got it thanks m8
  sorry bro but she is cheating that is just too suspicious not to think she is cheating
  shes cheating enough said why the fuck else would she hide it if she were gonna surprise you she could just slide a little white lie but no she stands to be called on it so shes gonna say nothing everything you say can and will be used against you as they say    shes a thot just tell her youre done with the relationship and find a chick who isnt bpd
  ive had some bad relationships in the past    and you still havent learn your lesson is her pussy too good anon
  the grand canyon wasnt carved in a day
  seems too obvious
  no but a person only has to take a peek down to know its a bad fucken idea to jump  better turn of phrase is bad habits dont break overnight
the puffiest
  i could ask my girlfriend for her point of view in this but i promise if mine is dry and critical hers will be downright volatile and vindictive she hates when people play their partner in a relationship and i promise shell tell me thats what this is
you have put yourself in the situation you are in now    do you really think all the stress you are going through right now given your original thoughts and the comments here was worth not coming off as nosy to youre gf in any sense its perfectly acceptable for your partner to want to know where youre going if youre going out somewhere especially if they say they wont be able to text or call you while they are out i wouldnt be surprised if you not asking where shed be would come off as you not caring in the relationship if theres a possibility shes not cheating    also you still have not specified bow long shoes expected to be gone and not able to call     and id proba ly be on my toes after this i say make a few questions in youre head and ask her about where she went/why/with who and try to read her face for reactions if she seems ingenious or not    just think about it not asking 1 or 2 questions before because you think youll come off as nosy is causing you to worry and potentially have to ask a lot more questions so you dont worry and will actually make you look nosy youre in for some self conscious shit in the next week or so
  obviously cheating on you
she just logged onto xbox and wont answer me
  break up with her
  its probably christmas related due to the fact that ahe warned you ahead of time    if she was getting rooted out by some construction worker at the bar she would have told you she was going to a friends house or staying late at the office
  savage
  fuck it im down with that
she wont tell me where shes going  well i didnt ask her  you absolute pathetic pussy    she logged onto xbox  she didnt message me  its over bitch  this is hilarious
  i honest need this thank you sir i am garbage
  good now go talk to her dont panic if she doesnt answer just fucking ask her point blank later dont beat around the bush to not be nosy be fucking nosy
      tell my bf i have something to do and cant answer his texts   call over tyrone for big dicking  log into xbox  if je asks we what i have done i can use xbox as an excuse  i am a genius  get boned big time by bbc  i am sorry anon was so into the game i didnt see your message thehe  continue like normal  fucking retards stop being so gullible do you seriously think she plays xbox and cant answer you cause of that  lmao
friendly reminder to ignore all incel posts they belong in /r9k/ and everyone hates them
  im a sub 8 male
  my gf told me yesterday shes going somewhere and wont tell me where she said she cant text me either while shes gone  you can safely assume shes cheating on you a loyal girl would have had no problem telling you
  this but op just ignores these type of posts cause we clearly are mad incels and dont align with his ideal world
  best case scenario its a shit test and she wants you to put your foot down  worst case scenario she knows you are weak and is putting you in your place knowing she can do what she wants with no repercussions you cant see it as a trust exercise because thats not how one works she will only use it as a reason to do it more in the future    i was seeing a girl for over a year who was going out somewhere with a friend she never had an issue telling me where she was going before or who with i got the whole anon you dont trust me thing and she tried playing the victim i didnt back down i was ready to call it a day she told me anon ill give you a couple of hours to apologise to me a few hours later she called me in tears because she expected flowers and didnt get them  after that she told me that she will tell me where she is going and who with under the conditions that i dont argue or get angry i didnt agree she tearfully told me she was going to go to the cinema and dinner with a guy she worked with that friday at some time i told her to cancel the plans i intended to bin her leading up to that friday she was delaying cancelling those plans telling me it would cause problems at work and all sorts i told her to make plans with me instead she claimed she did  i went to her flat packed my things up and told her that she had an hour to convince me not to leave her she grovelled on her knees bawling her eyes out telling me she would do anything she sucked my dick still crying when i came i gave her another hour and kept fucking her holes until it was almost time for her date she thought i forgave her her hair was a mess she was sweaty her clothes were a mess on the floor and i came on her dress that she was going to wear then i told her enjoy your date with callum and binned her  she cried and i was told she went on the date with him he didnt fancy carrying on with a woman who had clearly been ravished
  she might be getting you a christmas gift but that doesnt make sense why she wouldnt be able to call or text   or maybe an interview but then it still doesnt make complete sense   its probably nothing good
  100 something bad no decent person in a relationship keeps her activity secret and then adds that he/she cant be reached thats a huge red flag
hey anon im going to study abroad in africa for a bit i wont have solid phone or internet access  while shitposting on 4chan huh ok sure whatever   halp my gf said she is leaving and cant phone me is she cheating
  lol
  you i like you anon
watch she had to go out of town for a funeral and you gave her shit
  when your gf goes someplace without you and tells you you cant come with her she is  a planning a surprise party for you  b fucking somebody else  probably the second one  this question is so common i feel this should be stickied
what qualifies someone as a good person
  they defy/overcome their cruel and selfish nature and try to be a positive influence on the world around them
  thats a matter of opinion people form these opinions based on their inborn dispositions and preferences as well as the society they grew up in and what situations they encountered in their lives    so asking the question as though people are intrinsically good or bad is totally fallicious watch this    a good person is someone whos willing to physically fight to defend their honor    a good person is someone who would never fight over something as petty as pride    both of these are equally valid in a vacuum in practice one set of values might be preferable to a specific individual or for individuals living in a specific time and place
depends on what you define as a good person    honestly these days i set a pretty low bar so long as someone is honest about who they are and what they value i think they are well on their way to becoming a genuine person and from there they wont need much more to hit the finish line
      these are all really good answers thank you
  what qualifies someone as a good person    godspeed
    this is kind of subjective    pretty sure hitler himself would call his own acts as good actions therefore he is a good person in his eyes
  thats why he was fucked up if someone finds themselves morally superior thats a massive red flag people can be morally superior in instances but not overall as human beings    of course were talking about your perception of hitler and not actual hitler
  dude people still discuss this you know thats called moral philosophy right     some people say its impossible to be a good person everyones various shades of bad selfish vain lazy what have you but through self interest it can manifest as good behavior then effectively youre a good person if you choose your actions based on whether theyll make you look good camus claimed its impossible to be good of this very reason    or theres you know mother theresa and gandhi and whatnot people who give it all up and really emphasize on the selfless aspect of becoming a moral person but theres people who maybe effectively do more good through a more measured selfpreserving strategy like say self made billionaires who donate to charity elon musk may be an example and does that mean theyre better people than mother theresa who knows    and theres people who just live their best life trying to listen to their conscience and who sleep sweeter when theyve remembered once or twice that day to step out of their own shoes and act from a slightlybroaderthannormal perspective
being a good person to me is always seeking to be better good is relative as long as i increase how good i am then i become more good according to me  seeking to do right by those around you learning to communicate and facilitate communication between people who might not get the chance sharing experience etc i seek to better the lives of those i hold dear
bruh you asked one of the hardest questions in philosophy try something easier next time
what is good
  if you have to ask you probably arent one  but it really is all relative  just the fact that youre asking about it makes you better than some people
  good is a word not everyone views it in the same way so as long as you dont specify your perception of good you will probably get wide variety of answers
  god is good
i struggle with this myself op  i used to be good i know it  but ive done too many bad things to consider myself to be good many people still think im good but im terrified of admitting to them some of the bad things ive done some people have only known me since ive been reformed for lack of a better term and ive only been good to them so of course they know me to be good but other people i have let down in ways i cant make up for and other people have been hurt in ways i cant undo  there are some specific awful events that i feel i could have done more to prevent the guilt is infinite and immeasurable perhaps it is some higher powers method of punishing me for previous sins committed or pushing me to the brink to try to break me and get me to act even worse towards the rest of the world i have no idea and still cant figure it out i am kind to almost all i work hard i prioritize other people constantly but that doesnt make me a good person i have selfish thoughts darkened fantasies but the few individuals i have confided in still love me and still think im good i dont worry about it much i just try to do good things and hope that that can make me better each day slowly i just try to do the right thing the good thing even when its hard and i dont want to sometimes i mess up and dont and sometimes i dont try as hard as i should but i dont think theres much more you can ask of yourself with expectations being realistic
  one of the hardest questions in philosophy  or one of the easiest
  selflessness and acting with the intent of doing positive things
  jeeze anon what did you do
hey /adv/ theres this cute girl ive correspondence with and we both have flirted scantly over through text and in person the only thing is i always have to initiate conversation otherwise conversation wont get anywhere is this worth pursuing
probably not
i need some help i called out sick from work yesterday because of an event i could not miss and was not actually sick i was told i needed a doctors note now today thinking i could go to the doctor getting a note so i called out again then i told my parents i have been sick and should go to the doctor as i cannot afford to go they said no i have been written up once if dont get a note it will happen again maybe even twice then i will be fired what should i do
find a place that doesnt have such shitty policies also ask to resign or quit before they fire you if they do that way you dont have fired on your resume
  idiot that puts fired on his rèsumé      urgent care or find a clinic for poor people and get a note financial 101 cost of a note is cheaper that total lost income by losing job you cannot afford not to get a note
  you know they can just ask previous employer if you were fired right whatre you in econ 101
  easy bro apply for a new job target sucks anyway
  only if you put it on your resume
  lol they probably already saw ops instagram of him at the concert just letting him dig a deeper grave
  yeah youre right lol
  i dont think hes going to get it man
  i would just go back to work act sick and tell them you dont have money to go to a doctor because they obviously dont pay you shit or offer benefits
  a doctors note for one absence is pretty strange    if your attendance is otherwise good i doubt anything will come of you telling them i didnt go to a doctor aside from you getting pulled into the directors office to get yelled hell i could fucking nocall noshow at my job for two whole days and not get canned    if theyve explicitly said theyre going to fire you unless you get that doctors note id honestly just go work somewhere else this story would raise most peoples eyebrows    i assume its a small employer most places have a system for requesting different days off and theyll give it to you if you file two weeks in advance what happened
  its not uncommon when the business doesnt believe youre sick       op go see urgent care tell them you had explosive diarrhea and to write a note saying that then eat a box of exlax washed down with coffee then splaterpaint every toilet in the place
  its not uncommon when the business doesnt believe youre sick   its uncommon for them to fire someone over one missed day its hard to find competent help and going through that whole newbie training thing where you have to take them by the hand for every fucking thing is costly and tedious even for lowskill work     if op is a serial absentee thats a different story
  op wrote i have been written up once if dont get a note it will happen again maybe even twice then i will be fired
do you get a set number of sick days if so really they should be yours to use for whatever you want if it really comes down to it say you needed to take a mental health day from stress or depression or something and were too embarassed to say say you thought that was allowed
im certain that i have bpd and i cant afford therapy  what do
  whatever you do dont date
  ya i gave up on that idea years ago i might be unstable but im not stupid
  why is that
  op here  if you look up what bpd implies anyone would agree that its practically impossible to have a meaningful relationship with it
the only cure to bpd is death
  my wife does too  it used to be really bad we almost divorced  the only thing we changed is doing daily bible study together  over the last couple of years it has slowly gotten better    thru the biblettb dot org is what we use he goes through the whole bible verse by verse half an hour a day every weekday you can listen there or download it
  thanks but im indifferent about religion its just not my thing
so a year ago i met this girl and after a couple months we started getting closer after a couple more months her boyfriend broke up with her and after a couple weeks she said that she had feelings for me and i said the same we started dating only for her to break up with me because she never got closure from her last relationship after that it was a bit up and down after a week she said that she wanted to be friends with benefits but after another week she said that she doesnt want anything to do with me romantically but she still wants me as a friend its been over a month now and shes all i can think about shes set on not dating anyone for a while and i dont know how to move on any advice on how to get over her
get new relationship also you fucked up somehow the closure thing is excuse
  women are like monkeys they dont let go of one branch until they have hold of another
  i was pretty supportive of her before and during the relationship so i dont know how i could have fucked up
  you didnt dont blame yourself its her problem ive known many girls that had a clear way out of bad relationships but chose to stay always thinking that they can change a bad situation take some pride in the fact that you did what was right dont obsess over this chick shes damaged could have daddy issues
  i dont know how to stop obsessing over her every time im alone or in silence memories start pouring in and i get so depressed i still want to be close to her but i feel like somethings missing now that the romantic part of our relationship is gone
  its rough anon i was in a 4 year on again off again with a stunning brunette think shania twain twin sister only better looking i was head over heels but disturbing patterns emerged she never once said i love you started disappearing   for months at a time no calls no visits i got super depressed and couldnt find anyone to take her place after about 2 years of this shit i got resentful towards her she could never commit to the next level of a relationship one day it came to a head and now looking back it was mostly her fear of commitment intimacy
hey anons ive recently decided to cut down my masturbation quite a bit i used to wank like 23 times a day to porn but now i wank once a week while ive noticed my erections are stronger i am also losing my stamina i recently hooked up with a girl and i came in like 5 minutes because im so sensitive what do i need to find a happy medium between these but i dont know how
are you circumcised
  no
  start taking supplements  zinc vitamin d3 folic acid fish oil and eat lots of protein  after your first 5 minutes round with your girl  just wait an hour and ask if she is ready for round 2 and you will last a long time  like an hour
  more foreplay and announce dry spells
  i never really thought about that i get enough protein but basically nothing else lol     thats kind of awkward how would i go about that
  fap before the fucks like a good 2 hours before and keep it unnutted
memory getting worse  doctors completely useless  exercise isnt helping    tell myself im going to do tasks  end up just standing around the room being distracted/confused  instantly forget what i was supposed to be doing  i cant take it anymore just fucking end me before my brain atrophies any more
  are you me i have the same issues i just learned not to give a duck and remember what makes me happy titties and 40s
  are you trying to combat old timers disease with kegels write everything down try to remember what you wrote down ten minutes ago rinse and repeat theres an exercise for you
  stop alcohol consumption  stop sugar consumption  get more sleep  be mindful
god i fucking feel like punching a wall and spiting god and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  my mom is the kindest person in my life and i dont want to see her go   how do you do it anons how do you deal with this fucking feeling of helplessness as your fucking mother slowly dies
  jesus man sorry about the shit news  i think the best advice i can give you is to spend as much time as possible with your mother just share her company and talk to her   create as many moments as you can with her   she will love having her son supporting her while she deals with her illness
there is no such thing as god you are either a narcissist who thinks they have the right to enslave everyone or you are too dumb to understand the universe maybe too lazy  either way fuck you and fuck your useless mom for raising you to be a fucking retard do us a favor and go read the endless proof that religion is a useless fucking cult brain surgeons dont use the magic schizo system they study the world and use that knowledge they do the surgery not god you dumb fucking nigger holy fuck look at how shitty this world is shut the fuck up and stop insulting the people who actually have to deal with this by trumping their entire existence by going hehe by the way me and my retarded cult are god and will burn you if you dont worship us
everyone dies and theyve been doing it for millions of years your turn is coming up too enjoy the little time you have dont be angry try to make her death as peaceful as possible right now you are not being peaceful and she would not like you to be like that
  the fuck is wrong with you   why are you pushing your own opinion when not asked for  the guy just asked for things to help him in this situation and here you come the big fucking fedora tipper spewing shit undemanded
ill pray for her right now im so sorry stay strong
i cried every day as i was coming home from seeing my dad i watched him waste away until he was nothing its by far the hardest thing ive ever had to deal with in my life my suggestion is have the talks you need to have if she has accepted her fate we wasted too much time trying different things to keep him around and being in denial cannabis is nice for cancer patients lots of love your way anon
  omg so sorry to hear that anon    can she be helped with surgery or chemo therapy    i really hope she survives    otherwise you have to accept it and cry it out  see it as a blessing where you can still be with her and tell and ask her anything you still want    also create memories together while you still can take her out to the forest for example for a walk    sorry anon i dont know how to deal with this either
  i remember that i was this kind of athiest too mean forceful retarded       anyway op you have to love your mother make great memories with her and make her last memories of this world the best of ones  just remember if she is suffering so badly that she cant even function as a human being then just pull the plug anon sounds harsh but u have to let go     take this scenario as the moment you become slightly independent and capable let ur god inspire you anon
  what kind of cancer does she have and what stage is it    if you can find a doctor or trial that will perform targeted immunotherapy on her cancer thats your best chance chemotherapy and radiation slash and burn treatment usually does more harm than good except for a few types of cancer that havent metastasized past a certain point and have a reasonable vascular structure where chemotherapy drugs can penetrate the cancerous tissue if she doesnt have one of these types of cancers where chemotherapy is highly effective dont bother with it unless you want to watch your mothers body and soul be destroyed by the medicine
  cancer is not necessarily a death sentence a lot of people survive it
  just cope vith video games and become a self hating degenerate shutin like i did when my mother died 3 years ago
  if i had to guess id say youre 15 i was pretty edgy back then when i realized i was atheist youll grow out of it some day i hope
i wish your mom and your familiy luck what type of cancer does she have and what stage
  le fedora is strong with this one
  edgy
hey anon my dad got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic in august its hard you should go to therapy it helps talk to your mother as well and just a heads up chemo makes people very angry and bitchy so dont take it personally the 3 days following chemo my dad is an ass
  and i focus elsewhere i work a lot and do school so i can avoid thinking of it
is it only broken for me i dont see pictures anymore
  hey buddy i think you got the wrong board    
  turn off adblock
this   apparently you blocked those dumb 4chan ads
sfw 4chan boards have moved to the 4channel domains adlocks mess with /adv/ you probably had settings to deal with it but the domain change bypassed your settings    just go change the settings to reflect the new domain
tell me about peter why does he wear the shirt
  its comfy i quess so why not
  wrong board
i have no idea which board would be best for this question so im gonna ask you guys    my apartment uses electric heaters pic related but they are horribly inefficient when the ambient air is below like 50 degrees well i live in the midwest so its like fucking 0 degrees outside and will be for the next several months    so ive been wondering would it be cheaper to run an electric oil heater instead of my wall unit ptacs for reference it cost me 140 to heat my apartment for november 170 total electric bill  30 average electric bill in months i dont use heat or a/c and even then my apartment was still cold
at party  friends on about how i want to go pull girl was my friend  her friends overhear and tell her  she stops talking to me  in chem next day  ranting to friend  he responds at 50000db  shes in my physics  she hears    pic me rn
  i really really like this thread
  dont give any fucks any person that stops talking because you have a crush ob them is not worth your time    relax you are the same person youve been
  ive seen this thread twice today i swear
hey /adv/  gf broke up with me    after a long relationship full of me mentally supporting her and dealing with her mental health and issues which destroyed and drained me on many levelsshe said to me that i destroyed her that im the cause of her issues and she never wants to see me again    i still love her and would fall on knees in front of her     this is my fourth long lasting relationship its not that i dont want to be alone     what should i do instead of killing myself
realize there is someone out there that will listen to your problems and love you and not use you as a therapist there is someone out there who will care about you the same way you care about them
  mentally ill girls are fucking horrible to be with you should be glad the nightmare is over and you should look for a sane person that makes you happy instead drop the samaritan act and think of yourself
  its easy to say it for you but i can remember the great times i spent with her i have never experienced such feelings and love in past relationships
/adv/ how do you find motivation for doing necessary but unpleasant things i have to study for an exam i have in 4 months and everyday that passes i am closer to it and more far away to passing it i feel very depressed because i cant concentrate for more than 10 minutes ive had a personal problem with which i am struggling and doesnt allow me to concentrate on what i really need after 10 minutes of reading i start browsing /b/ and i get even more depressed   how can i slap myself in the face and do what i must
  if you dont change this is all your life will be
i didnt get to study now i am watching a dumb show while drinking beer and whiskey    bump
  we agree but how to change it
  there is no perfect method that works for everyone google concentration/study methods and techniques try them all until you find something that works if nothing does try adderall if that doesnt work you should consider dropping out and taking up a trade
hi /adv/    i am in a very weird situation    i am studying to become a doctor however i am a loner and being bullied by the faculty    i am almost finished but i have to do these 2 mandatory courses where i get subjectively judged by people in order to pass  i cant pass it    its very subjective they basically have to like you for you to pass it    i have been blacklisted by my faculty i think  the headmaster and a teacher have also said earlier that i was on their watch list and that i should be very careful  there are also rumors that if they dont like you they will make sure you quit i know another guy who also gets bullied    once a week there is a mandatory meeting where we discuss patients and there is always a psychologist there too  however i noticed she started to watch me and make notes  when i said a friendly hi to her in the hallway later she just ignored me    its a very uncomfortable situation where i have to pretend everything is fine and i am happy however they are watching me like hawks  and when i get uncomfortable they will say i am paranoid and that i am crazy there is a lot of gossip and backstabbing going on too    they try to bully me out i think they are driving me nuts at least    i called a lawyer but a lawyer is very expensive and the lawyer said as free advice if you dont have proof we cant do anything for you in court  so i am basically subjected to their power over me    they are very smart people i dont know how to deal with them    for now i cant pass they will just say i am not good enough and letting me fail until i give up  but i cant give up because my study loan is sky high    how do i deal with this corruption
  you are not being bullied what you call subjective judgment is actually professional assessment of your suitability to be a doctor this may be a matter of intellect temperament attitude or something else    being a doctor involves more than memorizing a lot of data part of the job of a faculty is to help those who arent really destined to succeed discover that as early as possible    i suggest you talk to a friendly professor dont be paranoid just say can you tell me if i have any major weaknesses as a prospective doctor
  thank you i will do that as soon as possible    because i am driving myself insane with these doubts
  partially this     however       there are bureaucratic establishments if you do meet the goal for what theyre looking for then they wont accept you     i have similar issues with people and ive been ostracized for it
a girl asked me for relationship advice again ive never had a girlfriend why does this keep happening
  probably because for her you look smart and like a good friend  i suffer with that too anon ur not alone
  i guess its good to know that people look to me for wisdom i guess idk shes nice enough but shes got a weird history that she doesnt mind sharing with everyone id never date her
why do people tell me they care about me and wish for the best for me give me hope that maybe i can be happy for a few years but then turn around and break every promise they made me of being there for me  im right now just crying it all out  so ill feel better later  but why do people do this  they tell me they care and they will be there for me to tell them everything i want to let out and i did i told them everything  lost one friend on my birthday lost the other a week later now i lost my last friend  what the fuck did i do  can someone please tell me  i never ask anything from them im always listening to them when they feel horrible i try my best to help them and they thanked me everytime i talked to them but why this  i trusted them all of them and now this  before someone tells me i misinterpreted their messages heres what some of them told me why didnt you tell me you had depression why didnt you talk to me and stop hating yourself you just made a few bad choices in life  this is fucking why i hate myself you fucking liars i fucking trusted all of you and you all left me when i needed you the most you dirty fucking liars  dont tell me you care for me  can someone please tell me how i can get over this i cant eat sleep or even fucking stay awake i dont feel normal i feel dizzy and the pit in my stomach is hurting soo much
  sounds like youre a baby and want everyone to be as involved as your mommy was when you were in diapers you were supposed to be raised to be somewhat selfsufficient emotionally by now but youre grasping at peoples legs for nurturing and care they expect you to be somewhat emotionally stable but youre not you still need a parent so their normal response of getting weirded out by your clamors for a toddlers level of emotional support is like youre being stabbed in the back again and again     rough
  lost one friend on my birthday lost the other a week later now i lost my last friend  how though      trash post
  all i did was ask them i wanted to talk to them because my parents dont give a fuck about me my brother and sister dont care ive even told them to not care about me and theyve told me that they will care no matter what i keep quiet of all my problems except when they ask but this time i needed them just this once i decided to reach out for them and they denied me  im always talking to them and about their problems and i dont regret it  just dont tell me that you care about me and then get mad at me because they find me drunk  i like keeping to myself but this one time is different
  friend stopped talking to me then i tried talking to my other friend who told me to talk to her whenever i want she did the same  its been a month without talking to both of them  now this friend is doing the same thing now   and i dont know why thats why im crying and angry
  then get mad at me because they find me drunk  so something specific happened do they ignore your attempts to contract them
  yes two of them ignored me  but the other one just told me to shut up and to stop thinking about my other two friends and so i did  but now that same friend is now ignoring me
  fuck i dont know did you say something when you got drunk did you talk about your issues 24/7 lately    sounds like they were never your close friends they just said the whole im there for you crap as a polite phrase people lose friends sometimes especially when theyre looking for emotional support you managed to lose three of them somehow fuck it this is why i stopped trusting and relying on people    selfpity wont get you anywhere consider finding a therapist for your issues or read up on stoicism and learn to rely on yourself only
  i kept apologizing for being drunk when she found me drunk  i never talk to them about my issues unless they ask me but when it was birthday i reached out to them so i could talk about my friend who was ignoring me but i ended up losing both of them    but why make me feel like i was finally loved and cared about  thats why im crying everything meant nothing to them but i did feel loved and i thanked them for it  but all of that flies out the door in one second  i told them my greatest fear is being alone again and it happened again  maybe being alone isnt that bad it just hurts knowing i was nothing to them
  i know man
  thank you for at least talking to me anon i will check the whole being self reliant  this wont happen again
  caring for someone is a feeling not a contractual obligation they probably meant it at the moment    i think people are selfless mainly when they can afford it young adults these days are mostly exhausted and poor
  if that was the case why didnt they ever contact me again
  im not sure you understood the people who say they love you and everything at least half mean it if not all down the road it becomes inconvenient for them to maintain the relationship and their feelings go away its a shallow world like that    i try not to blame the people who are gone too much because that would be hypocritical relationships are 50/50 so the outcome will always be largely dictated by what we put in    most people in their early 20s in our culture are exhausted and poor just trying to get by so its not like selfless deeds will flow through them as though they are saints
  sorry everything is blurry and im dizzy from all the crying  i understand what you mean maybe thats what happened here and i guess it wasnt meant to be
  you do realize that all friendships are circumstantial and conditional like all relationships
  you tend to ignore everything when people tell you they care for you and also tell you that they want to be part of your life  its what my second friend told me and i took the bait
  i guess it just wasnt meant to be  thats a very mature take anon youll make it through this
  as long as your friends like hanging out with you because they feel good around you thats all that matters once they stop feeling like that thats when youre fucked
  thank you anon
  he has his own needs and aspects to his life besides his relationship with you im not saying him ditching you was right or anything im just saying there probably was a valid reason people need to put themselves first if they want to meet all of their material life goals including basic goals such as having food and a roof overhead
  yeah maybe they got bored of me i dont talk much maybe they found someone else
  i dont talk much either anon i guess we share the same fate
  but why not let me know  none of them were like this they were kind to me and i tried my best to comfort them when they felt lonely or defeated  i even got my friend to go out with another friend of his by telling him what to do he was soo happy when he was telling me how he and his friend were hanging out  maybe thats why he left me  yeah youre right theyre starting their lives and i cant hold them back  i wish them the best but this pain isnt going away
  dont worry anon you can sit next to me open a cold one or just lay back and get high
  specifically what happened did you just fall out of touch with these people without incident
  yup i tried contacting my first friend because this was a on going thing she would flat out ignore my messages and not respond even after it said she read them she was the only person who knew my birthday but she didnt tell me anything next thing you know she blocks me my second friend i tried contacting her sent her three messages because i wanted her to give me advice on how to save my other friend from leaving me she never responded and she read the messages hasnt contacted me since this friend who left me today hes been having a few problems in his life hes also let out some of his anger out on me but i would always ignore it because i didnt want to anger him further but now hes doing the same of ignoring my messages
  oh this whole thing sounds really weird to me try talking to someone about it in real life theyll have more context and be more likely to make heads or tails of this situation    dont ask a basic bitch who will blow you off with some short response ask someone more contemplative analytical and helpful
  i think i should just forget this whole situation and move on  even if i get to talk to someone about this what good will that do  i wont get my friends back and even if i did would it be the same as it once was  i know im in 4chan in the advice board but after talking with you guys this whole situation was fucked from the beginning and im starting to accept it
  it sounds like you might have some kind of social or emotional problem but i cant really infer that based on a 4chan thread if youre a pretty girl or a genuinely nice person i guess that could mitigate some of the problem but it is concerning to see a social breakdown like this occuring    not to make you feel bad or anything it seems like you know that bygones are bygones with these specific people
  truth is im a introverte/sociopath i get too attached to people because when i was young no one wanted me so anyone who was really nice to me i would hold them closer then anyone else when i met my second friend she made me feel real emotions and i finally cried not of anger or pain but of joy i never felt anything like that before so when i lost her i couldnt believe it that she made me keep promises and tell me the things i feel was progress on making myself a better person but none of that matters now because i now feel like my old self again  i really dont want to be who i once was i couldnt feel anything but she managed to and she let me go
  you could use some counseling and a more modern take on your problem the whole sociopath/psychopath thing is a mythos without a lot of basis in concrete fact    the dsm 5 does have antisocial personality disorder which is more about violating peoples rights and societys rules    either way your story is relatable to me my childhood was dysfunctional and i became very socially unskilled and detached from people as a result i had the same experience where i finally made a close friend in this case it was a girlfriend and then insanity ensued for a few years after that i desperately sought new people to fill the void and then had fallings out with them sort of like what youre having now    counseling helped me a ton its where i learned about how illogical my family wad and how illogically i was acting when i went all psycho about the ex and so on in therapy i learned that im not a bad person so much as someone who needs to learn to socialize and relate to other people properly
    by the way i get what youre saying when you say  i met my second friend she made me feel real emotions and i finally cried not of anger or pain but of joy i never felt anything like that before  i relate to that its like being in a desert and finding an oasis its the happiest possible feeling
  yeah   that sounds great right now maybe when i get enough money ill go get counseling and getting to understand others  if i was younger like 18 i would tell you everything i have done like accomplishments the things i did to people and animals  now i regret everything i guess this is karma for making others feel like shit    its the best feeling thats what made me care for others i wanted to share it with others because i know how it feels to be alone and have no one to talk to
  affording therapy for personality  same    have a good night anon and dont give up
  i wont   you do the same and goodnight
  because they know that youll buy the lie stop believing them damnit
my current gf is incredibly insecure     if i say her work is good shell freak out and ask why i didnt say a better word than good if i say i like her ass shell say what about face and personality etc she always says she doesnt know if i wanna see her or if im just seeing her to be nice to her     and often times shell say something is okay so we do it and then after she says she didnt want that to happen and that its m fault for not intuitively realizing this    i kinda wanna break up because of this its been going on for a long time and the glass is running over what can i do/say to make her fucking stop
  sounds like a ticking timebomb if you ask me mate  dont want to be rude but has she considered seeing a psychiatrist
  thats a crazy thing to suggest shed go nuts    how do i break up without getting killed tho
  kill her first duh
just tell her instead of a bunch of starngers on a japanese styled imageboard
  what can i do/say to make her fucking stop    you dont you cant fix other people humans dont work that way    you could try having an adult conversation if that cant happen join the merchant marine and see the world
  been there done that got as the t shirt 4 years of it too    i would say try having an adult conversation about it but past experience has shown that it doesnt work with these sorts of people its true you cant change them    they might understand you and listen once but will quickly revert back to the way they were and disregard everything you talked about    sorry for the negativity but your situation just sounds too familiar
  okay what can i say to break up     she said she only wants reassurance that i want to be with her but it really is getting out of hand and now shes mad at me as if she is the victim
  youre broken as a person and im done with your shit later bitch

one of my only friends i talk to is pretty depressed and is addicted to xanax just a couple of hours ago he said he used to cut himself and he stopped because he didnt feel like doing it after discovering xanax he is getting really bad grades because of the pills i really want to help him but dont know how and am scared that hes going to cut himself again     i really dont know what to do anons
will dating someone help fill the gaping emotional void i have    i feel like a jumble of other peoples desires and what people want to see me as and im trying to be my own person and break free from that but i also feel more and more empty as time goes on
  yeah itll help
dating someone can help assuming youre both compatible happy together problem solve well etc but it wont fix it youre also going to have a much harder time finding someone to date if you expect them to be a solution for your life people can tell when you want them to fix a problem and not really for them and its very offputting its also not fair to someone else to pile all your expectations onto them    it sucks but the best way to find happiness is to make it yourself relationships also come easier that way if youre struggling you should see if you can get professional help as that is more likely to make a noticeable difference soon
what youre suggesting is using someone as an emotional crutch youre basically setting yourself up to be dependent and increasingly so as time goes on  it might help it might not but your baggage will put a strain on a relationship you enjoy or can cause you to be ineffective in getting out of a relationship you hate or trying to improve either of the two  we are all a jumble of peoples desires and influences and thats okay the difference you need to make though is that your desires your interpretations of these ideas and your sense of self should come first  what might help with your sense of self can be friends family hiking biking nature music traveling excercise and whatever odd hobbies you find in between  take some time to go to a relaxing place take a walk and think about who you are treat yourself to some beauty emptiness is filled with stuff of meaning try to do that in as healthy a fashion as you can  if what you desire is human company thats reasonable and the relationship two people can form can be quite awesome but you have to be very careful about deciding what function you want from them  take the time to appreciate stuff op time tells all
the growing realization of how superficial every single relationship i have doesnt help either it feels like ive got nobody  i also suppose that i hadnt thought of how i would be just making some poor girl into a crutch i have thought of that with friends though maybe thats why i just internalize it all i cant just throw my baggage onto people for no reason theyve their own lives to worry about
  there is a healthy balance between shoving everything down and dumping everything on other people you can be emotionally available honest and communicative with other people and not bulldoze them just be accommodating and supportive of them in return and consider their needs as well as yours you have value too
can i get any kind of work with a abusgr is it even a degree have i wasted 3 years of my life because i didnt research college beforehand i just want to work already
become study partners with this girl in my psych class  starts talking to me casually between classes  ask me if i have a gf  say no  suggests we grab lunch after school  lunch goes great and tells me she likes me  start talking more and more  tells me she wants to date but shes super religious and is a virgin  tell her it doesnt bother me  says before we officially become bf/gf i need to come to church with her and be on good terms with her parents  go to church with her and meet her parents and they take us out for dinner  tells me her parents really liked me but they suggest we keep going to church before we do any serious dating  do that for 2 months and still will only let me kiss her on the cheeks and meet her at church or at starbucks but talks about us getting married and having kids  finally agrees to go on a date but halfway thru eating she tells me her parents suggest its too fast to start dating and we are just close friends check comes from the bill and her card declines and i pay for both of us  stop talking for a couple days and messages me out of the blue that she dreamt about us moving in together    im trying to be patient but am i wrong for just letting this go one minute she acts like we are dating then goes cold on me very confused
  uhmmm talk to her she likes you but her parents are controlling her dont shit talk her parents
  the parents seem to be holding her back dont do anything rash and make sure you dont let them control you as well as her should work out if you are older but if your younger then you might wanna call it off since her parents will be doting her till shes an adult even then could still control her
  follow up very nice girl though shes a keeper
  this whole thing sounds pretty retarded yeah its nice having a girl initiate a relationship with you and all but she sounds way overlyreliant on her parents like how old are the two of you and why would you be okay having a relationship where her parents have so much control over it and also youve been seeing this girl for 2 months and shes already talking about moving in and getting married and shes broke get up outta that my guy
  religions have been doing stupid shit to keep their adherents apart for hundreds of years anon if god can make her like you then she should be good enough with that and her parents can fuck off for trying to interfere in his plan to get you laid
im really not looking forward to christmas this year my mother passed away on new years day this year so this will be the first christmas without her    i really dont want to think about christmas but its been borderline inescapable since around july all my friends are really excited for it they all seem to be very festive people i dont want to be a cunt and try and police what they talk about i like hearing my friends talk about the stuff theyre looking forward to but realizing its now december and christmas is less than a month away has hit me like a ton of bricks    yesterday i felt fine i went out to walk the dog with my dad i made lunch i listened to some music with my older brother and i felt fine but later in the evening i noticed the date and it was just this big wave of depression didnt feel like doing anything tried to drink it away and then just felt guilty and stupid for doing that ended up just going to sleep so i wouldnt have to deal with it    tomorrow im supposed to be taking my little brother to see the grinch im really not sure why i didnt think of it before but its only just occurred to me that maybe thats not a good idea because its more christmas i cant really cancel though    i know this is fucking dumb but does anyone have some ideas for how i can get through this time i dont want to bum my friends out by being mopey and i want to try and make christmas day as positive as i can for my family i know im going to have more festive activities coming up my friends want to go to some christmas markets and we always get together in the local pub at some point to do gifts and i just need to know i can pull through them without being a little bitch    tldr  im a scrooge because depression how do i stop
hey anoni really cant help 100 you cause i never experience sucha loss imo you should try to gather your family together and celebrate itwatch some moviesplay some gamesgo to places enjoy life as much as u can im sure your mother would have liked that  pd i hate christmas but heythere is no reason to let other enjoy itand help them to enjoy it  best regards from me
i know the feeling my little sister died and her birth day is really close to halloween and she always loved halloween so far i havent found anything that works to make it easier for my family or i good luck man wish the best for you and your family
    i agree with this anon how is your relationship/communication with your family im sure they must have at least similar feelings like this anon said i think it is worth trying to enjoy the holiday as your mother would want but be honest with them about your feelings    as for your friends are they capable of actually being there for you if you need it if so try and have a good time with them if you can and be honest with them if you just cant this year you should be able to lean on those close to you in the event of a death of a parent and you shouldnt feel guilty for it if you do have to    but then again if theyre not the kind of friends that can be leaned on fake it til you make it or just tell them youre sick and skip out on the social occasions this time or spend more time with your family instead of them    im so sorry for your loss op thinking about you
ive been talking to a 9/10 since summer and we text daily we go to different schools and im usually really busy so i dont really hang out with her in person as much as id like i also talk to her friend when im bored but its usually about her since i told her i liked her friend and she was going to help me and make sure if i asked her i would get a yes recently i talked to the friend and she said that the 9/10 wasnt interested in me anymore and wanted to keep me in the friendzone im wondering if its possible that the friend was trying to deter me from asking the 9/10 out and wanted me to go after her instead she mentioned that the 9/10 didnt want her to meet me out of fear that the friend would take me away from her as well as suggesting that i take her to the dance instead of the 9/10 is this actually feasible or am i just overthinking it
i want to buy weed butt im autistic as fuck
tfw your friend is basically a female sociopath who does tons of nice things / puts on a normal happy facade only because she finds it mildly interesting and is scared shitless of going to hell / being alone and feels nothing for other people  tfw when shes hot and kind of a slut but you know if you dated her shed get bored and cheat / throw you away within a few months and youre a pretty romantic person  tfw you forgo all dating shit and put tons of care and platonic love into her because you know she needs people who care about her and an actual family because her own is total shit and the ones who made her like this  tfw all she wants is to feel something for people but she just cant and is terrified of how alone she will be if this continues  tfw afraid you may start having romantic feelings for her    what do
having friends  see theres your problem
how do i deal with a professor that wont make a single concession of time to help me improve my understanding of the subject matter math professors in this state make near a 100k but mine refuses to even answer a yes or no question and talks down to me every time i go to her office how the do i deal with this i have to take this class so i can eventually take physical chemistry
  is there a tutorial lab or office at the uni     maybe voice your complaints to their boss get a shirt printed that says students are your customers and wear it to their class or office visit
college  talks down to me  her  youve run into a cunt no action you take will change that learn on your own or with classmates pass the test and move on
  i do agree that i have indeed run into a cunt my final is on the 14th how many hours a day should i set aside to try and brute force study with the book i am thinking an hour and half    i would probably need to go to the department head to complain but i have the distinct feeling she wouldnt give a fuck either
  write a letter be sure to put cc university president and send them one as well never hurts to complain
  yeah ill be sure to write and make some suggestions bitching and moaning to the right people can make a change
  do it after you have received your grade  if you send an email to your female department head your complaint will not be treated anonymously despite any promises you receive to the contrary    out of three female colleagues of mine being called out for shit worse than yours only one got sacked in all cases they sought retribution on the complaining students
  thats probably a good idea considering this class is based of three tests and a portfolio it would be best to avoid burning bridges before grades
i want to become and teacher and have been wanting for almost ten years now  im at my second year of uni actually fourth year but i repeated a few times because of health issues and should be getting my teaching license by the end of 2020    issue is lately ive been a total wreck during oral presentations its like a huge snowball effect all it takes is for me to stutter once or my voice to waver a little or someone to laugh at something unrelated and i start having panic attacks stuttering and overall looking like an ass  which is really weird because up until that point ive always been a okayish public speaker and i am not the shy introverted afraid of what other people think type its only in this particular situation that i start uncontrollably panicking to the surprise of my friends in the class    tldr how can i train my public speaking skill 
  have you taken any public speaking courses
  no should i look for an online one since i assume it could be free/cheaper or should i find one around my city 
im overwhelmed by thoughts of suicide every waking moment is torment do i install league of legends and become a videogame zombie again its hard to do things like read a book i cant concentrate
  i would recommended doing soul searching in religion to find your purpose dont kill yourself man it is only negative to where you are in life right now
  ive been firmly an atheist since i was a child
get some vitamin d3 omega 3 is good too
  i would recommended doing soul searching in religion  what a fucking shit board
  sad since paranormal phenomenon has occurred since the dawn of history and it either points toward aliens / gods being real or yahweh the christian god being real
suicide isnt an option  it hurts like hell  its set aside for the famous  a little suicide sells
  personally i dont think anyone can make that better for you on here the answer is inside you
  like what
  yeah its a bunch of christ fags and jews trying to convert people  we should start burning down churches to convert them to atheism
i applied to a bunch of jobs in my field but the only ones interested in an interview are ones that i dont feel qualified for    is there a good way to fake it through an interview or should i just not even bother preparing
there are people who would actually take advice from any of you retards
  this is the nicest board on 4chan
  might aswell call yourself the tallest midget
hey some of the advices actually worked for me
honestly this use to be one of the best boards before the /r9k/ incel rejects fucked it up    its beyond repair now
  eh its not much worse than /ck/ desu      underrated
  hasnt this place always been filled with losers wanting dating advice and whining about women being shallow/whores/etc or whatever    lol but honestly this board seems about as well adjusted as a 4chan board could be
  dating advice isnt the problem the shitty incel answers are
  puas are basically the same as incels and i feel like theyve been here forever
yeah its always felt like most people here are teenagers from reddit with no life experience
  le incel boogeyman  jfc if theres one word that deserves to be filtered its this one
  im successful with women yet often when i give real advice i am criticized for being an incel   i dont get it    its like the people who dont know how to do relationships are the most pompous

  can anyone explain to me what kind of a board /r9k/ is i keep hearing people bashing it and i dont know why
i like those vertical lines where all the spaces line up
  its a board for robots ie complete social outcasts to have a community  youd think they would engage in some sort of camaraderie but all they do is bitch about how the world mostly women has done them wrong basically full blown narcissists but instead of thinking the world only exists to please them it only exists to make them unhappy
  its a board for robots ie complete social outcasts to have a community  i would argue that /adv/ is more like that i see a lot of people on here just lonely and looking for friends which theres nothing wrong with we all try to help each other here and were pretty good at calling out /r9k/ shitters at least from my experience
  there are solid advice among a shit a shit
  kek
  kek times two good thread     what would an incel pua be like tripple kek lovin it here
  feel free to go back to 9gag if it bothers you that much
10 of replies on this board contain good advice
i think wed all be surprised at where we all come from and the experiences weve had theres a lot of bait and bullshit posted on this board but theres occasionally some actual advice that can be given
stfu incel
  80 of statistics are made up on the spot
he doesnt know that /adv/ is a containment board
only incels give shit advice the fact youre reading this means youre an incel waiting for me to fix your life when you should get off your ass and work for a change
  kek
all these incels mad people are calling them out  this isnt your board moot literally gave you back your board because nobody likes you and so youd leave us alone     advice is a good board just be on the lookout for buzzwords and topics   chad   cuck/bbc   roastie   anything relating to rape fantasies   anyone telling you to cheat   anyone larping as very successful with women   anyone coming into a thread just to insult someone putting effort into their life and not giving helpful advice   anyone whos first response is theyre cheating on you with no advice or other info   never believe a woman      moot brought back /r9k/ literally to keep you mongoloids out nobody likes you or wants you here your advice is useless and all you do is project
everytime it seems like a girl likes me i always ruin it anyone have any advice on this
  be gay
me and a friend are going to do shrooms its both of our first times and we are gonna do 2gs each with no trip sitter he wants to lemon tek it im not sure      could i take 1g lemon teked then see how i feel then take the other gram normally or tek it as well
27 yo single guy  very introverted  friends want me to hook up with one if their friends  she is very plain kind of fat not good skin 3 years older than me but theres nothing wrong with her personality     its going to sound like i think a lot of myself but i think i look pretty good im /fit/ take care of myself im financial well off the only thing wrong with me is my introversion     id like a gf bit dont feel like im getting old but looking at my friends im the only one not maried and 3/4ths already have kids so maybe i just have peter pan syndrom    do i try it with her do i have the right to say that she doesnt fit my standards when im a virgin
i am 6 years younger and also virgin i dont have experience but i think you should like how the girl looks i am not saying you should only date models but there are a lot average looking girls that if they are your type and have great personality can be the prettiest women you ever meet personally i would hate the feeling of constant nagging in my head that i am settling with someone just for the sake of settling with someone but i am younger than you and may change opinions when i am older or maybe i am destined to stay lonely forever
27 yo virgin  having standards  just go out with her try it out maybe shes a freak and youll hit something off you dont have to marry her so dont jump to that so quickly
  you cant imply when the thing you are meme arrowing is part of a question because the guy isnt implying it he is asking if its like that or not
is there harm on going on a date you could end up liking each other have you been on a lot of dates if not it seems like an opportunity to practice if you have no interest whatsoever then still pass theres no rush to marriage though man one step at a time
im a senior in high school am 18 and this girl i was mildly interested in acted really close to me at a football game despite me being a shy and depressed diagnosed guy at the game we held hands and sat in the bleachers together alone i was somewhat convinced she was into me at that point and i kept talking to her at school after that day she occasionally shows a lot of interest in me and other times she treats me like a close friend she does tease me and i tease her back but only when she seems interested in me the issue with me just going for it and asking her out is that according to friends rumors shes been known to lead on other guys and she is a little flirty with most dudes i know this sounds like a stereotypical high school love story but if i can please get some good advice thatd be great
  both
  what
  well man you wont know till you ask what do you have to lose really godspeed op
i know exactly the kind of girl youre talking about even if she is somewhat interested in you now even if she does start dating you it will only last a couple months as shell get bored and want more flirty excitement with these kind of girls its very obvious when theyre really into you its never a guessing game not worth your time
  thanks ive thought multiple times about just going for it im not too pussy to ask a girl out but like i said i really cant tell if shes into me knowing what kind of girl she is she might actually overreact if i ask her out and shes not
  does she love me or am i autistic
  you might be right but damn shes cute confident and my type    lmao ive seen aspies with gfs i dont have autism but its possible
  shes been known to lead on other guys and she is a little flirty with most dudes  have sex with her if you want to and dont get attached romantically
  hell no shes not a dumb slut and shes lowkey christian i just want her love
i am 30 years old    i have 40k in the bank a well paying job a masters degree thats paid off i am fit and until the end of 2020 i live rent free in my parents spare house alone so i am saving a shit ton    and yet i feel empty inside how do i learn how to appreciate life and be happy
  get some good dick in ya
wait  are you a woman or man
  man
  who told you this was happiness  like really you think everything in life was getting a job having a nice house and money  you misunderstood life this is was i was told i got the same as you  what are you goals in life building a house learning a new language when you do that you become happy  if you cannot make life happy for you help other people they will appreciate
to be clear i dont want to trick him into getting me pregnant i want him to want to have children    ive never wanted children and he never really did either the conversation has come up several times over our relationship my side being that children/being pregnant scares me and his side being that he has no desire for them outright he sees no reason nor has any desire to have them    recently though i think i hit my biological clock and now despite my fears i do want a child how can i get him excited for the prospect hes said that hell go with it if thats what i want hes not averse to the idea but for me thats not good enough i dont want to drag him along for something hes apathetic about i know he would be a good father hes said as much himself i just want him to look forward to it ive not told him yet that i changed my mind what should i say to get him on board
  its not good enough that hell do it for me i have to be able to make him want to do it  jesus christ
  hell do anything to make me happy and youre vilifying the fact that i dont want to take advantage of this
  i mean he said hed already go through with it i see no real issue with his position as long as he loves the child when it arrives most men are adverse to kids anyways till theyre there
if u havr sny relatives who have kids u should play with then if they are nice not if spoilt brats  anyway i think guys only gets real when shit hits he fan the kid is born most have a complete change in attitude
   this anon is most right i think     i think its partly nerves if i had to guess you need to get him hyped about knocking you up sexual wise once thats done the rest is easy     youll probably see a huge change once it hits home there is a certain nature trigger that kicks in and hell be for it in no time     t been in your husbands shoes myself
why would you marry somebody if you didnt intent to breed with them     marriage is about providing a stable household for children to develop in    go cohabitate if you wanna just larp
marry me instead  my gf doesnt want children  they would be happy togather while we make babies
  hes very adorable with his own young cousins though i dont think its made him want any for himself      thank you this is very reassuring im not sure how id get excited for it outright but i can certainly try      aside from the financial benefits and societal pressure i just like the idea of marriage im a bit of a traditionalist sex was never a big deal for me and i liked the idea of waiting on my husbands part hes technically religious and so also wanted to wait until after marriage
    he will never want them the way you want them now because he just doesnt have that set of hormones     dont be too shocked when you have kids and he becomes protective and sees danger in the world that he will need to protect you from     other than that what you are looking at right now is the best you can expect from his gender and he will be great with it subtly future pace him that you are prepared to work really hard for your children and you wont just dump them on him when the going gets tough it will and in return he will nurture and support you through this very natural process
  the nature of fleeing when you are forced into something you dont really want religion is not a good motivator neither is marriage
  marrying without wanting children  expecting him to change mindset  unironically forget anticonception and hope he doesnt have balls for divorce
  weve never just dumped stuff onto each other everything we do is very much done together and i know he knows that thank you      no
  everything apart from hiding your intentions lol who are you trying to fool here we have no access to your holes so you cant hook us onto your bs
tell him about your change of thoughts and see his reaction mayhaps he will be excited now
what changed my mind from not wanting children to wanting them as a guy was trying to imagine how the future would be with or without them not just in my late 20s/early 30s but also the consequences when im 40 50 theres not much to live for once youve got your education done and career going  though i must say that everytime i see parents with a baby i wonder whether i really want this theyre dumb stinking ugly little creatures    the best thing you can do though is just talk to him about wanting children and seeing how he reacts what youre doing now is holding up the pretense that you dont want children but you want him to be enthousiastic about it thats not gonna work be honest talk it through
  no  men do things only becazse their either want them or because they have to and since he doesnt want children i dont see why would he ever change his mind    but one thing is sure he will have to take care of children
  he doesnt like the idea of having children just so that youre not alone when youre older thats what his parents did and it didnt end up being good for anyone      i do intend to talk with him honestly about this i just dont want my own desires to color his judgement or make him say something he doesnt mean      i think its entirely plausible for his mind to change on this chiefly because hes not of any strong opinion either way he doesnt hate the idea of having kids but he also doesnt love the idea  and yes we would both be taking care of our children thats part of the reason i want him to not just be neutral but excited for the prospect its an important life decision that i dont want him regretting or being overly concerned about
  weve never just dumped stuff onto each other everything we do is very much done together and i know he knows that    spoken like someone who is not going to relax his mind by telling a future pace story     look it up  you dont have to think he will do anything just relax his mind so it is free to work
he will be all for it after shes born hes already said as much by agreeing to do it
poke a damn whole in his condom jesus christ its that easy hell come around eventually
  he doesnt hate the idea of having kids but he also doesnt love the idea  sound like youre in a relationship with some dense ass fuck anime mc ala shinji ikari and youre the asuka soryuu nah fuck that you need a man with strong conviction whose ideals are unmoveable he cant be so wishwashy with the idea of bringing a child into existence because having a kid is very important make him understand that
  same i do want kids myself but i want to have a child with someone i know i will grow old with and die divorce can fuck up a kid and i dont want that for him or her if im fucking it is going to be with someone i love unconditionally
  recently though i think i hit my biological clock  what a terrible excuse are you implying that your body has overridden your mind and is now forcing you to want to have children despite all your previous reasons in support of you not wanting children
  leave him for this incel  why dont people understand they are going to die eventually
speaking as a male who is against/fearful of having kids the main problem is that men are often roped into becoming the sole provider financially    if you really want kids offer to become the working mom and have him as the stay at home dad    if he doesnt at least consider that offer give up because kids arent happening
i never wanted children until recently im 36 now if youd asked me in my 20s id have laughed long and hard at the idea to the extent that i was completely convinced i never wanted them thing is  i didnt want them because it was objectively a bad idea at that time i wouldnt really be able to raise children in a manner which wouldnt have been horrific for them and me all the people around me raising children when i was that age were either much older and in a completely unrelatable position in life or clearly having a horrific time    now now im kind of bored ive got a house a steady job no debt cars are paid for raising children would be relatively easy possible compared to before id look forward to it if anything ive done so much now that fresh and new experiences are quite rare and hard to find so i either do the same boring shit feeling increasingly bored and frustrated with things which fail to match my abilities or i start a family because that would be cool i can share so much so many reasons to do things    that sounds kind of weird but an inherent desire for a child doesnt really exist for me i cant say that children are inherently good it is about what they would bring to my life i know a lot of what they bring to my life will be hardships and challenges but who the hell doesnt want to kick ass at hardships and challenges challenges are an opportunity to display how awesome you are    so id try to convince a guy based on all the positives that a child would bring to their life you wouldnt get far with me just saying because they are great without reasons if his reasons for not wanting a child are basically i can only see drawbacks and difficulties then yeah  that is entirely how making rational decisions work you avoid making bad choices    also as a male im always slightly aware of the deal inherent in cohabitation i dont want to be alone i dont want to die lonely and infirm i accept some compromise
  is the only reason that you want children is so they could entertain you
  also id say a lot depends upon his philosophy and his surroundings i never wanted kids when i was younger because i was all about sensation and experience and against responsibility and reliability both of which are required to successfully raise children i knew that children are often wanted by couples and that if a relationship progressed far enough along the question would arise as to what we were doing but relationships were transitory brief interchangeable and based on me getting what i wanted people around me were my family and i could never imagine being alone except by choice i was rarely sick injured or ill life stretched ahead days too numerous to count ive missed a sunrise so what theyll be many more to come    my philosophy has always been rational though so subject to change as circumstances change as ive gotten older ive become bored with the same sensations and pleasures if anything overindulgence prevents me from reaching my wider goals relationships have become something which incorporate a deeper understanding and awareness of love and commitment more and more they are based on what i can give how i can support how we can be greater together even if it means suppressing what i want immediately for a longer term and more satisfying result friends have moved away died gotten married had families of their own careers have taken off and over i can see how being alone is not a choice now meaningful socialisation requires significant effort something im limited time and resources to invest in and i want meaningful connections not just shooting the shit with randoms which gets boring ive had friends and family die ive been injured and ill ive seen friends and family get terminal illnesses the concept of mortality starts to weigh a little heavier    so eventually all signs point at it not being a bad idea to start a family and get some next level drama to feed my rational problem solving monkey brain
  i guess friends pretty it up by saying shit like we realised we had so much love to give but it amounts to the same thing historically youd have had children because you wanted somebody to work for you succeed you look after you in old age and because children resulted from sex in the absence of birth control the whole continuation of the species societal support and obligation and religious imperative was the icing on the cake    now it is entirely a choice i choose to have a child despite knowing that continuation of the species isnt a problem that no god im aware of is going to congratulate or condemn me that society at large is probably going to look down upon my choice and be irritated at yet another source of atmospheric carbon and that i dont need them to work on my farm or support me in old age    so yeah it is pretty much mommy and daddy decided to make you because mommy would have likely left daddy and he realised that in order to maintain access to sex and companionship you were part of the deal and that as his friends and family age and become less available to keep him amused the problems and opportunities around keeping you amused would give him something new to do instead    lotta love to gib
  this can end marriages     if you both got married under the assumption of not having kids and he still is operating under that desire nothing will make him want children     so either decide if your marriage is worth continuing without children and do that until his mind changes organically or end the marriage and find someone who does want kids     honest conversation is a good start but when it comes down to it theres nothing you can do to change his mind on a big life decision like that  especially if he married you under the impression that you two wouldnt have kids couples therapy can also help if this brings up resentment and can help you both determine if the marriage is salvageable
expose him to some kids and give him a little encouragement you can also talk about it    if that doesnt work let it go forcing kids on a man is something many women have done and it never ends well youll end up divorced and with a mixed up kid
  hell do anything to make me happy  looks like hes already on board please be aware youre an emotional mess and thats likely to only get worse during a pregnancy make an effort to limit these outbursts and recognize when they happen so that you dont end up torpedoing your own relationship
i normally dont come to this board but expect to see me a lot more anon    about 9 months ago i met the girl of my dreams i would give you guys an image but im worried for her own privacy we called on a nightly basis i went to her house as much as i could it was coming along perfect she is one of the sweetest girls ive ever known as a matter of fact she is currently growing out her hair to donate she is just so smart nice pretty practically the girl of any mans dreams everything was going good until like three months ago she randomly texted me and said she didnt love me anymore of course i cried for some hours she called and apologized and explained that she was on her period i came to accept her hormonal distress and just settled down for the next couple of days our relation ship started to decline heavily from there she started going threw her period again last month and said to me this time that she never wanted to see me again i freaked the fuck out and called her friends and asked what was going on i was just gave the same period shit this didnt happen any other time so i just accepted it again though this was a major blow to our relationship i started talking to another girl from my school that i like of course because my relationship with my first love was virtually dead i decided i would move on i am really into talking to her and such then yesterday she called and told me that we should marry like what the fuck after all that shit she said about not liking me and she wants to get married im caught in a mother fucking sticky situation and its really straining me mentally i cant tell what i myself want to do i know the clear answer is to brush her off and just stick with the new girl i like i just dont want to make her upset ughhh its such a terrible decision im not asking for anyone to decide for me im just looking for some /adv/
  she doesnt sound kind to me op im sure any woman you talk to about this in real life will tell you the same thing im a male i dated someone like you did the only valid practical advice stop obsessing and move on with your life
ive been there anon my ex would constantly break up with me just to date someone else but eventually get back together she told me she didnt love me anymore after every breakup but just blow her off man it be a vicious cycle of self doubt and such find something or someone to help ease the idea of a clean break and find someone less emotionally manipulative  best of luckanon
    reading further i see that youre in the stage where she tells you to go away forever then comes back and says she wants to be with you forever this is part of some fucked up game shes playing the wise thing to do would be to tell her what shes doing is wrong and then cut all contact permanently
  dude just let her go shes crazy not worth it
    to clarify further what i mean by unkind is that she isnt empathizing with you at all its not necessarily a sadistic thing shes doing but it is selfish dysfunctional and clearly fucking your head up
be me  be in conflict with a girl she makes me feel guilty  tells me its all my fault  i ask for a 5 minutes walk to talk about things  she says no  i ask if we can do it by instant messaging  she says no and that im blocked    am i wrong for thinking she tries to string me along with guilt
  why the fuck are you worrying at this point stop talking to her
  im not going to
cut your losses anon continuing to try and deal with her will only frustrate you    even if she still wanted to contact you you should have enough self respect that you wouldnt want to talk to someone whos that emotionally manipulative
  its already obvious that youre a creepy pest why do you insist on harassing her
  im not going to talk to her after that anyway im not the kind to run after a girl
  she came to me
  so whats this thread about then
  just to know
  fuck you
  this
  oh then no youre not wrong
  thanks
  my bad when you said im not going to i thought you were replying to my last sentence when i said stop talking to her youre actually in the right and you shouldnt attempt to speak to her in any way because shell tell people youre harassing her and damage youre reputation
  yeh i know im not giving in the manipulation anyway so there is nothing im gonna do except tease about how its not gonna work she was falling into my frame shes done all i wants shes trying to fight back i wasnt sure but i probably wouldnt have fell for it anyway since i dont run after women anyway
  promise me op youll not disfigure her or stab her in the neck or burn her house down promise it
  yeh anon i promise
youre not wrong anon no one deserves to be manipulated like that
last few months ive been in some intense arguements drama if you like with my friends and acquaintancesthey are changing  instead of asking any advice on thatwould like to know the following  whats the best way to let steam off channel my rage somewhere safe    you can also ask anything relatedif you like
well i can only tell you what i do to control my rage i shower with really cold water you can do it slowly warm to cold or just cold from the start its hard to explain but it doesnt hurt in a bad way it makes you feel clean and refreshed you feel the blood going through your body you feel alive i think it makes you release endorphins too listen to music that makes you want to dance to it as you shower a few days ago i was about to have a panic attack i was furious and in edge i showered and my body was pure red but it helped so much oh you can also do exercise or play sports anything that you can actually enjoy doing
  sounds goodhow can one forget and ignore such stuff though
how do i stop being a person who literally procrastinates 12 hours every day and start being a highly motivated person whos going places
  get the hell off of 4chin always the best start now shoo
  very gradually and unremarkably you will be encouraged by minute change and stay focused on the longterm goal there will be no flipping of any switches you will still be you but you will be a you who works towards a more diligent self with every day that passes you will be set back and you will fail and you will be discouraged but you will not quit because the only honest to god way you can fail in this life is to check out and take no more part in it
  how do i choose a longterm goal    every time i set out to do something as soon as it gets hard i get completely paralysed and would very literally rather die than do that
  youre not working within your means you dont have to put yourself through hell for 12 hours a day thats not what being a productive person is confront your problems and consider ways around them or ways through them or whether they are real or imagined problems the specific nature of your longterm goal is pretty irrelevant whats important is that you are challenging yourself and consequently growing without torturing yourself through hardship if something is too hard then its too hard and so your task becomes to make it easier not to give up everything completely
  the task of getting up going to my other chair and opening the chemistry textbook is hell enough that i start contemplating suicide instead    how do i make it easier
  are you depressed
  ill tell you when i get around to it
  been my whole life and its not going to change
    this guy gets it we need to work smart not hard    humans are not perfect and so we cant rely on an infinite source of willpower what limited willpower we do have should be alloted to things that will make us want to work    for example say you need to study chemistry for 6 hours in your day if you get up at 11am make your way down to library for 12 or worse stay in your room and then try to force yourself through those 6 hours youre likely going to give up pretty quickly if instead you use that willpower to simply get an early night you could get up at 7am go for a jog feel truly awake and then youd probably want to study come 9am      im also pretty depressed things that have been working for me  not smoking weed  drinking less  becoming more openminded about spirituality  running and lifting weights  eating fewer carbs and sugary foods  sleeping properly    im very much still in the same struggle as you op i wish you the very best please never expect yourself to be perfect 
mid 20s person living and working in a big city  everyone obsessed with instagram and snap chat tinder etc    i wanted to an edgelord and say fuck social media im above that but its becoming more and more apparent that your digital presence fucking matters your instagram page is basically your social/sexual cv resume and cover letter and if its shit youre out of luck    you can day game and network all you want irl sooner or later someone is going to ask you for your handle and youre going to seem like a potential school shooter when you say nah im off the grid    people complain about girls posting butt selfies and getting thousands of likes and thus inflating their ego but honestly i think this whole phenomenon is just revealing how much value some of these girls really have theres no such thing as an artifically inflated ego that chick just finally realized how hot she was and instagram helped her do it     if youre a guy and you even want a chance at competing you have to go full blown narcissist yourself    im average in terms of having a social life but to adapt to this climate i need to play the digital game and i have no clue where to start can anyone help    alternatively id love to hear a compelling reason not to give a shit about any of this bonus points if its not some jordan peterson inspired clean your room and be christian pl0x garbage
  mid 20s person living and working in a big city  i dont know man it seems like you have your shit together but what exactly is your goal      t 29 yo invisible wageslave in a big city
  i guess my goal isnt to be invisible but to be a somebody    being a quiet suburban working boi doesnt appeal to me as much as being someone with a big social circle and having more of a presence if that makes sense
  he thinks being a narcissist like a woman on social media will attract women
dont fall for it its just a meme ive had people i know approach me saying i was mysterious because i dont post on social media often     its okay to have a facebook profile instagram ect just dont use it
  i mean one of the dark triad traits is narcissism
  fame and notoriety are the biggest baits in the book it seems as though everyones hawking their social media because you only notice the ones who hawk the ones who mind their business and live as they see fit are quiet and unheard your insecurity is your most unattractive trait and it outweighs your lack of social media presence by far

both me and my gf are poor  i am somewhat wealthier than her  she sometimes talks about how it would be nice to date a rich guy and names certain guys we both know when i am around    is she being disrespectful
not kicking off at her and calling her out on her bullshit when your gf literally lists other men she would like to date in your presence    have you any sort of selfrespect you cuck  pathetic
yep need to put a collar on that bitch
yes that is very disrespectful  i would let my girl know in a calm but firm and even tone of voice that i didnt appreciate when she talked that way and prefer that she didnt do it again  if she says that its just a joke tell her in the same tone that you dont see the humor in it and find it disrespectful  speak slowly and enunciate each word but do your best not to seem angry just be calm about it and deliver the message  if she understands then just move on to another subject  if she acts defiant and flippant then she doesnt respect you time to find someone else

  happens to me sometimes shake up your routine if you cant then take a weekend trip and force yourself to break routine     practice privation for a while fasting or unplugging the internet for a few days anything like that
  today really helped by staying awake all day had to force myself but i feel a lot lesswound up i even did lay down and take a nap but kept myself awake for over 13 hours to offset my usualy 1213 hours of sleeping ervery day that im doing the last few weeks that seems to have calmed my mind a bit especially seeing the difference of those feelings and thoughts of 10 hours ago vs now
i live in a foreign country in which people do not speak english  i go to a school in which no one understands english with the exception of english teachers  i came across this book about philosophy i liked it however i cannot take it for myself only borrow it and records show that ive borrowed it from the library    how do i persuade the librarian to give me the book not he nor anyone in the school ever opened the book only i the only individual whos a native english speaker long story    im thinking some tyrell wellick action not really
return it and steal it later
  ok but have you taken in consideration that the only person who would steal a book in english is the only person who actually speaks english ignoring the fact that im also the only person who borrowed the book and probably the only one who would ever borrow it anyway
  just buy it read it now return it at the due date save up for it while you take in the information as you go about life
    photograph/scan all the pages or buy it if you got the money wtf is wrong with you unless this is a special edition of the 19th century you should be able to get it elsewhere
  this book was meant for me i am only one who may own it it calls for me i call for it  if the book could talk i would imagine that if i bought it with money it would tell me how stupid i was and that it belonged to me from the very start kind of like a wife i had to pay some irrelevant people to marry
does anything stop you from returning it then instantly borrowing it again if youre the only english reader then there shouldnt be a queue of other people wanting to read it for you and if there are then your original point that you should have it because youre the only one that can read it becomes moot  or ask if its possible to extend the borrowing period
  this book was meant for me i am only one who may own it it calls for me i call for it  wtf gay
  you misunderstand my goal school is temporary the book is not
  indeed i am with the greatest of books
  inb4 the book is some playboy magazine that the librarian stashed and pretends to borrow to op so that he doesnt report it to the school board  the bait is pretty bad at this point op if you want to steal it go ahead its not some anons on 4chan that are going to increase your likelihood of getting away with it
whats the book op
  oh havent i included that in the original comment let me take a picture
cannot connect to camera  android 80 shit0    heres a picture in the meantime
  cheers  look online can only buy from some australian bookstore for over 200 dollarydoos  thats a pickle seems like it would be difficult to buy then although it being worth that much makes me double down on the stance that you shouldnt just take it
something similar happened to me once i ended up losing the book and just paid the 20 fee they had multiple copies and it wasnt borrowed since 1997
assuming i dont get stood up what am i supposed to do in order to be a good date i know that asking questions is good though im not quite sure what to say when i meet her at the same time
be a good and interested listener if she starts to speak allow her to interrupt you always and take a real interest in her words     im not quite sure what to say when i meet her at the same time  where are you guys meeting   a really good first thing to say is how she looks shell spend a lot of time and thought on looking good for you depending on the girl she maybe put on like 10 outfits before leaving the house every stroke of makeup she was thinking about you so when you see her compliment whatever you honestly feel if you like her outfit then maybe  hey anonette how was university today i love your outfit  like this
    where are you guys meeting  restaurant
  aside from compliments how do you flirt ive never done this sort of thing before
  just say nice ass or something like that
  flirting is just normal conversation when two people like each other you dont need to over think it     i want to say be yourself cliche but super true   talk about whatever you find interesting dont force yourself to talk dont make conversation it always feels awkward if you need a moment of awkward silence to gather your thoughts and relax then do that instead of forcing an uncomfortable conversation     maybe youre interested in her family so ask her how many siblings she has shell start telling you about her family remember this is her life she is sharing with you and she loves her life because its hers so take real interest here if she talks about her dad or dog or something with special interest then maybe dig in a little more get to learn about what she loves try to figure out what makes her special the sooner you guys are comfortable talking the more comfort you have and then less youll think about talking and more of just flowing     the trick to building comfort is being super honest straight from braintomouth if you say something stupid its ok just keep going you can control things after the fact but if you choose to be shy then itll cause you trouble because its like youre trying to control things before they even happen so when faced with being shy or saying something a little dumb always choose the latter its the lesser of two evils    girls are human too shell be just as nervous as you and even more shy and selfconscious probably if you mess up shell still respect you because youre at least brave its sooo much better to date a man whos brave and stupid than a guy whos shy and smart   dont get me wrong im not saying youre stupid im only saying shell understand if you make mistakes because youre probably amazing to her     i hope that helps       why do you even post here if youre not going to help people
  dubs confirm
  checked
  how do i know if the date went well/if i should kiss her
  youll feel if the date went well it wont be much of a question for you by the end of the night kiss her if she pauses for just a moment to look at you before saying goodbye listen to your intuition when it comes to stuff like this   also never ask permission for a kiss just do it if youre wrong its better to say sorry than to ask permission and even if youre wrong its not a big deal just say oh sorry smile and have a good night
  if youve gotta ask about what youre supposed to do about these things then youll never be a good date sorry zoomer
when i was in my 20s i heard about how dating gets to be a mans game    now that im 36 most of the women i have dated within the last few years seem to mistake emotional selfishness with being independent and a sense of entitlement     and i meaning everything from telling me im controlling for asking about their drug and alcohol habits to telling me to deal with them going to vegas with another guy    the thing is i feel i am getting more and more frustrated and bitter as this goes on    should i take a break from dating before i get too fed up is there any proper way to take a break without going full mgtow anyone with advice
go to church and find someone proper
 this is something in relation to the woman itself each and every person you will date will be different and have a different personality way of thinking etc    if you want someone who isnt so struck up independent and be so entitled then you should go ahead and just continue out looking for people that meet your needs in someone who wont be like that    and youre not controlling youre asking because things like that can concern you and its an honest and serious thing to know about their drug/alcohol habits    just continue on but dont wait too long let things come to you and make yourself open and know more about the person first so they dont be like this and you didnt see it coming etc    hope this helps anon
  i appreciate your reply thanks friend
  you have bad taste in women
date girls in their 20s
  it was the same op 
  this is unfortunately retarded advice nobody but old people goes to church anymore
  not true
in the same way peverted older men are probably just a bit heartbroken disapointed with life and particularly how women have treated them i would say these types of women probably have issues too relating to their daddy or some heartbreak try to get to know what these issues are before you emotionally invest in yourself
  my last girlfriend went to church she was also a severe alcoholic with daddy issues who lived with her parents and cammed to make money because she couldnt hold down a typical job    church is not an automatic solution
i met up with the same escort for about 56 sessions in a 2 month span in the last session the condom broke and as soon as i noticed it i had replaced it but now im somewhat freaking out that i might actually have caught something from her i havent had any kind of strange symptoms as far as i know but my anxiety and fears keeps me in a constant state of panic to the point where every little thing that goes wrong with me i assume its hiv related my family doesnt know that i went to get tested over the weekend because i try to be discreet with a lot of things i do    tomorrow i might or might not be getting a call back from my doctor on the results i cant think straight at all at this point is there anything i can do to calm down and even prepare myself
  just think that i have a coworker that go 5 or 6 times a year in thailand to fuck shemale/ladyboy and when hes so wasted it does this without condoms  he did this 3 times i think  he takes cocaïne and drink a lot when hes there and he never have anything    and as you may know the bitch is making a living with her pussy so she better have nothing or her reputation is over     i did this one i was in longbeach i kind of freakout just like you but all went fine so      dont worry be happy
whenever im on my period i feel resistant to my boyfriends affection just sort of physically and emotionally unmoved by it i dont actually resist just feel it its a totally functioning/happy/loving relationship and both of us are generally affectionate so im more interested to see if its a thing that other girls experience strongly too because it must be biological/hormonal
the opposite happens for me when im on my period i usually crave my boyfriends affection more and i want to spend the day cuddling under a blanket  its probably hormonal but hormones can have different effects depending on the person
i do crave more attention too because i am in pain so i want to be taken care of some people get annoyed/upset while theyre sick because its too much to deal with pain and being touched its not weird though to be one or the other
  if youre on birth control it will screw with you
  nah im not i already definitely had serious hormonal/chemical imbalances when i was growing up and history of depression/anxiety which doctors would only ever recommend b/c for despite constantly saying i didnt want it so i stayed away from b/c for that reason    its not some overwhelming feeling of resistance i still want to be around him and with him and enjoy cuddling him etc but say for example if he kisses me i do not feel like reciprocating like i usually would its not a problem since i can understand its circumstantial i just wondered if anybody else experienced the same thing
male 22 just started dating this girl ive known for a while in college i had a crush on her a while back back when i was super fat and she told me she was actually into me like a few weeks ago anyway weve been going on some dates and making out it feels like she wants to fuck soon and i kind of want to as well but i have no burning desire to fuck     shes a hottie too i fucking love kissing her and feeling her body against mine but i just have no desire to fuck     i think i might be asexual sex does not appeal to me half as much as it does all of my other friends male or female sex to me is something i can live without and be just fine i like the intimacy and stuff associated with kissing/cuddling and shit like that i want to find out if im asexual but i dont know what to think what are your thoughts on this /adv/
  are you a virgin
  no ive had sex twice before   the first time was just to fuck and get it over with so i could stop obsessing over being a virgin i hated it so much i got too drunk and couldnt feel my dick    2nd time i was kind of tipsy and just came onto this girl i met in a club on vacation then fucked her i came that time but it was still pretty lackluster
  once burned twice shy
  maybe youre asexual if you are then good for you and just live your life man
  should i break off this new relationship then i dont want to lead her down a path of disappointment with my lack of desire to have sex
  did you watch a ton of porn
  i used to a while ago not so much anymore i dont even have any desire to masturbate like i used to when i was younger
  what the fuck are you 
  just a 22 year old dude with no real sex drive
  im in the same situation as you are on the one side its nice because no stress on the other side i sometimes have the feeling that i miss something
  you have no clue what asexual means op this level of idiot is well it is 4chan
  youre not asexual if you were you wouldnt really be into intimacy you wouldnt have crushes and you wouldnt give a damn about kissing/cuddling these are responses that are linked instinctually to mating and courtship they go together    what you are is a slow burner you probably need to build up to it stay away from booze as it can cause limp dick and as a depressive itll dampen your slow moving sex drive to the point where you ask silly questions on the internet    next time you block out time to service your girlfriend block out a lot of time like hours and then slowly ramp up stuff from the intimacy you do recognize to straight up fucking let one thing will naturally proceed to the next
  you should get your testosterone levels checked op low t levels is the only thing i can think of that could be an explanation for your low sex drive testosterone is the main hormone thats responsible for a males desire to have sex get it checked if your t levels are fine then yes you might be asexual
  if you invested 2 minutes of your lifetime to google the basic forms of asexuality you would have learned that there can be different stages from zero interest in anything bodytobodyrelated to very little joy in sex no offense tho
how do i meet the type of girl i want    people say that you shouldnt change yourself for anyone but i feel like ill never meet someone i want a relationship doing lines of coke in a subway at 3am     what kind of changes should i make in my life to meet someone i find desirable
become homeless
dont change yourself change the women they are hedonistic creatures theyll do coke anywhere you want if you just realize that fact
  maybe stop doing lines of coke in a subway at 3am but i dunno
  gosh i hate druggies you all should rot away
doing hard drugs in a subway at 3am is a defining part of ops identity
  what you find depends on where you look    what kind of girl do you want  where would someone like that be likely to hang out  go there
  someone quiet and shy
see normie girls on instagram drinking at 18 want to hang out with them but dont know how at the same time dont want to go out there and drink said girls constantly bitching about boys on social media
  you change yourself for yourself  hit the gym and the library  
  im already /lit/ and a lot of women dont care about /fit/

  i tell her i like her    yeah dont do that anymore or ever telling you girl you like her is a death sentence    other than that take a year off to just get your shit together and relax and think about what you want to study if you cant afford that then working at least parttime isnt bad either if youre all confused and fucked up about everything you need to stop everything as much as possible and clear your head
i miss my ex    we broke up in july but had troubles starting in may i had only talked to her once or twice since then once she responded it was cool the other she didnt after we fought    how do i get over her everything that reminds me of her depresses me and the dates ive been on dont help for shit ive been busying myself with work but thats it
youre doing the right things except making efforts to contact her    time will heal this wound use it as a way to get stronger
  i miss my ex  you already made your first mistake  she responded it was cool  it is not cool elaborate on the situation  how do i get over her  it aint about her anymore its only about you she aint spending her time pondering about you or wondering how youre doing the fact she said its cool at the end of the relationship shows how much of a stone cold bitch she is thinking shes such a badass for lowering your self esteem and yoir self respect by asking 4chan for /adv/ you want to forget her focus on yourself go back to school learn skills employers want start working out and most importantly start learning to motivate yourself and challenge yourself to become better if you want to stop pitying yourself then get a grip and fucking do it stop procrastinating and stop feeling fucking sorry for yourself because that bitch thought of 1 first herself you should learn from her too and think about yourself and for a change do it

oh boy i actually have to make the thread huh well here goes    i really need a womans input whether ive blown this i am very infatuated with my coworker soon to be former since i am leaving our job in two weeks for the last month or so ive been able to shelf my feelings because i didnt want to make things awkward for her despite lots of male friends telling me to just go for it i fucked up last friday i asked her if she wanted to go to an art gallery with me thinking this would just be another platonic hangout with a focus beyond getting food after work she takes longer to respond than usual i start to get anxious i ask several male friends if that came off as asking her out on a date they say yes i freak out even more thinking ive blown my plan only two weeks before the finish line but then she responds yes and im ecstatic then a few texts later she says something along the lines of i dont know what were going to do without you sad emoji and a male friend suggests i reply just because im leaving doesnt mean we cant still see each other   i think thats waaay too forward and say some stuff about how shell do fine without my help and tag on that line but change the wink to a haha i thought that would make it a lot less forward but she never responded i thought id be able to get a sense of how she reacted to it today but i have no clue she wasnt really any different to me today but at the end of the day when it was just us left in the office and i left first to avoid her thinking i was creepily waiting for her she just mumbled bye in response to mine  is it over should i give up on seeming attractive and send a lame apology text and just focus on preserving the friendship    i really wish i knew how to ramble more concisely

  i searched so much and couldnt find it cut me some slack
  its in the archive lurk moar
  hitler saves the day  how does this image make you feel
  forgot pic
  the archive wasnt letting me search earlier i swear i tried i really didnt want to hog attention
  it looks like something steeped in boomer    seriously speaking though from what ive seen the national socialists were either neutral or in a few cases harmful to sexual morality they cared much more about raising fertility rates than ensuring longterm stability of the marriages although in part i suspect this is because it simply wasnt as much of an issue yet in a heavily christian society the ss on the other hand had quite a bit of nasty shit going on in comparison no thanks to the larping pagans in its ranks    so on balance while im fine with the message the premise nazis bad is something which is used for much more unscrupulous ends and shouldnt be legitimized like in your pic if the premise is accepted blindly its simply giving a mental bludgeon to those who would manipulate you with it
  so youre saying you support premarital sex
  
  ill take that as a yes
why do girls seem more attracted to you when you have a girlfriend i had no attention until i got in a relationship then i was genuinely having to turn down many advances from girls who knew i was taken
  both genders are actually more attracted to people in relationships its basically the unconscious dating version of ill have what hes having
    this was so sweet to read    dont give up please from what you said i can tell you havent even been very direct with her when will you go to the gallery wait to see what happens good luck with that    just because im leaving doesnt mean we cant still see each other   this would have been nice in my opinion
  they rose from the weimar republic one of the most sexually degenerate societies ever in human history they quickly built an economy from utter scratch with a degenerate populace meanwhile constantly dodging the threat of war from all sides until war finally broke and they had to do everything they could to survive   the nazi reign was only 7 years and occurred against all odds and resistance and produced something absolutely amazing the only reason they werent more sexually virtuous is because they rose like a phoenix from decadence and defilement and resisted the threat of mankinds biggest war in human history at the same time   i would cut them some slack when you look at the big picture they were the most sexually virtuous and mutually liberal society ever if you want to get a taste of it check out some of their propaganda films
  when you look at the big picture they were the most sexually virtuous and mutually liberal society ever if you want to get a taste of it check out some of their propaganda films  topkek  you need to be a bit more subtle in your bait as a tripfag you have much to learn
do big penises feel better    mine is pretty average at six inches and while i feel like i am pretty good in bed it bums me out that i feel like i wont ever really give a chick the sensation of fullness that she must remember from the biggest shes had
femanon here     sometimes girls get creeped outfocus on preserving the friendship yes
im a guy and i pushed my girlfriend away by being too needy i recognized the problem and ive basically just been giving her space not really talking to her that much    she texts me often now really flirty and personal stuff again like we were dating do i stay aloof until she directly suggests that we should meet up or do i respond to her flirtation with flirtation
  can you name a more sexually virtuous society
girls     whats your favorite part of your boyfriends body
my body is yelling at me to get some kind of sexual outlet what do i do about it masturbating hasnt made much difference
  i havent been here for nearly a year good to see you are still going strong hitler
  the short answer no  6 is reasonably large not huge but enough that any bigger gets into painful territory many if not most girls consider 6 to be ideal whatever youre imagining as the biggest shes ever had is probably too big for her taste
this might sound like an asshole question but i promise its not what response are girls looking for when they complain about things beyond hers or my control i have slight tism and my first thought is to try to find an actual solution but i understand when thats not possible and people complain just to let it out so id like to know the proper response for an example my friend often complains about her burnout xanax addict father i know theres nothing to do about it besides cutting him off completely and im not going to suggest that but id like to help however i can do i just nod and say that sucks until shes done venting then change the subject
  girls often arent looking for solutions or advice as much as they are looking for empathy
  engage in sexual activity with another human
  how on earth do i make that happen
  le super edgy tripcode  calling others newfags
  its living evidence youre not a pathetic creep and youre actually worth being with
  to be fair hes been here for years
  his hands very elegant and beautiful its hard to find a guy with hands like that
  absolutely weirdly specific taste youve got there senpai
  hands are actually a super common thing for girls to be into
  i thought girls were all about forearms and calf muscles
  this i was kind of surprised to find this shit out  it seems to be almost universal  ive been leaving my hands in view more often because of it
  is it better or worse to have hands that are a bit rough and workmanlike i have a white collar job but blue collar hobbies theyre not super rough like a black smith or anything but they are a little and ive often got lots of little cuts on them from working on cars
  im pretty sure thats a good thing but i think the frame of your hands is more important but im not a woman so i dont really know for sure
god fucking dammit this thread just made me realize i have yet another feminine trait because lately ive been really into female hands and imagining them strangling me how do women feel about mens nails my hands would be great if my nails werent so dull but i wonder if anyone else even cares about that
  as long as he cuts them i dont care nothing is worse than a guy with long nails because pretty much all of them have it long because theyre lazy so they tend to have dirt under it and its disgusting
  what if the nails are long but obsessively cleaned  asking for a friend
  creepy
  how long are we talking provide picture or reference pls
  thank you for the insight i feel like im doing something right and also feel less guilty for being irrationally turned off by chipped nail polish on girls
  i cant find anything from skimming google its just a bunch of the dirty ones and some of the recordholders but usually 23 mm never more than 5
if a bunch of dudes want to fuck me is it safe to assume girls do to
  to be fair i dont remember any triplads because they are lower than the newest of newfags    women are fucking weird i like butts and boobs like a normal person
  no gay dudes have low bars
  are you a dude not really women have different standards than gay dudes and they have much higher standards straight women can find any guy they want any time they want and it leads to a massive complex that fucks with their heads while gay dudes often have very limited options  at a minimum it means you arent ugly though so you have something to work with
  no gay guys are thirsty as fuck  t hit on by gays but cant get girls
  why do gays hit on you but not women
  in university a girl i had a crush on did not reciprocate but the guy she had a crush on did am i gay if thats the only time ive had sex and it wasnt awful
  yeah seemingly every homo i meet tries to get with me i have gotten women too just not as recently
  im a plain looking skinny 511 dude with a pretty unattractive personality but my dick is just shy of 9 ive had dudes at the gym stare at it and call me big guy so unless i was plotting to destroy gotham i think thats what they were talking about gays are fucking creepy
  wait are girls actually into calf muscles shit i need to wear shorts then because somehow my completely average to chubby body comes with some olympic power lifters calfs
anons and femanons    how do i know how good/bad i did on my first time making out with my gf  i am virgin she isnt were 23 i didnt tell     some details she was laying on my chest on the bed were watching some videos i stared at her she did too i looked away then back then i kissed her she started using her tounge first i followed not too much but i dont know where to put it i pull back move my hand on her neck and kiss her again repeat couple of times then it was time for me to leave we made out again standing up couple more on the elevator and i front of the building door    is repeated kissing means i did good  also what the fuck do i do with my tounge  do i pause every couple of seconds or just keep kissing her  bonus question how do i bring up that i am virgin
  did you crash the squat rack with no survivors
how do people date i heard people use questions where you from what are your hobbies should i prepare a list of what to ask and practice in front of a mirror would it be ok to have a beer because i need to loosen up is an arcade/bar a good plce for a first date
  no brother theyll be expecting one of us in the gains
  youre probably fine dont overthink it
  if you have to think about kissing youre doing it wrong do what feels right and enjoy it     tongue is to be used sparingly dont just push your tongue into her mouth and swirl it around tongue is more like brief explorations pause when you want to breathe or when you want to change angles of attack     dont forget to kiss her on the neck
  bonus question how do i bring up that i am virgin  just ask her to watch one piece with you
  this  chads watch fist of the north star
  noiice      its my first time man cant help it       keked
start hanging out with girl  things progress smoothly  she has a europe holiday coming up  not really even thinking about it  ask her to be my official exclusive gf  shes all excited and happy and looks like ive just asked her to marry me  feeling good about myself  toward the end of the same night she turns to me and says   can we wait on making it official until after i get back from holiday  cant fucking control it deadpan back   dont want to be in a relationship just in case you meet someone and want to have a fling while youre there  she says yes but is a little offended by the implication that she does ons  thinking about it  i get where shes coming from and all but it really rubs me up the wrong way that shes asking it of me now and not ealier  tell her im not comfortable with that and that we can stay as we are but that i wont be waiting for her when she gets back  leaves in tears but claims to understand my position    someone tell me i did the right thing we were seeing each other casually but it was exclusive by choice on both ends not that ive got girls banging down my door or anything and i was super fucking offended by the idea that is should wait at home in case she chooses to sleep her way across europe before coming back to me i told her that she cant have her cake and eat it too truth is that whether or not she meets a guy overseas im not going to resume our casual arrangement when shes back anyway    hitler need not respond
  she went back for more so you did fine keep your teeth out of the way but dont drop your spaghettini if they do bump hers every girl ive kissed in the last few years has told me im a good kisser but i have no fucking clue what that means or what im doing exactly that is good as such     my pro tip of the day though is that when kissing a girl you lean back slowly as you go so that she kind of has to chase your lips to keep it going and they end up resting up against you trying to chase those kisses second bonus tip is use one or both hands on her hips/lower back and pull her in close and hold her against you grills love that
  i usually dont read those walls of text but if you call me by name ill make an exception    you did do the right thing she wanted to whore around with you as a guaranteed fallback and you called her out on it her fault
is what red pill youtube says about the modern dating world true are average men really at a heightened disadvantage for dating nowadays not sure if this is true or not i dont even know how to meet girls though i have no broader community i am a part of yet my parents seem upset i have never been in a relationship at 23 years old i dont even know where i would go to find potential girls but i think i should start seeking someone before i get too old
  im gonna say its not all true but average dudes do have it rough
attracted to old women  have noticed some older women flirt with me  how do i date older women im talking 50s women some of them seen to have an interest i just dont know how to take it further than flirting there was once one woman who was very aggressively pursuing me but i was too shy at the time
  women are screwed just as much as men and the thing is that men are responsible for slightly more of the mess right now than women  youre not really at a relative disadvantage unless you consider mindless sex which got us into the current situation to begin with a goal in absolute terms its definitely harder to find a decent partner and build a decent relationship than it was just a few decades ago     the problem i generally see with red pill stuff is that they analyze current data but leave the underlying causes untouched or even embracedjust in such a way as to maximize the benefits for men while dumping as many of the consequences as possible on women ex the lock and key meme which needless to say isnt a good mindset to have
  tfw handlet
me  male  511 ie higher end of manlet tier    her  64 which is rare for a woman and even uncommon for men around here  still cute though    should i even bother trying    pros  guys of equal/greater height than her are very uncommon here so shes got slim pickings regardless    cons  unwritten rule that most women dont date shorter guys
i said to my girlfriend we should take a break     she immediately asked are we still exclusive on the break    what do i reply friends
  i know that feel bro
  yeah sure if she rejects you just call her a giraffe
  shes been fucking someone on the side  she wants to know if she can fool you on saying she met him on the break
  how do i help a close relative deal with a miscarriage im a diagnosed autistic and a guy so im a social moron who has never had to deal with such a shitty situation please help
  show her deadbabyjokescom
  fuck off
  just hug her and say i love you   repeat for a while
my internet friend has been bringing up her disassociation recently as well as possible depression problems i offer if she wants to talk about her problems but tells me she doesnt want to and that it might damper the mood of our conversation should i press or leave it as is im just very concerned
  if you can find a time when the mood is already ruined come talk to me about it
  gotchu i forget everything in the heat of the moment but i will try next time
  shes a young fag trying to excuse her problems as a another personality    or shes straight crazy  take your pick
    his hands very elegant and beautiful its hard to find a guy with hands like that  she didnt like big hands she said elegant hands so probably small smooth hands
  small hands  good  ever  to anyone  dude no
  she seems pretty normal i think it might be legitimate
  normal people accept their mistakes  they dont make other personalities to take the hit
  assure her that youre here for her and ready to talk about it if she changes her mind but dont pressure her further she needs to open up on her own just act like her friend itll be okay
  i think you are confused about something
  thank you for the advise
meet cutie while grocery shopping   seen her there a few times cute little thing with the homely big sweater and baggy pants look probably a 5 or 6/10 but cuteness makes up for it  seen her quote often decide to talk to her  help her home with the groceries and start doing this on a rather frequent basis she is opening up pretty nicely and had begun to smile whenever she saw me  traded numbers and she texts me once in a while doesnt seem to have anyone else to talk to given the topics she brings up sometimes   its literally everything like even simple shit you would think shed talk to a female friend about or just your own parents even asked me about how to best avoid going to the christmas party she was invited to at her workplace   she seems very closed off so i have been going slow to avoid scaring her off  mostly just meet once in a while to help each other with whatever excuse we can find like but christmas presents groceries whatever   yesterday i decided to go for a hug when i dropped her off at her apartment   she pretty much melted into the hug fight away   and then instantly started crying  wotjpg  after a few seconds she slowly pulled away said sorry and quickly went into her apartment       have i fucked up or what the hell happened here it didnt feel like it was a bad moment and its not like she recoiled she  i know she lives alone ive seen her apartment and searching around for information on her has yielded basically nothing blank twitter profile with her picture and like 5 follows of random stuff no tweets and a very light facebook profile that have not been logged on to for 4 years    i havent texted her yet and she hasnt said anything either which is pretty much how this usually goes we dont text daily and dont keep running conversations going but i kinda feel i have to reach out to her somehow i just have no idea what the hell happened here or if i did something wrong
  shes probably been through something and seems pretty lonely you didnt do anything wrong but maybe you should reach out because shes probably feeling really embarrassed and will never text you again she seems a bit reclusive just reassure her you want to still communicate with her
  autocorrect the post  dirty phone poster     literally all of this screams social anxiety and/or a complete lack of proper parenting and affection throughout her childhood dont be surprised if she straight up doesnt have parents to talk to and likely no friends either    t femanon who grew up on an orphanage  just trust me when i say a hug may just be a casual greeting to you but my first real hug was when i was 19 and i reacted more or less in the same way you described her reaction and that was another girl i had no romantic or sexual ideas about no idea why exactly but i still remember that hug as the first time i ever felt real comfort and it just destroyed me    ill be honest your best bet is to pretend it didnt happen she is 100 embarrassed about it and then just go for it next time you see her again but try to do it in a more secluded area ie not right in front of her apartment building with potential onlookers preferably in either of your apartments     youll need patience here a lot of it
  shes probably been through something and seems pretty lonely  like a trauma or something why would that be triggered by a hug of all things    shes probably feeling really embarrassed and will never text you again  ill definitely text her its not unusual anyway we go a bit back and forth on who text first anyway i am just worried about what to text her after that reaction      dirty phone poster  pfft    just trust me when i say a hug may just be a casual greeting to you but my first real hug was when i was 19 and i reacted more or less in the same way you described her reaction and that was another girl i had no romantic or sexual ideas about no idea why exactly but i still remember that hug as the first time i ever felt real comfort and it just destroyed me  what the fuck seriously     and how the fuck was your first physical interaction at the age of 19 that sounds insane most people have had sex at that time jesus christ     i guess it makes sense if you just had shit parents and never had any real friends but that just sounds unrealistic    ill be honest your best bet is to pretend it didnt happen she is 100 embarrassed about it and then just go for it next time you see her again  so i literally have to make her cry again is that really a good option here   in either of your apartments   doesnt that seem a bit rapey
  and how the fuck was your first physical interaction at the age of 19 that sounds insane most people have had sex at that time jesus christ   i guess it makes sense if you just had shit parents and never had any real friends but that just sounds unrealistic  did you miss the key word orphanage  not her
  i am just worried about what to text her after that reaction  just text whatever you nornally would       i guess it makes sense if you just had shit parents and never had any real friends but that just sounds unrealistic  it also sounds unrealistic that some guys havent had proper female touch by the age of 25 but welcome to 4chan home to the socially maladjusted and neglected kids who never grew up properly also i literally didnt have parents and kids at an orphanage arent really huggy and affectionate and neither are the caretakers i still support the place because they did unbelievably much for me and it was run by good people but comfort and affection is not what you get at a place like that    so i literally have to make her cry again is that really a good option here   yes if this is her problem she needs to get it out of her system   in either of your apartments   doesnt that seem a bit rapey  what no its a hug you moron you arent giving her the dick
  it also sounds unrealistic that some guys havent had proper female touch by the age of 25  not him but its a lot harder for guys to get a girl unless they literally go for some fat smelly ogre not that surprising how some guys end up like that at 25
  orphanage  well shit didnt notice that    though honestly i thought orphanages were even more likely to have physical contact all the time ive heard enough about the orgies that can happen at places like that so it almost makes it even weirder      it also sounds unrealistic that some guys havent had proper female touch by the age of 25  ouch i feel like this is going to trigger a lot of people here    and yeah i missed the orphanage part my apologies     i guess ill just text her and see if we can meet up again soon hopefully youre right
  not him but its a lot harder for guys to get a girl unless they literally go for some fat smelly ogre  i was just messing with him    but trust me when i say good guys are also a lot harder to come by if you arent a decent girl in both looks and social skills it very quickly gets narrowed down to fat smelly neckbeards as well baring getting lucky with being noticed and picked up by someone    assuming you are looking for more than just sex of course if we just talk getting laid then yeah girls have it a lot easier girls who are looking for serious relationships and not just random sex have a far harder time       i thought orphanages were even more likely to have physical contact all the time ive heard enough about the orgies that can happen at places like that so it almost makes it even weirder  stop watching/reading so much porn anon
  it also sounds unrealistic that some guys havent had proper female touch by the age of 25  i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced i fear something terrible has been said
  i mean if you take an average guy and put him next to a fat girl who do you think will have an easier time dating
  ive heard enough about the orgies that can happen at places like that  have you now i see
  youve asked the question that half this board is here to ask in their own way
  stop watching/reading so much porn anon  i am pretty sure its not porn i have it from      age of consent is 15 where im from i assumed most kids stuck with nonrelatives with their own rooms or whatever and full of hormones would naturally turn to sex with each other so when i heard people say that orgies happen on the regular at orphanages it seemed reasonable to me
  if you take an average guy and put him next to a fat girl  given most fat girls in my country are raging feminists i would put my money on the average guy if we are talking serious relationships    for nsa sex the fat girl
how do i greet my gf after we made out for the first time yesterday  a hug kiss on the cheek quick kiss on the lip  i meet her in class next time so far i have been hugging her as a greeting
  someone actually believes this   literally no one from my orphanage hooked up to my knowledge i dont think you understand how your relationship is with people you grow up with like this we may as well be siblings for how we would normally interact
  even though getting kissed for what i assume is the first time considering this stupid ass question is a big deal for you for normies it is not if you greet her with a hug keep doing that kissing didnt change anything thats just a normal thing people do in relationships
girls if youre going over to a guys house and hes cooking dinner for you what does he cook should i make dessert baked goods should it be an interactive date should it all be finished before she gets here     i can cook pretty much anything    we wont be having sex
    maybe a main course and some light easy to make dessert you can get the food going but give her some small tasks like cutting veg stirring or setting the table so she doesnt just have to wait around awkwardly it gives you two something to do together and time to chat in a more relaxed setting warn her beforehand that theres gonna be food so she doesnt eat before she comes over and ask about allergies/dislikes its a good idea
  we wont be having sex  something easy to eat that isnt messy dont make stuff like bolognese shell worry about spilling anything on herself     something light to eat that lets you interact with each other is also good chewy meat make it more difficult to talk
  depends on the girl personally id prefer a salad small artsy cuisine and nothing like a burger or sandwich but my best friend would hate that if youve presumably been on a lunch/dinner date with her riff off of what she ordered and liked
the guy im seeing is always complimenting the things i hate most about myself and i dont understand    i hate my nose its ugly and too big he says its cute and one of his favourite parts of my face ive always thought my neck is too short and not slim enough yesterday he said he thinks i have a beautiful neck and that its really elegant and pretty im overweight with a dumpy body and he acts like im some model is he mentally ill what could cause someone to see things in such a distorted way
try to pull off a sexy look for a few dates  guys just laughs at me half of the time and we part awkwardly at the end   they never texted me back any of them  help what can i do if sexy isnt possible for me ive tried to like copy some of the clothing styles that are usually considered sexy but apparently i just look funny when i do it    i dont have much fat on my body which i guess could explain it i just dont know how else to get guys interested because im super plain to look at if i dont do something i realize its probably pretty obvious that i am not comfortable in the clothes like shorter skirt dress etc but i am not sure how i can fix that
  if you cant be sexy then go for cute guys like both
  cute  what does that even mean most of what i find when i search cute is literally the same as what i get when searching for sexy
  look for cute and girly
  sounds like youre the one whos mentally ill with depression or summat
  this   sounds like a you problem     first off realize he may do this because he loves you second of all realize there is some truth to it he wouldnt be there if he thought you were hideous and finally you are likely comparing yourself to literal photoshops and not actual human beings     how you even get that he is mentally ill is beyond me
theres this guy at work who likes to tease me sometimes a couple days ago we got to hang out till almost 4 am after a christmas party it was kinda cozy and relaxed ill admit that i enjoyed the night more than i should have i asked him to hang out somewhere two days later and again we stayed out till 2 pm the thing is there was this one point where felt a really strong urge to kiss him of course i didnt do it  this kind of behaviour is completely strange for me and totally out of my comfort zone besides work i dont leave my apartment im a friendless loser but usually im okay with that since i kind of chose this life by myself i am also 32 and a kissless virgin with social anxiety disorder who had a major depression a while ago   i dont get whats wrong with me why does he get to me so fucking much it even didnt bother me to bar with him i never go to bars i cant be that thirsty can i  still when he looks a me a certain way i get wet makes me feel like a monster especially since hes only 25 and lives with his mom and sis  i feel so inappropriate and confused  what can i do   sorry for wall of text
  things like sundresses aline dresses cardigans floral prints lace details tights and long socks flared and pleated skirts instead of fitted etc
my fiance died some years ago of a miscarriage i havent dated in 6 years as a result     ive been in the company of men for this time mainly and ive lost my ability to judge how women would take things    i was going to be upfront about my situation to head off any akward questions about my autism on a first date is that weird
  here is an example of sexy vs cute
  cute is basically for pedophiles girls dressing young and acting like a kid
  _ i feel like a fashion idiot i had to google most of that     guess ill try again i have a really hard time understanding the differences probably why it always looks wrong       i suppose the right is cute ill probably just try a long skirt with the shirt i have that looks a bit similar to that right one see if that gets a different result
  nope gay guys fuck anything with a heart beat and sometimes even that is optional
  he really likes you obviously he wants you to be happy
  yeah try a longer skirt you might feel more comfortable in it too than you would in a short one good luck 
  what could cause someone to see things in such a distorted way    love
my best and only friend for pretty much the entirety of my early adult life was my sister  she moved countries 2 years ago  has been rough  theres a young girl i work with who reminds me a hell of a lot of my sister  become attached to her  started projecting my sister onto her  just find her comforting to be around  how do i stop doing this its bad for me and i dont think she needs/wants this
  yes thats way too much baggage for a first date
  kiss him
ladies how do you like getting fucked talking about penetration what really turns you on that the guy does and hos he does it etc
  not on the first date maybe 3rd or 4th know if this makes sense to even bring up first if you feel it after 3 dates its fine to drop it its definitely something you should bring up early because thats a ton of baggage a lot of people wouldnt be able to deal with     i dont personally see the issue in a morbid way it means you know what you want without having a potential threat in an ex who might pop up out of nowhere     but i guess im just a bit jaded
there is a girl ive been seeing for few months last week i was uncertain about the seriousness of our relationship so i asked about it now this week she refuses to see me and doesnt give me a reason somehow i think i fucked up by asking her that question because i cant think of any other reason behind it can any girl tell me what is going through her head
  i prefer hard and dominating     dont care about the position as much as long as he assumes full control whether thats forcing me against a wall/floor/bed or on top of him with a leash around my neck/chokehold doesnt matter much to me     i have a very hard time fully enjoying penetration if the guy acts submissive in any way never had an orgasm with guys who did this but i cum super easily if he is taking full control
  perfect answer thank you
guys how would you react if you went on a few dates with a girl that went well and she told you she was a sadist and dominant in the bedroom i have avoided relationships because of this fact i was only in one and they hated that part of me i feel like its only fair now that i warn guys in advance so i dont trap them into thinking im one way especially when im introverted and short and look like a sub
me and colleague attracted to each other   slightly late because reasons   go on date run out of money and she has to pay the rest 8  not a good look  besides that seemed like a casual first date i wasnt autistic or anything  used to have conversations for hours after she got off and i was still on   wont even talk to me now  apologize tell her she doesnt have to ignore me   says shes sorry for doing it still just walks right past me    fuck i actually liked this girl and i fucked it all up because im an idiot     i wanna recommend some music that i think she might like but i dont know if its a good idea cant hurt i suppose     i just wish i knew what was going through her head she was the one who started telling my work friends she had a thing for me so i know there is some kind of sexual attraction     can someone help me make sense of this situation i dont want it to be over yet
  id try because im open to new things although i prefer to be dominant
  girl drops you for not having 8 bucks  shes a cunt lol she did you a favor
  do you think if you didnt get to be dominant it would cause some resentment i feel like with all the messed up things i enjoy would chase people away and then if we dont do that i would be too vanilla really dislike piv but would try it again anyway because i tried it with my ex but i really love stuff like petting oral and lots of kissing and shit  basically it seems like im sexually incompatible with any man ever
  6 is big stop watching porn  but if youre into making a girl feel full maybe think about bringing butt plugs into the mix but only if youre actually into that you dont need it as compensation or anything  t grill with 6 bf whos obsessed with butt stuff and dp  we can barely do doggy because hes too long and warming up is a chore because hes girthy too the big dick problems are real
  girlfriend  like we were dating  this seems like a wildly undefined relationship    do i stay aloof   no you faggot explain to her what the issue is with your big boy words so she can make the informed decision to give you some space
  or maybe she wised up and realized or was outright told how insanely stupid it is to date a coworker     ill have understand why people insist on shitting where they eat
  would cause some resentment  i would never resent a person personally and honestly if the girl was great and she had opposite sexual preferences id gladly take turns if she would never let me be dominant idk how id feel about it i never encountered this before
  average is good and 6 inches is actually a bit bigger than i prefer     i cant tell enough of a difference during sex anyway so its just for the visual impression it gives
what does it mean when a girl is constantly asking if she made you angry
  his abs or his biceps smooth solid fun to fondle and hold onto or his beard if the face counts or his eyes or his butt and everything else     seconding   id be more into my guys hands but theyre calloused to shit from physical work hence abs and biceps so its a fair trade i still like them though theyre big and strong and make me feel safe  apologies to handlets
  do i just nod and say that sucks until shes done venting then change the subject  pretty much they just want to vent their feelings and be validated that theyre not bad or stupid or wrong for feeling that way
  that she is super insecure and has potentially irrational reasons to believe you might be angry at her
  fair enough   so this girl has always sat next to me in uni and both times weve gone to get food together she asks if im angry at her im not but her family is verbally abusive might be the thing
if a girl is doing her helpless act for example trying to reach for something high and can reach it but asks for help despite being taller what is the correct move  if you agree and help her arnt you submitting to her requests making you the beta orbiter willing to do anything  if you dont help you dont get that obvious sign that a girl likes you by doing their helpless act also seems like an unnecessary jerk move but girls dont like nice guys also so    i think im way overthinking this but genuinely clueless and the advice ive received contradicts both sides
  dissociation / dissociative identity disorder  dissociation is more like shellshock or an out of body experience temporary mental detachment from your surroundings
  thats something thatll be an issue if someone actually begins dating you a first date isnt dating if you tell them so early it might just cloud their mind so that nothing about your actual personality will get through maybe give them a few dates to decide if theyre actually interested in you then give them the story so they can decide if its too much for them to handle also remember you might go on a fair few dates before you find someone whos worth a second look let alone a relationship so it might even tire you out to tell the story however many times might want to keep it to the privileged few  that said if you dont mind retelling it and feel like not saying it up front will be holding back or hiding something then by all means be upfront if youre an upfront guy find yourself an upfront gal
the guy i like is annoyed with me because i was busy for a couple days and couldnt text him usually i respond right away how can i make it up to him
how do i stay friends with someone who dumped me for another person    our relationship started after months of friendship where i had no interest but i cant seem to go back to that
  could be anything really maybe shes attached to you and is worried your question means youre seeing people on the side maybe shes not attached to you and is worried your question means she shouldnt have been seeing people on the side maybe she thinks men should be mindreaders and is offended you had to ask maybe shes got a fear of commitment maybe she has really bad diarrhoea maybe shes a man in drag and this was all just a prank until she fell for you
  just find a sub guy theyre in the same boat as you
  and the advice ive received contradicts both sides  exactly theres no right way to be no single action defines who you are just do what feels right and people will perceive you not the person youre trying to portray
  we want the guys we like and that we find attractive to be nice to us i love when the guy i like does nice stuff for me like putting his jacket down for me to sit on carrying my things for me holding my hand to help me up and down steps putting himself in between me and traffic slowing his walking pace to match mine etc small things but i really notice and appreciate them
  by contacting them only rarely we all have those friends that we only really hear from on holidays thats what they are now
  she told you she was a sadist and dominant in the bedroom  id say im not interested in being bottom bitch but hey there are plenty of submissive guys out there
  former is bad latter is less than ideal but could be worked with  what exactly did you do that he didnt like  are we talking a bit of dripping candle wax or something bad
  this person wants to stay close friends
  thanks for the honesty you seem like a good person and im hopeful more people would be willing to try      funny enough i found my ex on a fetish dating site he said he was a sub his previous partners tried to get him to dom and he hated it two years into our relationship he says he doesnt want to be a sub anymore that it turns him on but also makes him feel awful about himself and hes ashamed of liking it in the end he broke up with me because we were no longer sexually compatible
  sensation of fullness  that comes from girth not length
    also they contact me often even if i dont contact them
  be honest and say youre going to at the very least need some time apart before that might be possible but i wouldnt recommend it i was ghosted by a girl i was in love with 2 years later she unblocked me and apologized i thought for sure i was totally over her so being friends would be no problem especially since i have a girlfriend now but as soon as i started talking to her on a regular basis my feelings came back or maybe they never really left
how do i make women stop i want to stop them
  i want to stop them  become mgtow
  i hate that youre completely right i need to work on forgetting to try and portray someone im not thanks for your help    interesting take ive only heard the opposite   do you only like nice stuff done what about being mean in a playful way if that makes any sense  going back to my example but if you were much taller than her dangling what she wanted just out of reach for her
  they just keep going i wish theyd stop
  apologize and take responsibility for it then continue texting him
im a 26 year old man im in the navy my command had its holiday party last friday it was an open bar i got blitzed out of my mind and made a huge fool out of myself picked fights with at least four people  though they always got broken up  and just generally acted like a loud and obnoxious piece of shit     none of that is good obviously but more than anything im incredibly incredibly ashamed that i evidently grabbed the ass of one of my female coworkers she shoved me off and told a buddy of mine to drive me home i dont remember any of this or most of the night to be honest i only found out about it this morning when i found out i asked if i could speak to her i told her i wasnt asking her to forgive me but apologized and i offered to turn myself into the command if she wanted she said she forgave me anyway that i was basically unconscious but then told me that i had to stop drinking so much and that eventually im going to fuck up one too many times and get into serious trouble she also told me that once i got seriously fucked up i looked i wanted to kill somebody and was just generally scary looking and overly aggressive     the last girlfriend i had  one of my very few  broke up with me over what seemed to me to be a small and dumb argument when we talked about it more over text a week later she told me that i have a aggressive and frightening demeanor when im drunk so more or less similar to what the coworker said     basically im pretty much struggling right now with the idea that i might be a piece of shit on a deep and fundamental level alcohol doesnt change who you are     i guess i dont really know what im asking i live a miserable life in general now as of today add general feelings of being a scumbag to it and unfit for being around women or something i dont know my thoughts and words are all over the place i guess im just asking for the thoughts of any other women who might read this or anyone else really
in love with a girl   shes got a bf  i wish i could cut her off but i cant
  get treatment you tard
  thanks bud
  alcohol just lets your true self show  you need counseling and therapy and stop drinking
  if my true self is a violent asshole who also  and this is new to last friday  thinks its cool to slap women on the ass im not involved with then that makes me a scumbag therapy doesnt fix that
total virgin question for both genders  when a girl says she wants to play with your dick does that mean something different from just a blowjob/handjob or is it just a catchall for nonpenetrative stuff
  are you being sarcastic  you just admitted it could have easily ruined your career and life as well as caused trouble in relationships  you know what the problem is some grill in your command knows and i do too  only you wont admit it
  thats just awful i dont even know if i can get some time apart ill get it in a few weeks when their potential new partner visits regardless of what i want or not
  i dont think that youre inherently a piece of shit but dude you need to regulate your drinking habits its a good starting point that you had someone around you who was honest with you now its your chance to work on this behaviour please do it before you get yourself in some serious shit
  therapy doesnt fix that  therapy makes you see what causes it and manage your emotions
  yes it does
  she basically just said i need to stop drinking which is probably true at least in public my concern is more that my behavior when im blackout drunk illustrates my actual personality and since its only been women whove said anything about this to me and im not about to attach this story to my name or a handle here i am counseling treatment or drinking less doesnt change me being a piece of shit if i am in fact a piece of shit
  what kind of coping mechanism is this do you secretly like being a piece of shit which is why you wont get help
  its not your personality its the alcohol you fool otherwise youd behave like that 24/7 without thinking much of it
  so you want affirmation from others 
  some playful teasing and bullying is ok as long as its not like malicious or mean spirited it has to be done with love
  how does she feel about you
  my gf usually means just kinda ambiguously groping it and occasionally licking it i dont know how formalized the language is though
do girls get jealous if they see a guy talking to another girl this girl at work around closing always stops by to say a line or two to me but this time i was talking to someone and she didnt come by at all she avoided the area entirely
  do girls get jealous if they see a guy talking to another girl  what do you think yes
  im not really trying to cope exactly seems pretty shitty to me to try and spin my fucked up behavior around into me feeling better about myself at the same time obviously i dont want to feel like a piece of shit so i guess yeah as   that guy said more or less i was hoping for affirmation in a way but honestly hence the anonymity some kind of honest rational way of looking at this where im not an irredeemable scumbag the problem is its pretty well known that alcohol doesnt change your personality so much as lower your inhibitions so if there is no rational way out of it then fine     as i said my thoughts and words are all over the place on this
  damn i definitely need to speak to her then today i kinda like her
guys how would you feel if a girlfriend was significantly smarter than you
  no rational way out of it  there is a way and its called therapy aka finding what causes your outbursts maybe its hidden attention seeking or deathwish
  turned on like a motherfucker its not intimidating in the slightest at least for me but and this ought to go without saying smart isnt the same thing as pretentious or condescending     but that goes the same for other dudes for that matter
  i would break up
  significantly smarter  in what way by degree or intellectual capacity i could imagine myself being with one if shes not trying to make me feel stupid or rubbing in at every situation
  ill look into anger management classes in the area i have had it suggested to me before but that doesnt say anything about me thinking it acceptable to grab a girls ass when i was drunk
  but her family is verbally abusive  ahh yeah then it makes perfect sense most verbally abusive parents are an issue because they dont just verbally abuse in the traditional sense of calling names and stuff but also because they constantly make you unsure of whether any given statement is good or bad you literally stop being able to tell the difference so even if the speaker believes he is perfectly clear and anyone else listening would think the same the abused part just cant figure it out     pretty classic example of that unfortunately
  you become more impulsive under influence of alcohol whenever its fighting with others or grabbing girls ass it means youve always had the idea but alcohol reduces defenses and you do it
  my intelligence is just about the only attractive thing about my personality so id imagine id be a little insecure you probably wont run into that problem if you go after guys that are used to people being significantly smarter than them though
  shes into me she didnt ever mention her ldr bf to me a friend asked her when i was in the same room and i overheard we talk flirt etc shes always laughing at my jokes and she reciprocates touching she doesnt do this with her other friends only me thats whats fucking me up  also shes leaving the state next year but her family is staying here   its pretty strange
  and my point is if ive always deep down thought doing that shit was fine i just needed alcohol to loosen my inhibitions a bit how the fuck do i reconcile that with being a decent human being that is my problem i understand i shouldnt drink out in public maybe not at all yes anger management would probably be a good idea but this is why i keep coming back to essentially being a scumbag i cant get away from that if all getting blackout drunk did was reveal how i actually think    truth be told this is probably beyond the purview of the ask the other gender thread at this point it was already iffy i just posted it here since as i said its only been women whove said anything about this to me in the past
  ah exciting  fortunately ive been able to keep her relaxed for the most part and get her to open up little by little thats how i know about the verbal abuse   were both still in the dont know what we want out of this but it feels good to be around one another stage
  if you are significantly smarter you dont show it unless you know the guy is interested in smart girls    its pretty much how i manage guys around me i have a coworker who figured me out working together always have me leave the decisions and choices to him and always add i think or isnt it to my sentences but working separately i never ask questions and gets the job done faster with pretty much no mistakes so he started to notice it but no guy i could potentially date thinks i am anywhere close to where i am they think i work as some low paid administrative clerk when i work as a high paid financial controller with a master degree     its just better to play it coy and cute
  its better to use deception
  you may not be as smart as you think you are     that said smart is great depending on how its used the ones who always say they told you so and have to rub their int stat in your face drive me up the fuckin wall but im very interested in learning personally and having a philosophical soundboard to bounce ideas off of
girls    are the hottest most attractive 10 of women all sluts im not talking about models or instagram shit i just mean the hottest 10 who really take good care of themselves and have best genes
  not so much deception just a more you didnt ask so i had no reason to tell     have you ever been around actual smart people who told you they were smart hint no you havent because those who brag arent smart
  if you were so smart youd be able to solve these problems without manipulation
  there is no objective top 10  looks are subjective
  no theyre usually very selective
  thats my opinion but i think that 47/10 girls are way bigger sluts than 13 or 810 ones
  so you dont think 10/10s are whores
  less
  but and this ought to go without saying smart isnt the same thing as pretentious or condescending but that goes the same for other dudes for that matter  right theres a couple in one of my classes and the girl is way brighter and really supportive to her bf theyre adorable together    why    in what way by degree or intellectual capacity   intellectual capacity better informed conclusions  i could imagine myself being with one if shes not trying to make me feel stupid or rubbing in at every situation  ofc    you probably wont run into that problem if you go after guys that are used to people being significantly smarter than them though  my bf is actually really smart he has great intuition for problems but he went to the military and im in academia so the nature of smartness is different    its just better to play it coy and cute  i do do this and most of the time its not intentional i had no idea how a coffee machine works until my boyfriend taught plus i hate actually thinking when im not working so im kinda an empath in normal social situations     you may not be as smart as you think you are   i know im an idiot with most things but im doing okay in my phd program with only a few emotional breakdowns so far so that means something im smarter than average but still fail things like coffee machines
  noice how the hottest girls here have the lowest numbers    
  its your actions and decisions that make you a decent person not that you have an absolute lack of urges or thoughts that some people might find inadequate or socially/morally unacceptable
how do i know if theres anything significant between me and the girl thats nice to everyone
  ask her out
  im only about a weeks worth of small talk in thats way too soon and forward
  wait another 4 days then
      alright so if big penises dont feel better then whats there to like about them
girls    im 29 ive only had 1 gf before and i had a awful ons is this abnormal if it is is it a problem
  no and no
  why are you like this man
  dont most 29 year olds have multiple relationships and ons under their belts
  usually its not abnormal not to just less common dont think about it its a peculiarity some might find surprising but its not weird nor does it matter
  i ask because ive had 2 change thier behavior toward me when they found out the last 2 girls i briefly dated when talk about our twenties came up and they found out about what i didnt do their attitudes changed the thing is before this conversation everything was going great    i feel like im being pureshamed or something
  how do you present the fact do you preface it with things like i had a very studious 20s i have atypical life experiences you can phrase these things in a way to pull empathy out of someone who wouldnt understand otherwise
  how long would you like to wait before you ask her out
  its more about things i can pick up on so i dont embarrass myself with someone who was just being friendly
  well in both cases i was directly asked about my sexual history i will not have sex with someone before the relationship is official so after a few weeks of dating both girls started to drop obvious hints about sex because i never brought it up like putting their hand on my crouch while watching a movie so when i told them i want to wait longer at this point we were dating between 23 weeks they started asking questions i just kept it short and said i had a lot going on in my 20s
  ive known you were smart from day one and our supervisor told me you have a masters  u tryna date or na
  thats gay youre gonna have to embarrass yourself if you want a gf
    can someone elaborate on how i should proceed
  good you dodged sluts
  not even her im a dude among a circle of absolute morons and nah this is exactly how you do it you dont have to try hard it obviously but just dont say anything even if you know the answer to a complex question ask others for help with things you know they know about like that other girls coffee machine example and never ever be a smartass     thats literally social 101 that is not manipulation that is not being an asshole
  people on 4chan generally arent known for their social awareness
  they didnt look like sluts tho
  people who use lies/deception/fraud and the like do it because they need an edge if they didnt need an edge they wouldnt do it i mean its just simple fact that she does it because shes not intelligent enough to think of a better solution     youre posing a false dichotomy by equating tactful intelligent conversation to being a smartass i mean its clear youre not the most intelligent person either you might be smart maybe but not smart enough that you can resist lying to get along with others
  look  doesnt matter if they wanted sex 3 weeks in theyre sluts if they wanted sex 3 weeks in and got angry when you said no theyre trash
hello women a couple of months ago i met a girl at my university we shared a couple of nerdy interests talked for hours during lessons she laughed at every joke i made and she seemed to enjoy the time we spent together even adding me on instagram  fast forward to last month she starts ignoring me avoiding any kind of contact one day i greet her she stands up and walks away  what the fuck ive always talked to her face to face and she was always laughing her ass off
  you didnt ask her out she got bored  move on just dont wait so long next time
  pb what do you think of this  
  i think the inevitable social dynamic is that the woman will end up in a sort of motherly role even if its faint you mentioned in a different quote that your peers similar relationship is adorable as a man i want to be attractive to women and being adorable is a label i want to shed     but more personally its because im super competitive i love and cherish my woman im well off and can give her anything or do basically anything i dont need the threat of competition in my remember personal relationship     and its just like dating a woman whos wealthier than you it makes you feel worthless as a man because you have no inherent value your only value to women is what you have to offer them so in this sense its just logical men need women that we have something to offer to
  hmm so this is a good slut detecting tactic    what if i wait 3 months before talking about sex
male 28  i used to enjoy playing videogames watching anime and films programming sex and sharing with my family and friends now i dont feel any surprise any smile neither happiness nor sadness i feel like a robot what is the purpose of life

does it make you a loser in society to not lose your virginity   im a late bloomer
depends on which society in general no
  than why do i feel like a failure
  i dont really care if it makes me a loser im just worried that when i eventually do get to have sex the older i am the more embarrassing it will be that i have no experience
  hell if i know
  thats all you putting sex up on a huge pedestal
not really but it does it make it hard    im a 28khv from late blooming no idea how to pursue sex women say its not a problem being a virgin its the reasons but this is complete bullshit their emotions about you change instantly the second they found out you are one regardless of the reason
  its not a problem i wonder what grown adult would even care about you being a virgin dont worry anon
  yeah this is also my experience being a virgin or not is a big deal but most likely youre socially retarded if you are so who the fuck would want to be with you anyway
  isnt a big deal
  im not a loser because im a virgin im a virgin because im a loser thats how it works people are always getting cause and effect and it warps their worldviews
  cause and effect mixed up
  not necessarily imho op could be an happy person pursuing his goals i dont think being a virgin and being a loser are even remotely correlated  expect for the movies where nerds fights against bully athletes but reality is different
  no my situation is different   never wanted a relationship in my life and never thought about it too much  made tons of money on investments   also ended up getting into a very good career  than turn 31 and depression hits  feels like a total loser compared to the rest of society  its so bad i hate going outside alone
  you are not a loser obviously on 4chan youll be dragged for being a virgin but no one with a brain would call you a loser to me it seems you managed to accomplish a lot till now and you should be proud     you should pursue what you as person want to pursue and when you fail to do that thats the time to second guess yourself who cares about what others are doing  most relationships arent happy anon sadly its very hard for two people to really get along what you dont have believe its really rare and almost no has it   ask yourself what you want and go for it if you want to simply lose your virginity do it if you want someone on your side look for someone
i have a really good idea most of them come from observing other people btw trying to figure out what they enjoy so i can make money off of it or make myself seem smart with my observations one of those observances involves jokes in this country america you know youve truly made it when people no longer call you mister or misses in this country you know youve made it when they dont even use your name anymore they just call you spongebob or w/e because it makes them laugh and feel good despite how it makes the person called such feel this indicates to me that people really enjoy being the butt of a joke or being made fun of over things like personal appearance people must love it when things they were born with and dont like about themselves get pointed out for public attention and then dissected in front of everyone so others can feel better about themselves this country is so charitable i figured wed start a competition instead of hot or not wed put smeones profile pic up and see who can come up with the funniest names for them based on appearance that way we can all go to sleep and laugh and say well atleast im not that guy/gal sucks to be them d
i mean everyone in america works hard for money and respect so they can have the media rip them a new one right at least thats what it seems like to me but then again they are the friends of the people right so it must be what we want them to do make us all feel like shit and ugly and stupid because they keep giving us fake news
then again wo needs the media for that when we do it to ourselves so well ever wonder why it seems like people are laughing at you behnd your back but say it was something else when you ask yeah they doing the same shit you do to them there is no such thing as real friends in this world you all treat each other like shit so dont be surprised when others do to /shrug
its obvious that 4chan is no longer for me and probably hasnt been for some time    but im desperate to talk to people particularly people my own age and social level but i dont really know where to look shit like yugioh mtg lan events are all full of normies i mean that in the sense everybody there my age seems to be already in a established social circle and most younger people if not all are socially adept    i heard warhammer figurine painting is the last holdout of the socially retarded old nerds but the closest place near me is pretty far and id have to set aside a couple of days from my crappy job to attend it    what else is there
  nothing    you must venture into the wastes now anon alone
its obvious that 4chan is no longer for me  youre darn right pal  its time to find yourself a wife and start a family
  nice dubs    you must venture into the wastes now anon alone    jesus christ you ask for one small small corner of the universe to call your own and youre not even allowed that
  but the closest place near me  bingo thats the problem start your own group dont join one     start a group on facebook and you can buy a domain and website right now while its still cyber monday and get a good deal     from there as you grow then you can move out of your house/garage and friends houses maybe you guys can take turns where you hang out and then rent a cheap 12 room retail floor for a few hundred dollars a month now you have a retail presence and your group will grow larger     im only 27 but i think part of being this age is really knowing how to think and solve your problems when you dont have options make options     also maybe you should consider laying down the toys and embracing what it means to be a man find fulfillment in other things or not as long as youre actually happy and fulfilled doing what youre doing
  its time to find yourself a wife and start a family  whos left at this point im not a catch and the female counterparts to me were smarter and settled down once they got the chance everyone else is out of my league
  start punching down assuming that youre not completely hideous and you can go for someone lower
  from there as you grow then you can move out of your house/garage and friends houses maybe you guys can take turns where you hang out and then rent a cheap 12 room retail floor for a few hundred dollars a month now you have a retail presence and your group will grow larger  are you planning on something like this    find fulfilment in other things  i suppose
  you shouldnt care about your league im pretty sure women in their 30s care less about looks and more about personality    btw dont worry about age my dad met my mom when he was well over 40 and im his first son so theres still hope as long as you go out and meet people
  i have the looks and personality of a brick i dont think i can punch any lower
  you shouldnt care about your league im pretty sure women in their 30s care less about looks and more about personality    i dont disagree but like i turned wizard this year and never had a gf i dont who or where i would find a person with that kind of patience for someone first attempt at a relationship
youre 30 year old man with no self esteem  you have no social skills but are lonely and long for company  youve never been with a woman  you work a dead end job that you hate    your life sounds terrible op but its totally fixable it will take a bit of work but you can get out of this rut possibly an unimaginable amount of work youre so used to this lifestyle at this point you definitely dont want to keep living this way    im sure i or someone else could help you better if you answered these questions    whats your living situation are you still with your parents renting or have a house    how overweight are you what do you do for exercise    you seem to be after any hobby that attracts other people who also suck in social situations are you actually into the idea of figurine painting what are your real hobbies    whats your job    what are you good at or interested in    who did you hang out with in high school do you still talk to any of them
    you must venture into the wastes now anon alone  oh god its fallout 76 all over again      not op but i appreciate what you are trying to tell him its very good advice    except the last part about laying down the toys and maning up maybe op jist enjoys the way he lives his life and having couple more friends to share that would be nice
  your life sounds terrible op but its totally fixable it will take a bit of work but you can get out of this rut possibly an unimaginable amount of work youre so used to this lifestyle at this point you definitely dont want to keep living this way    im sure i or someone else could help you better if you answered these questions  whats your living situation are you still with your parents renting or have a house  still live with disappointed parents    how overweight are you what do you do for exercise  overweight not obese nothing except my lifting heavy boxes at a warehouse job    you seem to be after any hobby that attracts other people who also suck in social situations are you actually into the idea of figurine painting   not really to be honest just the idea of finding people in a somewhat related hobby on my social level    what are your real hobbies  ive kinda lost interest for everything    whats your job  lifting heavy boxes in a warehouse at night    what are you good at or interested in  i dont know i used to be part of the gifted and talented in school but everything fell by the wayside towards the end of uni and i ended up with a 22 in a stem degree    who did you hang out with in high school do you still talk to any of them  thats like college in the uk just a small handful of people kind of never saw them again cos of secondary where i was really wary of people funnily enough im still in contact with people from secondary cos bad friends are better than no friends right
  shit replied an hour late
    heres what i would do in your situation op    move out of your parents place asap youre 30 this is a must you probably have a bit of money saved up use that to rent an apartment if you can look for a place to yourself but if you cant find a roommate    find a better job then quit your current one find something that isnt moving heavy boxes at night or ask for a promotion at your current place    you have to develop interests things like watching tv or playing video games dont count check out events that are going on in your city and join them    you keep in touch with a few people so youre not a total outcast once youre settled into your new place organize little poker or board game events let your friends know that theyre not serious games just for fun and to have a few drinks get them to invite other friends and grow your social circle    ask your friends to help you move if they dont want to help thats okay its worth asking its also a billion times easier to get laid with your own place no girl wants to go to a dudes parents place to fuck thats an instant turn off
  a lot of this is easier said than done money is a big issue and i only have a few grand saved up and a promotions out of the question with the people i work with and it would only be quid more    the friends im still in contact with are basically whos lives havent quite worked out the way theyd hoped and have me as the bottom rung of their friends just so theyd have someone to look down at    check out events that are going on in your city and join them  what would you suggest
    a lot of this is easier said than done money is a big issue and i only have a few grand saved up    thats why i said you would have to put in a possibly an unimaginable amount of work its still this guy  btw     a few grand is more than enough plus nothing gives you a better kick in the ass than struggling and getting out of your comfort zone youre too comfortable living with your parents at the moment and im sure theyre wonderful people and care deeply about you but they are failing as parents by enabling you to live this way    and a promotions out of the question with the people i work with and it would only be quid more    you dont know you havent asked if its only a little more thats better than nothing if you dont think youre worth a promotion make yourself worth it put in the extra work theyll notice i promise and if they dont find somewhere else to work where your effort will be appreciated just dont quit before you find another job its always easier to find work when youre already employed and also dont quit on a bad note you may need your boss or coworkers as a reference and now that i think about it why arent you hanging out with your coworkers you should be inviting them out for a drink after work or coffee during your break etc get a lot of social practice in at work    the friends im still in contact with are basically whos lives havent quite worked out the way theyd hoped and have me as the bottom rung of their friends just so theyd have someone to look down at    thats a horrible way to look at it but i think it comes down to your low self esteem you need to work on that you have a negative view on too many things in life
  what events would you suggest  hit up a local climbing gym its not necessarily an event although the gyms usually host some fun events since youre alone look for a gym with mostly or only bouldering routes its probably the best place for you for a bunch of reasons    its fun as fuck this could easily be your new hobby    you get a crazy workout but its not only about strength or height tall people have an advantage on a lot of routes but a lot of them are actually meant for shorter people technique is involved in a lot of them too    it solves your social problem its so easy to chat people up while climbing you wont believe me until you actually start doing it ive been climbing for a little while now and i know basically all of the other locals    it literally goes like this  you try a route that you cant quite get or you try one that other people are trying  ask someone else whos trying the route for advice or offer them tips on what you have been trying  try that advice give him props when one of you gets it  see that person the next time chat them up hey hows it going have any projects youre working on cool let me try it too    it sounds like a painful social situation but its honestly not plus you dont have to keep eye contact its normal to look up at a route or other people climbing while talking to someone and if youre too shy or whatever just try shit on your own and someone else is bound to come over and chat you up because its the thing to do at a climbing gym its not like a regular gym trust me    its also cheap to start up for bouldering you really just need to buy the shoes which run around 150 cad and some chalk and a chalk bag but a lot of gyms provide the chalk for you then the gym membership depends on where you go but is usually about the same price as a normal gym
  but they are failing as parents by enabling you to live this way  probably    you dont know you havent asked  its not a small company its part of something bigger and moving up depends on kissing the right ass and doing unpaid labour and the supervisor position is literally a quid extra on top per hour its not really a place for moving up but yeah looking for another job ill do that    and now that i think about it why arent you hanging out with your coworkers  literally all old tired immigrants and couple of students who disappeared after the work got too much for them    thats a horrible way to look at it  theyre not great people no really other way of looking at it      maybe
  it does get harder with age op try to join groups use meet up or create your own group as others said having things in common with others opens the door to friendships        that autistic poster telling everyone to have children in every thread  having children is an easy hack if you are sufficiently mindless to have no other aspirations or goals in life op
alright man i hope you fix your life your general outlook is too negative and you have too many excuses for why things arent working out if theres any takeaway from what i told you it should be that it will take more work than you can imagine because of how comfortable you are with your current living situation you cant imagine yourself being more than you are i truly hope that changes i dont think a random asshole on the internet will change that but its worth a shot
  it should be that it will take more work than you can imagine because of how comfortable you are with your current living situation  it would help if i could meet people in the same situation as me irl but i guess meeting other 30something social outcasts would theyre just as broken as me      use meet up  has anyone here actually tried that
  ill paint warhammer figures with you anon afterwards we can wank each other off crying silently about our lack of human contact while we orgasm
  ill pass
  you guys cant create dependencies at your age  its one thing when youre a child a teen or even 21  but at 30 dependency is no longer sustainable you arent dealing with romance is unfair or i wish i could buy all the candy you deal with advanced philosophical quandary which takes more than one night of listening to resolve  all this while your output is at an alltime low considering 30 years old is about the time to become sort of a lynchpin in your own life with at least the potential to do it for another at your rate youll be in bins at 35 making those good boy reee posts a reality    i hate to shit all over the parade here but the behavior is no longer healthy or conducive the sooner you admit to yourself the steps to change can be taken anytime the journey to improve will take all my life no matter its length the sooner you can hold your own life in your hands again    its what humans want what they strive for dont stop yourself up like this 4chan discord hugboxes and echo chambers in general these only slow you down and hurt you by reinforcing negative attributes and behaviors  get out there get your life back itll be long and hard to accomplish but itll be worth it
  get out there get your life back itll be long and hard to accomplish but itll be worth it  id thought meeting irl sad sacks in a hobby group would help so you advise against it
  i dont know that you need to hang around people who encourage the behaviors  you are a product of never leaving your comfort zone for consistent and enduring periods of time
  30yo boomer who still x memes cut deep
  i feel like it would be helpful meeting real people my age even if they are sadsacks     you are a product of never leaving your comfort zone for consistent and enduring periods of time  i know i know what would you say is a concrete path
  i mean like it has to be better than talking to sadsacks behind a screen right
  shit like yugioh mtg lan events are all full of normies    dude if you approach that with that attitude then youre also going to walk into a warhammer shop or a modeltrain store or a tai chi class or a birdwatching group or furry convention or icp concert and still go wow look at all the normies    i hate using the word but that is a toxic attitude people who play card games are not normies nor a single one of them also that whole i cant talk to anyone because they already have a social circle thing is some shit that you should have gotten over when you were in first grade or kindergarten    also theres always martial arts if youre still hanging onto that fear that youll walk in and no one will want to train and spar with you because everyone there is a ufc chad and normies reeee then join a chinese martial arts class anyone who takes kung fu or something is so far down the autism hole they cant even see the light anymore      i know because i did all those things and still do    oh and yes obviously 4chan is shit and has been for years now you share the website with literal kids like 16 year olds if not younger that are old enough to be your own kids they get upset at dumb things that were made up a couple of years ago like reddit spacing and theyre the ones who brought in all this sjw vs alt right shit
this is a 30 thread why is it full of manchildren
  people who play card games are not normies nor a single one of them   im gonna have to attempt to go to some kind of event to meet people eventually but you cant tell me that most things like mtg yugioh lan parties and the people who go to those things arent normies im not reeeing im just saying geek has become mainstream enough for them to be not outcast like before
  how is that a bad thing you no longer feel like you have your own special sikrit club
  but you cant tell me that most things like mtg yugioh lan parties and the people who go to those things arent normies    theyre not i dont know what normie means in your book and how much time you spent taking r9k memes to heart but people who are into things like tcg and larp and tabletop games are not normies if yugioh was for normies then they would have that shit in night clubs and music festivals most people normal people the norm aka normies dont play collectible card games they might play some video games like fifa on the xbox or fornite and they might play card games like poker or blackjack if they really have nothing better to do but they certainly dont play tcgs    im just saying geek has become mainstream enough for them to be not outcast like before    it was the exact same thing 20 years ago when we were kids just because theyre outcast from pop culture and the cool kids lunch table that doesnt mean that they cant bond over a common interests or hobby or start their own group    the only difference is that its more obvious now with things like youtube
  theyre not i dont know what normie means in your book and how much time you spent taking r9k memes to heart but people who are into things like tcg and larp and tabletop games are not normies  im not reading from the r9k handbook theyre normie in the sense that they have enough social skills to fit in elsewhere im not saying theyre fake geeks    it was the exact same thing 20 years ago when we were kids  no it isnt maybe for you where you always had a group of nerds when i was at school it was literally just me interested in this shit and you cant do much by yourself       you no longer feel like you have your own special sikrit club  in a sense yes i mean its cool for the younger nerds to be part of the mainstream but now i have to climb up to the level of mainstream
  youre a 35 year olds wet dream
  theyre normie in the sense that they have enough social skills to fit in elsewhere    its not even about having a social skill 99 of the people there arent even there to even try and make friends they just want to play the game the only thing that keeps them together is the game or activity i have so little in common with so many of the people that i spend a few hours a week with on the clubs and groups im a part of i wouldnt want to hang out with them casually outside of those settings either it has nothing to do with social skills they dont fit in they just hang out with each other by default    no it isnt maybe for you where you always had a group of nerds when i was at school it was literally just me interested in this shit and you cant do much by yourself     well now you get to do it now but instead youre sitting here complaining about normies
  99 of the people there arent even there to even try and make friends they just want to play the game the only thing that keeps them together is the game or activity i have so little in common with so many of the people  so now youre telling me even these things are pointless in making friends which is it
  no im not planning anything like that just the first thing that came to my head when i read your post
  go out dummy go to a bar go to a cafe if you cant stand bars or are too much of a teetotaler pussy to sit at a bar and drink seltzer become a regular at places so people recognize you and say hi and talk to you when you go there    im in my 40s and i have to remind myself to do this from time to time i have a family so i dont really need to but over time i start to lose the feeling that you have friends and acquaintances and a neighborhood i go to all the cafes around here and bring my kid with me so that he learns the value of being a part of a neighborhood and not some random gta bystander ive been going to this one place for a year and i know everybody there now none of the other clientele are like this so i wind up just talking to the employees but at least i have someplace to go where i feel welcome and can talk to someone other than my family    as for 4chan ive never been called out for my age here or maybe i did and havent noticed because the average age here is higher than you think and once youre an adult you dont mind being chided for it by younger people im not saying that to shame you im saying stick with it and dont let the age difference get to you this is all thats left of the old good internet and we need to hold on to it and defend it
  get into modding cars and going to trackdays full of 30 socially retarded people
  im saying that if you go out to an activity full of socially stunted or literally autistic people then odds are you wont find that many that are charismatic social butterflies with loads of friends    at the very least it gets you out of the house on weekends and you have something to do    if you want to make loads of friends then dont go to the places that are full of socially retarded old nerds in your own words go somewhere where youll find actual normies
  fuck shes cute
  know who she is
i feel guilty for even wanting a partner as i know that people are not things to be owned i deserve only to work until i am no longer able to contribute to society and then to die alone i should be grateful that i am even allowed that
  wat
  deep down i want there to be someone i can make happy the idea itself is flawed i cannot make someone experience happiness and the idea of attempting to force such happiness on someone in order to achieve some perverse desire is a clear indicator of how sick i am a healthy person would find fulfillment from within and meaningful relationships between healthy welladjusted individually would come naturally
be 30  for whatever reason cannot tell peoples age  like at all  flirting with someone who i thought was in their early 30s  they say i am a little to young for them  ask how old they are  52  well fuck  talking to another person  assume late 20s  find out they are 17  nope the fuck out of there  afraid to approach any more woman now    how do i fix this shit before it gets me in trouble do women actually hate people asking their age the fuck is wrong with me
  50  17    how are you making these fails
  that girl looks 15 though
  asians probably i once dated a 30 year old asian woman when i was 19 thinking she was the same age as me
  ill bite at this as well    i rent i live alone on a two bedroom its mostly two bedrooms here  slightly overweight i run in the summer but still eat like shit  id like to try dnd it sounds fun and is sort of mainstream now there are people at work who play that or there were  retail i mostly drive a forklift and sell things  i like making things driving reading vista and some cooking  i know no one from high school hung out with the outcasts though the school lacked the cliquiness most of you describe in high school grammar school moreso  i have strong hermetic tendencies probably resulting from avoidant personality or some fucky social anxiety thing
  shit and guns i like guns but am not a gun nut
  shit like yugioh mtg lan events are all full of normies  why cant you make friends with normies     also board game groups are popping up everywhere try that
  though the school lacked the cliquiness most of you describe in high school  me too there may have been a group of castoffs but there were no cliques maybe its an american thing though i find out way after the fact that the other schools just outside the area had special interest groups and clubs i think the most we had was a chess club that shutdown cos nobody came to it
      i think    im slowly but surely losing my ability to tell peoples faces apart  plus these girls all photoshop themselves alike
bump
  i heard warhammer figurine painting is the last holdout of the socially retarded old nerds  jesus that sounds more depressing than anything else ive heard   and why on earth would you want to talk people your age   t40
warhammer    yeah i did that for a bit still enjoy it still paint but holy fuck the people are insufferable desu only really go in to talk to the manager since he is a really nice guy
  if you asked this question maybe 8 or so years ago youd get a better response frankly this internet communication stuff has really gone to shit
  can you faggots not use sn or something   jesus fucking christ the source is literally one click away
  i guess to have more common ground i mean with things as they are now i have exactly the same social standing inside one of these things as outside in the wider world
bump
if you are still painting figurines you are borderline mentally retarded the fuck are you talking about dude  like hey where can grown ass adults go to play tag there is no imagination left in this world  in case you havent noticed everything is already explored and established if you arent already in the upper class you are just left with a basically socialist system where its so rigged you can go to a bank for almost any low class job and they will break down exactly how long it will take you to retire your recreation has nothing at all to do with the current situation this is a fucking plantation there is a constant theme among all these people who are lost in this gay world they want to do all this stuff but theres nowhere to go i love how you think these people will bypass all laws with mafias paying off congressmen lawyers judges police and invade any country that tries to slightly deviate from the norm but they are going to let joe the figurine painter start his own world no everything is rigged and gasp the people who have been playing human centipede and eating shit out of every ass they see to the top are the ones who are content im sick of seeing the same fucking posts every day  yeah no shit shit is fucked its called social engineering you cant even just open a lemonade stand without a trillion vampires throwing all these hurdles in your way
  take your fucking antipsychotic you goddamn pseud
  contemplate the possibility that speaking exclusively with people who struggle with the same things you do is the antithesis to progress i mean for example if i wanted to learn how to fix motorcycles what benefit would there be for me to exclusively spend my time with people who are at the same level of motorcycle knowledge as i am your comfort zone is not doing you any favors
  youre such an epic woke dude how constructive and helpful of you to point out what is common sense to 98 of the world
  everything hurts so much i feel so alone
  your comfort zone is not doing you any favors  why is everything such a fucking steep incline at this point    like i have this image in my head of when these places were small things and it was just small groups of socially awkward nerds bonding and building their social skills but i guess youre right a group of socially retarded late 20/30somethings in what is an orphaned for now itll probably also get sucked up into the mainstream hobby has little social mobility
been a fuck up for many years now both of my parents failed me over the years and i tried to become self made to break away from their legacy worked in marketing as a copywriter but lost my job because my boss was a crook and embezzled money was down for a long time but now im picking myself up    im focusing on happiness and getting into it got a full time job at staples and although its degrading its something my worst feeling is that i dont feel like i can connect to people i am sociable but i find most of the people i meet are awkward or stilted in conversation how do i connect with the right people and focus on my goals hope to do my a cert soon and thinking about moving cities for help desk support doubt im gonna find a career and happiness at staples any advice
  most people your age are married with families they have careers that suck up time too its too late to do things like party or hang out leisure time is over after 30 and its time to be serious you shouldnt be socially retarded either by your age but sophisticated instead are your parents overbearing/controlling or are you just lazy
  leisure time is over after 30  bull fucking shit what gave you that idea how old are you
  25 and its just a fact that adulthood is about the gradual loss of fun and time if you dont have a career and wife by 30 youre alone you wont have anymore friends anymore free time your health drops etc
  no one asked for advice from a 25 year old you still dont know shit at that age dont even think you do
  gyms are for fags
  lol what you can do whatever you like at whatever age you like

31  neet of 10 years  still live with mother  no money  severe mental illness  taking mountains of antidepressants and still suicidal  spend most of the day sleeping  every waking moment is pain  havent left home except to go to the supermarket in years  not a single friend  didnt finish university due to depression so no qualifications  tried a dozen different therapies and the situation only gets worse  im so scared i feel like im really close to the moment where its too unbearable and i will kms  i dont have the strength to fix things on my own i need someone to help me
  man you need to change start small why dont you do some pushups today what about some exercies a walk in the street how about talking to strangers a shower seems fine too i tell you start small and do small thing each day and one day in the future you will be laughing at this
  good luck anon youll make it      what did you study anon  what do you think people should do in order to help you
  i used to study japanese language and literature i was doing great until depression hit i had the idea of going back to university but after all these years id have to pay 6500 in taxes which i dont have  i just need a therapy that works i cant function like this if therapy helps even just a little bit then i can do things like leave the house
  okay kid you know better about life in your 30s than those of us actually in our 30s
  this thread just reminded me of my own coming of age into my 30s this month along with the realization that people dont have to treat you well just because you treat them well cant believe it took me three decades to realize this lol
  along with the realization that people dont have to treat you well just because you treat them well cant believe it took me three decades to realize this lol  how did that change your behaviour im not quite sure i get you
  i mean its cool for the younger nerds to be part of the mainstream but now i have to climb up to the level of mainstream  jigga you crazy its almost 2019   we live in a very socially diverse world if you groom yourself decently dont wear edgy shirts and approach people with the intention of finding something in common but with no ill will if they arent equally interested you can socialize with whoever you want
  if you dont have a career or a wife and therefore no kids what exactly is going to eat up your free time then
  i am sociable but i find most of the people i meet are awkward or stilted in conversation  the people or you
      im 46 and hes right i spent my early 30s partying and meeting new people and i was able to do this only because i was newly divorced from a long bad codependent relationship and i fucking had to  and thank fuck i had a lot of money saved plus help from a very understanding family even then i lucked out finding a young girl who would have me and we only managed to make one kid and our financial situation sucks    and sure enough all my young friends started families and/or moved away today every single one of my reallife friends is either a parent i met at school or someone from the neighborhood every single one of my old friends is just ectoplasm on facebook    do not waste your young life drinking and sleeping around find a great woman start a family and put all your shit in order  then you can spend the rest of your damned life drinking and sleeping around and not wake up one morning alone with a shitty job and with no grandkids
  i might be too eager to talk and connect i think that might be off putting im not sure
  single guys over 30 with nonmainstream hobbies arent just everywhere to be found    id suggest you find a sport that you can enjoy watching basketball is pure athleticism but hockey and football involve tactics and plays    id recommend hitting up some sports bars and finding a few chess partners to meet up with    if youre trying to play mtg with the kids as an old fuck its just going to be weird    poker chess sports are the mainstream id suggest meeting people through those and as you get to know people youll find out what other hobbies they have a few of them might have similar interests    try forming a group thats into strategy games in general not your niche interests and as that group grows you could have a dd night one night mtg another night warhammer poker night etc
34 female never had any form of relationship should i just do a hookup and not tell the guy or go to a matchmaker wanted kids but theres no white males only pajeets and negros help adv
  you know it doesnt have one extreme or the other theres plenty of people most people actually who able to balance leisure and responsibilities theyre able to party when theyre young while also focusing on studies and longterm relationships and when theyre older adults theyre still able to balance that    hes also a 25 year old zoomer whos pretending to know what life is like as a 30 year old
   to another person   late 20s   out they are 17   the fuck out of there    who cares as long as its legal and the two of you get along
  single guys over 30 with nonmainstream hobbies arent just everywhere to be found    someone please answer me this honestly if this was the 90s or even early 00s would the strategy of finding other people through geek hobbies as a 30something be viable
  maybe since hobby stores and lgs and lcs were more common but youd have the same problem that mostly younger people are into those hobbies
i spent my early 20s getting my education and career in order sure i can pay my bills and have a home but i am despised by everyone xers and boomers hate me for being a millennial other millennials hate me for not goofing off in their 20s as was custom for every generation before theirs including their own i have no friends i have never known love or intimacy i chose comfort and security over life but if i give it all up now then what was it all for
  nothing everything is full of normies the dream is dead go play golf or bowling something you can devote yourself to thats what i do
you all need to put this to paper and really think about it    take your life in multiple dimensions see picture so if you take these questions with the premise of the next three years where would it be with your capabilities and everything going the way you would want to and these are open questions so you can answer them any way you want theres no wrong    the next step is in three years if you give in to every temptation procrastinations alcohol partying or whatever how would your life then look thats a bit easier because everyone knows their personal hell in some way it will go down    you have your outline of the very best and the very worst with that you can start making goals on what to do to get closer towards the very best and not go towards the very worst sure its daunting to go towards the very best but at least daunting is less of a hellhole than going towards your very worst some people are just hopeful of their lives but not realistic life is suffering in either way but to be going towards a hellhole and fully knowing that suffering is all you deserved is a whole something else
im a tall fit navy officer  i havent had sex for 15 years    i dont know what to do
  babby discovers jordanp and eats it up
jbp has put it well to words so i only use his words as an example there are a ton of books setting up this same idea to get motivation in life towards the better it aint something new it does however show you what a whiney manbabies some people are and they dont like to be confronted by these things
  im 42 and hes wrong there are plenty of people in their 30s who are single or unmarried and enjoying life to its fullest
  in what shithole do you live lots of good quality single white men and women over here in europe
is it bad if im still virgin after 30
  not necessarily what is the reason you are
  ur insane
  i chose comfort and security over life but if i give it all up now then what was it all for  its not for anything in the first place its just living to die think about it all you did was grind for a more comfortable place to continue to grind from and in that grind were you enjoying anything    20s  its a specific period of your life where time age and money arent such huge obstacles to enjoyment i only realize after wasting my 20s just procrastinating the whole time      the dream is dead  its alive im just too old and the social level for it went up
  yes not the virginity itself persay the virginity is just an indicator of other problems with you
  i dont know really i guess i was busy with studying and working to try and meet someone  and being introverted didnt help either    oh shit
  then get to it and start catching up get on tinder and start swiping
  its not for anything in the first place its just living to die think about it all you did was grind for a more comfortable place to continue to grind from and in that grind were you enjoying anything  its all ive ever known i am not sure what i even want out of life anymore other than to stop hurting
  i tired it never got any match
  welcome to the club i suggest a deep think about your life
i can relate op 4chan is a place full of edgy kids for sure and im an oldfag and i should know better but even in the worst of the internet sometimes youd be able to find some decency     nowadays no one cares online or offline people are raised to be heartless and transitory im over 30 myself my friends are all scattered and unavailable and therefore inexistent my family is dying and a lifetime of disappointments has finally broken down the only safepoint i had amongst them im a nobody in my workplace im about to get married and my insecurities tell me i wont be able to make her happy i cant discuss some things with her or with anybody so ill probably carry the world inside my head to the grave    the idea of bringing a kid to the world seems bright in a good day when i see the good things in the world and it seems overwhelming every other day when i realize that the world is just worst because people are growing heartless    so no friends no family thinking im unworthy of love no prospect no hope im still alive and my fire is still burning but its getting weaker
  being a virgin in itself is fine nobody really gives a fuck about your virginity besides you and the occasional hookup if you have a mental/physical hangup preventing you from having sex then thats something you should work on but getting fucked wont fix that
  persay  per se    the absolute state of english speakers
  try again but with pics that are not shitty and a writeup that is not boring
  pics that are not shitty  like what
  there are plenty of people in their 30s who are single or unmarried and enjoying life to its fullest  single life in your 30s consist of hookups with single moms and playing ps4 games unless youre a gymbro with cash you wont get much else    its a specific period of your life where time age and money arent such huge obstacles to enjoyment  the thing about your 20s is most of the things you can enjoy dont require much money you dont need to be loaded to go to parties or hookup with thots or just go wild the fun things you do in your 30s and up are all expensive
  are you that 25 year old zoomer who thinks he knows what life in your 30s is like better than people actually in their 30s because everything you said is wrong and retarded you dont have the slightest clue about what being single in your 30s is like
  nobody really gives a fuck about your virginity besides you and the occasional hookup  no woman wants a 30 virgin if they even sense it theyll go running for the hills    4chan is a place full of edgy kids for sure  its strange how this website consistently grabs a new demographic every 5 or so years newgrounds is dead ytmnd is dead something awful is a distant memory but you can rest assured the next wave of socially inept shut ins will find a place in 4chan
  you are just making excuses for not trying you dont actually want a gf or sex
  are you that 25 year old zoomer who thinks he knows what life in your 30s is like better than people actually in their 30s  its a fact backed up by evidence your 30s is a time of decline and its only a matter of degree some people decline rapidly and will see their lives become one big tedious march to the grave others will be slightly less radiant humans arent lobsters or jellyfish to age is to decline
  complete list of things you can do in your 20s but not your 30s      you are a fucking idiot
  post that evidence
  no woman wants a 30 virgin  nah thats teenager logic plenty of women will fuck a 30 virgin some older christfags even prefer waiting until marriage virgins might get sneered at if a woman is only looking for a quick fuck but thankfully those arent the kind of people anybody should be sleeping with anyways
  why is it hard to make friends after 30      dating in your 30s sucks      and of course your health goes to shit after 30      the science is in and aging sucks all you can do after 30 is wait for the grave especially the basement dwellers with no career or wife
  you are literally cherrypicking articles that are purely opinions not evidence what is your autistic obsession with this i detect that you have some desperate need to put down people just a hint you should pick easy targets if you want that because no adult will do anything but laugh at your pitiful childlike attempts sure keep on believing what you want meanwhile people in their 30s are enjoying life the rants of a 25 year old basement dwelling virgin isnt going to change reality
  im just stating the facts about realityif its depressing to you so be it adults understand optimism is foolish you should always expect the worse to happen in life
  you are not stating facts you posted links that were opinions and example stories why do you have this desperate need to try to drag people down to your level you should be on   not here
  get on tinder  i really dont think tinder is something for people in our predicaments
    cringe  just let it die loser
  cringe
  pajeets  negros  not surprised youre a singleton spinster
nearing 30 and want to have a family the guys i dated never wanted to commit never had sex with them since im a virgin and want to wait for marriage wtf do i do
  gee i wonder why they didnt want to commit its almost as if no one wants to jump into marriage with someone who is so selfish and uncaring that she does not want to have sex with them and leads them on with vague promises    find someone from church who will be okay with always being second fiddle to jesus
  no it isnt its selfish to want to get me into bed regardless of what i said its disrespectful actually
i was abused i devalue myself internally a lot very sorry for reacting to life by being a worthless coward my purpose is to be the lowest of the low my feelings tell me what to do like a scared child its how i learned to live who can stand a guy like that im embarassed to exist  sorry im afraid these claims could actually be a narcissistic passive aggressive attempt at manipulating people with sympathy just want to test wihat you think before i try to do something about it because i need to be sure not to unconsciously screw up another attempt at getting help i should probably kill myself but we all know thats out of the question im just trying to prevent or at least minimize the damage im causing  25m chronic depression
please dont play the chronic depression card when you possibly havent officially been diagnosed with it feeling shitty of your life because of your low selfesteem for multiple years is not chronic depression also go find help with someone qualified to help you otherwise that selfesteem surely wont change can you honestly answer yourself if hearing from people on this board to not feel like the absolute bottom of the barrel human being of society will help you indeed go find some professional help please this aint something that will change in one day few months or a year it needs continues work and investment in yourself
the people i meet can be broadly divided into two categories one group doesnt care about the direction of their life lives for the moment sex drugs etc the second group is focused on the future and tend to be very unadventurous and to be frank kind of boring    personally i feel that im somewhere in between i indulge in things that make upstanding people feel boring but at the same time i dont feel right hanging around people with no aspirations    does anyone else know this feel apologies if im coming off as fedora tier but its something thats been kicking around in my head lately
  i have similar experiences and feelings op but i have no real advice shit was summer as a kid  i guess figure out who is less off putting to you but know there are others in the middle like you
hey /adv/    be me  20m   khhv never had a gf  trans but not a trap  4/10 guy barely any friends no life  dropped out of uni because depression  temp staff in retail treated like shit  dont celebrate christmas but family forces me    that time of year has come again where my already severe depression gets even worse my job treats me like shit my family expects me to spend my wages on presents i have no motivation to do anything dont take care of myself etc     very little money   live at home want to move out   want a real career but dont know what   want to take better care of myself and become trap   cant leave country because on waiting list for hrt   no work experience in my first job   crazy suicidal and depression all the time    i feel like shit all the time but im not an sjwfag either my depression and anxiety are diagnosed by psychology as is my gender dysphoria im totally straight and will be a lesbian when girl    what do
  uk can you go to a private clinic for your hrt script try staying off 4chan its notoriously bad for the health of trans people take a look at out resident /lgbt/ board can you see a therapist khhv is pretty common for people with queer people before they discover it especially if your perception of yourself and peoples perception of you isnt so great
im irish so the only way to get hrt is years of therapy privately then an assessment from them to take to your gp for more therapy then an assessment from them then send that off and wait for the 1 place in the whole country to get back to you in like 25 years im 156 on the waiting list and they process like 4 cases a month
all scenarios i react to my general toughs rarely comes out verbally  not out of any fear or self doubt it just doesnt come natural to me  at times i catch myself blabbering out nonsense upbeat excitement bs as a way to seem normal and i have a sneaking suspicion that people know its bs  i dont have a public image this selfmade thing that i pride myself on and im not talking achievements just general smalltalk  is this an ingrained personal trait or can it be fixed
you sound autistic i dont mean that as an insult but if you are it can be helpful to know you can   go to a specialist and/or read blogs or books if you cant afford one you might find some help there
visuddha
  i dont really have much to say other than thank you you put it to words beautifully    just know theres more people with this problem out there
i myself am not very articulate so i can understand your frustration  i can only speak for myself but the main cause of my problem was due to me rarely speaking  to this day i still have issues expressing myself but to a slightly lesser degree i talk a tiny bit more nowadays
ive been dating my boyfriend for over 4 years now he was my first kiss and the only man ive been with i love him but also have thoughts of kissing and being with other guys should i feel guilty for this i cant imagine being without him but also feel like im missing out by not experiencing things with other guys
  ahem  thot
im a guy and ive thought the same things many times and i dont think its a bad thing at all if you have a strong relationship then the feelings will probably go away
  dont pretend you didnt post this bait
  im kinda in the reverse position of youive been with my gf for about 3 years and she is the first person ive fallen in love with or kissed she also took my virginity 3ish years ago i have similar thoughts about if i am missing out its normal to have doubts but im loyal to my gf and have not cheated on her because these thoughts dont matter the way i see it some people find happiness on the first try others have to search a few times  and some spend their whole lives i was lucky enough that my first gf is the one i want to spend my life with even though she is my first we are happy
dude you were given eyes for a reason the thing is you can enjoy a view but dont touch dont do something youll regret but you can look and enjoy it
i think its normal my boyfriend is also the only man ive ever been with and at some point i did wonder what i was missing since almost all my friends were at their fourth or fifth boyfriend/hookup    i got over those thoughts though since my boyfriend is an amazing man kind smart handsome funny the sex is great what more could i want if youre happy in your relationship dont fuck it up just because of curiosity chances are the grass is not greener on the other side look dont touch and dont let it become an obsession of what if
  should i feel guilty for this  yes    feel like im missing out by not experiencing things with other guys  thats the price of a relationship that we all pay
ask yourself if the devil you know is better than the one you dont if it is then harden the fuck up and get over it
  hypergamy
    oh go stick your hypergamy up your arse ops issue is far more of a male one than a female one men get far more and give into far more pressure to play the field
  why do so many retards come by here wondering if the first person they ever dated also happens to be the only person theyll ever be capable of loving can someone give me advice on this
op its normal but just remember that you can only choose one a happy stable solid relationship or experience     its ok to check out other guys and think theyre attractive just remember that you have something better than that  ugly chicks can get hot dudes to fuck them on tinder but not every girl gets a happy relationship     have fun with your imagination then get back to loving your man be grateful and count your blessings
also ask yourself what other guys can give you that he doesnt if you cant think of the answer then theres your answer youre being irrational just stay with him
  i think its more about doing the deed than thinking about it if you really love him and your relationship its doing good keep those thoughts to yourself and dont act on them
  i say go for it you get one life why not experience everything that it has to offer
  its normal thats just your biological defenses protecting you from settling with a beta just because he was the easy choice
  because traditionally people have been expected to only date one person and someone raised with those morals naturally looks to justify their predetermined opinion no matter how irrational and incompatible with reality it is
  do you think of these guys as in you want to trade up or you just think of them every now and then
  time to break up and go ride some fresh dick
  hi op     have you ever heard of the 80/20 rule   in any relationship 80 of the time you have everything you want/need in that person 20 you dont so when that 20 comes walking by it looks really good until you leave the 80 for the 20 and find out how dumb you were     its natural to have these feelings we are all human i promise you youre not missing much by not being with other men if you have a good thing emotionally and physically stick to it
i have a bf i love but i dont really enjoy sex all my life i was convinced i was bi if not full les hes my first relationship but i feel im missing out on a lot at the same time i dont want to break up with him what do
  im gonna get real frick frackin personal here so listen up i had a highschool sweetheart long ago and we were going great but she decided that she needed to experience more than one man to verify she wanted me forever ya wannna know what happened she caught herpies she caught hpv and she begged for me to take her back thinking i would settle for a std ridden whore you wanna go fuck around and taste some new cock go for it but you will never get your man back if he even has a shred of self respect and you will never have a lasting relationship afterwards good luck
  break up with him youve tricked yourself into accepting the status quo because youre afraid of the unknown if you think you might be les while in a straight relationship chances are you are the single gayest girl in your entire town stop putting off the best decision in your life and break up with him
  typical tell him you want strange dick manipulate him into being home one of his best friends fuck his friend really good and show him how much you enjoy it he will either accept it and you or he wont stop right now telling him your lies
im in the reverse position as well    my gf of 4 years broke up with me two weeks ago because she wanted to explore without having to cheat on me and wanted to be honest with me    she told me about a couple days ago that shes had sex with other guys but theyre not the same as me she likes my personality better and she even told me that even though she was the one that wanted and initiated the sex that its just sex and she doesnt think she can find someone quite like me    my ex gf probably thinks she can talk to these men and get me whenever she wants because we love each other a lot and while i do love her im really on the fence about taking her back if it comes to it its just the act of forsaking our relationship just for sex and how it came so easily i can honestly say that it really scarred our relationship and i dont see her the same way anymore    even though i told her i still would and i still love her she just seems like a ho to me now even though i have to think of her like that i just dont know if i should take her back cause trust me anons i really love this girl and she loves me she just wants to explore for now and trust me i feel really stupid for even thinking of taking her back    sorry for the text dump but think of how it affected me this much  trust me you might never see this guy again any advice for me at all though anons
  well definitely dont take her back now youre going to be too insecure over the body count disparity and it wont work  try banging a couple of chicks and see how you feel three possibilities here  1 you forget about her and move on  2 she gets hypocritically jealous and stops talking to you or pitches a fit  3 against all the odds you get back together    it wont be the same but at least make sure you get some notches on the bedpost too
  this is legit the best advice ive heard about my situation i have been looking for women to bed but havent had much luck    like i go on meetme but not even the average girls converse with me i usually only get propositions for sex for money which i dont want to do    i dont really know where to meet regular women irl i was thinking of going on bumble but does that even work and all the girls i talked to before are either in relationships or a single mother that focuses on their kid and swears off men trust me im really trying and i dont think im unattractive if im being honest it might be because i was a late bloomer so i look good and have a sense of humor im just not that good at being suave or a player like how my looks suggest
    then meet other guys without telling him what he doesnt know wont hurt him and your mind will be at ease unless you realize that most other dudes are better than your boyfriend in that case youll be relieved to trade up
  i dont have very good advice there not much of a player myself i dont go out much and have no idea where to meet women i met three of my past gfs at work lmao  my most recent ex i actually met off of 4chan /soc/
how do i get over the emotional pain of getting completely rejected from your first love /adv/ it ended recently after eleven months i know not too long but it was my first he wanted to remain friends at first but i was too emotional and he assumed i was trying to make him feel guilty because of how other people were treating him i tried my best to keep it civil but he saw things different the possibility of friendship turned into no contact then after a month of no contact he finally blocks me from all sns and probably my number too i know its for the better but i feel so lost right now
  saved heres a friendly rival
just get a new bf  nice wallpapers tho
    wrong size      i just dont want to be shitty to someone by rebound not that id intentionally be abusive but i can see myself being distant because i yearn for my ex
  then dont start anything serious  say theyre rebound from the start
  excuse me for being the hopeless romantic but ive read so many times flings feel overly shallow once finished plus i miss the companionship in the relationship and not many guys in a fling really give a shit about you
  the only alternative is moping about him
  sure but wouldnt finding methods to cope after the trauma help more than burrying your sorrows in another relationship
  it just takes time finding a hobby or something to take your mind off him usually helps
  the best way to get the fuck over it is by claiming your independence and doing positive independent based things   gym/workout  shopping therapy get nails done hair done  pick up a hobby   and most importantly keep busy     he obviously doesnt care about you and yes it sucks but hes not the only guy in the world and we accept the love we think we deserve if you think you deserve someone who treats you that way then it speaks volumes about you and how you need to work on yourself  hope this helps sorry if it was harsh im just blunt
  oh and i know females be doing this but dont go on any of his social media  delete any memory of him from your social media and phone if you keep looking at his shit or old memories youre literally setting yourself up for failure to move on
why dont you do simple normal thing and start to hate him for rejecting you  stockolm syndrom         from my own experience there is often a time when starting over with someone else where you will be comparing them with the missing ex this will happen even if you take time to recover because as long as youve not experienced something different he will be the only reference you have    this is perfectly understandable by the more mature part of guys dont worry too much about it
  just get a rebound
    definitely been getting back in touch with more active creative hobbies slowly forcing myself out of the rut to get started is always a trouble but once started i can go for hours should really start exercising again not overweight but to get back into the swing of things in response to the second anon lowself esteem is ironically once of the reasons it probably ended      yeah already did that on the first day didnt delete anything permanently but stored everything digital on a usb out of sight then moved that along with other physical possessions into a box
  why not get angry    i am a little but most of my sorrow comes from the fact that i feel guilty the relationship ended because of my mistake i didnt cheat abuse him or try to control his behavior but my own insecurity was the root of the problem    stockholm syndrom    mostly denial and having a hard time letting go of your first love that fun shit
ok i need some serious advice    long story short  3 years ago i moved abroad i had some friends in london so i decided to come here the first 3 months were quite busy and a lot of fun going to work coming back smoking weed with my mates and so on after that ive met my then gf and i decided to settle down and move in with her i still kept in touch with my mates but it wasnt the same as before they still continued to go out and so on though fastforward 2 years theyve moved to spain i broke up with my gf 5 months ago i manage to get a nice job and a nice place to live but i have no friends and my ex gf is out there drinking with friends somewhere probably meeting some guy i feel terribly alone most people i approach seem awkward as hell with me around i dont know if they fear me or what i just feel sad and lonely im regularly hitting the gym to cheer myself up but its getting quite routinary and i still dont have the physique to approach any girl there as most of the guys are more ripped than me and of course the girls go after them first i would like to go out right now with someone at least just to avoid this crippling loneliness but theres no one all of my friends live abroad how can i get out of this shit im in
hey /adv/ i havent really been on this board before but would really like your help and from what i have perused this seems like a place where i may get a serious answer    how do i not cheat i love my girlfriend shes amazing and treats me better than i deserve being with her makes me happy and she values me a lot i know i shouldnt cheat but i was never popular with women when i was younger and ive developed some kind of complex about it    i had completely innocent business with this attractive young legal girl and we agreed to meet for lunch to go over things she changed that into us hanging out that afternoon and im fairly sure she is into me a stronger man than i would have no concerns over this how do i resist doing what i know i shouldnt do
youll find out whether or not your a good person or not we cant help you at all if you really love your girlfriend these thoughts would be suppressed your musnt be forfilled
  be a good person become better
i got a famous caught taking drugs with me i told me friends he was with me and they reported him to his work company im scared for my life now what will i do 
move out of the neighborhood drug dealers are losers
  he isnt a dealer just was snorting cocaine but ges famous so im scared
  he is famous  who was it anon
snooped through gfs imessage found a ton of inappropriate shit said to a male friend of hers stuff like   youre fucking hot   only if i can give you head jk   you think id want to fuck an ugly person     this was months ago and weve been dating for a little over 15 yrs how much should i blow up on her for it
update to this shit it was in november not months ago
  god damn man im sorry for you id say just end it dont even give her shit about it take her out for a last fuck if you are into that and then just drop her if you are lucky you will at least be able to break her heart
  i think ghosting people over disagreements is awful but ghosting someone over cheating is based the most based thing you can do is just never talk to her again if youre worried about that being cruel or immoral just tell her you saw the text messages and then ghost her
  the info youre giving is very ambiguous are you saying she was genuinely messaging a guy about hooking up while you two were together
    i dont think she cheated the guy is her best friends bf but its fucking rage inducing and suspicious as fuck
  theres no reason to blow up that will give her an excuse to play the victim and feel good about leaving you if you want to be vindictive realize what women truly want is attention which puts you in the advantageous position never explain what you saw or fight her over it or tell her about it dont talk to her ever again and she will torture herself wondering what she did and the uncertainty and lack of closure will actually effect her more than any fight could
  you think she may have cheated well i guess give a more measured reaponse then if you two are casual maybe just leave it if youve got some kind of passionate romance or potential marriage going on id take a moment to evaluate why youre with her if you do decide to break up tell her not in these exact words that its over her thottery
  also this post here kinds of makes things more ambiguous are you saying she teasted him about not wanting to suck his dick like are these people alchy and they just openly ask each other to give head
  tell the best friend
  this is the exact conversation i think things were either said over the phone or deleted    him that is a completely true statement  can i still drive your car tho    her yes hahaha  only if i can give you head  i am totally joking  dont hate me but it was a good opportunity    him lmao no as soon as i typed my sentence i thought to myself wow that joke would fit so perfectly
  that seems like a perfect idea but he seems to mostly passive about the whole thing
  yeah thats highly suspicious i stand by  whatever you do dont blow up at all        if you cant do faux monogamy then simply peace out and try to find one of the 1/2 or 1/3 partners who wont cheat
  yeah youre right its just that everything was going so well recently too ill keep my cool
  yeah im kind of a hopeless romantic with old fashioned ideas so it really hurts me to know so many people are hoes not to mention ex girlfriends of mine who cheated    according to statistics unless you think these statistics were altered by the illuminati show that a large percentage of men are cheaters too im not a cheater so its hard to imagine that    i cant really imagine doing that to someone i love so i honestly assume that love is rare and that a lot of people are hoes and tools who only pretend to be in lovebut that sounds paranoid doesnt it maybe they only think theyre in love
  im in the same fucking boat i cant understand the mentality of throwing the relationship away
  what does the fucking hot guy look like
  not even a 6/10 lanky nerdy awkward as fuck im kinda pissed desu
  sounds like me
american women are whores

  ive never owned a car

cute chick in my class     pay no mind to it and we been in group classwork together     we never talked during class or anything     she now just got hired at my job     while on break    hey anon addressing me by my name how do i work this to punch out how is it working out here do you like it do you work tommorow joking around and bantering about work     what do i do now 
  nothing special has happened just socially interact with her like you normally would
just weird how she took initiative to talk to me and keep the convo going     but during class she wouldnt talk to me but not ignore me
  different environment just play it cool be a decent human being and dont expect anything if she is interested she will give you hints if you have questions about those come back and well answer those as well
  enjoy flirting together but dont let it develop into anything big unless youre planning on leaving that job    having a fun workplace crush makes it worth showing up for work you can see how the chemistry between you two are without needing to be put on the spot like you would on a date
no relationship while coworkers
test
  wrong
its a job ill have for the next 2 years maximum
im too sensitive by nature im a people pleaser people have secretive me as being the most likeable person they know and i have virtually no enemies cos i usually get along with everyone but when i fail to make that initial connection people usually shit on me cos im a pretty timid and a bit of a pushover otherwise earlier today my best friend called me a dumbass cos i was asking for help with something i dunno its really chewing at me anyone know how i can get a thicker skin when it comes to friends being mad at you
described not secretive
  you talk shit back to them but be careful it will be wrong if you turn it up too much always insult them just as much as they do when they call you a dembass call them faggots but never attack personal values of them
is it weird im glad to be nothing like my dad     hes a muscle head arms bigger than my legs very loud obnoxious and sells himself likes hes the best at everything when hes not hes super greedy and has even ripped me and my other 2 siblings off     im not like that at all i had to convince him that my anxiety and depression were a real thing and something i sadly needed medication for     now im no weak little bitch i hold my own im not frail i do flooring for a living but my attitude isnt like his and im glad its not     i try and help people and understand people i dont lie and i dont cheat people like he does     he can be a real asshole and was to me most of my life he gets in these super greedy modes and i cant stand being around him and you cant confront him about anything or he goes into a wild gorilla rage     pic not related somewhat soundproofed my door
  i try and help people and understand people i dont lie and i dont cheat people like he does    it seems you are a good person and your dad isnt  i too have a shitty dad and actually think about him as a good exemple of what i should never become
  yes its very common for children to resent their parents usually it means its time for you to move out and face the world on your own
  yeah basically how i feel     my pops basically raised me since my parents were drug addicts     i feel this way most likely since its coming up on pops death anniversary here in a few days
  i only live with them due to my dad having back surgery and mom had stage 4 breast cancer to help them with bills i moved back in im moving out again soon
i tried ass play due to some femdom/sissy fap roulette and i didnt like it  am i gay
 sissy roulette   am i gay    why are you even asking
  do you have or do you want to have sex with a man    if not youre not    /end thread
  the sissy shit stemmed from the femdom stuff  i just thought the sissy shit was being a slave to a woman i didnt know about the gay stuff  i would never want to be fucked or fuck a guy but imagining a mistress commanding a slave in chastity with girly clothes on was hot  what about sissy is gay      thank you anon
bump
second bump
  while it was initially unclear despite tilting towards faggotry after two shameless bumps of a garbage thread i can confidently declare that you have graduated into being a faggot
whats a fap roulette
  wait so that means i wasnt gay  yay 
  its an image that people reply to and you have tasks to do depending on the numbers you roll  so it would be like   1  jerk off for 20 mins  2  edge once  3  cum  and so on
long story short i want to make money and travel but im 28 and havent been able to go to college i tried for the navy when i was younger but had depression in hs and couldnt get a recruiter to touch me my brother works on a cruise ship as a lighting technician and seems to like his work i read up on this but got a lot of horror stories about how the pay is shit and wont go anywhere reading more i read about becoming a merchant marine and working on cargo ships does anyone have any input into this
better join the navy
  was it ever diagnosed depression    youll likely be underpayed in the navy too but at least on a cruise ship its less stressful and you can meet new people more often
  was it ever diagnosed depression  curious what constitutes diagnosis i had some therapist say i was depressed but i dont buy into that anymore how does anyone know it was all very casual  if i buy guns i plan on lying about this
yeah i was a cadet in the merchant navy ill tell you the basic roles for the deck side of things dont know much about the engine room crew  os  ordinary seaman  ab  able body seaman  3rd 2nd 1st officer  captain  if you want to be a deckhand youll start as an os doing basic grunt work such as securing cargo mooring operations anchor operations maintenance gangway watch and whatever else the officers decide on long sea trips things are usually a breeze unless you have to go tighten up cargo lashings constantly due to heavy weather in port dont expect much sleep youll be working with alot of filipinos/indians who almost get treated like second class citizens  abs are the next step up youll be doing the same as an os but on the bridge more doing watch with an officer at times youll also be in charge of steering the ship in pilotage at the officers orders  then from there you can attempt to become an officer for which you need a coc certificate of competency which is very difficult or easy depending on your country
  idk maybe call the doctor or someshit    but its only diagnosed if a doctor says you have it otherwise you obviously cant diagnose yourself and say youre diagnosed with something you dont know you have
  you have nothing to lose by trying out for a cruise ship if that doesnt work out try something else
  oh and theres also the bosun he reports to the 1st officer and finds out what he needs done then manages the os/ab to do it
  oh yeah so this was a therapist and not a real doctor but it did make its way back to my primary care doctor since i took ssris for a short time so its definitely in my records along with weed usage when i went to college and dropped off my medical records i hadnt looked at them but the lady at the college clinic glanced at it and said something about how they can help me with drug addiction and that caught me off guard  that shit pisses me off to no end and i dont like nor trust doctors anymore
  its spelt boatswain probably short for boatswains mate btw
  we always called it bosun and our first engineer was always called primo but i worked with mainly eastern europeans
  yeah the spellings different than how its pronounced like forecastle  i was just pointing it out thinking it wouldnt show up on internet searches but it does
  just say petty officer
  just know that shipping and cruise lines often violate workers rightsthats why many just employ third world citizens often you are required to work on your off time to be able to complete your assigned tasks you dont always get the best food very cramped closet crew quarters that are usually 4 to a cabin
im a dude addicted to porn and sex no shocker there but im having a hard time getting any action in real life    i understand that porn rots your brain and its not like real life but i dont give a fuck my issue is that for someone as degenerate and fucked in the head as me now why is that when i go out in public at uni i cant ever find the confidence to express my love for sex and lewd stuff around people all i want is to lose my anxiety and talk to thots at parties because i know without a doubt i could pull if i truly wanted to im into lots of people and lots of different things but ive got this weird voice in my head all the time telling me not to get more intimate with people not to try to find love and not to lose my virginity before i turn 21 in four months    tldr my body needs what my mind doesnt want
  something something projection youve gone so long without real things touch intimacy action itself that the prospect has become unknown to you  and well you know how it is with humans and the unknown dont you all that fear and inhibition
  sex is about actual human connection not just fantasies and fetishes
yeah but i had a girlfriend in my senior year of high school and we did everything under the sun except actual penetration i understand foreplay and seduction just fine not in a pua way either  but 3 years is a looooong fucking time man ive made out with a few girls at parties but never taken it further the one time i tried to grab a girls ass at a party while we kissed she did this stupid giggle and smacked my hand away like i had the plague it really fucked me up because she had just told me 5 seconds ago i was really cute    and i dunno im generally sincere and express my feelings in a coherent way to people but sometimes it seems like my peers want me to hide behind walls and hide my true self so we can be fake together i dont even know anymore    so lately ive been coping by doing lots of online erp it helps and i have lots of lewd online friends but it doesnt distract from the fact that i cant pull my bootstraps and get sexual activity in real life
  muh feelings  anon im trying to fuck sluts at university not find a soulmate ive been let down once and until im older and improve myself i refuse to settle with someone who inevitably fuck me over
  erp  just the last bastion of refuge before you admit youre your own problem  also tons of guys larp as women online coming from rp communities its because they get exorbitantly better prospects treatment and clemency  t larped as a girl for yeeeears
  ha jokes on you anon i larp as a girl just to fuck with guys because i have autogynephilia  you mentioned im my own problem could you expand on this i understand its true but i would greatly appreciate if i could have your opinion on this info put into words owo
  wear a im shy talk to me sign let the writing speak for you also print it out if you have shit handwriting
  you are not good at reading people facetoface human interaction is too chaotic for you you are much safer expressing things through words from the safety of your computer screen and real relationships dont work that way people in real life often give signals and cues rather than just directly writing out sentences to tell you what they want for example  the one time i tried to grab a girls ass at a party while we kissed she did this stupid giggle and smacked my hand away like i had the plague it really fucked me up  if she said you were cute and was willing to kiss you this was almost definitely not a real rejection you were still in the game and you didnt know it almost all girls will play hardtoget and act modest like this but it is an invitation for you to be bad you need to be able to tell the difference between stop and hahaha stopppp or else you just wont be able to navigate these things
  larp  larp is something like a war reenactment or renaissance fair shit online its just rp
  anon im trying to fuck sluts at university not find a soulmate ive been let down once and until im older and improve myself i refuse to settle with someone who inevitably fuck me over    you cant expecr that whilst jerking off multiple times a day and draining your sexual energy not to mention girls sense when you jerk off too muc h
some advice should i go    i was dumped like a month ago by my ex she going to this music festival for new years and i wanted to go to it too but now shes going with her friends and possibly new boyfriend just assuming    i am debating whether or not to go if i did id go solo its like a 6 hours drive there will be thousands of people there     i really dont wanna be at home for new years alone so i mean if anything i just plan on rolling really hard and not giving a fuck and plus i get to say i was there and had fun    i need to buy the ticket soon though itd be cool if i found someone to go with but im pretty alone and dont know anyone willing to make a trip like that with me
just go theres a huge chance you wont even see her or her friends and festivals are a great place to meet people if theres a chance to not give a fuck its certainly now go hard op
so there is that girl that rejected me 3 years ago i begged her cause i was young and stupid she started to hurt my feeling then deleted me and we didnt talk since then but i couldnt forget her i developed some masochism toward her i fantasize about being   her sexuel slave i have never felt this before   for another girl how could i make this happen
  call her and tell her that you are ready to be degraded
  is there any chance that she accepts i mean do girls like to do these kind of things
  lol no way in hell
how could i make this happen  lol you cant are you retarded or something
move the fuck on  theres at least a million other available women hotter and better than her
  did that come from a set
  why is it impossible     i know that i gave up about being her bf i just want some satisfaction only her could provide that     what
  the picture you posted fool
  idk found it on fb got only this one
  just use sn faggot it never fails
  obviously thats not what this is about nice all caps though
  why is it impossible   because she outright rejected you and actively avoided you for 3 years you better hope you glowed the fuck up and learned how to swoon a bitch over that time but judging by this thread you seem as young and stupid as you were then
  it clearly is about his oneitis  thanks btw
pic heavily related    i dont know where else to post this but please hear me out i think i really fucked up there  ill try to make it short but i owe up a large amount of money around 50k but the crazy interest rates made it so that i now have to pay 100k back to a shark loan and im supposed to meet the guy at a shitty overpriced french restaurant tomorrow the thing is as you may have already figured out i dont have enough money to repay him back wanna know whats worse i asked him for money with the objective to get rid of some gambling debts but ive used it all to gamble more losing all my bets of course even now i have a fuckton of lotto tickets and im waiting for the next drawing which is also happening tomorrow im fucking scared anons the guy is known in the field for his extreme violence when it comes to late payments the guy is gonna break my legs or worse i might have something that is worth enough to pay him off but thats pretty risky and illegal if he doesnt accept it consider me as good as dead   im making this thread to tell you goodbye basically if i dont make it i want at least to thank the anon if youre still around who told me to go into black market hacking thanks for trying to save my ass i guess
  im making this thread to tell you goodbye  oh ok goodbye
so  which newspaper do i have to read to learn about your future murder
  how bout you move/ start over
how much money do you have left including assets you could sell before he breaks your shit up
  i cant the man im dealing with has strong ties with the local mafia     at most id say 2k i wont be able to make it
  at least you got quads before you died oof 2k is hard if you even had 3k id tell you to get on a one way flight to phnom penh cambodia you can teach english there for a super generous salary for there plus hed never find you there ever
    dont forget to see your ontologist tomorrow op i heard you liked strong black coffee you liked it veeery strong tee hee
  you could make it on 2k but youre going to have to move with purpose and stay in a shit hostel until you have a job they pay once a month and will 100 not give you an advance
  leave california as soon as you can
  leave japanofornia as soon as you can  ftfy
  i know the restaurant youre talking about and the food there is really delicious and delicate like a little flower you dont know one thing about french gastronomy
once youre on the ship wait for the last moment and sell all your cards you will have 3 stars more money and no cards
  lmao this
  i got a loan from a loan shark  youre mega fucked the loan shark decides the rates decides the cost to you when you cant pay and did his homework on you before he gave you anything the value of anything you do offer him will be decided by him because he is taking it instead of money and its a buyers market youre buying nothing  chances are he knows where everyone you care about live because he can have power over you and take whatever he likes from you    pack essentials and drive as far away as you can cutting ties to everyone you might have to live out of your car for a while you ideally want to get 2 tanks of fuel away before you consider where you will go next  get a new phone number dont contact anyone from home regardless of how much you miss them  spend your nights crying wrapped in a blanket in your car afraid of every noise knowing you left your loved ones in the shit
kek i will be there to witness the trial about your murder in two days op    spoilerits impressive how of all places its on fucking /adv/ that i would be reminded that the events in ace attorney are happening in real time/spoiler
  this and dont trust the fat guy
  get a gun and shoot him then shoot yourself better to go down fighting and on your terms
you seem to have three options   1 get killed/ crippled  2 run away and live anonymously somewhere  3 go to the police but prolly end up in prison where mafia guys wont even wait until you drop soap in the shower     hintoption two is the only option
  its not illegal to borrow money from a loan shark hes not even obligated to pay the dude back if he loaned him the money without a lisence set up a sting call the police and let them know everything and include the guy rolls with the mob wear a wire to dinner
  flee to another state
move to thailand cambodia or some veeery far away place sadly this is you only option not trying to dramatize here otherwise accept you fate and chose to have you life ended by tomorrow
  local mafia    you think im talking local get on a plane and leave
  this
keep us updated on your decision anon
is your name glen elg by any chance if it is then good bye that loan shark will fucking murder you
im gonna laugh if i read in the paper some guy won the lottery and immediately had to give it away to keep some loan shark off his ass
if you had saved up more money you couldve bought some guns at least held a pistol against him when you walked outside take his out of course let him carefully lead you to the guys slit his throat place bomb in or at the house or under their cars triggersensitive if the latter     kill as many as you can
  trust me bro im an attorney and you seem pretty screwed but you better meet up with him anyway
  found the /k/ommando
  this is your best bet op otherwise gg you had a good run bye
  its fun to make up stories isnt it
  well thats some shit to be in    firstly just stop gambling no more  my advice would be to meet him and pay him every thing you can muster do not lie to him tell him the truth and see if you can work something out  the fact that you manned up and showed up should gain some respect   if you have any assets you need to sell them house car bike fancy dog everything  i wonder if you could get a student loan and just pay them back id rather deal with a bank anyday over the fucking mafia
  loan sharks will give you up to 50k where do i meet these guys
  vegas
  japanifornia
drive to iowa live in your car and work some shit factory job for decent pay under a new name go from there baby steps anon

anon becomes a normie    summary  1 short tldr of my life as now  2 actual question  ive posted the same post on /b/    1   from 16 to 23 i was overweight loner few friends only very few random sexual experiences and no serious and meaningful relationships with womens  at 24 i had a severe health problem that changed me no lasting damages thanks god    start to look after myself     fast forward now 27yo im in shape normal guy overall have a decent job and finishing college the one after bachelor idk what is called    2  noticing a qt girl interested in me i have no idea how to proceed as i have close to no experience   she will see that i never had a serious relationship   im no good at sex    ive spent most of my adult life by myself used to live in a foreign country    am i set to fail  will she see that i have no past and no experiences and freak out cant blame her
i know this sounds like bullshit but tell her making youvlook like a cool lone wolf youll look very different from what you are
is this okay to look for a bf or date someone if im in love with some other guy
if you really are in love with that one person why would you need another one    if he doesnt give you what you want break up before you really hurt him
  its not the most respectful thing towards the person youre dating
  he doesnt love me back and we arent in touch
  make him love you and get in touch with him
no and go fuck yourself for contemplating it dont drag someone down with you what the fuck
  how the fuck can you make someone love you
  nah its not good for anyone involved even if you do meet a guy somewhere in the back of your head youre always gunna be comparing    that shit is toxic as fuck     it boots out reality in an incredibly subtle and subversive way where even if you dont actively compare every now and then youll probably still have a what if moment towards the first guy that just makes you value what you actually have that much lesseven though you never actually had any chance of having anything at all with the other guy    what you should do is realize that there is no reality where you and the first guy work out and the fact that he doesnt feel the same about you means that if anything did happen it would actually probably be fucking horrible in all the worst ways you just arent meant to be    so move on find someone who likes you the same you like them
  show affection for him act casual eventually hell figure it out
  you cant plain and simple truth
  im in same situation as op in love with someone considering dating but unsure if i should and in my case its because the guy im in love with already has a girlfriend
  i cant move on over 3 years of being in love with him im realistic about us never ending up together but i cant alter my feelings and im tired with being so lonely all the time obviously i wouldnt tell my bf that im in love with someone else he would never know so it wouldnt hurt him
in love with someone  still want to date someone else    lmao you fucking deserve your loneliness
  angry virgin detected
  you are a literal lonely cuck who doesnt even have a bf you dont get to talk go cry about stacey getting dicked down by your troo love every night
  i feel you anon ive been in love with the same guy for 6 years and no matter what i cant get over him he told me be loves me too but he wont leave his girlfriend so ive tried moving on tried dating even got this tall handsome rich guy from paris to fall in love with me but i just couldnt love him back being with these other guys feels fake and wrong the thought of having their dicks anywhere near me repulses me i guess id rather be alone there are other ways to deal with the loneliness than forcing yourself to be with somebody you dont really love
  seething
  t lonely cuckette     chad still doesnt love you
  but at least he is loved we cant say the same about you  no girl to pine over you
i was infatuated with a girl i knew in high school for about 8 years after graduation i think my problem was i never told her how i felt once i did that i spent a few days a wreck quietly crying in my cube at work the worst part is all the pretty girls i met at college that i passed up i could have been a married father of 3 in my twenties instead im a kissless handholdless virgin in my thirties  i got implicitly rejected by two women over over the last two days      if you can get in touch with him try getting an explicit rejection from him hear him say it will never happen if youre like me you still have a vain fantasy that needs to be destroyed before you can recover  also one a yous date me we can bond over this
  if you can get in touch with him try getting an explicit rejection from him hear him say it will never happen    in my case i still talk to him almost every day ive told him i love him and he says he loves me and has feelings for me but that we cant be together right now because hes in a relationship but that maybe in the future things will be different which is probably bullshit but still not making it easy for me to move on
  rohypnol
  make him love you   jesus fucking christ this board is shit
  what an asshole  if he really loved you hed leave this other chick if he really loved her he wouldnt have told you that even if it was true
  im going through something similiar    im married but im falling for a colleague of mine i dunno how she feels about me we do hang around and get pretty flirty but she knows that im married    im always thinking about her it sucks im supressing it with alcohol
what ways can i do to quickly get enough money to buy pic related or a jeep wrangler ive been wanting one my whole life and as much as i love the truck i have now shes on her last leg so i need to get one soon i know jeeps are crazy expensive but they match my lifestyle and my future occupation well as of now im going to class and working full time so i can save enough to get one so i can head to montana state so what are some ways i can earn some extra money no gay shit like drugs been straight edge my whole life dont wanna break that now
  jeep wrangler  your lifestyle and future profession of being a douchbag
  sell off things that you own that have value
whats your average monthly income and what are your expenses
  im getting 12 an hour and my only expenses as of now are just gas and insurance for my current truck financial aid takes care of the rest
  na thats just a side thing im trying to get a doctorate in paleontology so i need something to haul gear as well as being able to handle some tough terrain
  since you got a truck you could try hauling shit people always need to move crap around most will pay for your gas
  so you make 12/hr assuming you work 40 hours a week thats 25k a year a new jeep wrangler is from a quick search about 28k anyone with any amount of sense will tell you not spend more than 25 of your salary on a vehicle you cant afford one and if you finance one on your salary and with no emergency fund youre a fool seeing as you have no real expenses which can change at any time mind you i wouldnt recommend you spend any more than 10k on a vehicle     source used to process loans at a bank youll be having that vehicle repossessed in no time
sorry dude but youre not getting off the lot in a gladiator for less than 50k no base no reg cab no 2wd fucking sucks    if you want to scratch the jeep itch do the reasonable thing xj xj xj anything else will kill your wallet even a tj
how do i stop giving a care about what the world may think about me how do i build the agency to do the things i want to do i dont even know what i want at this point my identity is blank
  losing mhy mind here need someone anyone something to engage with somebody help
i dont get it normally im a very reserved and quiet person with a pretty calm demeanor but around people who im comfortable with i talk a good bit more comparatively at least and i just feel like a big ol dumbass but not in an endearing way apparently people like this side of me both sides seem to be good in most peoples books but i want to be a more quiet person overall and not jump ahead of myself like i do the 10 of the time im around others who i happen to be comfortable around what do i do
how do i focus on studying while feeling like blowing my brains out it doesnt help that i keep fucking my grades up and creating a negative feedback loop
be me  20ish minutes ago  talking to girl on snapchat casually  she sends me picture of girl from my school  fuckjpg  panic because girlfriend is psyco and doesnt like me talking to any girls at all no matter what  worry the stacy will say something to my girlfriend even tho they have never talked and i barely know her  how fucked am i anons  how do i unfuck the situation
psycho  girlfriend  yeah
were you actually hitting on her or scoping her out
  scoping out lowkey
  really doesnt sound like you got a lot on the line here
  i like my girlfriend but im the type of person to have a plan b mainly because lately she gets mad at me for nothing really but that more or less went away now
will i ever meet the one     every night i go to bed touched starved and feeling empty fantasizing about falling asleep in the safe embrace of the man i love    but i fear that day will never come i have so much love to give but also so many barriers i put in place i can never really connect with anyone     why am i convinced ill end up alone but still long for a soulmate
  are you cute
  same how was your childhood
be me  7 y/o or some shit  wake up  walk into living room our room was not separate from the living room  wearing footiepajamas  look out the only window in the living room  notice all the fucking snow  ideamp3  still wearing pajamas  go outside  pretty fucking cold again i knew very little at the time  walk through waist deep snow  this was in the morning sun was just up  stand about 7 yards away from house  look around  autismmp4  pretend i could control the snow twisters  actually began to think i could  a few years later when i was more educated  realize that humans were at the mercy of the weather  mfw i had realized this  mfw i had fun doing this but was pretty clueless now knowing that i had no power with weather  did anyone also do this when they were younger  pic related
  good stories
hi fellow anons  somebody made a fake acc on insta about me and i would like to know if there are any possibility to identify that person like any ip adress or something
are you sure its about you
  sorry for bad english im from germany   what i wanna say is it is a fake acc with my name and pictures
  thats alright mate you make sense    its probably just a bot which is trying to generate money or something by scraping your images and then reposting them    you can report it here     
  thanks anon
i have a history of major depressive disorder and anxiety and cannot find the motivation to finish my work or study for finals i have anxiety to the point of petrification when i attempt to do any of it now i have procrastinated to the point that it is almost impossible    i began the term as an overachiever in the honors program taking more than full time hours while working sometimes 1012 hour days and doing mandatory volunteer service required for the program    the instructor for four of my lecture courses had to leave after one month of classes and the college did not assign a new instructor or do anything except send an email saying to complete a sudden fuckton of essays in lieu of classes for various law courses not general ed or anything easy and heres a date for finals    im burned out bored have add to go along with the depression and i cannot find any motivation to do my work or pick up a book and read i have lost all interest even though i am almost finished with college i have been experiencing this for months now and have expressed my problems to my other instructors and the college counselor but nobody gives a fuck my regular counselor retired recently when my psychiatrists practice closed so i have been by myself with nobody to listen to me or take me seriously i feel like i was finally doing something with my life and everything went to shit
being a 58 manlet in college   just fuck my mental health up how do i cope i know im here to learn and get a degree but the constant sexual demoralization is starting to get to me
just be yourself
  i know this one australian dude hes halffilipino and it shows hes only about an inch taller than me im 54 while his younger siblings are well over 510     thing is dudes a massive chad hes a dj and packs massive guns with him wherever he goes all the ladies swarm him daily too no joke     maybe start working out
  i also have aspergers which doesnt help matters
  i have started to workout and am already in decent shape i have a long way to go though im 135 and want to get to 140 at least 145 in the long term
  thats step one step two is actually talking to women
cunt im 57 and i can still get girls    face  body  social skills  height  dick
  i can get girls just not ones im attracted to
  ill be 100 honest with you bro im 59 and lived in a house full of short guys in uni i was the tallest person living there no joke all those dudes got laid way more than me except for one dude who never left his room your height is a detriment to your attractiveness but not nearly as bad as you think
  57 is in fact around the ideal height for getting girls you will have the looks getting a good body is easy and youre still taller than most girls
  australian society breeds chads especially the northeast and the west any australian from those parts of the country may be normal by the standards of their homes but they dominate other societies through the innate charisma that the culture nurtures  t australian in canada for work
  just act normal and dont act retarded lol thats easy
  more like everyone else sees them as oafish retards but they think they are chads
  desu that sounds delusional most of the guys i see getting girls are comfortably above 510 and the little 58 and below guys are walking around alone or as girls friends
  ive yet to meet a single aussie that wasnt a chucklefuck so i agree     also the women make my peepee feel funny
  virtually all of the girls i find attractive have boyfriends are leaving their options open or are so out of my league i might as well not try
  be yourself  just act normal  spergs like me must pick one
  then pick acting normal
  57 is in fact around the ideal height for getting girls    errr u wot m8    ideal height for getting girls is 62 you get to be tall for the normal girls to feel small and also are able to pretty much get instant access to all the tall girls who have a severely limited supply of dudes
  thanks for the suicidefuel
  you sound delusional have you actually been outside recently or are you in high school every guy i know who is popular with girls is below 6 this isnt to say tall guys cant get girls they just lack the looks to use as advantage the guys i know 56 to 510 are all getting girls easily except the fat ones
i might just end up gaymaxxing until moneymaxxing becomes part of the equation
  in what world do you live in every statistic in addition to observations anyone can make say that is far from an ideal height and into the too tall territory
  yes i get outside i have to walk to class after all but i guess my main barriers to success are actually social and mental rather than heightrelated
  see this is my aspergers coming out i dont actually mean this but said it because i cant just conduct a normal conservation online or irl
  start observing the guys who are your height or shorter and who pull girls easily see what they are doing right and you wrong
  i dont see many guys my height or shorter pulling girls i see them single or friend zoned 
goodbye thanks for your replies
  sounds like you are seeing what you want to see
  you dont cope its over bro     also dont trust anything roasties say its all cognitive dissonance and estrogen good feel lies bafoonery
your problem isnt that youre 58 your problem is that you have no self confidence and so when you read a few manlet memes on the internet youre deeply affected by it and start to think your height is the defining characteristic of who you are its pathetic man just stop whining about shit and i guarantee your life will improve the literal richest man in the world right now is shorter than you do you think he got there by complaining about his height
so ive been talking to this guy i really like i thought we had chemistry and the last time i saw him we had fun he was being goofy and we exchanged words it was nice what im worried about is that before this interaction i have sent him three messages ending in questions or a conversation starter of some kind he didnt reply to a single one his sister said hes not really a phone person and tries to avoid his phone when he can or something but he read every message i feel like im being paranoid but im also not used to this level of being ignored so im stuck being afraid that im boring hes a really funny and interesting guy and i thought we would click well because every time we hang out we have great conversations and both of us laugh a lot it seems like our irl and online relationships are as different as night and day what the hell do i do i would love for things to get more serious between us but i dont want to push anything because he was engaged to one of my best friends for a very brief moment in time im not sure if hes moved past her yet and im afraid he hasnt my friend is completely over him and weve talked about the situation so i know shes comfortable with it she even said she would love to see him finally move on since shes the one who broke things off even before they were engaged we had chemistry he would give me rides and we would smoke weed together and have a fun time any advice would be appreciated on how to move forward from here would it be pushy to ask him on a date would it be awkward to ask him to come to my house i dont want to make him uncomfortable
  he didnt reply to a single one  from personal experience if i dont reply to a message its because im busy / not in the proper mindset to reply to give a good reply  i do eventually get back to people within a reasonable amount of time subjective  has it been a reasonable amount of time in your case  what i can say is that if it were me id be quick to answer people that i have an interest in    he was engaged to one of my best friends for a very brief moment in time im not sure if hes moved past her yet  shes the one who broke things off  thats sounds pretty bad 1 being that youre all in a circle of friends which might make it less likely for him to get over it and 2 being that engagements are quite serious  how long has it been since they broke it off    im stuck being afraid that im boring  have some confidence in yourself  im also not used to this level of being ignored  seems like its rare that people find you boring  but if he does find you boring you cant force yourself be not be boring for him its a lost cause    as for your questions at the end ill leave them for others to answer
  yeah some people truly just stick to facetoface interactions and only reply to messages when theyre strictly borderlingelifeorneath/necessary/logistical/practical its no cause for alarm just focus on interacting with him face to face so i think it would be very suiting to ask him out/ask him to your house i also think with people who dont do online interaction you dont have to worry as much about being appropriate or maybe im just biased about that type hell probably be very down to earth in any situation you might put him in
hes not interested  or  hes not sure if its a good idea    i think let it go for now  you shouldnt wait around for someone who doesnt know what they want he also might just enjoy your friendship and doesnt even know but still dont push it anymore
hiw do you start getting disciplined    theres so many things i wanna do but i just font have the willpower to get off my ass i wanna take control of my life for once and follow a routine
  theres no secret to it man you just do it start small and work your way up to bigger goals
  pain you must put yourself in ultimatums like setting your alarm on the other side of the room to go off at full blast at 500 am in the morning this will not happen gradually dont listen to what they say you will find a way to slack if you try to do this gradually you need to treat yourself brutally and tell yourself youre doing it for the future dont have a specific goal in mind or youll just convince yourself that you dont really want it anymore and there goes your motivation just think of how shitty everything is because you didnt go the extra mile and because you were a quitter just think about how good your life could be yeah maybe your life is ok right now but only through many layers of rosetinted glasses and sugar coating am i right do you want to keep sucking do want to stay garbage forever do you want to die garbage i know i dont ill figure out how to atone for my sins later this more important
  thanks man thats edgy but i needed that
  i was kinda talking to myself thats why its so edgy i dont really know anything about your life
ill share a secret with women as to how they can compete with younger mods/versions basically a pro tip on how to keep your man from going out and looking for an upgrade or what to do when trying to steal him back from an upgrade or w/e the thing that makes them seem so isnt always just the tighter skin or the perky breasts though obviously that helps a lot of it really is in the eyes though you can save on a lot of time and money using various other accessories but essentially if you can get him to focus on your eyes and your as eager as a squirrel in the morning scrambling from safety to stand up tall in the street ears out sniffing the air looking for your  well hopefully you get the idea im honestly trying to help the best thing you can bring to the table if in any kind of slump or competition is eagerness like your willing to bring it all to the table to make up for whatever might be lacking and not ashamed to admit it
how to get a 9/10 girl when you re short and have average face
money
  this or personality
  you dont trust me even becoming physician didnt help me at all your looks lock your possibilities even if you get a 9/10 to be with you she will just see you as a credit card you cant buy physical attraction
  personality
if you look like a trainwreck why do you even feel you should get a 9/10 girlfriend do you think theres a 5chan board where 9/10s are like all i want is a 1/10 guy who lives in his moms basement playing vidya watching anime and eating tendies wut do fellow stacies
  honest answer  you really dont want a 9/10 girl  the reasons  you are not a 9/10 male  thus you will always feel insecure when she is around other chads  she will always be busy getting hit by random dudes on social media  she will always get others attention when she will be down after you guys fight or some shit  in the end she will ditch you and will start riding some random dick    so why go through all this and still end up being miserable  just find a good hearted 5/10 girl give your truest form of love to her she will love you back and it will be the most awesome experience for both of you     7/10 guy married to a 5/10 woman 10/10 by her personality desu

only child  working 100miles from home  highly specialised job  move back home to help my dad care for my chronically ill mother  commute in daily on public transport  6 months later  dad gets hit by a drunk driver  broken spine  no movement or feeling from the chest down  law suit in progress but it takes so much time and work  dont know if i can pull this off i want to kill myself every day    the only thing stopping me is the fact that it would make their lives even more miserable than they already are
23 f virgin here    i found an amazing place to live that is literally a 5 minute walk from my new job the rent is a little high but only a quarter of my net monthly salary and the view is amazing too    however its just a room i have to share the appt with 2 guys one of them is moving in next month as well and i havent met either theyre both foreigners europeans but still and i have to share a bathroom too   while most dudes in this world are probably okay my biggest and possibly unrealistic fear is that i wont be safe there i know living there is my own choice but i want to make myself as unappealing as possible  what would be the concequences if i lied about having aids or herpes what are some other things i can do my room has a lock
i think you should wait until youve met at least one of them before making any decisions like that youre going to really regret lying about something like that if they turn out to be harmless guys listen to your gut
  i wasnt planning on mentioning this right away first time meeting them no im more worried about the possible concequences when i tell such a lie _after_ i get a bad gut feeling
bump
what would be the concequences if i lied about having aids or herpes  i think the biggest issue would be if they found out you were lying to them or maybe they mentioned it to your boyfriend causing its own host of issues id suggest getting a stungun or something if you felt unsafe instead not lying about your medical history
this is what feminism and tumblr has brought to us no op you are not going to be raped men arent crazy wild animals who cant tell right from wrong plus feminism is significant in europe they arent going to harm some woman furthermore they arent going to rape you when they couldnt possibly get away with it and i guarentee neither of them word ever want to go to american prison    you are wildly over reacting many men and women are roommates and nothing happens
today marks the last day of my life in 16 hours i will be no more totally at peace    feel free to ask me anything
what makes you think you will be at peace do you believe in some kind of afterlife
do you plan to give your body to science or donate it to a hospital    maybe you can give others some happiness before you find inner peace
if you are dead you will not experience peace peace is by definition an experience being dead is a complete absence of experience
  he will while hes losing consciousness
  likelihood is youll bitch out like i and thousands of others do every other week good luck tho
if this is where your journey takes you mate then all the best for your sake and mine i really hope it is peaceful i heard someone say that eternity is as long as a second
  i dont know if my body will be donated to science i hope so maybe i can write a letter indicating my preference      by peace i mean i am at peace right now the last hours and days of your life are extraordinarily peaceful as the future is no longer a factor imagine writing an essay on an exam while the exam is ongoing you are filled with constant worry and second thoughts but when the test ends you turn in your exam you are filled with a sense of relief    i apologize to the other posters but they didnt ask questions
    i think you have to sing up for both but im not sure how it is where you live    just out of curiosity how old are you and what is the reason why are going to be at peace soon
    i have a very reliable means of making sure that i die in a few hours    as far as signing up i know i signed up to be a donor on my drivers license not sure what would be required in a situation like this i wont be driving when my i expire
  also im 25
hey anon  i told myself if i ever got to the point where i wanted to kill myself i would gather all the money i have sell everything then i would travel to a new country one i have absolutely 0 ties to and start a new life there leave your old life behind in that sense you would have killed your old self without needing to kill yourself why dont you do that
  its certainly a novel idea but in my case the issue is internal rather than external a change of scenery would be exciting but not substantive
  damn that sounds really weird  im just gonna say dont do it    whatever your method is dont damage or intoxicate yourself with some drugs or alcohol or you wont be taken for organ donation  yeah if its on your drivers license it should be good    i dont wanna stur up your inner peace but what may i ask what took you to that decision at the age of 25
  drugs or alcohol wont be a factor    i hate to give my life story but basically ive struggled with basic functionality since i was 13 when i was younger i cried in public for no reason i pushed myself to work a variety of jobs and managed to stay on them for years in spite of what i believe to be my best efforts however i was a nervous wreck and a terrible employee    so i tried to enter academia where i figured i would at least have a change of pace but after a year in an economics phd program i got kicked out    so after years of medication therapy pushing myself and failure i just want a moment of peace and happiness i am especially glad not to be a burden on my family anymore    so i guess i saw what life had to offer me and what i had to offer it and realized its time to cash in my chips
  how do you feel about all of the amazing things that youre going to be missing out on    hell were only a year away from expering being alive during 2020 its going to be amazing
at least try shrooms or lsd first
  when you tried therapy and all that stuff and after all that you come to that conclusionthen maybe its whats best for you in the end    im not saying suicide is a solution but if you only suffer and think life has nothing more for you to offer      well i dont think i have more questions for you on this topic  i wish you the best and hope that you maybe change your mind before its too late
op here thank you to all of you who commented and thank you to 4chan for all the wonderful experiences    i never met any of you in person but i wish each and every one of you the best and a happy future
  faggot
why not livestream it
  what is the halflife of strontium90

  who promoted peress
give alan watts a listen he may change your perspective did you grow up in a single parent household
  oh please theyre called fatherless households
  see you here tomorrow as usual
  too early to give up imo  31yo virgin sperg trying earnestly for the first time and finding it isnt as hard as i thought here
have you told your parents you love them
  if you were actually ready and decided to do it you wouldnt delay it and you certainly wouldnt be making a thread here to bait people to tell you not to do it and that life is worth it and all that bs  go off yourself right now faggot  better yet go shoot up some normie gathering place while youre at it
  dont do it peter
  wow did you just guess my name or are you one of the few irl people know i browse 4chan and hate my life what your name
  just dont do it man
do a flip
  op is bullshitting  no one ever does it
  what types of troubles did you face in this life
  welp rip op
dont do it man please probably too late but if not just know people care i care i probably dont know you irl but i care guy i really do i wouldnt baother making this post if i didnt care you shouldnt be so rash to do this friend please
  hey op not sure if you have ever played video games before but have you ever played one where you choose to start the game with a deathwish attitude rather than a i want to win mindset  playing aggressive dangerously and without hesitation  you can also pull the plug on the gamevideo and kill it anytime you want  but there is a thrill and achievement from seeing how far you go while disregarding the safety of your character    i believe if you were to change your suicidal mindset to deathwish mindset it may open a new world of opportunities for you that could change your mind on dieing so soon  and if it doesnt work out you still end up in the same place  consider what you could or would do if you actually didnt care anymore   the world is your oyster op
  not him or op but i was raised by a single father
  there isnt a single thing that could happen to you that could justify you putting yourself into a total cessation of consciousnesses there isnt shit after death you getting beaten and fucking raped is better than that because at least you exist i know ill go home and blow my brains out in a psychosomatic rage soon enough but who says you have to what cant you do why the fuck are you ready for this you can fucking talk about it here anywhere you arent lost yet
i applaud your decision anon good luck
  do everything youve never done thats legal or dont get caught then become a christian monk the first parts optional
  my name is jeff
why are these the last hours of your life  why are you spending them on 4chan
  what are the symptoms you are trying to  what specifically causes you difficulty in life why did you get kicked out of the econ program you were in   have you tried to program computers you could maybe figure out some type of work you could do from home to support yourself  you can always kill yourself later and get that moment of peace and happiness but you might as well try to get those feelings for a different reason that you even got into a phd program shows that you are at least in certain respects a very capable person   the death wish thing is also an option but not one i would really recommend until you are actually starting the physical act of killing yourself
  if it would be exciting why dont you want to try it
i love you anon whether you stay or leave
may you rest in peace op i hope you went out painlessly
did you off yourself yet op or did you chicken out like a faggot  i dont see anything about a new school shooting in the news so youre already an absolute soiboi cuck
so my boyfriend got me pregnant about 3 months back and we werent sure what to do but it didnt matter because i miscarried about 2 weeks ago i was pretty torn up about it and he was too and im trying to get myself together because im mostly alright but its jeez its haunting my kid died in me i couldnt even bury him like a person my dumb body said oh we gave birth i guess time to make milk just to rub it in that i have no baby to feed and keep warm the milk stopped since i obvioysly didnt nurse and my bleeding is slowing down but i dont know how i want to continue with sex after im able to i have a high drive so my inner horny slut says lets just be much much much safer now but i dont think i want to have vaginal sex again at all until were married or i can support a child on my own hes worried about me and thinks im not handling this right i dont know i cant tell when im out of mind i just dont want to risk another kid i feel like its be wrong to just go back to business help me out please am i coping wrong what should i do
id say wait it out you seem sane enough to be able to cope with this you just need time eventually ease yourself back into your normal life
how do i get over a dead girl my highschool girlfriend died in 2016 in a car wreck and im still hung up over it she was korean and im black so her family didnt want me at the funeral and never contacted me when she died now im in my 20s away from my home town working a shitty night shift and writing poetry every fuck doesnt matter every words a sound and im not progressing in life i feel theres no reason to anymore help
there are questions you need to ask yourself and obligations you must fulfill and you need to find a method to do both  what are you trying to get over whats motivating this desire of yours once you find that out work out what you need to do to manage  the pain of losing someone will always hurt especially someone who gives your life some meaning  i recommenced writing a letter to her that says all the things left unsaid ritual helps in an odd sort of way  there is beauty in shitty stuff anon take a drive somewhere at night it might give you time to think   try looking for different jobs as well and keep on finding a way to express yourself  learn to express yourself anon and other shit will soon follow
  sounds like you never got closure for a traumatic event 4chan aint gonna be able to help you you need a professional
  this professional grief counseling is what you need op 99 of human beings never have and never will experience what you have especially the family refusing to allow you attend the funeral part  my best advice is this even if you feel like youre just going through the motions keep doing so no matter what keep reminding yourself that if she still exists somewhere as a soul or whatever that shed be happier to see you doing well in life and not giving into despair good luck op i feel for you its not the same by a longshot but an ex that i was reconnecting with killed themselves 5 years ago and i think about them daily still youll never stop thinking about it from time to time but one day you will learn to enjoy life again
  toll was paid  today was a good day
  sounds like you need love op

does anybody here have any experience designing / selling tshirt or other designs online    im having a hard time finding an audience and im curious if im doing something wrong or what     any advise would be appreciated
ive seen countless threads about people who have been cheated on but im interested to know what its like for people who have cheated on their partners    like how does it feel did you come clean personally im really tempted to have a one night stand because ive never had sex with anybody except my partner of 2 years but im 90 certain i wouldnt be able to do it i just want to hear your stories because its not something people talk about a lot
  ive cheated because i dont actually care about my gfs that much
  felt good in the moment and like shit ever since i wouldnt recommend it but i know that i if i ever get in that position id probably do it again because im fucking retarded the only good part is that im basically a terrible boyfriend but every time i cheat on my girlfriend i start treating her better because i feel bad about it or maybe thats just me trying to cope
  the only time i cheated i wasnt sure if the girl even considered me her boyfriend at the end of that relationship it was apparent that by then at least she was pretty over it    the girl i affaird with also had a man felt like kind of a rush thrilling exciting the stakes were a bit higher and thus the exhiliration was more pronounced    i wont cheat on my current partner but she and i was decidedly an intimate couple and i have no questions or reservations
once in a long distance relationship a few years ago i got horny and downloaded grindr i just browsed didnt message or reply to anyone but lots of guys messaged me many with pics i knew id get messages and pics when i made the profile though i didnt put up my own pic so saying i technically didnt message anyone has less meaning because i was de facto soliciting pics and jerking off to it as soon as i came i felt awful never confessed though its difficult to feel too bad about it now because she ended up having a months long physical affair and leaving me so what i did pales in comparison im still deeply disappointed in myself for doing it but its made me much more careful to keep myself im check when horny
    be me  selfish sociopath     i have cheated on every boyfriend ive ever had because i am not getting everything i need mentally sexually or emotionally  you see what you want in others and then when you get it realise that theyre missing things the previous one had  sick sad cycle it is
  irl i do this like all the time i never intend to bang anyone but have never felt guilty just from having casual sexy chats with anons that said i literally just started talking to one guy who is probably the hottest person ive ever seen so im really struggling to decide whether or not its worth it hes into me so this is like an opportunity of a lifetime  help appreciated
i am a woman and i cheated i told my husband and told him i would do it again i was bored of life bored of him bored with myself said i would leave if that was what he wanted he did not we tried for a few years to have some sort of normal relationship while i was off doing what i wanted most nights it did finally fall apart and with children at home it was hard the final straw was over 13 years ago we still live in the same house and pay bills together but live separate lives its a sad and lonely way to live for us both my suggestion is if you are wanting to do this leave its not worth it to hold on to something that didnt or isnt working and hopefully in the end you wont be old and stuck like me just my 2 cents
  just see how things go if its meant to be it will come easily
  did you hate your husband or just not have empathy for him
when i cheated i felt bad but my desperation loneliness and sadness out weighed my judgement i was also drinking way too much because of sadness so that helped me do it  i was caught i begged for forgiveness but read a million articles in the midst on how to actually fix it so i also admitted into how sad i was i felt so alone before i did so fucking alone like if i cheated they wouldnt even notice or care theyve forgiven me and about a year later i still hate myself for my awful judgement and my lack of communication leading up to it i felt listened to by who i cheated on them with but it wasnt worth it at all it is my biggest regret in life
not directly answering your question but i had an affair with a married woman her husband found out and they divorced we loved eachother for a short period then after the divorce she lost interest in me she was done with her man though but i think she just liked the thrill still think about her sometimes
i cheated on a couple girlfriends not all of them though i usually cheat when i sense the relationship is going downhill or my gf doesnt respect me as much as she used to normally the relationship ends shortly afterward  i feel that most everyone cheats if not physically then emotionally people get bored of eachother monogamy is pointless until you have kids then it becomes neccessary
ive cheated on my husband for many various reasons i only regret the first because it was for love of my ex who wanted me back and i felt so alone and confused my husband didnt stop bringing it up for years when he was angry id never cheated before  he got a job somewhere id begged him not to because his bitch sister worked there and she wanted us to split if hed listened and not given her the satisfaction i wouldnt have been even tempted he suspected but said nothing got him to quit finally then told him he stayed because im hot i guess he wanted to one up my ex too  turns out he was also having affairs left and right while his sister approved so ive never told him about another all in all ive fucked around fifteen other men and women since we married hes had about the same weve found out some in really horrible ways and at this point we just deny all of it to each other when it comes out im still friends with most of my affair partners     best sex ive ever had was during affairs theirs or mine he always stabbed my cervix with his dick when he came and it completely ruined sex with him for me never talks to me or looks at me like he loves me never has divorce sounds like a huge pain in the ass and we get along okay otherwise were just idiots putting on a good show i guess cheating isnt the worst thing in a relationship
  its okay for a man to cheat but not for a woman
i found it easy to do but i got crippling guilt afterwards my gf didnt fuck me often like once a month sometimes up to 6 months  felt she fell out of love and was comfortable with our sex life declining so i went else where and after that i started to see all the little things she does forme and the happiness she brought me on a daily basis the guilt became too much so i said it to her and found out that she too had cheated but multiple times and never came clean both of us got a taste of our own medicine and left one another cheating doesnt end well if youve a heart no matter how horny you are in the moment after wards feels so much worse
  jesus christ your husband sounds like a serious loser beta for putting up with you for a few more years after you proudly cheated on him    also did i mention you are a stupid dumb whore why did the two of you get married in the first place
  relationship felt like it was falling apart my then gf was constantly texting with her best friend who was in love with her and basically wooing her and she got off from all the attention she never let it escalate further then the texting and flirting but it was basically emotionally cheating we talked and talked but she wasnt ready to drop it  so i felt that if she didnt respect the relationship that i wouldnt either surprisingly that phase passed and we were together for three years in a pretty ok relationship
not op but after reading some of the stories i have followup question on the topic if you are prone to cheating why do you even bother with a relationship and not just onenightstand all the time  before you potentially fuck someone emotional just go swinging
  codependent narcissists sounds like not even couples therapy could help either of you    cheating isnt the worst thing in a relationship  if you base the concept about truthfulness and loyalty around it it sure is the worst thing    its always funny to see how fucked up people try to relativize their lives with bullshit excuses to look less like the ignorant assholes they are
    if you are prone to cheating why do you even bother with a relationship and not just onenightstand all the time  im not even one of the cheaters but i still want to give my 2 cents on why i think some people are natural cheaters    some people simply wont accept or they dont understand the principle that you cant have your cake and eat it too whether youre in a relationship or whether youre single you always gain something and you lose something its give and take in a relationship you gain things like emotional/financial support and you have someone to love and connect to but you lose your sexual freedom if youre single its vice versa you can do whatever you want with whomever you want but you lack the security and emotional fulfillment a relationship provides some people are so unhappy/unsatisfied in their regular lives that they require both instead of just one they require the emotional/financial support from a relationship but at the same time they cant live a happy life if they have to stay sexually loyal to 1 person they need both the security of a relationship and the excitement of being single these are the guys/girls who will make threads like i love him/her so much but i still cheated on him/her with some random guy/girl pls what do /adv/    the only common exception to what i stated above is people who cheat on their partner because they simply arent happy with them they want to break up but they are too scared of the consequences or whatever so instead of pulling the bandaid off they go and look for someone else who can fill that hole on the side while staying in their dysfunctional relationship
  you dont have anything close to a healthy relationship you both sound like assholes so youre perfect for each other but the whole thing is completely toxic
    thank you for the answer thats something i havent thought of
  i didnt and still dont hate him i have much respect for him he is a great person just a big home body and not good in bedand i am a piece of shit and a thrill seeker i am never happy with what i have ruined a good relationship with a really good man/father/person it is something i feel i will regret the rest of my life
  you dont regret anything people that call themselves pieces of shit but continue the behavior show its just words deep down you dont care about him or relationship just what you want
  yeah good relationships arent simply about getting what you want that would be boring
  something similar i think people dont know why they cheat im taking a child devolpmental class in college and we just learned a check list for kids/teenagers that indicate they will grow up to be healthy adults a couple of the bullet points is practicing restraint through out their life as in not having excessive sex not doing drugs not underage drinking that being said i think a lot of cheaters lack restraint and and dont even realize it
  why dont you just have an open marriage then
  i cheated after over a year of trying to resist and stop myself basically i found out a girl ive loved and wanted for years felt the same way about me but i didnt find out until i was already in a relationship i told her nothing can happen bc i have a gf at first and we both decided to keep being friends but i think the underlying knowledge that we both have feelings for each other and wanted to fuck became too much every time we hung out alone together the unresolved sexual tension became harder and harder to deal with things progressed slowly looking back i was already cheating long before i even admitted it just because of how much mental energy i was spending on her sneaking out at night to spend time with her looking for excuses to hold her hand and touch her and holding her a little longer and a little closer than is probably normal for friends eventually i kissed her still couldnt bring myself to leave my girlfriend kept telling myself it was only a kiss and i wasnt cheating that this girl was my friend and not my side chick but eventually it happened i never felt so loved and at peace yet so full of guilt and self hatred at the same time i love this girl and dont regret sleeping with her but i now wish i had broken up with my gf first
i cheated on my first girlfriend like 10  times or something i honestly lost track
  dammit anon that is next level piece of shittery you pulled off there  i truly hope you live with that regret until the day you die
    
hey kiddies i have a newsflash for you almost all married people have some sort of affair your mom and dad did too if they are still married this is just life but you will learn about that in time
  ive been on a couple of sides of that issue    ive been the guy that the girls cheats on her boyfriend with and thats always great obviously you get to have sex and the ego boost of knowing that a girls likes you and is attracted to you but you also get this machiavellian sense of power knowing that you could crumble down this fragile house of cards at any moment and that you exercise one of the biggest forms of dominance over another man ive had some girls break up with their bf to be with me as well thats all great of course    one time i was stuck in a yearslong relationship with a girl who was just fine and she was a great person who deserved so much better than me it was a night out with some guys and i met a girl and the most i did with her was just kiss her and maybe feel her up a bit but nothing more than that i felt like absolute shit and to this i still do i dont know how some guys go through girls like paper tissues and juggle two or three while cheating on the one all the time i still feel like a piece of shit and this was 14 years ago    did you come clean    why the shit would i have done that of course not some things you gotta take to the grave the girl i was in a relationship with thought that i loved her and i thought so too and i didnt want to take that memory/feeling away from her
  nice answer thanks for taking your time to type it out      damn it really makes me sad seeing that at least half of the population has cheated before including my fucking dad is monogamy just a social construct forced on everyone why dont people without children just divorce maybe marriage was a mistake that sucks
yesterday i asked some guy if he has a girlfriend and he said no and i gave him my number because he asked about it and im in a committed relationship we texted but i felt so bored and despite him being physically attractive it didnt do anything for me at all and i didnt think he was all that i do feel bad that i did that and i dont know if itd be emotional cheating i just never had the guts to do that so it was more for me a personal challenge i dont plan on cheating and the thought of it disgusts
i really love my girlfriend she is a nice person but she dont like sex so much and its really hard for me control the desire to bang other women just for the pleasure of sex without commitment    im thinking of paying for professional sex and in my mind this isnt cheat she dont like sex afterall how wrong is this
  this anon is right a significant number of married people do have affairs  imperfect people  can be monogamous 9999 of the time all it takes is one event  most couples do not have the emotional maturity and honesty to prevent infidelity or manage infidelity when it occurs  but dont give up hope anons
  definitely not almost all though over half is certainly believable literally the only people who say everyone cheats are people with a history of cheating
  is monogamy just a social construct forced on everyone     i think monogamy can work but you have to find the right person
  yeah not proud of it but ive cheated on an ex before an emotional affair but still realized that meant i didnt really love him
  sexual intimacy is a basic need for most people if shes not having sex with you that alone is fair grounds to break up i understand that sounds like very harsh language and im not saying you should break up im just saying that despite our culture depicting male sex drive as just guys being typical perverts it would not in fact be a dick move to split with someone because theyre not fulfilling your sexual needs its not shallow now you just need to sit down and have a serious discussion about sex and let her know youre not satisfied with the amount youre having together ill repeat here that this does not make you a shallow asshole this is very reasonable this discussion could bring up some solutions perhaps shes feeling stressed so to improve the amount of sex you need to make some stress reduction plans maybe helping with housework or setting aside dedicated leisure time theres even a low chance that she would be okay with you getting sexual release with other people how much you want to discuss this with her and work on solutions before giving up is for you to decide either way you should be either working to resolve the problem accepting it or breaking up cheating isnt something you have to inflict on her
   one of the biggest forms of dominance over another man    unless they know what your doing with their so and let it continue without leaving the bitch no even if they know its more the bitch who is dominating
its selfish and a fucked up thing to do but it is insanely hot
disgusting thread and disgusting people    especially you simply disgusting     my father used to cheat on my mother and seeing how it hurt her i developed this disgust for cheating bastards a relationship is about trust i would rather off myself than cheat on my wife if anyone would cheat on me i wouldnt hesitate to kill everyone involved
  anon i wanna hug you mentally
warning shit abt guitars   ive always had a problem with strings going out of tune when hit hard coz thats how physics works so youre supposed to get heavier strings and i was using like 9s so i went to 1052 which is what people almost always use to fix this problem butthey still wouldnt work so i went to 1156 which is used for like drop b but even in e standard they still fucking cant be hit hard and nowhere ive ever looked for help has helped at all they all say to hit the strings less hard which i barely hit them hard in the first place and they say to get heavier strings but that means going to like a 52 not already being at a 56 and still having the same fucking bullshit problem ive seen people who use lighter strings than me and tune lower and hit harder and theres dont go sharp and i dont fucking know what to do its not the guitar ive set it up its fine idk what to do im mad tho
ive seen people who use lighter strings than me and tune lower and hit harder and theres dont go sharp  until you learn how to use simple tuners google it try the locking ones
  its not like they stay out of tune the strings are only out of tune when hit then they return back
  make sure your saddles dont have burrs and get a graphite nut when tuning always make sure youre tuning up and not down like if the note is slightly sharp then flatten it a considerable amount then sharpen until its in tune this is only for fender style 6 in line headstocks i dont know about anything else  i use 0838s and have good tuning stability
  they dont stay out of tune though so its not a tuning stability issue
    does your instrument have a floating bridge or floyd rose tremolo thats likely to be your problem if you dont use it google how to lock it
  no it has a stable bridge
  when you fret a note the string doesnt actually reach down to the finger board  its just floating between the frets if you do press all the way down however it will sharpen i switched to 11s to fix this problem but if thats not enough the problem may be you   if you do choose to go heavier just keep in mind many guitars arent sturdy enough for heavys and may start to bow/bend or worse
im getting bored of doing the same position everytime i have sex which is incredibly boring and not really passionate at all i dont feel the love coming from him theres no passion only lust but just in a i just want to fuck something kind of way i am the one doing all the foreplay i am the one that usually initiates it he never just takes me blowjobs are a daily thing i used to love doing it but now its just a chore i tried acting different and more sexy dressing slutty and even encouraged him to be more active or tell me if theres anything hed like me to do he is also a lying asshole in many ways so it doesnt help cant break up with him for different reasons what can i do i am a really lustful woman and it feels like its just going to waste
  prostitution is a noble profession and one that has existed since the dawn of civilization you shouldnt let some pearlclutching shrews from the 80s prevent you from achieving your dream
  i feel you you have to talk to him about it and if all goes horribly then you have to leave take a choice other then than and youre a fuckin tard
i know exactly what you should do fuck me instead hahahaha jk sounds like your bf is an asshole dump him
  cant break up with him for different reasons    will you get stoned if you do i dont mean like high
probably only after making me feel like shit for having higher libido than him
  was he ever good in bed was it better at the beginning of the relationship
he has never been good in bed but i did put up with it because i really didnt care it was purely out of love selfless making him feel good even if i didnt cum or feel good at all when he wants a quickie he literally just puts it in right away no foreplay at all sometimes not even kisses made me really happy i didnt expect him to do anything he became more and more entitled to it and he just expects me to do whatever to satisfy his needs i have told him i do have my needs too but it hasnt changed anything he has also been such a huge jerk to me that i stopped caring about his needs
  ok so theres nothing you can do to fix this except break up and find a better boyfriend you say that you have other reasons why you cant break up so i guess bad sex and jerky behavior are the sacrifices youre choosing to make for whatever those other reasons are but you cant transform a shitty boyfriend into a good one many have tried and it just doesnt work that way
well i dont really have a choice here cant break up or leave i dont think i can change him either wasting my lust and high libido annoys me deeply though
  so you are just looking for anonymous strangers to give you permission to cheat  wow i totally hadnt even thought of that what a great idea and not my idea because im not like that
i dont think id go that far for probably just a bad fuck my husband sucks in bed but so do many other men thinking about it sure is a turn on though
  kill yourself you worthless meat
i did want to kill myself back then i know i am not ashamed of my lust anymore like i used to in the end you realize you can just think of other people as you fuck your partner and enjoy sex for once its the closest ive been to being unfaithful to him
fuck other men thinking of the things youve done will make sex with bf more fun
  where and how do people find these submissive cumsocks while i have to work extremely hard to find myself a psychotic frigid bitch jesus christ there is no justice  anyway dump that asshole and find a man that satisfies you in bed
i wish i was properly used as a cumsock and lusted for i really just feel like a fleshlight because fapping requires more effort well we always do it with the lights off and he doesnt normally look at me so i can imagine someone else pretty easily
  stop giving him blowjobs and quickies than you dumb bitch of course hes going to become complacent if you do that for him let his lust build up and have him take it out on you when he gets to a breaking point even better if you flirt and tease him meanwhile
i have done that before i am not that dumb his lust doesnt build up he just stops expecting sex he has never just pushed me down to fuck me because he couldnt control himself he will never let his lust control him what happens is if he starts having less blowjobs or quickies he will become start to give less kisses and hugs hell become distant less affectionate and physical with me and since i need that kind of affection it will just get me depressed hell be perfectly fine lets not talk about being flirty either it turns him off believe me ive tried really hard to make him lust for me properly
oh and if i try to play hard to get when he wants a blowjob hell guilt trip me and get upset/be a stubborn bitch/complain about having to insist and then hell go do something else he will be mad for a while or silent afterwards
this is my problem only with my gf i do all the shit and she barely tugs my dick no blowjob mind you cause she doesnt like them roll eyes yet im the one starting doing rubbing and licking everywhere to the point i get bored in foreplay cause its only me doing the work and im tired of trying to get her to naturally be sexy but nope she just presses her ass into my dick and thinks thats enough     in all honesty im probably gonna find a side chick cause yeah shes great but cmon man i want her to fucking jump me when shes horny and not just expect me to be clued in when i myself am not i can see why guys go after other women eventually cause this complacency is killing my natural male drive
well finally in my shoes its hard when your partner is not naturally sexy towards you and just expects you to do everything since the very beggining its also hard when you are a woman and the lustful one because then youre just a thot not like you just an unsatisfied man with a rigid girl
i wonder if anyone else that posted here actually understands or they have a gf that does as much as ive done for my husband i would like to hear your experience with gfs
i cant understand why lustful people always end up with people who have low libido or maybe theyre just plain egotitistical and they dont care that much about you
  i tried acting different and more sexy dressing slutty  have you tried not doing that sutty is pretty much the signal for i want emotionally disconnected sex to a lot of guys try being more romantic if you want passionate sex
i agree stop being slutty
well i didnt think id have to explain it but its just dressing the way he wants its actually not slutty at all just certain clothes that turn him on or that he likes to see on me as i said before acting slutty and anything that may be slightly thotlike will turn him off so i try to avoid it
how do i exactly deal with jealous people
any other people who had parents that are fucking retards   they never took pictures or videos of any of us no fucking childhood photos and anything else  literally nothing exists
when i told my mom i wanted kill myself by jumping off a tower she just joked about it to my face and never brought it up again i dont think she even realizes the damage that she did to my psychological wellbeing while i was already suicidally depressed
  op here  im actually going to do it just not now  they wont have a casket funeral either  no ceremony   i want to be forgotten
  suicidally depressed people dont complain to their mothers or feel worse afterwards youre a shit
i lost my diaries from 20132017     i started writing regularly in 2012 and thus ive lost most all of my history which double sucks because my life is pretty sweet and now i dont have a sort of proof of my adventures     whatever you just move on   its never too late to start writing a diary blog or take photos op if you do a little thing like that every day for 10 years then when its 2028 youll have all these cool things to look back on
  you will never be forgotten
  yes  we all will  i dont care about the 30 cousins who know my name and remember be as a kid  im a man now  waiting for that final moment  once youre done fighting its over
  not op but 4 years of diaries is not even close to having no pictures of your childhood
  why do you want childhood photos so badly humans went literal millennia without them if theyd suicided because of it you wouldnt even exist
should i break up with my ldr if she doesnt wanna give nudes even though i already saw her naked before
id say no maybe shes just smart and doesnt her nudes out there there are some girls who wont give nudes to boyfriends who they fuck every single daydream
some people wisely avoid taking nudes of themselves and sending them to other people since the photos can easily be spread due to maliciousness carelessness or general stupidity
  but i wanna see my gfs tits
  yeah but she sounds like a smart girl
youre sad anon  she deserves better
dude respect her boundaries i was with my gf for 2 years at jc she went to university and now we are doing ldr we have never sent nudes sure we i want nudes but i would never ask her for them or pressure her into it    instead we use videochat to masturbate together and then i fly up to see her once a month to fuck her brains out and watch her eat and listen to her sleep and kiss her forehead and tell her i love her also get her to punch me shes really good at punching me
  instead we use videochat to masturbate together  theres fucking weird
  thats actually pretty normal
  yeah i do that with my ldr gf all the time a few times a week or so   its kinda nice yeah not the same as actually playing with her but its better than nothing also i have a few videos saved up
  crack  sip   back in my day we just kept it in our pants and went off like a firehose when we actually got to see each other
  yep i wish things were still like that  my gf is younger than i am she kinda wants the online masturbation i shouldnt complain as well closing the gap in a few months so well get that rabbit fucking time soon enough
  i only ask for nudes because im too shy to video chat let alone masturbate on a video chat with my gf    go fuck yourself if you think other people arents allowed to deserve something
should i break up with my ldr  yes      because she doesnt wanna give nudes  no
  im too shy to video chat let alone masturbate on a video chat with my gf    whats your girl number im not shy
  top kek
is there anyone here have tried mewinghow long does it take to achieve your desired effect is there a possibility that when you started at a young age theres a greater chance your face will change faster
  whats mewing
  i think its various tongue exercises that are supposed to move your lower jaw forward
  why would one do that
  its not its literally training yourself to hold your jaw and tongue in their normal resting state it will work for phenomenally disfigured individuals but if you have no abnormalities its literal snake oil
  but if you have an overbite you wont be able to keep the jaw in the correct place since the teeth will not be aligned correctly to lock
its gonna take a long time to achieve any significant results but ive been doing it for about 7 months now and i look a lot better than i did before
  got any pics
when i am drinking how do i gauge my level of drunkerness
  experience    but if im going to put it into terms you really cant understand heres how id guage it    1 buzzed  you feel basically the same but less worried that problem yeah you know maybe tomorrow ill deal with it i feel good you feel good smiles all around  2 drunk  you feel like hot shit youre smart youre cool fuck yeah maybe your eyes cant see as far as before but who cares fun times now  3 too drunk  yeash yoush prey coo righ yeah yoush ahr gotta take a pish whoa floah why yoush movin  4 way too drink  spins vomit maybe and always black out
  ok never vomited so good
  the amount of alcohol you absorbed
  it changes as you get experience  im a bit of an alcoholic and i dont throw up any more unless i drink way too fast   but if i drink too much over a night i can still black out
i feel like i cannot have sex if i dont have some connection with the other party it just doesnt feel right to me i have had many opportunities but always rejected them at the same time i never had that kind of romantic connection that i searched for    not sure what to do im 25 also male people assume im female when i ask about this online
  keep searching for the connection the sex is only worth it in that context  t found the connection but gave up the search at a time to get action and it was not worth it
    where does the sexual frustration figure in all of this
    how special and romantic would you define the right connection 
so i applied to a job 2 weeks ago and after submitting the application the application status showed a status of in progress a few days later i received an email for a one way video interview which i submitted last week wednesday after submitting the video the application status changed to video interview completed then this tuesday the status changed back to in progress with the date of november 27 now it still shows in progress but the date of the status update changed to november 29    do i still have a chance am reading two much into this i just really want this position
please help im crazy
mate calm the fuck down they probably have hundreds of people top go through it takes time mate
it looks like they are using a broken system for tracking applications anyway a person would follow up with a call after each step which i assume didnt happen  they havent even noticed your application
messed it up big today  i have a 60 janitor job at this office building  being the math illiterate that i am i thought nothing of it  i follow the cleaning plan that is in a folder  so proud of myself that i got things in order or so it seemed  my janitor boss sends text on wednesday saying remember to clean this and that room etc  its not corresponding with the cleaning plan so i pay no mind/forget as im also aware that its something i dont understand  i dont understand the system so im lost  thought i had it under control  find out i shouldve cleaned this one building today not enough time at 15pm  right then and there i wanted to tie a noose and hang myself i was so ashamed that i cant even grasp basic shit within a janitor job
its not a big deal people can live without a clean office for a deal i understand why you feel bad about it though i would too
  my boss talked about certain square feet a janitor have to clean everyday etc and this corresponds with my 60 job  ever since my father gave up on teaching me math as a kid ive struggled trough the system  it still holds me back even to this day  scared of facing and learning the essentials in math and in the workforce i need this to work  shame keeps me from seeking help with it  its like my entire being all that i am and are good at becomes irrelevant when i think about it
this isnt a math issue    if you are honest dont steal stuff from the offices and can clean they will keep you talk to boss ask him to give you a daily list of what to clean boss guy is getting paid to understand and manage that schedule what you are calling math you job is to clean when he points and says clean that    now from a math stand point make sure you read being paid fairly and dont announce you are bad a math because that make it easy for boss to overwork you without paying
  try and put the shame part behind you and ask your boss for more simple instructions i want to do the best job i can but i get a little confused as to which rooms or buildings you need me to service is there a floor plan that you could please circle the rooms/buildings on
hi quick question    when it comes to texting girls from dating apps is there a sweet spot when asking them out because sometimes girls hate it when you drag it on for too long and some girls are uncomfortable being asked out too early     there doesnt seem to be a middle ground
first text them about something interesting about them    then be like we should talk this over coffee/drinks    then stick your penor inside them
i really want to write a long love letter to a classmate that dropped a course im in i never see her anymore and i want to express how much i miss her is this a bad idea when we really didnt talk all that much i fell in love with her and its killing me that all i have is her email
fuck off creep    thatll be her response   look for some else
is this a bad idea  yes im curious though where did you get the idea that it isnt
  im a 20 year old virgin whos been single for 4 years and i lack a someone else to find anymore im very repressed in spite of my appearances and personality
  same thing im just really repressed and lack any females in my friend group
shes also a foot taller than me so idek why im bothering
  but where did you get the idea that a love letter is the appropriate way to get a date
god damn what is this the 90s dude get a facebook and look her up
do not write a love letter to a girl that you barely talked to your best bet is to find her through facebook or something and say something like hey it was cool chatting with you in class want to hang out sometime
dont write a love letter to someone whom you never talked to youll come off as creepy what you wanna do is find her on facebook and talk to her through that ask her on a date and go from there dont be stupid use your brain
  ask her on a date through facebook   this comes off as creepy too
20307401    yeah i know im not saying the first message should ask for a date im saying talk to her for a bit so your not creepy then ask for a date
  yeah thats really creepy dont be creepy shell probably contact the authorities its over you never got to know her stop projecting feelings of loneliness onto people you dont know virgin
how the fuck do you text a girl and get her to meet up
send dick pic
  a common hey how its going toots
  i always use the line  im finna elliot rodgers my dorm unless i get my dick wet  and it works
  you dont start with a text you start with facetoface chat then you can text chatting today was fun want to continue ill buy the coffee
could you stay in a longterm relationship with someone who has a vastly different political stance is vocal about it and at the same time tries to shame you for your political bearing rather than allowing a argument based discussion    pic not related
  is this a question about you or are you asking anons what they would do  either way no
  i couldnt live with anyone who is vocal about anything whether its politics or something else they need to have an actual personality outside of the thing theyre interested in
i wouldnt want a woman who was very vocal about how great the jews are all the time thatd be weird
  yes because i like to be antagonistic and start arguments every day
dont date anyone who shames you about yourself
  its my position i phrased it so as if anons would be judging for themselves not for me
  if i love them then yeah politics does not come before family there is a difference if he/she is being consistently belligerent about everything they believe in or if its just a few topics that are touchy for them
  sometimes you deserve to be shamed
  rather than allowing a argument based discussion  this is kind of a important point
    no
id shit on her in political debate daily my arguments are polished and cant be beaten fuck liberals
  the problem is that liberals dont want to hear your arguments and will avoid listening to you
  no and honestly only because of the shaming part it takes a special stupid kind of petty basic person that shaming over politics is some nextlevel npc shit
id never be friends with someone i disagree with politically let alone fuck them a bunch of times
  if you want to convert women to your side generally you appeal to emotion they dont care about how blacks are a net negative on society and it makes 100 logical sense to ship them out if they have a black friend or have some sort of emotional connection to anything related to that    so how do you argue feelings
  conservatives after watching antisjws cringy yt videos
  lol its funny because in the society we live in minorities are gaining more and more power while you can only sperg on 4chan
  lol minorities are just given temporary seats of power because whites have so much they feel bad about it dont think we couldnt wipe you all out in a day if we really wanted to you big lipped baboon
no    shes a slave who follows the same programming as everyone else  im not a programmed slave and i dont respect the two party system
  keep seething delusional nazi psycho  probably you are half moroccan but you think you are white anyway you know very well how things are going and where we are going towards if you dont like that you can stop being retarded or go live in space
could you stay in a longterm relationship with someone who has a vastly different political stance  yes    tries to shame you for your political bearing rather than allowing a argument based discussion  no
  and at the same time tries to shame you for your political bearing  this is where it breaks down this kind of thing only works if you have mutual respect it cant be all on you to make it work
  not from a partner a partner should provide support and solutions society and oneself can provide the shame
in a longdistance relationship with my gf  have been arguing every single night distant during the day  expecting the relationship to end soon  yesterday i went with my family to the beach some family friends were with us  family friend my age and i ended up alone together  we had made out before i met gf this is the first time we were alone since i had been with my gf  groped her tits grabbed her ass kissed her twice  didnt do anything more than that  we went back to the beach  go home  talk to my gf expecting things to go bad there  talk   things didnt go as bad as i expected    were not as good as we were as when we were happy but we didnt argue i wouldnt do it again and i made it clear to the family friend that it was a mistake that i shouldnt have done and wont be repeating     i dont know if i should my gf or not should i tell her leave her should i take this secret to my grave and just try to be a better boyfriend until we decide its not working out    i dont know what to do i feel like if i told her i cheated i would be causing her unnecessary pain
what are you waiting for idiot break up with your girlfriend clearly youre not feeling it for her anymore if youre groping and making out with other chicks fess up and break up dumbass youre making the both of you miserable
  i wouldnt do that because i love my significant other you did that likely because you dont there is nothing wrong with that but it is time to move on op clearly youre both unhappy and sometimes shit cant or isnt worth saving
  fess up and break up    but why fess up wouldnt it be better to say    this relationship isnt working neither one of us is happy lets not do this anymore
im going to get flamed for saying this but no dont tell her about the cheating unless you legit want to break up first of all you will not get good boy points for your honesty it will just make things worse second of all if only two people know something happened then its just like it never happened at all    if its an ldr then she is probably getting some on the side too so dont worry about it
  no id want to know so id be able to get over them a lot easier kind of like geez this faggot cheated on me hes not worth me having a pity party over
    i dont want to ruin her trust in other people if she doesnt trust me anymore then okay i would understand i dont want her to be paranoid and insecure in the future because of something i did though
  so youd rather keep her trapped in a relationship with someone who doesnt want to be with her id say that will ruin her trust more than anything if you would stay with her even if you dont love her then that teaches her that any prospective partners might be staying with her out of pity and not because they want to be with her    just leave youre not happy shes not happy make a clean break so you both are free
  so youd rather keep her trapped in a relationship with someone who doesnt want to be with her    no absolutely not    1 i do want to be with her    2 i dont want her to be trapped in a relationship with someone who lies to her    i want her to know exactly who shes with and i want her to know the truth however    were talking right now and shes perfectly happy and in a good mood  im afraid of ruining her christmas/new year    and of course i dont want to wait her until after the new year because by then the fact that i had kept it so long from her will hurt her    however im not gonna stay with her out of pity if i stay with her its because i actually want to be with her    i know that im not happy but shes much much more happier than me in the relationship and the arguing is wearing /me/ down i know things arent good now but i know they could be    i do want to be with her i do want to tell her what i did however i want to do it with causing her the least amount of pain possible how can i do this
  the least amount of pain possible would be if you told her the truth broke up with her and did it as soon as fucking possible dont be a moron
update    i told her    ama
the first and only girl ive ever had a relationship with died when she was 23  its been 8 years now and i havent been in a relationship since i always think about her and compare anyone i date to her and i lose interest im lonely but i cant get over her what should i do
dont forget the past but the only way to grow is to get out there dont forget it honor them when your able but dont let the memory of the fallen keep you from growing as a person
  holy shit that sucks im sorry anon sometimes things get better sometimes they dont i dont have any adivice for you but i really hope it gets better for you
  posts like yours terrify me more than anything    love of my life left me 4 months ago cant go a day without crying or missing her with passionate intensity been doing no contact in response to her trying to friendzone me    if i still feel like this in like a year ill absolutely kill myself i cant fucking fathom suffering like this for 8 years
therapy
sorry to create a thread here but i cannot post on /soc/    there is a girl thats pretty normal uses tinder but wants a serious relationship pretty usual in my country   im really really interested in her but i only give a couple glimpses  we keep talking pretty often everyday for a week  its often funny talk joking around etc and more serious stuff about her    she responds everytime but she never asks personal questions i do ask her questions pretty often we discussed very personal stuff about her at some point    how do i make her more interested in getting to know me  she said shes ok to meet me the second day we talked but she never says when
bumps
no one  really 
is pic related
she seems like a nice person i would go meet her right away
maybe you seem so interested that she loses interest   if someone is way too i interested before even meeting that might feels off and sends weird vibes
so wednesday night i was at my usualy pub student hangout just having a drink when i saw what looked like a couple sitting in the corner seeming out of place    make eye contact with woman smile slightly  she smiles back  go back to minding my own business because i think they are a couple  later she walks by me and slaps my ass on the way to the bathroom  when she comes back starts dancing and grinding up on me  her guy pulls out his phone and starts filming  wtfjpeg  we talk a bit she asks if i have a girlfriend  she and the guy switch places  i start stroking her leg  my husband should be here soon  he arrives we all have a chat  other guy her ex looks slightly phased while shes flirting with me crossing his legs and looking away  husband seems a bit uneasy but cool about it  back on the floor i grab her tits and we make out  tells me she wants me now  tell her no can do due to whiskey coke dick  gives me her number saying i should call her next week when i want to fuck  the guys urge her to leave with them she still wants to convince me  i am physically incapable of getting it up and not too sure if thats really alright with the other men so i tell her not tonight    should i call her i want to fuck her but i am also a bit concerned about their whole deal id have no problem cucking them or sending pics/videos or such but if its not 100 consensual i dont want to get involved what do you think
forgot to mention im 25 they are all early 40s
  ive fucked girls behind their boyfriends back and i didnt care one bit the weirdest thing about that is the guy who was filming the whole thing that would be where i draw the line no cameras
  yeah usually i wouldnt care dont ask dont tell  but due to a different story right now im not too keen on ruining another relationship bit of a moralfag in that department currently
  switch places from what grinding and recording or talking
  haha gross maybe thats why your dick didnt work
  sitting we were sitting at a table    no she was legit hot but i was drunk and on coke i tired in my room later that night and couldnt get past half mast so calling it off for that night was the right decision
i fucked a prostitute in china with a condom i feel fine desu am i safe lads
  99 of the time no symptoms means youre fine go get tested because itll eat away at you until you know for sure but you can expect them to come back negative
  you used a condom so it is unlikely to occur
  if you used a condom youll be fine also hiv shouldnt be heavily spreaded in china you even have to get tested if order to get a student visa    the real question is why you paid to have sex with a chinese theyre hideous
  i didnt pay a buddy of mine did
  what are you even taking about hiv may remain dormant for years if you have reasons to be worried you should get tested as soon as possible which is a month past the moment of exposure and then repeat the test after about 4 months for 100 accuracy   it isnt op case though
  get tested and next time dont fuck whores in 3rd world countries
is there anything i can do to help my gf get some body confidence she is a bit heavy but wears it well and in my opinion has a great body she however sees herself as a cow is there anything i can do to help her see herself as being as hot as i see her    pic kinda related her body looks a lot like proxy from the neck down at her biggest
  well pic related looks like a cow but i love cows
  remind her that you love her and have sex with extra gusto when she is feeling insecure
so so far on separate days i have taken 5mg and 10mg and they have done nothing for me so far what is the maximum before i shouldnt bother with these ritalin tablets
consult a doctor for fucks sake i cant believe people use prescription drugs without consulting the doctor its one thing if youve been taking it for a while and know what works and what doesnt but you are clearly new to it  short answer is it depends im 22 male weigh 75kg at 18 meters and use ritalin la at 30mg but i handle ritalin quite well and not everyone would 5 and 10mg is absolutely nothing for a healthy adult  have you been diagnosed with add/adhd if not forget it its not a magic drug that makes everyone better at studying  its like glasses it helps people with poor eyesight see but it doesnt mean a person with healthy eyesight will benefit from them
  add but uk nhs takes a long time to get the right medicine ive been taking privately til i get the right amount/tablets then i can refer it back to the nhs and get it for free
adhd anon here do no self dose just because you have adhd doesnt mean you cant get addicted to literal stimulants trust me you need to speak to your doc imho i take 20 ir adderrqll and when i was younger i took around 25 ritalin once a day

  smoke crack
  this  i went to an improvslowdancemultigenrecamp because i fucking hate dancing but i wanted to get over my fear of it so that at least when someone asks me to dance at a party i can say no without my heart jumping into my throat   i did some dancing and a lot of not dancing  some ok dancing and some cringeworthy dancing  afterwards it felt sorta awful and sorta awesome  10/10 wouldnt do again but im still glad i did it
  do what you want if you can manage to get paid for doing it all the better
  theres nothing to laugh about when making mistakes nothing at all
id say do whatever it takes to get financially independent as early as possible get some roommates live in a van anything to cut your costs and invest more of your takehome pay    once youre able to pay your bills via your investments then your life can properly begin

im bulimic have been for almost 10 years   my teeth are starting to rot
broke up officially some time in the summer long story short i lied to him about a dark battle i had been struggling with for quite some time after the lies caught up to me and everything was brought to light i had an epiphany i committed myself to doing the next right thing no matter what i ripped my mask off and vowed never to lie again or hide something in fear of the reaction at this time it was already too late he lost all respect love and even interest in me we tried working it a few times but he is convinced ill hurt him again and do the same shit i did to lose him initially he was psychologically abusive and as long as he was in my life i allowed him to treat me poorly i did everything he asked me too i still would too yet he cant find it in his heart to love me again he lost respect for me and looks at me as an enemy we kept communication via email and i loved it it wasnt too much to ask for from him and it kept me hopeful that he could still be in my life even if it wasnt as my bf last month he had a change of heart he text me asking why i deserve to talk to him and how could i lie to someone i love yada yada yada i always answer his questions and have to be content with him leaving mine unanswered our conversation lead toan argument which lead to him completely cutting me off i am so broken inside and feel worthless pos i regret taking him for granted and hurting someone who didnt deserve to be hurt he was the only person to ever walk into my life and completely change it for the best he was so patient intelligent and different super funny dude too he accepted me my silly habits he found to be adorable always had butterflies when he looked and me or when we kissed i miss him and each day without him gets worse i just want an email
holy fuck im actually doomed
i made a lot of bad decisions in my youth when i was 1214 i talked to significantly older men online all the time and would have basically a mini harem in various time zones giving me a constant stream of suffocating attention i needed but also demands that made me uncomfortable if and when they got emotionally attached id drop them and theyd be crazy and scary during this time i also abused pills and drank heavily from 1315 at 14 i entered an abusive and hostage like relationship that led to enduring public and lasting humiliation and complete social ostracization the next 2 years were spent on partying drinking having bad sex and new public embarrassments to forget the old after all that and the bottomest of rock bottoms i pulled myself up got good grades and into a decent college   several years and a few backslides later im in a happy loving relationship and on track to get my degree i love my boring life i get drunk off 2 glasses of wine and can barely digest beer i havent even seen pills since high school but when im feeling paranoid and insecure i have the urge to construct a second life again and like be a cam girl or something whats wrong with me man
one of my bosses at my internship one of the higher ups complained about my behavior in a completely exaggerated way and had egged me on in this incident im incredibly upset and my supervisor seems worried because he had to give me the talk and i was really down all day which is very unlike me   i feel extra bad because my supervisor was really trying his hardest to cheer me up and take my side but i just wasnt into it today i made the excuse that i was tired and he told me to get some rest when he and his girlfriend dropped me off but i think i was a little bit cold  should i apologize to him should i indulge in him that i was actually really really hurt that i was complained about he seems really close to me and hes very much taken me under his wing i just dont want him to feel hurt because im upset and being kind of cold he was concerned all day

i think tomorrow im going to cut off a long time friend because of his drug problem hes ran up a bill in my name to between 500 and 1000 dollars and has made no attempt to pay me back yet was trying to spend a large sum of money on something he really doesnt need that would equal most of what he owes me he dodges me over small amounts of money i borrowed him at this point im seriously asking if he is a sociopath to some degree and tries to hide it and now his drug problem has made him compromise that to some degree and show he truly doesnt give a shit about anyone but himself yep i think tomorrow im gonna get some of my shit back from him and tell him how it is im tired of hearing how im your brother your boy and pull this kinda shit on me on a consistent basis dodge me over 20 i borrowed them for a week after they said they would get it back to me the next day all so they can get 1 or 2 more pills running up a bill under my name cause they spent all their money on pills and didnt have any left to pay their part never making any attempt to pay me back for said bill but willing to drop money on whatever catches his fancy plus a bunch of other shit i know they are gonna lie thru there teeth about    ive tried to reach out to them told them they need to slow down and look at what they are spending all their money on they need to dial back on the pills they need to pay their bills and pay them on time he was at one time a really good friend but now with all the shit hes done and continues to do lets just say im sick of being put in a hard spot because he said he was gonna do something and doesnt not because he cant but because he dont want to after saying he would i know im not the only one annoyed with him for the same shit and i know a lot of people would have walked away a long time ago and im just now to that point    so yup tomorrow one way or another im getting my shit back and cutting him loose
this is actually going to happen   im nervous at the fact that we are actually closing the gap  in a short time  i at the age of 30 will be leaving my parents house and will be traveling over 2400 miles 3 to 4 days a car and a uhaul   im terrified  this is so much  i should be excited not scared right  we finally get to be together but im filled with fear  i feel bad for wanting to chicken out for wanting to just stop everything and not do it im scared and want to cry this is so much
people tell me i walk like a zombie my eyes vacant and staring at nothing i seem miserable  i am miserable i have delusions that everyone is better than me and hates my guts the sad part is i know theyre delusions but they feel so real at the time how can i be sure they dont really hate me sometimes i see people staring me down in my peripheral but when i muster up the courage to stare them down theyre either talking to someone else not facing my direction or not even the right person ive only had one person actually stare but hes an odd guy so i just shrugged at him and mouthed what he looked away i avoid eye contact as much as i can to avoid annoying anyone but then they ask why im so quiet or ignoring them    i try i really try to ignore my avoidant thoughts but they always win in the end people want to be my friend but i keep feeling like a burden
i want to kiss ella    on her boobies
  she went into a doughnut shop and spit on a tray of food that other people were going to purchase and eat
  im neutral about arianna but if someone at work told me they wish someone died id nope so hard out of there i already had one dipshit threat me with a thumbtack im not taking risks
how do you help someone thats stubborn and wont listen to others
   i already had one dipshit threat me with a thumbtack im not taking risks  poor baby
  you actually believe this
their hands are red with blood    they are covered in it    they tried to make people better    im living proof of their crimes     none of you have once bothered to ask how they acquired the technologies they use
  there is no other way to do it and they were under extreme pressure and time restraints the enemy was believed to be attempting the same thing and the first one to reach their goals would win ultimate power     yes i dont just believe i know for a fact this is what they did     the more you know the shorter your life will be
  i suffer from crippling anxiety and existential dread     i just quit drinking after 5 years of daily heavy drinking and im impatient to see the results of positive feedback even though i know the change wont be permanent if im only in it for rewards     im not sure if my wife likes or loves me     im not sure how i feel most of the time     tonight instead of drinking alcohol i stupidly decided to drink 8 cups of coffee up until 1000 pm and now cannot sleep and its 130 am here and i have 4 and a half hours before i need to go to work     despite all the problems i am proud of myself for being brave with the issues i have and for bettering myself even if my life doesnt get any better
  spend more time with your wife
thank you /adv/
  i am lately its difficult because she is so internal i cant read whether she is happy or not we communicate about this and are in therapy to hopefully help but i can never fully trust that im enough for anyone without blatant dictation on their part
i cant goddamn sleep i should have known that having too much caffeine and sugar after dark would do this but i dont think thats the only thing keeping me up   im not working right now due to some physical and mental health concerns part of the reason why i decided to take this time off after a 10 year career in higher education is because the company that i worked for prior to my last employer has offered me a payout of the pension i had with them this means im entitled to a lump sum of 11k after taxes sounds pretty sweet right thing is i turned in all the paperwork on time but the company contacted me to let me know that i forgot to sign something i corrected this and they got the signed form so now i just have to wait but my paranoid sleepdeprived brain is scared shitless that the money wont come in mind you i have a good amount of money in my savings that can cover me for a couple of months but without this money im kinda fucked its supposed to come in today but i just cant relax until i see it in my account
  based beyond reality
  i think i am too naive and i am really afraid i will be betrayed when i go to work im 18 still have uni not a brag btw but i am trusting friendly and nice to almost everyone and try to see the good in people    somedays i wish i could just go full sociopath and lose all my empathy to become cooler i feel like im not taken seriously especially when i was voted to lead my school club none of the members really respected me and im kinda pissed about that
  am a girl btw i can only imagine how much it is for guys
  worse

  thank you i feel invisible right now
  its not me you should be trying to make piece with    its your creator thats the being you should be finding words for
  thanks for the ragefuel
  who am i then
now that i and other circumstances managed to motivate her to finally get her shit straight and start working towards her future i think im going to give it another year before contacting her again hopefully she will have made good progress and maybe even caught up some of those wasted years i hope she wont be angry anymore then but i had to make her angry because thats just how she works shits gotta get worse before it gets better    meanwhile ill sit here trying not to be crushed under the weight of the fuckload of patience you require
its like i said i know it was my brother and neil getting into my computer and fucking with me i saw them doing it it was justins car idling outside or him in the basement smoking a cigarette with my dads help it was also paul martinez sickbrush the little asian boy james and more they formed a little group trying to hurt me    they were intercepting my messages to renee they were blocking them on my facebook and email that is the reason it was acting funny that is one of the reasons i couldnt talk to anyone my dad left his computer on so that my brother could use it to get on the network and get to my computer    not only were they blocking my conversations they were posing as me too sending texts images and more pretending to be me     and not only were they pretending to be me they were stealing my words which were often times poetic romantic or far more complex and interesting than their own in order to impress girls and claim posts that were mien to be theirs they were for the last two years constantly trying to see what i would think about different things like my thoughts on true love in order to copy what i was saying and pretend to be romantic intelligent and creative like i am     they stole my words songs everything when i talked about what a good person was when i talked about our personalities being reflected by one another or being a spectrum they were all using my words as their own so their partners would think better of them its truly fucking pathetic    i know they stole their nude photos they sent me i know they used them as blackmail    there was that time i used my brothers phone to text renee and he seemed extremely nervous i didnt know that he was trying to contact her too and i helped him do it they were always lying to me    you cant trust these people they act nice to be manipulative they lie about everything i dont trust them i dont know why they do this but they were and apparently still are
  they will get heirs     they are so confident that they will never be touched that they will never get in trouble for anything theyve done but they will i know more than they think i do in fact i know something that they dont     ive seen things they dont believe ive experienced things they havent     there are things out there much larger than man    i have extremely powerful friends i have friends on the outside and they got my back
you didnt answer my question
  i saw them come from the house next door get in his car and drive away i saw justin and neil this was about a year ago    i hear voices coming from the house next door the one thats closest from time to time when i do or say something they get really upset when i do something that makes myself look good or makes them look bad the people in that house are not on my side but i dont know who they are when i do find out who they are they are going to fucking pay for what they have been doing to me    my mother helps them but i dont know how pretty sure she is the one fucking with that package or taking shit from my room and putting bugs in it she is constantly trying to get me locked up in a psych or drug rehab clinic
  have you reported the rapes to the police
i got sent to a mental hospital my mother convinced me to go to the er they asked me if i was willing to go and i agreed i thought since i volunteered to go they could only hold me for 72 hours the psychiatrist wasnt even there when i was admitted he probably diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type before i even met him ill admit that i was having a manic episode and delusional thinking but his report said that i was having hallucinations when i never had any and never told anyone i had hallucinations they held me for 6 days before they let me go the only reason they did was because i threatened to sue if they didnt they wanted to keep me for 21 days but i had a job and a girlfriend to get back to well about 3 weeks later i didnt have that job my team lead said it would look better if i quit than if i got fired so i did before i had my episode i bought an engagement ring for the girl i had been dating for 5 years and living with for 4 i proposed to her after i got out of the hospital and she said yes about a month later we were broken up i get the impression she doesnt understand what bipolar disorder is she thinks i choose to act the way i do when im manic and just need to open up to her when im depressed my bills are starting to pile up and my savings is almost out all ive got left besides that is like 4000 in my 401k that will only cover about 1/4 of my debt im turning 26 soon so ill no longer be able to use my dads health insurance ive pretty much hit rock bottom
what now they are trying to make me believe that they are making up a disorder in order to make me make a claim that isnt true in order to make the other ones seem not true as well    christ you people suck at this
    well think about the upside of things youre free now and you dont have anything to lose and things could always be worse for example your dick could stop working    
  no i was young and dumb and didnt know better i cant persue charges nowm before you berate me i already know that i was an idiot about it and fucked up
i think its cute that you feel ashamed of yourself
  lol thanks anon made me chuckle
  not reporting it doesnt make you an idiot
  why what are you going to do about it
  yes it does at least she knows she should have     you need to make sure people know about this so other girls arent victimized
  i think its cute that you dont
why do you think i would believe that when have you faggots ever told the truth in these messages    i know they are guilty for the things in the past but youre clearly just to throw me off the trail here this was 100 the nsas doing when it comes to my package those faggots are going to fucking die and if i cant find specifically who im going after their agents     you fuckfaces torture people human trafficking and illegally experiment on people you spy on people illegally am i sure damn sure you do so because you think youll never get caught and that you guys will keep getting away with it time and time again     fuck you people and your organization youre all going to fucking burn
  as if you own her
  burn in hell im contemplating suicide and you wanna go on the protection brigade burn in hell whatever you reply will never be worse than what he said to me while he held a knife to spine while fucking me from behind where were you then
  yeah what a creep
  we dont know each other
  hes going to do that to some other girl because you didnt do anything about it its probably easier on your conscience to ignore that isnt it
  dont mind him he is obviously incapable of empathy
im dating a guy who im in love with but i really want a girlfriend hes okay with me getting a girlfriend/open to polyam but i cant find a girl that i get along with and want to take things to the next level with at the same time i keep thinking about one girl i fell for/fell for me years ago it was always on and off and long distance shes now dating some other girl and totally blinded by infatuation and dgaf about me atm
  you work the slaves until they are dead you guys even know this you know that is what they are doing to me    but not a single fucking one of you is going to do shit about it     absolutely amazing youre all terrible fucking people
of course the broads in the rich neighborhood didnt fuck me in fact one of them spat i stood in the driveway hit myself and cried the rest of the day and magically the next shes gone probably at daddys house because she pitched a bitch about having to be around a retard shes not scared shes clever and she knows im going to want to groom her so she runs for the hills i wish her parents would set me up an arranged marriage with her when she turns 16 so much
how is that a stretch    look at what you are doing today i am a slave you are using for illegal and unethical experimentation youre still fucking doing it and youre trying to say that past experimentation didnt happen fucking really    you people are fucking disgusting and have no regard for the laws or any kind of morals i know for a fact you used human fetuses as experiments because i am the result of that i am also the result of your ai research and experiments    how can you say its unlikely to have happened if you are still fucking doing it
  stop blaming everyone else for what happened to you im sure as hell not responsible for what some disgusting rapist did to you
  talk to a therapist there are a lot of support groups out there
trying to sell something over here even after putting a reasonable discount because hey man im your friend come on i still get shit for it    worst thing is he hasnt ever done such thing for me in 20 years he hasnt ever fucking done something because im his friend no discounts always complaints every favor i have to pay him the same price as anyone would pay him at that point i was always more of a customer hell i lost 100 of which most went to his pocket on absolutely fuck all    like i know money and friends bullshit like that but from all the people i knew hes my childhood friend we keep talking to each other about very personal stuff but when it comes to favors hes the least helpful person while asking for more help than others what the fuck now
i am baphomet   the good and the evil the wise and the fool the man and the woman the healer and the destroyer the powerful and the weak   my potential is infinite but limited i will rise and fall but stronger in every step i take and closer to god in every decision i make
  youre not any of those things youre gay
  no youre a person
  you will know and if you knew me    i am more than a person but like everyone else my life is in the hands of god
i got out of the hole anons im going to keep coming back here as often as time allows with my richly meaningful life to try to drag at least one of you out of the hole with me you have to want help though     have a good day
  i think that at least one of the things you wrote isnt true
im such a loser huh
  no just butthurt
  the way you save the drowning isnt by drowning with them its by either getting a boat or pushing them away
im glad that we can be boring together
  true
i feel very sick right now earlier this week i was so happy wednesday i was on a high am i so high functioning so nothing is wrong with me please i know something is because when i dont take the supplement my mind is in shambles probably why now maybe im suffering because i havent taken it yet know happiness isnt a 24/7 thing but it hurts very much when its a fleeting feeling i cant seem to get out fully and experience life in the now im always focussing on the future i want to be loved too i dont think theres anything wrong with that my head is pounding im hearing myself talk im barely able to stay coherent i keep thinking violent thoughts i would like to find someone into bdsm so i can at least let them out i feel like ill never be able to have normal relationship after what happened to me as child  its getting loopy now may nothing happen when i am
  same
why is everyone bullshitting me why does everyone tell me normies arent happy or that happiness is not a real thing or all that dumb shit when its extremely clear that im sad all the time and the people around me are not  even if they are just pretending to be happy or not truly happy they are at least way more functional in society than i am everything is easier for them than it is for me
i think im getting involved in a love triangle
i broke up with my ex girlfriend almost 2 years ago i still miss her but she seems to be doing fine we dont talk anymore and the few times ive messaged her to say sorry and wishing her the best she leaves me on read she still kept some of our pictures on her facebook just not of us kissing should i try and get back with her or let it go her and i shared a lot of great memories and had bonded so well but i fucked it up help
  im already in 1
  ha my birthdays today you know how many of my friends wished me a happy birthday    two

  not over here its almost 1600 and 20
  you might have a disorder if you have done a lot of dumb shit
im madly in love with my gf and i know i want to marry her one day ive dated a lot of girls and ive never had this feeling before i just know i never been more sure of anything am i crazy
if only i was one of those people that were always fantastic forever but i wasnt so tough shit
  yep
you drive me fucking crazycand i shouldve never started dating you yes i do love you but holy fuck the stress and emotional weight ive gotten over these last 2 years is finally starting to kill me i feel i cant make you happy everytbing i do and say is wrong im apparently always angry and overreacting eventho i feel like im not and i fucking hate that we arw on the brink of breaking up and its filling me with sadness fuck off
is it weird that im a rugged individualist but also a bleeding heart liberal
ive slowly begun to accept dying  my depression and anxiety have taken its toll i feel like but these past few days ive felt so content with finally ending my life it sounds dumb but ive begun to be at peace with it i know that no matter what im going to be stuck this way for the rest of my life and to me i dont see the point in continuing to hurt myself and feel this way i feel like everyone is going to be okay without me even though i know it will be hard thats why im going to make it look like an accident that way no one thinks they did wrong i feel happy for once in so many years with this idea i honestly smile and think about how great it will be to finally be at rest to stop being so tired and crying all the time im ready im ready to go my life has honestly gone to shit with my job my life even my relationship im not even religious and i prayed that god would give me a sign and i see the signs things getting worse never seeming to find a way out i think god is telling me that its okay to let go
  nothing left to do than to just fucking do it fuuuuuuuckckckckck   as long as im awake enough to do shit it doesnt matter if i fuck up i just need to keep doing shit
      i should note weve been together for a little over 3 months which is why i wonder if im crazy
  no youre in the honeymoon phase
i need some help please someone offer me some advice im going to start working for the first time in the middle of january as a nursery teacher and i am nervous as fuck i cant sleep well and i keep thinking about how they will overwork me and how horribly ill fail i have anxiety and its so crippling i cant even think about the positive things about this job and i cant even quit because im bound to a 1 year agreement     and on top of that im dealing with family problems this problematic bitch relative of mine whos quite close to the family suddenly got into a shitfit for the pettiest reason and she keeps hounding my family its impossible to get her away and i had to resort to looking for ways to cast a hex on her so she would simmer down and go away do these candle curses work at all    anyway im a mess right now i need some advice on how to get by and survive this year please someone please help me
i feel like my relationship is falling apart like im always the one putting in the effort she says she loves me but now i dont feel like its true the worst part is im afraid of bringing up my feelings about all this if feels like self sabatoge
so the girl im thinking about getting with keeps asking me if im mad at her    what gives
my gf and her mom had another argument over me the mom thinks im trying to kill her gf defends me its fucking exhausting trying to calm things down from time to time her mom might have a few screws loose and all i wanted was for them to met half way not to have them fight
i hope they dont sell that car until next week when i will buy it myself because otherwise i dont think i will be able to not kill myself
so me and this girl ive been talking to were supposed to have some dinner last night and hang out she flaked out on me then texted me after i had gone and gotten something to eat that she was hungry im wondering wtf i was supposed to do about it or why she was telling me we were going to have dinner on me and you flaked now youre whining to me about being hungry i just went to bed fuck that shit
  i think god is telling me that its okay to let go  no those demons that are tormenting are telling you that why would god tell you its okay to kill yourself you need to stop listening to your feelings for a while
its really sad  i thought i had a chance to know you better  but youre too far away i cant reach you  i stand no chance
i wish i acted normally  i wish i lowered my hope  i wish i didnt fall
when i got into the boat with you i thought we would go somewhere but youve taken my oar and refuse to let me help you navigate the waters on top of that you keep putting holes in the boat and get angry with me when i try to repair them so we are slowly taking on water we have been in this boat for a long time and have only been going in circles at one point i am going to have to stop trying to fix the holes and get out of this boat before we both sink and drown  its getting to that point
sweet innocent girl i had a crush on in high school  check out her social media page in case i have a shot after all these years  shes morphed into the typical thot even dyed her hair blonde in the style of maximum thotness around her  also shares screenshots from fornite plays  thats one way to cure onetitis
i often neglect my friends because i have social paranoia and feel like i am bugging them if i approach them and not them me
i live in the middle of the desert theres no one here and unfortunately im stuck here for the foreseeable future ive been here long enough that i feel like i should be used to it by now but i think im somehow having to get used to it all over again i just wish i had someone to talk to and hang out with
   wait i thought you were nergal now
im tired of being so detached from my emotions  tired of feeling like an empty husk with no direction  tired of pushing people away especially the one i love the most to my capability  tired of my drug addiction and alcoholism  tired of being a disappointment to my family and myself    just want to cloak myself in darkness and sleep forever
  love triangles end up in two people fighting not love making
  i should be more specific its a love square two boys two girls i and one of the girls are at odds over who likes who shes convinced the other guy and girl like her and me respectively and i think they like one another
  im the same if someone messages me im totally fine otherwise i assume theyre busy or at my worst i think theyre mad at me or dont like me ive been like this forever and dont know how to change
31  shutin never leave home except to go to the supermarket  depressed and suicidal  dont drive due to anxiety  not a single friend or human contact  didnt finish university  barely enough drive to brush my teeth  spend most of the day in bed  no job no qualifications to find one  living with mother also depressed because of me  used to be normal until 2010 then everything fell apart  developed a teeth grinding habit due to stress that is fucking up my mouth  antidepressants/antipsychotics dont work have tried a dozen different therapies  psychiatrist tells me my only hope is the psych ward  it gets worse every day every day i have less energy i might give up
  you take credit for her turning her life around by making her angry im really hope she wont be allowing you into her better life in a year
  my dude how old are you and how long have you felt that way
  you would be surprised the benefit a job would bring even menial work ive been there bro you must resist giving up and find something to strive towards i know you can do it
  well go for the girl that likes you i dont see the problem here lad
i want to ask if you have a girlfriend now but im afraid of the answer especially because i think i helped   i want to die so much you were the last good thing in my life
i get extremely paranoid about relationship things that make no sense  i have a crush on this girl and i had paranoid thoughts about her hanging out with the rest of the friend group without me i didnt act on them but it bothers me that i get this way ive always gotten this way about the girl im with since around my second gf and i dont know how to stop this and really want to
im gonna be a better person im gonna make it im not gonna neglect anything
  i dont think she actually likes me and also shes way into bondage and i am not
im never talking to you again ill never let myself go through this again
  what did they do
  26    because to me out of everyone in the world its the one person that understands how i feel ive become so desperate to try and find a way to feel okay or get out of this and its what ive begun to believe even when i tried to get help it didnt work
  endless bs
  also this actual way for about 6 months now sydudak thoughts for about 13 years
  nah im the same way
ever since you left me i havent been able to muster interest in life itself my heart died the day you left and its stayed dead im just a ghost i hope youre happy at least
  same im planning my suicide over a guy i cant survive this
  show her your asshole thatl change her mind give her a new perspective on things including life
  im not gonna do anything like that because i know my potential but the knowledge that she wouldnt even care if i was actually gone hurts the most she has a new man so why should she care she said she lied to me about loving me for the passed 4 years whatever man im dead inside
just had my first therapy session yesterday it was a consultation to see what would be best for me they gave me a list of therapists near me to contact hopefully i can start living again ive felt so lonely and useless for so long
  i saw my little brother naked today accidentally i didnt know he wasnt circumcised and his cock is huge i kinda wish my boyfriend had his cock
  did the thought of sucking your brother off and swallowing his thick load go through your mind
  no but i thought about wanting to hold it and feel it
  what did you do to her for her to leave you
  mhm ill have to jerk off to that later i love the thought of women being aroused
  i was very angry and mean to her for a long time because she had things going on in her life that made me feel like she didnt care at all she tried her best to fix things but i let myself be negative and hateful i deserve being alone and broken but it still hurts
  get a life you abominations
please block me do this one thing for me so i can move on
i am tired of being 21 and never having gf feels like i am so fucking behind it is not about sex either i just want someone to like
  sorry cant help it my gf spoiled me by always being so wet when she even thought about me women feeling good just gets my motor going
  sounds like my ex who i will never talk to again the thing with women is you can mistreat them for a while but then one day when theyve had enough theyll leave and never look back thats why they say women have an easier time with breakupsits because weve been preparing for it for so long every time you hurt us we lose more and more love for you until one day the pain is stronger than the love then you are dead to us forever you need to move on
  this is exactly what she described to me ive learned a hard lesson and ive vowed to treat the next woman to come into my life with the utmost kindness and care ill never make these awful mistakes againi miss her every single day im only angry with myself for hurting the woman who showed me great tenderness and care i will never be that way againthanks for confirming my worst fears though it gives me some sort of closure
ive been talking to men online even though i am married it turns me on so much and the way they talk to me gets me incredibly wet i also love to think that so many men in my countr have fapped to my photos and have seen my body the other day i sent a picture of myself after i came to a man i was so wet it was dropping out it felt so good to show it to another man and i dont feel guilty at all husband is a jerk anyway
  do the honorable thing and divorce him
  good luck sorry for your broken heart thats great youre planning some changes most want to change but almost no one ever really does
im debilitating i think i may be mentally retarded i feel like ive needed help for so long but i cant be proactive enough to get it whats wrong with me help me
  if she has kids the honorable thing is to stay with him until the kids grow up
  the broken heart is what made me change i suppose in hind sight it was a good thing that she left me for good i hope shell forgive me someday but im not expecting it i did wrong and i have to deal with the consequences for my actions like a man and forge ahead
  i wish i could
  i know its hard but the first thing that youve done right is to accept that you were the one who fucked things up and to acknowledge that the change has to come from you dont wallow in anger at yourself though its poison like that girl said shes not going to talk to you again from the pain that you gave her so you just have to move on i hope you find peace and happiness out of this from sorrow and grief a new person is born who was better than before at least ive learned from my own experiences with lost love
  then love me
  well this made me pitch a tent
  i do
  then im happy i love you so much
  psych
all i want in life is a good woman to homestead with and have lots of strong babies with i exercise read and try to better myself everyday i just dont know where to find her
  not really i know he doesnt love me silly felt nice though
  
  you need to forgive yourself and learn to love yourself and then learn that youre capable of being loved
  _
  this happy women make the world go round
i have realized i basically ended up making a girl develop feelings for me despite herself and despite both of our desire not to get into a relationship i could probably get her to do just about anything i want to at this point in time     i dont know how to avoid ruining her send help
  part 2 i think ive got her questioning her identity as well
  be frank and tell her that you werent meant to hurt her feelings
  shes rather young legal age though and impressionable and i dont know how to do that properly desu     i was acting with my own self interest at heart and i wanted to make sure i could keep her around
  dont be a degenerate and let her go if all you care about is yourself anon dont hurt that poor girl dont ruin her heart
my best and only friend of nearly 10 years recently got a girlfriend and now we dont talk anymore  im lonely and dont have anyone else to talk to  im afraid im starting to hate him because of it
will probably kill myself and i feel okay about it people need to drop the stigma around suicide its not really a big deal and just a response to a situation egging me on is the sense of satisfaction that my soul will get the people responsible will finally have to admit they are wrong and at fault that will live with them for the rest of their lives    theres a small possibility i dont go through with it im waiting to see the immediate outcome of this situation this should take no more than a couple weeks if things return to an equal or better standing i may stay alive but if things stay the same or continue to get worse im done
i woke up this morning immediately feeling shitty and reflecting heavily on the past again i feel nothing but guilt about it
you leaving me for good has inspired a fire within me to be the absolute best man i can be im sorry for dragging you through my negativity and i do hope youre happy with your new man but youve taught me what it means to be a man and im going to move ahead at full steam so i can win the heart of a truly good woman
all ive been doing is bottling up this excessive guilt i feel towards the past and how horrible of a person i used to be i feel like im really close to ending things i dont know how to seek proper help to find forgiveness in myself and to apologize to the people whose lives i affected badly
now thats some real lolita shit
im not sure if i actually want friends/a gf or if i just want the status that comes with it
dont believe them when they say they didnt know  dont accept their apologies  they knew they all knew   they are not sorry none of them     they will be though kill them kill them all
  have you talked to her about this
  thats the thing  were not together  she just more or less worships the ground i walk on
  then whats the problem let her worship you if thats what she wants maybe thats all she wants
  i feel the need to become a better person and am unsure of how
after all these years why please dont do it this way i cant believe how much this hurts
i broke up with my ex girlfriend almost 2 years ago i still miss her but she seems to be doing fine we dont talk anymore and the few times ive messaged her to say sorry and wishing her the best she leaves me on read she still kept some of our pictures on her facebook just not of us kissing should i try and get back with her or let it go her and i shared a lot of great memories and had bonded so well but i fucked it up help ill listen to songs we got high to together and i get emotional sometimes is this irreversible im 21 help please before its too late
i still dont know what the fuck happened between us i dont know whether you need me or not because i could interpret all of this as you having a breakdown in which case you need a friend or is it you just being selfish in which case i dont need that i wish youd been more open when we last talked i dunno whether to feel guilty about distancing myself from you or not i miss you though
  what have they done that makes you think they dont need you
i feel like shit  dont wanna talk to my gf  dont wanna be anywhere near my family  idk what to do  fuck  fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkk
i am idiot and developed feelings and of course i am hurt now     why dont i learn
seriously dont you faggots have anything better to do with your lives how is this still going on     how fucking pathetic are you people
  thanks
please dont do this talk to me
i am really in a good place in my life right now    thank you for fucking up so bad early this year and then continuing to do so so i could heal and be thankful to be away from you    im loving life
im starting to think youve changed your mind about us and that you dont have any intention of ever proposing if im not what you want please tell me i love you so much but my heart is slowly breaking
  i cant remember the last time i felt appreciated by them made me feel like i was a chore and the reason for every unhappiness in their life theyre heavily depressed though and i loved them so that makes shit harder since otherwise itd be an easy clean fuck off
i fucking hate my principal
holy shit take some anger management courses
  chillax your stoned out mind has made you paranoid af
  i know they knew i dont accept their apologies dont worry
just stop it i know you dont really love me get on with life and leave me the fuck alone
anybody wanna talk on the phone about nothing dont be surprised if i just hang up though
it was all a lie
i hold back sometimes i wont  i feel good sometimes i dont
  all things considered i should be a lot fucking angrier    but if you guys think torturing someone to death stealing their entire life from them constantly doing shit to fuck with them and constantly lying to their face shouldnt make someone angry what the fuck is wrong with you    how angry would you be if you found out your entire life was a lie everyone that you have ever met has been lying to you and all the things you perceived as just being really bad luck was actually all by a third parties design and all your suffering and misery was manufactured for their entertainment    i hate all of you so fucking much
how much more am i suppose to take    how much longer is this going to go on    what the fuck is wrong with you people    give me my medications give me the truth
  damn bro i didnt come here to get the feels hope you work that shit out godspeed anon
  i do love you though
  i feel that shit too much bro
im happy
     great then if you love me surely you can give me my initial and yours if you cant you surely dont
  i do know that feeling
  you caught me are you some sort of detective
  no i just know how to spot really horrible people
it has come to my attention that i have made it way too easy to make fun of me since middle school ive always been the quiet and awkward guy and thanks to me further acting this way i am the punching bag at parties   watching asip they mention something along the lines that retarded people cant drive and all of the eyes in the room dart towards me and laughter erupts   that is just one of many examples that ive experienced in my college years  i have decided im going to get out of this hole ive dug myself in i will probably end up being unfazed with the insults and jokes at my expense or the same miserable sack of shit i am today   all i know is that at the end it was all my fault
how do i accept that i will never be good enough for anything but the most entry of entrylevel jobs that i will most likely put off obtaining until i absolutely have to
  are you me now the question is how are we going to change how we feel because i have no clue
for you    
  i go through cycles im generally in a depressed state in my life have been since i was an early teen but then ill start something to try and pull myself out of it stem degree writer nightlife guy spiritual awakening starting a website/webstore every single time though after one or a few months i will experience something that knocks me off the rails and i outright reject all the progress ive made in whatever i was doing and i fall back to my generally depressed state but ever so slightly more entrenched its like trying to climb out of a hole but falling every time and every time you fall you loosen dirt and pull down roots and things that you could use as a hand and foot holds    i decided earlier tonight that if i dont fix this somehow im going to end up eating my own gun im sick of this tiny ass rural city im in 40k people i want to live somewhere condensed and bustling i dont know why but i do im just terrified of making the move i dont want to work for someone else anymore but i have no idea what to do about it i havent had meaningful intimate human contact in 7 years im 32 and i hate my life and i have no one to blame but myself but i dont seem to be able to fix it and i suspect its because deep down i think i deserve the life i have i hate that too
  oh my god what a fucking roller coaster this night has been first i get set off by a story about courtney love then you post this bitch i was in the most desperate unhealthy love with her when i was a teenager when it rains it pours what a goddamn night
  why would you get set off my a courtney love story
if you were drowning michael i would leave you to die gods honest truth
  she was staying with someone and in an effort to cleanse the air a lot of drama had been going on she brought out the heart shaped box set an candle in it and put one of kurts old shirts under the table it was on then she prayed with the group for things to get better    when i read that story i realized that i actually envied kurt kobain a little bit for having even a little bit of crazy as fuck happiness with courtney and because he didnt have to deal with this fucked up world anymore
  who is this for
  the rule is if you want to know you provide your initial
  we know its you toby
  i do love you but you dont deserve my love
literally just stood someone up im an awful person   this is why ill never have someone all the women i want dont care and the women i dont care about want me
one of the best friends ive ever had ended a 4 year long relationship to confess her feelings for me feelings shed had the entire time but simply couldnt push from her mind any longer my selfesteem is so abysmal that i couldnt even bring myself to kiss her i rejected her through my actions i simply couldnt believe someone could like me like that im too fucking ugly to be loved like that and most embarrassingly of all it took a shitty line from a shitty comic book movie about how ugly people being loved know theyre truly loved for who they are for me to realise how she felt truly about me and how poorly i treated her    i dont think theres anything left to salvage not even a friendship anymore and this is just another in the long list if reasons i have for hating every fibre of my being
she attempted suicide last night a couple hours before that we were sitting together casually and watching tv i now know that she wrote her suicide note before doing that    knowing she spent that time with me fully planning that shed be dead by the next time i saw her  i feel betrayed and angry i know those arent helpful feelings for me to have but i just dont know how to face her like this
whenever i have to go on to my old college campus for any reason i always like the students better than anyone ive met in the working professional world     it just makes me wish i could have a job where my co workers have a student personality instead of being obese and depressed people with broken dreams
max  it would be swell to know why you wont talk with my anymore
  dude what do you mean theres nothing left to salvage was this recent talk to her about it and explain yourself even if nothing comes from it you wont be thinking about it for the rest of your life goddamn it man realize that people make mistakes and youre not perfect
  oh shut up anon go bother someone else that statement is a contradiction in itself you dont know what love is
  oh shut up anon you can love someone and be betrayed by them leaving them undeserving of your love
  it was back in march i havent seen her since the very start of july she got back with the guy she broke up with to ask me out no point in putting myself back into that mess frankly better for everyone involved to just pretend we never met
  stop being a damn pest here youre a jerk to whoever you love
  and shes a jerk to me too were perfect for each other
i dont even know most celebrities as i dont pay attention to things like that i find it so weird though that people find it shocking that someone got fat and got wrinkles when they got older whats wrong with people
  okay anon lets talk it out what did she do to you
isnt it blowjob time yet    is it blowjob time yet
  this shit is so fucking frustrating but i guess thats the point    for two years now you guys have been saying its all a lie youve been living a lie none of it is real     but no one will tell me whats going on do you fucking cunts have any idea how terrible that is its torture they are just legit torturing me i haven no fucking idea why    even my mom was like youre just going to have to find out what is real and what isnt and that was two fucking years ago    fucking why why are you cunts dragging this out for so fucking long what excuse are you going to use why are you fucking doing this shit to me fucking why you are causing irreperable damage to my psyche ill never trust anyone ever fucking again    you guys had an opportunity to turn this around to show me some mercy and be like see someone is looking out for you but no instead you decided to double down on the torture and fuck me even harder
   lets talk it out  id rather not i only would with her
  you are right it is better to leave it like that if thats the case but hey no need to hate yourself over this there was no guarantee that it would have worked out if you cant get it out of your mind and feel its getting in the way of your life you could send a message explaining what happened then but acknowledging that its over and to wish her a happy life with that other guy thats what i would do for closure but i dont know if its the best idea
gee golly i cant wait to go to bed and get a bunch of bullshit messages that dont fucking mean anything
  na its not worth the effort id rather suffer with a lack of closure than potentially cause issues for someone else ill just fade away quietly like i normally do she wont notice and she wont miss me
  try not to suffer though shit happens learn to forgive yourself i will say though that its not impossible to be mature about things and be friends in the future when things have moved on let bygones be bygones

i hate being the only responsible sibling in my family my brother is a selfish lazy piece of shit who would rather spend 100 on his bullshit health powder than help my elderly parents pay for the food they buy him he promised to redo their kitchen but has left it undone for months because he found a new slut to screw around with im going to end up like that one sibling who will take care of his/her parents on their death beds while their sibling doesnt do shit and comes to take their parents stuff when they die i hate this i hate this this is not the life i wanted fuck family

  im sorry anon thats a lot to go through you need to find a way to get out of that living situation your disability makes it extremely difficult though do you have a back issue thats causing your disability
after having no luck for the 27 years of my life 3 women have started to show interest but all at the same time and im terrified i dont know what to do    1 a chick that asked my friend to give me her number and has been actively texting me for three weeks    2 a chick who has openly asked if i wanted to date her i said i wasnt ready at the time and she recently got a boyfriend who looks a lot like me down to having a similar job she told me she accidentally calls him by my name and so the boyfriend hates me    3 runner chick im running a half marathon with who has jokingly asked me to wife her up several times now personally my favorite of the three but one more intrenched in my friend group and i dont want to fuck that up
  runner chick im running a half marathon with   but one more intrenched in my friend group and i dont want to fuck that up  who has jokingly asked me to wife her up several times now  i dont think you need to worry about fucking things up
i met an actual reallife crazy person today she was my barber today she kept talking about how she could tell that i was stressed which i am but thats not really as big of a deal as she was making it ive recently gone back to a job that i essentially ragequit and that i had to practically beg for ive very recently lost a close relative im on the cusp of failing out of engineering school and i have a lot of sexual hangups and trust issues due to really bizarre things that happened to me in my childhood am i stressed geez thank you dr phil for your incredible profound take on my existence she even brought up that she could tell that im on drugs somehow because of my hair side note someone who works with or has an extensive knowledge of hair and scalp is that even possible can you really tell that i smoke weed on weekends with friends i used to experiment with a lot of different things but that was a few years ago now     the entire experience was sort of surreal as it was happening in retrospect it was kind of humiliating when she asserted that she could tell that i was on drugs again im not on hard drugs i smoke weed maybe two nights out of the week at most and even if i did use what the fuck makes her think thats an okay thing to just be blurting out in a busy barbershop    and then she got into some crazy racial shit and started going on about how crazy and racist america has only just become in the last two years it was fucking bizarre and scary and i just wanted to get the fuck out of there     the shitcovered cherry on top is that she totally ignored what i told her to do with my hair and now it looks like total shit and im probably going to just have to buzz it and start over    fuck
    im really sorry youre dealing with all of that thats really rough your life matters to me too take care out there
why would i stick around what have you offered me you get all the the fucking glory what do i get you fucking prick did that ever cross your mind whats in it for me not a thing answer this honestly would you stick around and get abused for nothing you asshole narcissist
i really fucking hate how you think youre some fucking prize to endure abuse for
i wonder how many other women youve strung along with the hope to be with you fuck you you arent even great you stupid asshole just die you wasted my time my life die
i shouldve put you to death in a past life
            possibly relevant
  disintegration is the best album of all time
  its not all the same people
  what did he do how did he string you along
this feels like a big f you to me and i feel like i deserve it but i dont know why
i want to have sex in a fursuit gender doesnt matter for some odd reason    my fursuit would probably be a skunk because im a shy little cunt     im a sick fuck
  ah i see youve met my ex
dare i entertain the thought of falling in love again    i feel like i have just one relationship left in me
i took the wisc test as a kid my scores were never shared with me until now and apparently while im pretty average in spatial and processing i am at genius level in verbal comprehension and fluid reasoning    what sort of careers is that good for ive always been very good at languages but i find the idea of just being an interpreter kind of unappealing
  wait how did you figure out the score they never told me mine
  my dad told me he didnt remember the exact numbers but i trust him not to lie to me to make me feel good  he said he didnt want to share the scores with me until i was older because he was worried id get too arrogant and not put any effort into learning
maybe a philology
  oh shit that makes sense my mom only told me i was mildly autistic but never the score might ask her what was my score i am 21 now
  you might have aboveaverage levels in verbal communication but you should take the genius tag with a grain of salt tests in childhood dont necessary apply to adulthood because a child might have a faster development than other children but as soon as growth ends they might level out those tests can be skewed
  thats fair and i might take another test again
  i took it when i was 16 there was a face puzzle with 5 pieces and i had to puzzle it and i couldnt do it man that was cringe as fuck
  those tests mean absolutely nothing i guarantee you are not at a genius level in comprehension and reasoning so please dont try use that to build your future on its as useless as an iq test  success is based on what you achieve not what people tell you youre capable of do a career you want to do and do the best you can at it
i feel so ugly and i dont know what to do about it i feel like im wasting my youth absolutely dreading confronting myself in a photograph it sounds petty i know but why does seeing a candid photo of myself absolutely ruin my day i just want to know how to go to bed without feeling absolutely worthless
i have acne so i never take selfies
  try fixing your diet and visit a dermatologist  worked for me
  how old are you this is something a lot of people go through at some point in their lives if youre still young 18 then theres a good chance you will grow out of this thinking if youre older then its a different story and the behaviour might be wellingrained in your thinking
  dont tell me to fix my diet i already visited a dermatologist they said to drink water and get sleep i dont eat fat foods
        im 21 i workout very regularly so my body isnt an issue i dont think im super hot but i dont hate it im comfortable in it its just my face why does seeing someone more attractive the me absolutely destroy my self esteem
i sleep naked next to my own clothes and sometimes coins fall out of my pockets    sometimes they stick to the under side of my balls the sweat on my taint and when i shower in the morning sometimes pennies quarters and nickels peel off of my butt cheeks or as far as the inside of my anus    im actually really worried about coins becoming foreign objects stuck in my anus and i dont want to get surgery to have ass pennies removed from my rectum    what are some good ways to prevent ass pennies while i can still enjoy sleeping in my birthday suit
  stick a liberal arts degree between your cheeks
put a magnet up youre ass
  put your change in a piggy bank
just have a laundry basket and put your clothes in there instead
have someone fuck you in the ass so they wont be able to get out again
  how much do you weigh
  dont sleep on your clothes have them on a chair the floor or in the laundry
    sounds like a good idea        i go wildly between 170 and 190 lbs from month to month
so ive been wondering if my living room looked stupid with all the vintage posters only the movies are vintage not monroe on the walls i collect them and sort my friends collection of them 50000 fucking movie posters no joke  the posters mean a lot to me but i will remove them if it looks stupid i am an adult and i dont want to come off as a manbaby    pic related
  this pic is from behind the tv i used to have a crt but my roomate fucking bought the stupid flatscreen he isnt even living here hes in fucking south korea right now
i think yes as a woman and im also a collector of things you should pick out a single really artistic movie poster and center it a really artistic one like the poster from belladonna of sadness or something and then frame it and center it although how you have it now displays passion you can convey something similar with maybe more rare posters just two or so framed and then showing her your full put away collection
  it strikes me that youre just really into films    if it makes you happy keep em if youre feeling embarrassed about them tear them down
    your shit looks cluttered more than anything honestly    who gives a fuck what youre into butyour presentation of it is pretty lacking    or basically what  said now that i read it
  posters are fine but a frame them and b dont have so many of them    also table and armchair in front of the fireplace thats weird
  this is a good idea it is too chaotic with all of them
looks comfy but like others have said it is a bit too unorganised/random
i think you need to be more discerning do you really need tom cruise and fast and furious posters right in your living room thats pretty lowbrow and tasteless honestly
  yes that looks like a manbaby cave    im not saying that you are one but it doesnt look like the room of an adult
  i know other people have said this but yeah choose 23 of your favorite posters and get them framed main thing though is the room looks way too cluttered and cramped
  im of the opinion that all movies have some value i wont go into specifics but all movies you see have something special to offer and are worth a look i really like movies so im looking for reasons to not take them down but i think when girls come over some see it as immature i actuall help my friend sort and sell them at his warehouse pretty much everyday
  i dont like it i prefer an ascetic style no adv here just an opinion clean walls little stuff in general
frame the ones you like   hang one  swap it out monthly    its what i do really makes it feel special also helps you keep organized with all your shit because its a clear reminder you got stuff to do
  a lil bit
mostly i think it just looks messy and randomly placed i agree with the above posters on only having a few displayed and framed you can rotate them out whenever you want right
  yeah i think ill take down a few its just that i really like most of them and i did pay a good bit of money for some of them the cocktail is an original italian movie poster its my favorite after the comando which is an original german movie poster
looks comfy op in fact the walls are the best part its the couches and centerpieces that dont match either clean up or replace the couches modernize it the walls are retro and i like them dont listen to any women in this thread because they dont fucking know what they like
yes it looks stupid it looks seriously embarrassing do you even read pynchon you faggot no you dont
the furniture needs fixing dont worry about posters
  you have 50k posters and your pick to put on the wall was three billboards meme and furious murica assasin and vanilla sky    cmon bruh
  most of them i get for free american assassin is just a solid action flick thats why i like it its kinda like the 2010s equivalent to the action flicks of the 80s three bilboards isnt really my favorite mcdonagh film fav director but in bruges and se en psychopaths is really hard to find i like the image on inherent vice and tokyo drift is the last fast and furious that was about street racing the fast  furious franchise is kind of a guilty pleaaure for me vanilla sky is an amazing movie imo but i can understand how some dont like it    pic is only the rolled movie posters they stopped folding them in the 80s there is just so many to sort i havent picked too many out yet
  all the furniture i got off the side of the road not in a financial situation to buy furniture
agree with the too many posters sentiment  its so dark too get bigger better lights  or better yet use natural lights if theres a window nearby
that room looks like 8 kinds of dogshit
  everything that everyone does is stupid who cares your living room is fine it does not matter
  live in a bad part of an already bad city blinds will always be down because i dont want the homeless to see my tv already had to beat one off my porch with a baseball bat i just have a shitload of candles in there and the table lamp for light i wanna get some vintage lamps
  looks comfy
you have good taste in movies but it screams i take bong rips and sit on this couch all weekend i guess it just depends what vibe you want to give off but if youre past your early 20s it looks pretty childish
   i just have a shitload of candles in there and the table lamp for light  insane vampire behavior
  so ive been wondering if my living room looked stupid with all the vintage posters  yes it makes you look like youre living in some kind of college flophouse get some proper furniture mount your tv on the wall and try to make your space inviting right now your space screams im terribly unorganized
  dude fast and the furious is not a vintage film take that shit down man
   if you hadnt mentioned that it was your living room i would have assumed this was the bedroom of a man between the ages of 18 and 22 you do have really good taste in films you were watching logan right good movie but youve gone overboard take all but two down and put those remaining two in frames on different walls get rid of the cameron diaz cut out that is just tacky the mismatched furniture isnt that big a deal just make sure you keep it all free of crumbs and general clutter but get yourself some proper shelves for the tv speakers and other loose possessions keep the clutter out of site if you can
i dont see how its stupid if you like them then why would you take them down
  it is about 15 years old now so id call that vintage i think a better word for me to use is original rather than vintage
is that a big bottle of jarritos
  haha  perception check passed    thats exactly how i feel it looks like my bedroom or at least its flipped no joke i only have a bed in my bedroom and nothing on the walls      yeah i got my apt more like a house but very tiny at the start of winter so ive got the seasonal depression thing going on i just watch movies about 10 or so movies a week and smoke bud when im there im 19 but i dont want to look like a manbaby      yeah the tamarind flavor is my favorite
also your apartment is super cozy but i would really free space up
  yeah i like the cozy/comfy if i take the posters down it will just be white walls i think i should get a shitload of plants put up shelves
  because presentation is everything i would write that down if i were you
  what you have looks like my sisters room and shes a single soon2b catlady
  vanilla sky is an amazing movie imo    the tamarind flavor is my favorite  absolutely disgusting  cameron crowe is complete trash  take the ptr posters off your walls
  currently just looks messy can tell that you really like movies and that you just dont know how to show your passion i would recommend framing every poster you put on the wall    look through google images / pinterest or some shit to find inspiration on how to display a movie poster collection
  is she cute
guys how the fuck to i explain that i have food poisoning to my boss at work im rather new here and ive already called in because of really bad weather should i just go in and just deal i dont know
  man i called in and i legitimately gagged over the phone and my manager just said ok feel better in her usual happy tone i think i accidentally made it sound over the top
you have autism
or am i just imagining things since im autistic    so basically there is this one qt at school we know eachother for a year or so since we go to the same class but we never really talked before two days ago i had small talk with her and her friend male about some random shit and since that day she always wants to be near me     today when i was about to leave school i had an idea to check if she really likes me i wanted to give a fistbump to her friend and see what she would do so i gave her friend a fistbump and before we finished she actually asked for a fistbump but i opted for a hug instead and she didnt seem bothered     now this by itself wouldnt need to mean that she likes me but i met her in front of the school and walked with her to the bus stop when i was about to leave she automatically gave me a hug
you have to be 18
give it a try ask her man
  its another episode of a girl does something completely innocent but thirsty anon misinterprets it gravely  shes been your friend for a year so hugs arent anything special
shes probably just being nice if she wants to hang out with you after school then yeah she likes you but other than that shes just being a decent human girls do this to me but you have to be able to tell between genuine interest and just fun/kindness
  lmao this
ask her or fuck off retard also come back when youre 18
try cumming on her face and seeing if she enjoys it
ive run out of happy memories i recently discovered today that my mood depends what im thinking about as long as im associating the happy memory with the action im doing i should remain motivated however i have very few happy memories what other emotions should i call upon to get me through my day is it bad that i dont have enough happy memories to keep me going it keeps on cycling back to sadness and boredom feeling thoughts and i get stuck in my bed all day songs sometime help but i eventually get bored even on repeat     is this what i deserve for not going out much as a child boredom that begot boredom how cruel
unrelated but im also the op i feel associating images with words also helps me understand things better obviously thats basic connections and thinking but the idea of associating hasnt struck me this hard    i feel like my mind is blank when i listen to people is this why i have trouble remembering and visualizing things because im not actively connecting the stimuli i hear with tangible memories
my mom used to be piece of shit she is ok now my dad dont give a shit about me my grandparents are fucking evil and i barely got family but why i used to keep myself happy and motivate me is think of future stuff rather than memories or present stuff
   hmm i will try this ive recently discovered a theory that emotions are your brain making connections with the feelings going on with your body so memories being connected to specific body feelings are emotions    admittedly i cannot define my emotions very well happy just feels generally happy but extremely vague i can define fear anger and boredom extremely well and there various levels but not so much happiness or even sadness     im going to try to think of the future understand concepts and understand myself
  what memories are making you sad or apathetic is the more pertinent question if youre not clinically depressed which you dont seem to be given the description then it means something you remember is making you feel this way    you might not even be aware of it but it could be an entire system of memories based on a single part of yourself
  i dont think i am clinically depressed however could these system of sad memories or lack of memories thereof be causing symptoms of clinical depression in the past 5 months ive just lost pleasure in doing anything i liked in the past it takes an insane amount of energy to motivate myself to do something greater for the day
so i am about to get a job at ski resort as a waiter in utah in alta and thats gonna be my first experience as a seasonal employee i am not from united states originally and i got a little antisocial here due to living in la i think it could be a good way to get out my anxiety and get new friends but i am not sure do any of you have an experience to work like that and can i quit a seasonal job before the end of the season
ive wanted to kill people since i was 14 and other stuff youngeri have mood swingspersonality shiftsand sometimes sudden dark thoughts but not like other people looking for attention like i want to kill someone with my hands and feel the life leave their body and i feel like thats what i was meant to do one of my biggest passions i have yet untapped potential ive put off some wantsemotions and desires but only the strongest never left and this one of them 
the top was supposed to say true self
  uhhhh im not gonna fuck with this one
  if being yourself requires you to hurt people you better keep on repressing it see a therapist
okay chief
so you think you have talent and untapped potential in killing people do me a favor and put yourself in a psychiatric hospital
either join the army and get shot by someone with the same desires or seek immediate help
how do i stop feeling guilty all the time for no reason every time i spend money make a decision or even lie in bed relaxing i get nagging thoughts telling me im a bad person most people i know dont seem to question themselves but i always picture the worst case scenario
how do i get a job with terrible grades im currently studying electrical engineering
fun fact mcdonalds rejected my application
i have always treated girls normally  except when i was younger where i love to do stuff that makes them unhappy  not bullying i promise   now i am having this feeling towards certain girls  like friends  and even strangers i just want to get close to them and it makes my heart race fastttttt the feeling being with them is so wierd but at the same time it makes me happy too sometimes i cant stop thinking of the person and thought i was being a wierdo whats going on this is my first thread and first time using 4chan too xd
  haha xd
    hahaha xd    kys
if a girl comes into my workplace every weekend and smiles waves and says hi to me does this mean anything or is she just being nice  i dont want to get my hopes up over nothing
she is just being nice       if she starts talking to you and being friendly then she is interested
  alright i guess ill try to start a conversation next saturday and see how she responds
pic is related and the black marks are for privacy    im a model and i went did a shoot with the photographer very professional and it was a great day my partner accompanied me as he does always supportive and sometimes he might take a selfie of us or just a pic of me for bts  im pretty social on social media and i go ahead and post a couple of bts pic and i get pic related message to me    i cant help but upset about this  my partner says to not worry about it and that its an ego thing with some photographers but i cant help but get upset over this   i should have asked for permission but im not sure how to go about it    am i overthinking this is my partner right    /adv/ please
  what the fuck are you talking about
  this what the fuck are you talking about op are you schizophrenic
what is bts
  behind the scenes    hes basically mad at her for posting behind the scenes shots of the photography shoot without his permission
  a perfectly reasonable request by the photographer expressed politely and professionally    any photo taken on his set could be mistaken for one of his and he has a professional reputation to protect your partners snapshot might look like substandard work by the pro
  no /      so i sent him an apology he hasnt replied     again im probs overthinking it but seems pretty angry from that message right
  he doesnt seem angry at all and i dont blame him for pointing this out to you
    the photographer has a right to be a cocky fag so let him if his message upsets or offends you then move on to someone else    what you owe it to him because he is butt hurt you didnt ask for his permission if its a moment for you and your partner then fuck what he thinks you two do you    he prob jerking off to your pictures overthink that    fuck i should be a photographer
nothing to be upset about he can as a photographer say and feel like he did but as your boyfriend says you can just ignore it since it doesnt really matter
      im just trying to create a good relationship with photographers so we could do future shoots i just felt that this shoot in particular went to well that i may have ruined the relationship with this photographer with posting bts pictures
you are over thinking and you were wrong    a photographers product is a picture if someone can pull a picture off the internet your social media and use it for free there is no reason to pay the photographer or you     there are lots of places you shouldnt take pictures something in the background might be private     respond with an apology and never do it again if you want to post a social media pic for marketing get permission and take a picture of you ankle with a bit of the pant leg dont give away the product you or someone else is trying to sell
what does it mean when a guy tells you i think you like me and you have such a crush on me
  why do ads always tell you that you dont have time for something why do makeup ads tell you that youre beautiful its marketing homo
he likes you and hes trying to hit on you this is a pretty basic pickup technique the goal is to flip the script so it seems like youre the one pursuing him instead of the typical guy chases girl its like the first lesson in game its basic shit and if done properly it can be highly effective
well if he finds you stalk him in real life it would make sense if he wondered how you felt
i mean like a model or a celebrity someone famous you lust after  if so how did you go about doing it
  im not attracted to models and celebrities and dont fantasize about them so no
  i fucked joe rogan backstage at a motley crew concert
  meet woman hit it off with woman make love to woman    the first step is the hardest part
  did you at least smack his bald ass head
  jamie pull that up
  he wasnt completely bald back then but lemme tell you joe has a huge cock
  thats because you know you could never get them
i have a fetish about chubby and poor girls  oddly enough my gf is both   easy enough for me to fuck her or beat the entrecotê when shes not around
  i fucked a submissive cute anime looking girl which was kinda my fetish thigh high socks shirt skirt and everything super submissive but she was toxic as fuck
  sure you did
    i cant do x therefore nobody else can
  had two girls i would say were the dream girl by looks for me one had borderline syndrom needed to call the ambulance 5 times and switching emotions like every 3 minutes the other was just a shithead thinking i was some kind of dog for her    dont go for perfect looks you wont be happy with them
  found the beta
  i fucked a girl who was minne mouse at disney land
so i kind of created this meme about something very traumatizing in life and for the past few years ive posted it nonstop on /b/ ive trolled people ive destroyed threads and very recently its got a huge support and cult following off of 4chan starting to bleed into youtube and facebook  its great that it caught fire but now i just want to move on with my life    the issue is i cant like its grown onto me as my drug that im addicted to i cant stand a day without posting it on 4chan even though a thread 404s i just repost it and repost it and repost it    how do i stop
  you have to eat the logs
  touch a tit
  its not even a good meme you ahould feel ashamed
my friend actually brought up andy six log of shit irl once
easy  you tell everyone it was a lie this way you wont be able to do it anymore since everyone will know youre full of shit
  pun intended
good evening anonymous   its sunday night again having a problem with sex and relationships job sucking the life out of you substance abuse issues maybe youd just like to rant maybe youd just like to stop by and say hello you can do all of that here
  hello mantis  i want to get a girlfriend but i dont know where to start i know the best way to do it is to expand my friend circle but im introverted and i dont think that path is right for me i might end up with an extrovert and im 99 sure it wouldnt go well any advice
evening mantis ah i have been trying to motivate myself recently to be less of a recluse i have a hard time talking even though i want to i was just wondering if you had any advice on this issue thank you for another thread i hope you are having a good day today
  i recommend learning how to talk to people in general practice starting up a conversation use a subject youre familiar with my subject is baseball i can talk to anyone about that    for you the subject matter isnt important just something you are interested in and can talk about
hey anon from last week with the ex who avoids me why do you think she has a personality issue can you explain it
  hi  like i said here   when striking up a conversation stick to topics you know about that will keep your comfort level high enough also stay away from controversial issues religion and politics are to be avoided
  hello and welcome   is this about the girl who avoids eye contact and only speaks to you in a whisper
  thanks for taking the time to reply     i have the talking part down but my subjects are usually math anime and other nerd stuff or video games theres not a lot of people who like to hear about those even then i feel like i dont know enough about them to have them be my subjects     say i practice and become proficient at talking and maybe the subject thing if im lucky what would you suggest doing next
  yeah thanks for remembering could you explain why do you think she has a personality issue and what is it called
  next thing would be to take inventory of how you present yourself i know you do this already but make sure you take a shower every day use deodorant put on clean clothes in addition to making yourself more presentable youll feel good too and that translates to a high level of comfiness and that is what you want
  youre welcome   now i dont remember every detail of what we discussed but this eye contact and whispering thing stood out to me it appears as though something is going on with her below the surface i dont know her so i dont see any of the nonverbal cues she gives off but thats how i drew my conclusion
i need some advice how do i deal with roll being a lil bitch
  hm i get what you mean i have a hard time initiating these kinds of things it gets tiring for me ah im just overthinking things again i let my anxiety take control some times i just need to keep at it really its hard being patient but ill get there
  what do you mean something is going on with her below the surface i dont understand how she was normal a week before the breakup but then became very cold and distant to the point she avoids me like the plague its been 4 months and she still acts like this why does she act like this
  and i have no doubt you will succeed   just move at your own pace dont try to rush yourself enjoy the journey
  okay that sounds reasonable     i wish i could bother you a little more for this but i think ill make another thread for the rest but before i go do you have advice on this      i might end up with an extrovert and im 99 sure it wouldnt go well    part specifically the standard advice seems geared towards getting a specific kind of girl at least thats how i see it
   does she act like this    that there is the million dollar question i dont know i dont know whats going on in her head
  you know how they say opposites attract it might work that way for you you never know i know couples who are like this and they are just fine together dont write someone off just because they are extroverted they just might be the perfect match for you
    i wont honestly im just going off of experiences with extroverted people i know male and female thanks for the advice mantis
  that true what do i do we sit next to each other and she avoids looking and talking to me there is only 2 weeks left until the semester ends
  ah ill try not to thank you mantis i hope you have a good night tonight
  little steps dont expect to be an extrovert if youre not just try something small like asking someone how their week was once in a while its a slow build    i suggest using jam i know a lot of people are fond of butter on bread rolls but i really think a fruit spread can elevate them
   avoids looking and talking to me     i suggest you give her some space
  so i shouldnt talk or look at her unless she does right how do i give her space if we sit next to each other in class
  by not approaching her dont try to talk to her just leave her be if she wants to talk to you at some point she will innate this
  initiate     fucking autocorrect
  ah it is most definitely a slow build i need that reminder from time to time thank you
  so i just sit in my chair and mind my own business its going to be hard since we sit next to each other but ill do it i want the semester to be over so we can have real space and see what comes from that
  i agree she might be waiting for that too  
  also i wanted to ask what should i do when i see her talk to a guy shes been talking to before class i try my best to ignore them and mind my own business
  i feel insecure in all my endeavors like i dont know enough about anything other than reactionary political philosophy to hold a conversation and nobody wants to listen to me go on about why my antisemitism is a rational response to jewish political activism  i feel like i cant get into anything like i cant get good at anything i try watching movies or tv shows and just get bored and give up 10 minutes in ive been playing guitar for 15 years and still cant play a single song all the way through i got higurashi on halloween and havent even finished the onikakushi
   try my best to ignore them and mind my own business    this  i think deep down inside you already knew this and its true she can speak to whoever she wants to leave it alone
  do you like sports thats a thing people like to talk about
  i have feelings for one of my best friends who says she doesnt reciprocate which is fine however she likes to tease me sexuallyreferencing me sexually jerking off objects in my room while staring at me  normally id disappear for a bit while the feelings subside but i cant manage it as she is also best friends with my roommate i have to see her every day  id like to tell her to stop but i enjoy until she leaves into which i sink a deep depression i cant fathom why someone would tease someone like that unless they actually want me to make a move  any advice
  ve been playing guitar for 15 years and still cant play a single song all the way through    do you allow yourself time to practice what happens when you try to play a song
  girls enjoy attention thats old news but that looks like the situation here she has your attention and your sexual interest and she appears to enjoy it immensely if you politely and respectfully tell her to stop she probably will
  communicate tell her that it feels awkward given the situation between you two itll be even more awkward for a while but hopefully it will even out in the end
  im doing my best to move on now i wanted to know was deleting her off social media a good idea she deleted me from snapchat and instagram but kept me in facebook i deleted her so i dont i have to see her but didnt block her did this ruin our chances of ever getting back together sorry for asking too much
    well i wouldve hoped she would know better if she didnt want anything to happen but those are reasonable answers thanks
  youre not asking too much not at all  deleting her off social media is a good thing its all about giving her space at this point
  taking time away is one of the best ways to heal ripping the bandaid off in one go and deleting her was healthy
    thanks for all the help its calms me down well ill just mind my own business until the semester is over and give her real space if she wants to rekindle things she should still have my number and email i deleted all her info so i can never have the urge to call her i guess i should start dating again to see there are other options
i hit it off with a co worker a few weeks ago ive been here 5 years and shes been here 2 we work in diff departments on different floors our jobs in no way shape or form line up other than of course working for the same company after laughing at all of my jokes and twirling her hair whenever we were chatting at lunch and giving off what i assumed was genuine interest i decided to ask for her number and she happily scribbled a number out and handed it over we chatted for a few days via text and it went well so i asked her if she wanted to go out after work the following night and get drinks she said she was busy and politely declined i said no problem and said some other time its been about a week now and she hasnt asked about grabbing drinks or food or anything with me she asked me a few times what i was up to i tried saying out watching the game at a bar by myself i tried saying i wasnt doing anything i even said i had nothing planned but i was itching for something but she just laughs and tells me what shes doing i dont want to come off as overbearing or desperate but i dont want to do the should i shouldnt i dance should i ask her if she wants to go out again if so should i instead just tell her id like to take her out sometime but ask which day is best for her or should i just let it go and just be friends unless she brings it up were not kids either were both in our early 30s
  youre welcome   and yes you are free to date other girls and you should have fun with that
    hello ive got a friend i have a close relationship with when my dog died she was the only person who reached out to make sure i was okay and that meant a lot to me because things were pretty dark back then theres quite a few turnoffs about her for me so im never going to pursue her but i thought she was a good friend and i really dont think i can repay how she helped me back then unfortunately some drama happened between me and one of her close friends like the contact me again and im calling the police kind my friend had a small role to play in that and now whenever i end up hanging out with her which is much more infrequent postclusterfuck which is understandable on her end all i want to do is cut ties with her because im reminded of that gigantic shitstorm however with what she did for me before i still feel like thats not enough of a reason to end the friendship  that sort of clusterfuck is kinda par for the course with that part of my social circle and if she ended up in a bad spot or needed my help i want to be able to lend her a hand if she needed it how can i reconcile this i dont even know if she wants to be friends anymore
  dont be afraid to take some time for yourself as well its not something people are fond of admitting but being alone and working on some selfreflection and selfimprovement is a good way to build some of your confidence back up  just my opinion though by all means get back out there as soon as you feel comfortable    nothing wrong with being the first person to talk ask if she wants to grab lunch or something
   i ask her if she wants to go out again    yes  she will do everything and anything but ask you out directly thats your job
  who is this girl you keep posting shes a qt
  good evening    how can you seem less cocky/needy to people like the genuine person im trying to be
am i spending too much money on my new gf  i just like her a lot and every time i see something fun i dont think about the money and instead think of how happy she would be if we do this together  she says she likes me a lot often i feel like i do this because i am a bit insecure idk   she just texted me telling me she just made a reservation for a dinner for us so i think either she feels bad maybe she felt pressured or maybe she is just that nice    i spent around 600 this month but this is our first month together is this normal
  firstly im sorry about your doggo this is devastating for most people im glad you had this friend to help you through it    with this issue this clusterfuck as you call it i recommend the utmost caution you dont have to give me details but you also dont need trouble with the law if this girl no longer wants to be friends with you let it go at that
i dont know how to handle my sex drive my body wants sex and a womans touch but im so far behind on the learning curve i cant do much about it what do you think i should do
  having a quiet easy self confidence is irresistible to most people but dont confuse confidence with arrogance
    i have been working on myself these past 4 months ive been going to the gym making a few friends and watching corey wayne and reading his book ive realised i messed up when i became clingy needy and complacent at the end of the relationship i over pursued her when she got distant and some what begged a month after the break up
  well what do you mean by a quiet easy self confidence what are somethings i can do to put this into practice in my life    desperately need this
  how much do you take home in a month what are your expenses
  fapping on the regular will help you with your sex drive     m so far behind on the learning curve i cant do much about it what do you think i should do    explain this pls
  both of us are currently students i did have an internship last summer i was making 87k a year i saved some money she works full time while studying making around 56k a year    i dont have that much of expenses since i still live with my parents i only pay for gas/insurance/phone bill around 300/mo im moving out in couple of month
  i forgot to mention that i will start working full time in couple of month making 100k/year im moving out because it is in a different state and it will be a ldr thats why im spending money as well so she remembers these moments
  i mean being comfortable in your own skin i mean not wallowing in self pity i mean playing it cool
  fapping on the regular will help you with your sex drive  what
  they mean jerk off so you dont think too much about sex
  then i guess 600 on the first month of dating isnt going to get you into financial trouble but if you think its too much then scale back this month and let her pay once in a while
  oh
  that makes a lot of sense i guess really not caring as much and focusing on being my self    in regards to conversations with people how could i put this into action thanks again
  when she offers to get the tab i just refuse i just feel it is wrong for me to let the girl pay
  sure  are you prone to anxiety stay away from caffeine and chocolate remember to take a deep breath or two while talking to someone that will help you stay relaxed start with this and see if you notice results
what the fuck do i talk to women about  like how do i show a girl im worth talking to and honestly im fine with having really personal deep conversations its just getting to that point which im having issues with like how long can you go on having meaningless convo till you want to talk about something real with someone
  hm i dont have issues in that sense when talking to people im very sociable can connect well with people etc im asking what i should do to avoid being accidentally cocky or whatever it may be when conversing with others
how do i get over my fear of the opposite sex   realize women are also people doesnt seem to be working i keep getting scared of being accused of being a creep and i feel like im being judged constantly when i talk to them i can talk to other dudes just fine but girls legitimately scare me
    on the mess yeah thats in the past now weve blocked each other and thats about as good an outcome as can be     with my friend yeah i noticed things were dialing back and ive done the same in turn if she doesnt like me anymore then that sucks but fine but she still tries to sometimes invite me out and do things so i dunno
  the weather sports food
is watching corey wayne good for learning relationship skills i hear that he gives great advice while others says its bullshit and hes a conman
  girls do not bite unless you politely ask them to
so whenever i become friends with someone im really happy and excited to get to know them im always in the mood to make friends and shit but theres this little voice in the back of my head that pops out and fucks everything up by making me believe small shit they do means they dont like me its usually ignorable but it balls up until something actually happens and it results in me pushing people away or overreacting its gotten to the point where im nervous to make friends now im scared that one day they wont like   this is especially a problem now because ive found a mentor that i really like who seems to genuinely care for me but i keep finding myself worried that somethings going to happen i know im being paranoid what do i do
  i know but i cant believe it if that makes any sense i forget stuff like that as soon as i approach one and i dont know how to fix that
  it hasnt my hormones will not shut up    my first time was something other people might call female on male rape my mom was dependant on me emotionally more than a teenager should probably have to handle
be me work for gov for years advance to trusted position discover horrible things so evil i cant imagine its reality things i was not supposed to know they thought i was stupid turns out i was the best realizing the evil was too deeply rooted i go dark and drop out i quit  wife mysteriously murdered shortly there after  spend next decade collecting evidence raising children staying hidden years later my torch is picked by others and carried further then i ever dreamed soon their may be fruit a light at the end of the tunnel my long nightmare ended try to explain to children who are now adults what is happening they think im crazy im trying to protect them and they are blind all my relatives save two act like the aliens in that movie where all the people are replaced by pods they repeat things they hear on the news unquestioningly they sound like crazy people mob mentality prevails in their train of thought independent thought seems to be beyond themthey are smarter then their brother who quit his good gov job for no apparent reason they never liked my wife anyway their callous disregard for my marriage burns in my heart nearly as much as the pain of losing her i have to be careful what i say they are always triggered ive been fighting this battle alone for so long now alone in the shadows always moving forward  inch by inch closer and closer alone  soon soon i tell myself  check the beretta lay down and close one eye  dont try to find me im behind 9 boxes
  also everytime i approach a girl i feel like people would laugh if they saw me for thinking i had a chance at her
  you have to get rid of that thought you have just as much chance as the next guy to be with whatever girl youre talking to
  im not sure whats going on here but you are welcome to speak your mind
  hey there mantis i hope youre doing well because i aint feelin so hot as of the current moment i wanna blame finals getting me down but as i think about it more this is something thats been in the back of my head     see ive been working on myself for the past couple of years and its come to a point where im living as positively as a broke college student can be everyday i try just to be a bit different and try to make life more interesting and fun for myself and everyone around me     now the big problem is that i sweep my actual problems under the proverbial rug the one that sticks out the most is my crippling loneliness i have female friends and i always try to be positive/funny around women but holy shit am i starved of romantic contact i figured my love life would start at some point by itself but it just hasnt happened for me i want to take the initiative but when ive tried it either goes nowhere i think im just really bad at romance or i just havent found someone with legitimate romantic interest in me yet whats a guy to do here
op here  its zero dark thirty here in op city   time to get some rest  i recommend we all get snuggly and get some good sleeps   if the thread is still up tomorrow ill be there  if not ill see you all next sunday   goodnight anonymous wherever you are
    please
  wow you caught me in the nick of time i was just getting ready to log out  if you havent found a girl you are interested in i suggest putting yourself in places where girls congregate such as the local laundromat for starters
  so your first sexual experience was with your mother if this is so than there are issues here that require more than a 4chan thread to resolve   i would start with an experienced professional therapist someone who is trained in how to work through this
  no no nothing that extreme but it was not something i wanted
there is a lady who comes into where i work a few days a week who i would like to talk with and get to know a little better but she always comes in when its busy and i never get the chance
  then just smile and say hello start with that    how badly does it affect you do you think therapy would help you
  talk to girl ive known for years  left overseas to help with humanitarian aid  had a romance sent her sweet things to let her know my affection she was interested  get back seems like nothings there  i stopped talking to her and moved on  she starts trying to communicate with me again after 3 months  play the idk who this is card  starts talking and wanting to hang out  she flakes on everything we plan and i start to ignore her again  weeks later happens again i give her short talk because im tired of the games and slowly im just not caring/ losing interest    whys this happen anon and why do girls do this
  i doesnt help for sure but i think the learning curve is the bigger issue
  i am quite sure that its the attention she thrives on when it comes time to actually do something irl she bails after a brief cooling off period the cycle repeats  and that is how its going to go with this one  best to move on
  i still say a therapist is your best bet    ok i really need to go to bed  goodnight anonymous ill either see you tomorrow or next sunday
  i moved on to another girl but whats crazy is that now that i just give her short talk and not talk to her she tries her hardest to help me out before applying to a couple phd programs she offered to help look over my personal statement etc i sent her my drafts not expecting her to help and submitted my application days prior she had revisions done three days before which was a shock because she never comes through i kind of told her i submitted my applications already was honest about her not coming through and just ignored her again she messages me telling me if i need anything with school shell help me out and that she wanted to go camping i planned it and she bailed but i went with the girl ive been seeing instead so it worked out regardless she before would never look at any messages i had or my snaps social media but now she always looks at my snaps and messages me shes cute dont get me wrong but i just feel like shes socially akward
  ive been with my girlfriend for 5 years and it seems like the connection we used to have is fading so far it feels like we are just roomates living with each other yet will still cook clean do few intimate things sex every two weeks sometimes is this what love leads to or is this just a dying relationship
  then just smile and say hello     i do but unfortunately that is all i have time for
can i get an answer to 
im a currycel and a mentalcel life was over for me before it even began
    i looked him up now because i had no idea who he is so take what im about to say with a grain of salt he seems like the kind of guy who gives somewhat useful fairly generic advice which might be useful on a subject like business but relationships are something that are heavily focused on your personality so having someone who doesnt even know you give you advice on that is kind of you know all they can say is a bunch of cliches that may or may not apply to you    you want to get better at relationships whatever that means have more relationships and put some thought and effort into understanding how people work generally a decent psychologist can teach you how to improve your relationships much better than all these self improvement gurus you see on youtube and whatnot
  a laundromat my first thoughts would be a bookstore or cafe lol so im guessing youd want me to be in a place where women congregate strike up conversation and go from there right
  thats make sense he  explains personalities that could kill your relationship such as being clingy needy and a bad communicator all of this lined up to what i did in my past relationship could you give advice on how to fix these issues
  
  hello again op i dont have much of a social life since i moved to a new college i have friends from my old school but its a relatively small group and we dont see each other so much because theyre quite busy with exams plus i live in a different town which doesnt help  similarly ive made new friends at college but theres a small age difference me being 18 and most of them being 1617 and were not all that close plus many of them live even further afield and commute to college by train every day    i used to be a massive basementdweller and as long as i had vidya i didnt care all that much about the rest of my life but the novelty wore off and i spent the last year getting fit and working on my appearance and confidence all of that doesnt change the fact that im autistic and am pretty clueless when it comes to normal social human things i live in a shitty rural english village outside the town where i go to college and where most of my old friends live theres nothing at all in the village and very few people my age in the town there is more obviously but i dont know exactly what there is to do over there outside of college food and shops  i want to find something to do with my time other than vidya and work and id really like to find a gf can you offer some advice
so my gf had a fucking go at me for following a couple girls from work on my insta i havent really wven looked at thier pages let alone liked any of the photos and one does have a lingerie pick which my gf picked out your friends with that  while she has guys dming her what ever and jas guy mates she goes onto and likes thier photos thinks im emotionally cheating fuck i hate girls with insecurities    fuck this mood im in      i do everthing i can for this chick and im fucking stung because of a couple girls at work i have no fucking interest in     i guess that what happens when you date a model fuck sake
  hope you figure that out man im sure itll clear up when youve both had a chance to calm down over it  chin up son
i dont know what i want out of life the only thing i miss i guess is a serious relationship which im working on recently had my first date ever for example other than that i dont want to suffer unnecessarily of course so i need an income and thus an education and shit like that  but i just get this is this all life has to offer feeling things are working fine for me but theres nothing to give it positive meaning theres just a lack of suffering
    i havent seen a girl i was in love with for just over 6 years she has had boyfriends and most likely moved on i havent stopped thinking about her since the day we stopped talking    it seems obsessive and unhealthy to think that i could still love this girl but when i admitted to her that i loved her i also made the decision that i didnt want anything or anyone else only her of course she doesnt know that i made that decision i never told her because i knew things would develop further i was afraid of the relationship becoming physical and real in a sense i was terrified that i was wrong about her and that she wouldnt want someone like me so i gradually ignored her requests to see her to go to her birthday parties to go out to dates etc she finally admitted to me that she never engaged fully with the relationship because she thought her family would ruin it as they were dysfunctional something i completely related with as my family was completely fucked from the start    when she told me why she didnt engage fully i pulled away even quicker i was terrified from the day i met her i didnt want anyone else i never looked at another girl sexually never missed another girl i didnt even like to be around other girls because i was so committed to just this one amazing girl im a virgin still at mid 20s because i would rather die alone than be with anyone else i digress i reeled back out of fear that she wouldnt accept that i had no experience or that i was so deeply devoted to her i was afraid she might laugh at me or use it against me like my family did with the love i gave them     this girl was an angel she had problems real fucked up problems yet when i was going through adoption and abuse and missing school and drugs she was the only thing i looked forward to in my day she never failed to make me happy and i tried to do the same for her but i was a fucking coward and now its all gone down the drain cont
    im going to contact her i have to i cant keep waking up not knowing what relief i could have just getting this off my chest and letting her know that it wasnt her fault i was a coward     i need help with how im thinking to message her on the zucc app very close to christmas day and pass it off casually like i was just reading old messages and thought i would reply she messaged me last and i ignored with good christmas wishes and a small apology about how i ignored her last message i think this would be the safest option to begin with and if we start talking again i could direct the conversation toward our history and get everything out of my system once i know its safe to reveal myself i also think that i should just message her near christmas with a full blown love story speech like some sort of period drama but this will obviously be too strong i want it to go well    if it doesnt go well it will be my final act on this planet i have decided if i cant mend things or even be friends anymore i cant live with such a huge chunk of myself missing so im going to go to the train station a mile from my home and jump onto the tracks     i know its melodramatic and sounds ridiculous to an outsider but to me its my entire life    i need some help guys please i dont want to die but i dont want to live without closure or resolution
  wow you described me perfectly i actually did make her my everything had some trust issues and was scared to communicate my feelings she was also a bad communicator got passive aggressive and always told me its fine currently im making the gym my goal trying to make friends and reading how to be more confident i got another question how do you deal when your girlfriend becomes distant and cold thanks for all the help
why does everything have to be so hard ive tried every approach there is to get a girl to date me hot  cold assertive  submissive longwinded  straight to the point and every single time ive failed at this point the only thing i havent done is outright ask for nudes and send dick pics
after a month of the breakupf of my first boyfriend i just realized that hes been using me for sex and to be more calm     when i wanted to cuddle with him/seek physical contact while on couch or bed he always took it as foreplay even tho i said to him that im not in the mood for sex he then turned completely away from me and ignored me i told him multiple times that i feel like hes using me as a sex doll but he denied it and didnt change a thing about his behaviour i was naive it hurt me so bad that eventually after some months of this behaviour i started to have sex with him even tho i didnt want to just to get the love afterwards and be able to cuddle with him while hes happy cuddling me back i was completely blind because i loved him so much i did everything i could just to make him happy and eventually lost myself along the way   it feels like some sort of rape to me but i cant describe what way    this went on for more than a year and ive gotten so numb to any emotion that im not sure if i should go see a therapist
  theres not much you can do in that situation other than sit her down and talk to her about it to try to figure out why shes being distant its another one of those issues where first step is identifying the underlying problem and frankly theres not always something that can be done on your end in these scenario takes two to tango and all that she needs to want to be with you and work on that relationship before anything else if anything in that scenario what you need to focus on is making the other person understand how important honest communication is      therapy or at least talking to a psychologist can always helpcan always make you understand yourself and the people around you better and guide you in taking good decisions in life     i dont want to diminish your lived experience but you shouldnt see yourself as a victim even if a case can be made for that its not a healthy mentality you chose having sex with him because you wanted his company or affection or whatnot im not saying you chose well or that his behavior wasnt hurting you but at the end of the day you shouldnt blame him for your choices even if he pressured you a little bit into them you still had some control in that situation    it sounds to me like the 2 of you just didnt fit well together and wanted different things from a relationship take it as a life lesson be upfront about the things you want and dont want from your partners and say no if you have to        
  its not necessarily a dying relationship this could be just a slow period for example its winter here in op city peoples activities in general start to slow down with the cold weather and the shortening of days
  hello and welcome  can you describe what you mean
  so the best thing is to communicate to her my feelings and make her open up if she doesnt i should distance myself and not try to over pursue her
  that is correct  i mention the laundromat because people dont think of it right away as a place for meeting people but the casual informal atmosphere of it can be ideal
  i will certainly try  lets start by taking a look at your college most colleges have activities going on all the time there are concerts special lectures and presentations you could attend there are probably off campus hangouts too a local coffee shop or diner is a good place to meet people  i will mention the campus library too because everyone uses that
  so the best thing is to communicate to her my feelings and make her open up  yeah pretty much thats the first step at least    if she doesnt i should distance myself and not try to over pursue her  i cant really give a general answer to this question it would depend on a lot of things and would require a good understand of a real situation not just a hypothetical issue what i can tell you is that you cant have a pleasant relationship where someone is cold and distant and doesnt want to talk about it so that needs to change one way or another or the relationship will either not last or make both of you miserable
  s just a lack of suffering    be grateful for that but seriously we all get bored once in a while this too shall pass i once got this piece of advice that i still use get a sheet of paper and make a list of all the things you are grateful for you might be surprised at how this changes how you look at things
  i become frustrated and discouraged when i get cant get a handle on a difficult part feel disappointed in myself and eventually burn out and my fingers wont move as i will them
    youre right i feel like an absolute idiot now ive never spoke about this girl in such depth before and you simplified it so clearly thanks man    i think i might just let her be and if i somehow bump into her by chance it will be an opportunity youre right i cant focus everything on this one thing in life no matter how much i want it to be some sort of romantic movie    youve probably answered questions that seem stupid to you so often youre sick of it by now so i apologise for making you read that wall of text    this morning i was convinced i was going to kill myself within the month now i go to sleep with a clear head    thank you
i have no idea what im doing im really infatuated with this girl but she has a boyfriend but her boyfriend literally raped several people in his past and shes aware of that fact are they both crazy and i should just steer clear how do i get her out of my mind why would she stay with him knowing that she otherwise has a very strong and sensible moral compass im so confused
  its fine man feefees can put you in a pretty dumb and irrational state of mind ive been there know how it feels so i dont judge people for or get annoyed by it no need to apologize im happy i could help to some extent
   would she stay with him knowing that     maybe she stays with him because of that hybristophilia is a real thing for a better understanding of it look up pic related
  okay communicating to her asking why shes distant and try to open her up is the best solution my ex never opened up she always told me shes fine and had no problems later broke up with me a month later telling me she lost feelings for a month thanks for the help
  you have the talent to play any piece of music when you start to get frustrated stop take a deep breath and tell yourself i can do this
i dont know what im doing desu im enrolled in a stater college right now but im feeling underwhelmed or overwhelmed or both or neither i dont even know why im going to college right now i dont know what i want to do as a career and i dont even know what i want to major in i dont even know what i would be doing if i wasnt in college all i know is that i feel apathetic about the situation even though the outcome will affect the rest of my fucking life i dont like going to class and in fact today was the first time in two weeks that ive even been to class i dont even know why i didnt go i didnt even fucking do anything i just payed down on my bed and took at least three showers a day to pass the time and when my parents came home and asked me how school went i said it was going ok the worst part is that everyone i know has asked me what i wanted to major in and i just tell them i dont know and they always respond along the lines of well college should help you find that out thats like telling me that im an adult now and that i should get in my car and drive   bbut where would i even go  just start driving youll figure it out  well guys im about about 30 credit hours in and i still dont fucking know metaphorically im pulled over asking for directions on the side of the road after following the comp sci kids for a while the only subject that has truly ever interested me was history but how am i going to support myself as a museum curator as a fucking teacher i really dont know all i do know is that im miserable or just not as interested as i should be and that i am completely disinterested in the classes that im taking i discussed taking a semester off last summer with my parents but they told me that as long as im full time enrolled in school im considered to be a dependent of my parents so my family has a financial incentive for keeping me in school
  it says stater college but its really state
no matter how many people tell me its okay and that i can find love at my height no matter how many times i post over and over again i never learn or at least i never seem o believe them what is wrong with me i dont enjoy being miserable and hopeless but i always go back to that mindset
  hello  ok lets look at a few things there are some careers that are rewarding and satisfying that dont require a college degree plumbers electricians and carpenters to name a few require no college you will need to go to trade school but thats completely different than college  firemen and police officers require a specific training period that each department provides in all these cases you will make a good living you will have benefits and a pension
  i take it that you are under 6 feet tall  i know there are plenty of petite girls for whom this is not a problem the issue is that you have to find one of them and when you do its gonna be great for now you have to accept yourself exactly as you are and keep moving forward
  i take it you are under 6 ft  no shit sherlock 51 to be exact so im on par with or below where most women are really so statistically maybe 2 of the female population at least from that point of view the chances dont look so great
   chances dont look so great    the chances arent so great of anyone finding true love everlasting yet we keep going
  unfortunately its not a university like that its a small british technical college ive tried looking but it doesnt seem theres any extracurricular activities going on at least at the moment  theres a library split across two floors quite small everyone seems busy studying so idk how id start talking to anyone but i guess its something
  i am grateful but the boredom will pass youre right but so will the lack of suffering things will get worse and worse loved ones will die my health will decline all kinds of things may happen but on the other side of the balance there is not really anything life will get harder but what will make it worthwhile    i feel like you need a strong will a motivation the desire for something something to strive towards and i just dont seem to have enough of this to occupy me    and lastly i feel like im wasting valuable time here i am young in good health with plenty of time just wasting it waiting for the time to come where i wont have the time anymore to bitch about how i dont know what to do with my life until i enter my final sleep
   we all get bored once in a while  its been like this for years though life feels more like constant boredom with something exciting a few times a year or sometimes a few weeks where youre seriously busy but most of the time its boredom you get out of bed eat breakfast are bored on the way to school/work then sit through your boring class/job until you can get home and be bored behind your pc or tv and go to bed and then something bad happens and youre not bored but shits fucked up and then things get normal again and there we go with the boredom once more day in day out bored with everything
well there is a girl and i feel she want something with me but im not sure about dating her because we talk a lot and she tell me almost all her problems and i feel she isnt okay to date for me never have a gf before but i dont know if i take the risk and date her or not because sometimes i feel she isnt my type or try to be the kind of girl i would date and sorry if i sound like i have highly standars i mean she body is okay but is more about her personaly than i feel something wrong
ive become very lazy and disorganized over the past couple years i want to get back on track with my life and all i want to be uptight the problem is is that im a huge extrovert i want to watch what i say and become more coordinated and for lack of a better example i want to become like thrawn or tarkin i just act on impulse and do autistic shit and say stupid things everyone views me as the smart idiot i act smart and do well on my homework yet im too lazy to do most homework     i like being lazy but intelligent yet that isnt a type thats cut out for schools ive looked at my grades and the majority of the reason theyre not straight as or bs is that i have missing assignments    any advice
one more thing i do plan to go into the rotc if thats relevant to this
what this isnt a girlfriend problem  dunno what to tell you    except maybe start small small efforts every day adds up
  ive considered that the moment i get home i should begin homework i also have considered doing those missing assignments for even just a little bit of a boost in my grade i dont use my planner and i might begin using it anything else thats small
smile all the time girls love when guys smile    be mysterious and quiet girls love that its a sign of intelligence     which one /adv/
whichever comes more naturally
have tattoos and smoke  guaranteed pussy
  t retard
  2nd to me but i yet have for find a girl so its clearly not working
  being a retard helps as well  basically be a shit fucking human being and you will get laid with the hottest girls
  you clearly dont understand women
  dont try to be someone youre not just keep talking to girls and maybe one will click with you youd probably enjoy her company more if she likes the real you because then you dont have to pretend
  t incel
  then this isnt the problem its something else
    nah dude its true
  neither does chad but look whos getting love letters in prison
  just keep talking to girls and maybe one will click with you  im 18 can i speed up the process i feel like my chances are becoming smaller and smaller
  you dum dums call everything incel without thinking about it lots of these redpills are true
  nah i just fuck ugly girls because i dont drink or smoke
  do you have a brain tumor or something
  18 is so young you have lots of time theres no way around the talking part even if you use a dating app youll still have to talk to the girls it takes time and no one can tell you how much but if youre making active efforts then your chances only increase
  whichever of the two youll be doing that will be the wrong thing to do
  this    being mysterious and quiet doesnt mean never ever initiating and expecting a girl to fall in love with your coolness it means that you dont reveal much when communicating while giving off an aura that says youre worth something  both cases need something to back it up something to makre you valuable the former leans towards extroversion so its usually talking well/making yourself approachable while the latter is obviously closer to introversion so it has to be backed up by actions or strong meaningful words
  im having normal conversations daily i just fail at noticing is someone likes me and advancing the relationship
  mysterious quiet and smile if she smiles to you its not rocket science  also smile doesnt mean you have to look like an idiot just give them some smile thats it dont go over the top with friendliness they can sense that you are starving
  i like how youve put it
  mysterious quiet and smile if she smiles to you  is it creepy if i give a smile first when our eyes meet even by coincidence
good picture op
be rich above all women desire money everything else is just a bonus
  i failed at that one when randomizing my character
when you realize women are a meme they want you more
  not giving a shit what gurks or anyone at all likes
  dont worry as long as you make 3k a month you still have a chance at financially supporting singlemom stacy and her racemixed son kanye
girls love both turns out the human brain is incredibly complex and can like more than one thing
  you cant do both at the same time its unnatural
both and neither  girls have preferences some would get wet over a ryan gosling in drive type of guy and other would like someone whos more outgoing friendly and charismatic and of course many other types  dont actively try to be one or the other because both work with the assumption you are generally attractive  a person whos awkward trying to smile would come off as autistic or even creepy and an awkward person trying to be cool and mysterious is just the quite kid at the back of the class i was there and i know most of you faggots were too  girls like guys like people who are attractive everything else is just flavor  how to be attractive is a different discussion all together if we focus on behavior and less about presentation all girls love confidence regardless of if youre cool and quiet or a charismatic extrovert  dont confuse confidence with behaving like so called pick up artists confidence is a much more general thing girls like decisiveness strength not necessarily the physical kind but the not being a doormat kind and confidence    bottom line is the things in the op are the wrong things to worry about different girls prefer different things just like you or me and if youre an attractive man a girl that likes your specific flavor will come around  and also know that attractiveness is a lot less difficult to attain than you might think you might not be a manly adonis overnight but the difference between ugly okay and my weird crush is entirely presentation basically decent hygiene cloths that are not utter shit walking upright and looking straight ahead and confidence as i described above  instead of trying out attractive characters strive to be the best version of yourself
  exquisite taste anon
  goes you better do one or the other as well as you can then you fucking autist
  wow that answer is too detailed for this shitpost of a thread   thank you much
  /thread
  its not about smiling you need to look pleasant like youre doing good just make sure you dont look like a retard
  you can be cool and nice
  i was talking more about making smiling your rest face and just smiling everywhere
i had a similar thread op heres an anon told me and it seems pretty good    take note of a few of you favorite anime characters male and female   for male write / think down their traits and try copying them  for female try making an ideal version of a girl merging every trait you like from each one and think about what type of guy that girl would like  imitate it dont overdo it tho
  this might be a little weird but i subconsiously study charles mansons facial expressions and mimic those a lot of times i find myself making a face charlie made not that im a huge charles manson fan but just because i find him really charming and like his attitude women tell me a lot that they love talking to me im a bit of a social recluse but i have a charm about me i smile a lot because i personally like my smile i think that something women do like in me is the fact even though i do smile there is more to me than just a nice friendly guy like your average joe i can hold a deeper conversation while still keeping a smile on my face and i like that about myself
  another person i find myself making the same faces as is jimi hendrix look at a few pictures of jimi hendrix and notice how cool he looks op     this post is autistic as fuck but i hope it gives at least a lil insight
    op here what a coincidence you and  posted literally in the same minute with basically the same thing he said anime characters you real people but its the same technique ill look into it
  check this face out and try it out if you like it its endearing in my opinion you basically show your top teeth without smiling tilt your head back and keep your chin up its a smug face think about your favorite smug anime girl reaction pictures and keep your chin up having a carefree look in your eyes is very attractive having your face like this also makes transitioning to a full smile pretty easy
  they like the 2nd option if youre handsome and the 1st one if youre handsome or have a genuine character
      be mysterious and quiet girls love that its a sign of intelligence   why are you so quiet  ohanon ew  have nothing to actually say outside of 10 specific topics  how to fix
  what if im not handsome      im in the same boat anon
ive been single for 2 years and i wanna finally put myself out there again so how do i get a boyfriend
  
  are you male female are you fat
  hobbies classes church you name it
  i fucking hate this bullshit advice none of those three will ever work for you if youre a robot   my hobbies dont involve other people my classes have no women i go to mass but nobody cares for the stranger there quit your bullshit man
  dude just get a hobby
a few years ago i moved to a city where most of the people there were white upper class people the majority of the people who went to my school had light hair and colored eyes i basically stood out like a sore thumb because i was one of the only people with black hair and brown eyes for all of high school every time i liked a guy i had to wonder if he even liked brunettes i even had friends who openly stated that they would only ever consider dating blondes is it normal for guys to be this uptight about someones hair/eye color or is it just with the people that i know do normal guys even care about hair color
  what super nazi city do you live in i feel like this is b8
i dont care too much about hair colour unless it stands out like redheads strawberry blonds or really jet black in which case its kinda neat same goes for eye color obviously dyed is a bit unattractive though oh and i should point out that in general i have a bit of a preference for lighter skinned girls so that might be part of it
  op honestly its not a nazy city it just so happens that most of the people who live there have light hair and eyes and a few of the guys that i know always talk about how much they prefer blondes over brunettes
  i do and dont give a shit all at once i absolutely love redheads and i heavily prefer blondes im super attracted to blue eyes but am i going to ignore a pretty brunette girl because she doesnt have that no of course not    ill admit i get frustrated with it though i really want to date a blue eyed blonde or redhead and have never pulled it off id even accept it all being fake but its almost like a fetish for me
   it is a fact that people tend to prefer those who look like them i have dark hair and eyes i really do prefer men with dark hair and eyes too meanwhile my fairer friends prefer blondes and blue or green eyed partners     however this is not an absolute by any means again an anecdote but i have a blonde male friend and yet he prefers black women and when he dates white women they tend to have dark hair    either way its not that big of an issue either find a guy that looks more similar to you or just continue searching also i noticed ultimately the more attractive you are the less any of that matters for men
  eye colour doesnt bother me green eyes are a bonus but not a turn on and other eye colours are just neutral and not a turn off or anything still buttmad 25 years later that i didnt inherit green eyes from my dad     hair is a little different i find it rare to be attracted to blondes because my sister is a blonde love me a brunette of all shades and a redhead as long as shes a hot red head and not a weird ugly one also watched too much anime and love coloured hair in most colours
  i even had friends who openly stated that they would only ever consider dating blondes  based  t not blonde
i personally prefer brunettes to blondes and always have    i am dark skinned though and always had the same problem with my complexion one eighth native american
  hey op here thanks for the response strangely enough of the very few dark haired men i meet they rarely ever seen to be interested in me almost every single guy ive ever been withbesides my first bf has had blonde hair and blue eyes
  blonde hair  nazi     found the moronic feminist
do normal guys even care about hair color  they tend to have a preference but ive never seen anyone outright dismiss being with someone because of the color of their hair or eyes
literally irrelevant youll know youve met someone for you when you meet and look in each others eyes everything else is just decoration
  im a guy and ive never heard any of my friends express a preference for any hair/eye color chest and hip size are more important
recently ive found myself stressing about this guy i really like its weird because ive been interested in guys before but this one is different i have zero appetite and have started to lose weight i literally feel sick i want to make a move and tell him that i like him or just simply ask for his number but my anxiety is holding me back i was going to give him a note today with my phone number but i completely froze in the moment as he walked out of class our class together ends in a month and im stressed as hell why cant i be like a normal person and simply ask him to do something together why am i being held back by my emotions it probably sounds childish but please give my shy self some advice or confidence
  you have friends dont you get one of your friends to slap him upside the head and tell him to ask her out you pussy
you have 2 options   a dont talk to him and nothing happens   b talk to him and something or nothing happens   i mean thats really all there is to it you might as well try even if it doesnt work youll get practice and be less nervous the next time theres someone youre interested in
  shy femanon here  two labels  but my anxiety is holding me back  you mean youre too anxious you choose to label yourself than take responsibility  why cant i be like a normal person   also a label  why am i being held back by my emotions  you mean why are you holding yourself back more like why arent you responsible for your own emotions  it probably sounds childish  another label  but please give my shy self some advice or confidence  shy self  another label  also advice is given but confidence is not you have to be responsible for your own feeling of confidence     anyway youre like what a salad of labels is there a human even underneath all of those labels you throw around     your problem is solved with a just do it but thats not good enough for a dumb female like you else you would already have first maybe work on your sense of emotional accountability and stop labeling everything labels can be a way to escape responsibility
  label label babble babble  nice literal label trip coding faggot
you already know what to do its only five seconds of bravery
  you missed the point and missed that it was great advice
  put your trip back on loser
how do i get a doctor/medical professional to take me seriously    im 90 sure i have developed some sort of eating disorder that stems from body dysmorphia or more specifically my obsession with gaining muscle and avoiding fat    i have this weird thing where i never feel hungry and if i go long enough without eating lets say a day then i notice my body is extremely fatigued so i start to force myself to eat despite how repulsive food seems to me as soon as i start eating it becomes a chore and i have to do my best to not throw up      before this i had a very unhealthy obsession with hitting my macros for gaining lean muscle mass after the gym i would go straight to my apartment down a protein shake then make a bland meal like chicken and rice hoping to gain muscle and no fat i would force myself to eat past when im full and did this everyday for about 2 and a half years throughout those years i noticed my appetite started to gradually go away and i desired food less and less      today i was throwing up stomach acid because i was trying to force myself to eat after eating only a snack for 2 days now im sipping on a smoothie but i have a huge headache from not eating and if i try to eat i start throwing up      my body weight is 150 pounds and im 56 so i dont think doctors want to diagnose me with any eating disorder when im pretty sure there is at least something wrong because no normal person feels repulsed by food 24/7
bulimia
  your condition is called ortorexia and although not in the dsm you might want to ask your doc to be referred to a shrink
  ortorexia  excessive preoccupation with eating healthy food  may paradoxically lead to unhealthy consequences such as social isolation anxiety loss of ability to eat in a natural intuitive manner reduced interest in the full range of other healthy human activities and in rare cases severe malnutrition or even death    not op but thank you
ive heard of no fap but is it worthwhile learning to fap over pictures rather than video porn
  worthwhile nah cunt if you want something worthwhile to do then read a book
  well can you get an erection just by looking at pictures without jerking it
  not really i usually need at sex sounds i can list to gonewildaudios but i gotta at least have social media pics of coworkers and friends up
  is this a guy
is this a compliment    i never hear it from other men and it seems to normally be from girls who seem interested is it basically saying they find me attractive    i am 63 not tall enough for it to be weird
  wait are you a guy or gal
  im a guy
  its a compliment
  does this mean she finds me sexually attractive or is it a non sexual thing like youre so smart    sorry if this is autismo to ask im a absolute brainlet when it comes to these things
  generally compliments about your physical appearance mean that they find you attractive yes
  ttthanks
be me  be 18  7/10 not too bad very shy and half autist 62  stacy is 9/10  grade under me sometimes look at each other nothing special  if i would ask her at the bus stop like 20 dudes and grills would watch me get humiliated  have her snap but im to scared to write her smth  pic unrelated
  kek tito
how are you 6 to the power of two
  lower your standards and date another 7
fk tito faking comi
  fuck you fucking dipshit the years of titos rule over yugoslavia were the best years these people could ever imagine it will never be this good again
so theres this girl i knew nothing about until i gathered my power and asked her about some school stuff via social media im using school related stuff as an excuse to talk to her how do i subtly keep the conversation going  she asked me if i could remember some school stuff to tell her on this wednesday and thus giving me a chance to talk her again       and yes i did post this yesterday im extremely anxious and want as many answers as possible to be prepared this is the last time i promise
relax and text her on wednesday just tell her how the test went and what she can expect shes not going to be put off if you do this its just important that you relax so you dont act in a way thats unnatural
  im kinda surprised someone from the last thread came thank you   no thats what im going to do like she asked me to but i also want to continue the conversation and not just get a simple ok thanks
  no problem   you can ask a question like if shes nervous about the test if she likes the class what she thinks about the professor just one of course then guage her response and maybe it will keep going its okay if it doesnt since you can always talk to her in person or try again later
  im going to do just that i hope i can somehow turn it into talking/texting just because we like to and not because we need something from each other
  theres a post on r/niceguys where the girl shared the text history with a guy that tried to do this exact same shit to her starting with school stuff but then trying to move it in another direction i can guarantee you that you are 100 creeping her out and if you keep pushing you are going to be the next feature of a niceguys compilation
  so got much planned for the weekend  hey have you seen that new film  what do you have planned for christmas  has the internet caused this much social damage in a decade
  all of that amounts to harrassment in the current generation dont give advice if youve been out of the game for 10 years my boomer friend
  then what do you do youre just making another problem instead of helping with the existing one
  has the internet caused this much social damage in a decade  no my anxiousness has nothing to do with the internet opposite in fact if internet werent here i wouldnt have even gone this far
  what you do is not trick women be cool then make your intentions perfectly clear and then either fuck her or take the rejection like a man seriously why are you even lying to a girl you havent even fucked yet
  must be pretty cool to be as easy going as you are     seriously why are you even lying to a girl you havent even fucked yet  how is op lying exactly
  i dont see this as tricking / lying at all
  how is op lying exactly   im using school related stuff as an excuse to talk to her
i met a girl and we started going out in group and hanging out at my house with friends    during one of the first times upon meeting i briefly kissed her while dancing because she was looking at me like she wanted to be kissed    however at this point she had already kissed a friend of mine and had more of a thing going with him so i stepped back    over two months we got closer as friends and developed more of an affectionate relationship    she briefly went out with my friend but finally broke it off he went full beta about it at the time    the other day we went out to a club and while dancing and fucking around with other girls i tried to kiss her to which she recoiled and mumbled something about being friends i ignored her and i forgot about it the original fwb friend was there with us and and i heard from him afterwards she was apparently trying to get him back    so last week my other friend was crashing at my house and he brought her along    i made supper for us on monday and she was purposefully ignoring me eventhough she had been completely normal on group chat    i think at some point we were discussing something and i got mad at her for being a little brat and she tried to reconsile with me but the next day she kept on with the ignoring me tactic    she got rather cuddly with my other friend those days and i think she was trying to spite me    today its her birthday and a week has passed without me being active in group chat and i dont know how to approach this    shes also the kind of girl who never has money to do anything and relies on her friends/fwb to pay for stuff she also asked for a cake for today and i thought about bringing her a cheap bag muffin and a candle but idk    should i go and pretend nothing happened or ignore her does it seem desperate if i show up with the muffin should i not go at all    we have some legit affection for each other but id also like to bang her at least once to not feel like her beta orbiter
go without the muffins
well no muffins im off to the party now
this one bitch is heavy into me but i am not really into her she stalks up my instagram but never follows me i recently got a message from her apologizing for everything it sounded mature desu i didnt reply to signalize i got her message and i am not further interested to partizipate in the conversation but i let her know in my instagram story what kind of psycho she is just to make sure she really keeps away from me but surprisingly she didnt view the instagram story whats happening here
sounds like she felt bad and decided to stop checking up on you its over now you can both move on
  if everyone was a psychopath for social media stalking a billion people would be in straight jackets
  sounds like you got what you wanted so whats the problem do you secretly miss the attention
  how specifically is she stalking
    she used to view every single story of mine came up to me alot of times and tried to talk shit till one day i told her to fuck off basically then she sticked to it sent me a last message and apologizing in it since then it all stopped just curious why
  because she decided to move on you shouldnt have let her go if you like her
  i think its obvious
  instagram  well theres your problem social media is literally cancer
i want to confess to a girl    dont its emotionally immature and makes you seem possessive and dramatic
  bitter incel meta thread  wow we never see these theyre so uncommon surely nobodys ever made this exact identical contribution to the boards alreadyburgeoning roster of quality posts and threads
its emotionally immature  im 25 its on the fucking tin anyway  and makes you seem possessive and dramatic  im very fucking possessive cant leave my poor girl alone i want to cover her in scratches and bruises feel smug when shes walking around in turtlenecks trying to hide the gradeschool hickies and do that overprotective thing where you pull her close whenever you pass another dude in the street  whats wrong with that its fun
  sorry but this one things need to be said in its own thread cause we get like 15 threads a day that always start off with    i want to confess to a girl    people need to stop that they shouldnt even be thinking about it      you sound like a real nice guy not like all those other bad boys amiright
  but twenty thousand of you mouthbreathers with like a consummate twelve hours life experience with a girl are always clamouring to try and depose the man    maybe just maybe one day youll realize humans arent a hivemind and youre your own worst problem  im not holding out much hope though
  you sound like a real nice guy not like all those other bad boys amiright  no im just a dick head  id rather be honest about it than put on all these bullshit personas guys come up with they either try to play as suave pickup artists or hyper feminist baby im on your side types and its beyond obnoxious    i dont see anything wrong with just wearing what i want on my sleeve
  bad advice desu while i agree about the whole drama bit honesty is always the best policy     youll regret more not saying something like that than just saying it so do it get it out put it in the air but dont oppress the girl at the same time but dont hold in a emotion or feeling due to fear thats the nature of lying
you should be asking someone out not confessing confessing is something teenagers do you initiate an adult romantic relationship via asking someone out get that highschool mentality shit out of your head
  what are you even talking about why do you think im a confessor incel ive been with loads of women
whats the alternative
  well this is the best thing ive heard all day
  honesty is always the best policy    its not people who are always honest have no social filter because theyve got the autism and dont understand that you shouldnt be saying everything that crosses your mind at any time    i mean yes obviously you should tell a girls that you like her but a f t e r youve asked her out and gone out on a bunch of dates dont be running around telling bitches that youre secretly in love with them when they barely even know who you are      like this other anon said  and i said just ask them out
  asking her on a date whether or not you should use the word date varies by country
  you seem on top of it but being honest isnt the same as being a sperg with no filter
  being honest is good yes but going up to a girl and being all hi im in love with you i love you so much ive been in love with you since 6th grade is just about the same as i beat off to your facebook summer pictures and want to eat your asshole and have you drink my cum    both are very honest statements but certainly not things you should say before youve even gone on a single date
  hi im in love with you i love you so much ive been in love with you since 6th grade is just about the same as i beat off to your facebook summer pictures and want to eat your asshole and have you drink my cum  how badly did you get shot down to feel like it was that much of a faux pas
  i personally never said anything like that i was just using it as examples that are slightly exagerated for comedic effect    but i have seen threads that were pretty much like that first thing i wrote about obsessing over a girl since 6th grade and telling them about it
  no thats a false dichotomy honesty is always the best policy youre comparing that to a serg who puts his mind on loudspeaker come on    dont rationalize lying to people or yourself just because youre too much of a coward to say whats on your mind dont bring others down with you     yeah sometimes telling the truth will hurt thats the point at least youll always be honest and your peers can respect this virtue in you   people tell lies to avoid hurt its two vices in one dishonesty and cowardice your morals are so easily tempted away by a mere thought of someone might not like what you have to say     seriously thats why think about it
  honesty is always the best policy youre comparing that to a serg who puts his mind on loudspeaker come on    what exactly is the difference between being a l w a y s 100 honest and a sperg who puts his mind on a loudspeaker
  nothing   it can be abjectly hilarious though people take themselves way too seriously
  dude you can be honest with your feelings and still express them in a way that wont make women feel creeped out    besides can you honestly say youre in love with a woman you barely even know you need to hang out go on dates etc etc
  pretty much i mostly just flirt mercilessly even if shes got some qualities that im genuinely drawn to
  will you calm down no one here is not saying to express your feelings were saying that you shouldnt come up to someone who probably doesnt even know you and hit them with a brick wall of complex emotions then expect them to be ok with it    ask the person out and then see if you actually like them because your honest feelings might be based a whole lot more on your perceptions of a person than the reality of who they are
  i dont have enough data to refute you op
  i do     first off i am calm many people here seem to read my posts in an angry voice im working on making that impossible but still i come across as angry take it as firm     asking a girl out is not the same as confessing your feelings like what if you dont want to ask her out what if you only want her as a friend but you love her so just tell her if its a big confession with some dramatic story then so be it its honest and thats all the matters if it puts pressure on the girl somehow then thats totally fine women are adults too and they certainly dont need coddling they can handle it     what youre advocating for is lying by omission on the grounds of fear both vices cowardice and dishonesty     and the reason you press this on people is  what so the girl will like you more so shell be more likely to say yes when you ask her out or something  thats called being disingenuous its being fake being something youre not and doing it just because you want something egotism     but if youre honest even if that means a ugly confession then if she says yes then you know for sure she loves the true you what else could you possible want to trick her into saying yes would you really feel happy if she says yes to going out with your untrue self    i dont know how much clearer i can make it youre spreading vice and your advice is evil     relationships that are founded on weak grounds fall apart in due time so enjoy your breakup op
  i think youre just willing to tell yourself anything and specify anything to get away from having to admit that yes confessions will do fine    unless you hit that persons physical checklist in every way i think approaching someone who barely knows you with any intent but cordial introduction is going to backfire but then maybe you should specify dont confess to people who dont know you    but youre not really here for discussion and intelligent discourse as much as to wave an im right on 4chan flag about absofuckinglutely nothing arent you    what i really want more than anything is for the anticonfessors to tell me how many times theyve been shot down and how often its played into their negative view    ive managed a few confessions and two ended in sexual relationships one got some tongue action i think juuuuuust maybe mileage may vary  but i wouldnt dare suggest that that would be crazytalk
  wont make women feel creeped out  of course and thats actually done with honesty the emotion of creeped out is derived from ambiguity in speech or behavior when a guy says something that can mean two or more things  thats when it is creepy but if youre super honest to the point theres no ambiguity then theres no creep   of course you should express yourself as well you can youre promoting another false dichotomy here thing bigger anon     can you honestly say youre in love with a woman you barely even know  yes this has been proven throughout history   good example is steve jobs parents married in under 10 days together happily for life   arranged marriages are statistically happier and more stable than western marriages   and the phenomenon of love at first sight  you need to hang out go on dates etc etc  no you dont this is philosophy of despair if you want to live your life in despair then go for it but dont spread your hopeless fears onto others in an advice board you are quite literally spreading evil
  this has been proven throughout history  good example is steve jobs parents married in under 10 days together happily for life    is this your first day on this board look at all the i love his girl and im going to confess to her oh boy threads that of course end in a disaster      what if you only want her as a friend but you love her so just tell her     why though     youre spreading vice and your advice is evil     seems to me like youre the one whos got a chip on his shoulder and thinks that all of society is wrong because we sometimes have a social filter and take things one step at a time    confessions are for the confessional and police station not relationships
  having tact and articulating yourself well     the human experience for instance is so complicated its impossible to put into words     example i feel angry  now youve probably felt angry before but the rush of emotions hormones impulses senses etc make each experience unique and utterly impossible to articulate hence why we have similes metaphors symbolism and literacy elements to help us communicate     but in any case you must turn your human experience into words to the best of your ability everyone has a different capacity a 13 year old boy with autism might have a much harder time explaining his feeling of anger than a 55 year old famous poet of course     which is why confession is actually so important it also demonstrates your capacity as a person to articulate yourself but the answer to your question is as best you can     like if you are from a wellof and intelligent family you have good table manners if you choose to eat with your hands one day well thats bad stop doing that however a peasant villager who has literally known another way may not be able to have the best manners if he eats with his hands he still gets the job done but people still respect him for trying his best not a perfect example but you get it if you literally have autism then dont worry so much because your friends already know youre autistic its only embarrassing when you know better
  socially maladapted nerds turned milquetoast by the internets instant constant gratification cant seem to hack it in life generally because their level of effort is token at best  nobodys surprised its just when we say you gotta start at square one to get to square five bud they get their panties in a twist    the advice a lot of people need to hear is its your own goddamned fault and the sooner you just fucking swallow that pill the better  but thats not the way the internet raised us its all pointandclick total and instant results hiding behind anonymity and never being accounted to your own word see kids who yell racial obscenities online but can barely speak for themselves in person  the confession is not their problem the fact that they live in their heads thats the problem the fact that theyve taken even a single social cue off the modern internet thats the problem and i havent even covered what happens when they get their goddam echo chambers going    the internet flatly put has turned out to be a mistake most magnificent
  as awkward as you feel she will feel the same when you tell her dont
  look at all the  that of course end in a disaster  this is the part youre not getting     really think about it too because i can tell this is hard for you     its not about getting what you want humans are not a candy machine you put a coin in and a candy comes out girls may not like you so confess do your best and you very well may not be liked   and lets get real people who dont need help wont ask for it and especially not here your example is so thoughtless im appealing to you now to start thinking really start thinking    why though love a girl but keep her as friend  because maybe theres a reason you wont date her  there are many girls in my life whom i absolutely love and i wont date  i dont understand your question im really trying to but it sounds like you correlate dating and love as if its the same thing    chip on his shoulder  and so ive already told you im quite calm youve got to make a point to stop reading my posts in an angry voice im firm maybe but not angry im not going to repeat myself   thinks that all of society is wrong   again false dichotomy i never said that if you heard it you simply misunderstood me       dont speak the truth when the truth hurts a little   you can have the strongest muscles in the world but it means nothing unless you have bones
      jesus dude youre not listening to anything were trying to tell you     you can confess your feelings to someone just make sure it is at an appropriate time once some level of an emotional connection has been established otherwise the other person will not know how to react    anecdotal evidence of steve jobs parents marriage  are you retarded if there was a graphical distribution of all marriages of people who got hitched after 10 days what do you think it would look like    and really arranged marriages are happier you mean the ones in countries where trying to leave a shitty marriage is punishable by deathits easy to think your life is ok when you have never experienced a higher standard of how you should be treated    philosophy of despair  what school of thought are you even referencing my assertion was that you should know someone before you decide youre in love with them and activities with one another is a good way to know someone
  which is why confession is actually so important    if its so important then why do only desperate sociallymaladjusted frogposters from a vietnamese cooking bulletin board seem to think that its a good idea    im not even going to read that whole chapter your wrote about peasants eating a dinner table if you like a girl just ask her out god damn
  youve got to make a point to stop reading my posts in an angry voice    you come in this thread and call people evil because they say that you should ask girls out instead of being a sperg about it    youre at the very least extremely irritated or mildly upset
  im an oldfag and the first half of my life and most peoples lives my age was spent entirely offline and we still had unfortunate idiots who went just way too far when they liked a girl in high school and like worked parttime to buy them gold jewellery as a birthday present because they overheard that their birthday was later that year when they were talking with someone else and this girl barely even knows who this guy is that bought her a 200 necklace    now the tripfag is going to chime in and tell us all how this is actually solid advice and what everyone should be doing unless theyre cowards or whatever
  asking a girl out like a normal human being is another good way to articulate yourself
  girls may not like you so confess    no dont do that actually i dont know why youre arguing with 6 different people at once and calling us evil idiot cowards and whatever else because we said that its actually better to just be cool and ask them out to go see a movie instead of confessing like you ran over their cat
  i seriously think this guy might have autism or some level of social impairment     i mean jesus tapdancing christ he refuses to acknowledge how uncomfortable confessing is for the poor girl who has some zitfaced 16 yearold sperg walk up to them and say theyre the most beautiful person in the world its weird to be hit with that level of feeling
  if there was a graphical distribution of all marriages of people who got hitched after 10 days what do you think it would look like  there is its the societies where arranged is or was practices the success and happiness rates are higher than western marriages   i said this    just make sure it is at an appropriate time  yeah i said that too       seem to think that its a good idea  here is a bit of painful truth     most people who come to 4chan/adv especially the ones who struggle with girls are losers they suck with girls because theyre losers they dont want to be losers and i will help them as best i can but thats why they struggle with girls     you cant take a loser watch him confess to a girl then he comes home and overreacts on the advice board because he needs help the worst thing you can do is tell him his honest and bravery is the problem virtue is never a problem the girl rejects him because hes a loser and undesired by women you can help these guys by lifting them out of their miserable lives and start winning again then when they confess girls will like them and theyll never post here telling you about it     10 seconds of thought anon im going to keep appealing to you to think autonomously       if you like a girl just ask her out  as we discussed beforewhat if you dont want to date her  this is the same old lie but branded in a different bottle instead of keeping quiet you can ask her out thus avoiding telling her the truth of how you feel because youre a fearful coward       no not really i dont take it personally these are abstract ideas and afaik were discussing the best choice of advice      thats a false relation if you misunderstand me so drastically then im not sure you can be helped im just talking about honestly articulating your feelings       correct
  confessing like you ran over their cat  just be honest even if its a little weird it may hurt sometimes but being honest will always serve you in the longrun       refuses to acknowledge how uncomfortable  oh it can be very uncomfortable im sure i mentioned this in an earlier post but you may have missed it     oh yes telling the truth will hurt sometimes thats the point its better to be honest and hurt a little than to tell a lie in fearful anticipation or even worse  say nothing at all   fear is not an excuse to drown your virtues     the poor girl who has some zitfaced 16 yearold sperg walk up to them its weird to be hit with that level of feeling  women are adults and they can handle themselves you dont need to white knight nor coddle them getting hit on sometimes and occasionally by men you dont like is a normal part of being a woman and women know that   theyll be fine trust me 
    im just telling you guys to get your shit together if youre gonna assert the point put in the girls you dont know part first    like i get where you guys are coming from but maybe dont act like smug cunts when the delivery of the pretense was flawed the delivery was dont confess the problem is that that means dont confess when you barely know or understand the person receiving that confession  fuck man most of us would agree that you should be careful of doing just about anything to veritable strangers given the social climate of suspecting your neighbours know who your recipient is and try to have an idea of what your results could be before you go in guns blazing    like the second poster hits it with its nothing new and its rooted in deeper problems damning confessions overall because a you got shut down and b because people with social difficulties give it a bad name    you dig we dig we good youre not wrong you just gotta say what you mean from square one the first time  disclaimer dont give a fuck about the tripfag i aint got time to read his fukken walls of text i dont know if hes saying the same shit
  the girl rejects him because hes a loser and undesired by women    the girl rejects him because confessing is emotionally immature and completely selfish its a huge turnoff as well as a major red flag its not virtuous or brave its completely retarded
        heres some statistical evidence showing you how stupid you are notice how getting married right away leads to more divorce    maybe its because you shouldnt decide you love someone you just met
  i mean it could be but it doesnt have to be     im sure in your head right now youre envisioning some awful encounter but i can imagine many scenarios where its not selfish or bad     so i cant accept this line of thinking   and even if it was a bit selfish then thats ok we all are sometimes you adjust and move on maybe just say thanks for letting me get that out i feel better now if it was too selfish or something really not a big deal at all       heres some statistical evidence showing you how stupid you are  im flattered but i doubt whats behind that link has anything to do with me at all
  but being honest will always serve you in the longrun    no thats being an autistic retard and not understand social cues and context theres a time and a place for unfiltered honesty its not a l w a y s the best policy its certainly not the way to do thing when youre trying to get yourself a girlfriend for the first time
  i mean it could be but it doesnt have to be    its inherently selfish to walk up to a girl and be like hello there you barely know who i am these are my unfiltered feelings and i dont know what to do with them okay here you go youre in charge of all this now by the way if you reject me ill be really sad and probably say ill kill myself and cant live without you and its all your fault    thats what confessing to a girl is
  its certainly not the way to do thing when youre trying to get yourself a girlfriend for the first time  there you go again with this     really are you trying to trick a girl into saying yes are you so insecure that you must resist telling the trust just to feel like you have a shot at a girl       yeah it doesnt have to be like that just like my example of table manners were all at a different capacity     if youre a 55yearold poet then thats very bad yes     but if youre a 13yearold autistic kid then thats actually rather brave     but regardless you must think bigger thats not the only way of confessing yourself

      honesty is not the best policy if youre backing someone into an emotional corner the thing about regretting not confessing is that its completely based on your own needs and not the needs of the person youre confessing to dont spill your emotions onto people they dont like it confessing is essentially dumping this emotional burden onto them and then giving the responsibility of doing something with those emotions when they never asked to be in that position this anon  is right dont confess anything ask them out initiate a relationship nobody likes being put on the spot holding in emotions can be a positive thing if youre the kind of person whose kneejerk reaction is to make other people responsible for taking care of them
  but if youre a 13yearold autistic kid then thats actually rather brave    its not brave its selfish like someone else said its really backing them into an emotional corner with all of your own emotional baggage dumping all of you emotions on someone all at once is something that you do after weeks and months of being in a relationship  not something you do to a girl that you barely know and she barely knows you
  backing someone into an emotional corner  you mean making them feel a little uncomfortable    i think im going to stop here because its the same theme over and over now     you are really really afraid of doing something wrong really terrified of rejection really scared of making the girl feel uncomfortable     i get it really i do im 27 now but i remember what it was like being 17 i went through that phase    from this i learned that you dont need to be afraid i know its hard for you to understand because when you read my words it sounds like im asking you to stab yourself im not its actually bigger than this     the point i think youre missing here is its perfectly fine to make a girl feel uncomfortable by accident obviously its absolutely completely and utterly fine to make mistakes   dont respond with anger when you make mistakes respond with curiosity   dont feel bad when a girl rejects you respond like she just gave you wonderful advice   dont feel ashamed to speak your life wear your heart on your sleeve and be proud     not every girl will like you even me im very good with girls but my chance of rejection isnt 0 nobodys is its perfectly fine to get rejected it just means you havent found the right woman yet       confessing based on your own needs  since you lack the imagination ill help you     i confessed how i felt to a french girl i know whom i will never in a hundred years date but i really wanted her to know how i felt that she was more than a friend and something really special maybe it was in the air and it was obvious or maybe she was oblivious i couldnt tell so i took the question away and just let it out i didnt want anything didnt need help didnt want a date or anything at all to change really just told her how i felt she was surprised maybe a bit uncomfortable i guess but who cares and now we are still amazing friends
  mistake    its not a mistake when you actively make the freewilled decision to confess to girls as a grownass adult man instead of just asking them out    french girl    i love how that story absolutely went nowhere you were friends and then you were still friends the end next time ask her out on a date you dingus
  since you also lack the imagination ill share another one of my stories this time its one the backfires    actually this was a few days ago     im still in love with my ex we were still friends we were both going to warsaw for different reasons and decided to take the train together on the train she told me she shes been dating this new guy for 3 weeks etc i told her i was very happy for her and he sounds amazing   later on the train i told her i really love her and miss her she didnt respond back but that was it not a big confession but i said honestly how i was feeling     later that night i get a text form her saying she doesnt want to talk to me for a while i asked why and long story short she said she felt uncomfortable with how i said i love her even though were broken up she said it means we cant be friends etc   but it is honestly how i feel i told her i can stop saying it but i cant stop feeling it   she said then we cant talk   so thats that my honesty backfired i guess you can say but you can not say that im a liar i happen to understand very well that some things were not meant to be i dont want to keep a phony friendship going where i have to pretend to not love her it would be wrong to hang around her if i love her this is a consequence that im more than happy to face
  next time ask her out on a date  i dont want to date her just wanted her to know how i felt
  i noticed something in the 10 000 words youve spread all over the thread youve got an extremely unhealthy black and white outlook on what you see as honesty you think that if youre not 100 honest at all times regardless of context then youre an evil lying coward with no values    like you said the human experience is complicated yet you see it in one way or another with no nuance in between
i dont go to the gym anymore because i feel anxious people might judge me and intimidated by the big guys  any advices on how to get over this 
  being so self absorbed that you think other people even notice your presence
this   think about how often you notice the other people in the gym not counting the girl in shorts or the weirdo on the chest press
  no one cares about other people in the gym everyone just mires themselves in the mirror
everyone starts somewhere most of the big guys are focused on getting their own shit done if they do notice you its  fuck yeah hit it hard ive never run into many who judge most are supportive they got where they did lifting with others and getting that support
my mother just came into my room crying giving me a phone with an open text from my father saying i wish we could divorce youre a lying bitch and im catching on    im 100 certain there are massive miscommunications and misunderstandings i do not know how to make my parents understand and believe in each other    ive asked my father to his face about talking about this since he just got home but he seems very adamant that theres nothing to discuss what do i do i want them to be happy more than i want to be alive
reply or i kill myself
  well just know that theyll both love you and you get double presents for christmas/bday win win yo
  lol    stop caring about your parents happiness and find your own theyll be dead soon and youll be list if you dont set some emotional boundaries    also hes probably cheating or just an insecure fuck move out asap either way
ask them to go to marriage counseling and that youll pay
hurrr mommy daddy sad ((( i sad(((  your parents are going through some shit right now dont be a pawn in their games i dont mean to come off as a complete prick but this is pretty much par for the course as far as relationships go they just had the misfortune of having kids before they worked this shit out
  my parents went through a divorce when i was 17 this is gonna fucking suck for you considering how weirdly involved you are in their relationship good luck if you actually kill yourself over this youre the biggest pussy on the planet
  you said yourself your dad is unresponsive and even if you could somehow convince him to open up and listen to your mother theres no going back on what he sent her at the very least its going to deal a huge blow to their marriage regardless of whether or not your mother did anything wrong    do you even know what theyre talking about is it adultery gambling problems what does your dad think she did
  im 19 going on 20 havent done a birthday or christmas present thing in years     my happiness is important to me but i think my happiness is compromised by such an awful divorce i have a sister whos 13 shes dependent on them more than shes dependent on oxygen im also trying to protect her from such an event atleast until shes old enough to rationalize it   thanks for thinking about me before them though means alot to read that i might be more important to myself than them     i cant afford that im already in debt for our house it might just be me putting myself in their shoes but i think suggesting counseling would do more harm than good    you dont come off as a jerk its good advice to leave them to their own devices but i can see too well that there is misinformation basing their distrust i will never live it down if i dont do something    probably wont but im not confident enough to say definitely though knowing its a shit enough reason that it makes me a pussy helps a little thanks anon     lying money and drugs father thinks my mother has lied about not having money and not taking drugs with pity friend mother thinks father is a drug addict kinda is and abuses her daily never physically as far as i know about her low earnings and lack of absolute compassion for him theres obviously years of misinformation stacking up here as everything is getting progressively worse
  move out and build better boundaries around your parents theyre your parents and you are their child youre not their therapist and definitely not a certified marriage counselor     also     but i think my happiness is compromised by such an awful divorce    figure out why you believe this their marriage does not cause your happiness you do you are the only one responsible for your emotions just like they are
  i have a sister whos 13 shes dependent on them more than shes dependent on oxygen im also trying to protect her from such an event atleast until shes old enough to rationalize it    there are several things done wrong do get to this point already you should be preparing her for some difficulties of life by now not helping extend her sheltered period      its good advice to leave them to their own devices but i can see too well that there is misinformation basing their distrust i will never live it down if i dont do something    i dont think you understand why its good advice you are their child you shouldnt try to take responsibility for the integrity of their relationship even if it was something you could affect to a resolution the relationship would still be forever altered because they didnt figure it out      lying money and drugs    the seeds for this were sown long ago way before you were probably aware they have a fundamental failure of their relationships foundational trust that is finally reaching critical mass    you can do nothing but prepare yourself and your little sister for the backlash
  i could never live with myself if i saw the two people in my life that gave me more joy and comfort than any other break apart over misinformation and money struggles then seeing my sister devolve into nothing would hurt me further     i have history of distancing myself from things that have and will hurt me exs friends and family ive dropped out of both highschool and college id give up on anything in the world so long as its not these two i will do everything my physical body can allow
    i could never live with myself if i saw the two people in my life that gave me more joy and comfort than any other break apart    why not this may be an actual reality that you will continue to live in but its their relationship it has nothing to do with you their marriage and its stability has nothing to do with your ability to live with yourself only you can control that and you cannot control their marriage they might even be happier separated than together in an unhappy marriage if they are miscommunicating this much and refuse to get help for that then divorce might be the best option for them
  as much as i dont want to believe that i have thought about it their problems seem less about the other person doing bad things and more about them feeling a lack of respect and a lack of understanding  support     i can recall several occasions in my life where splitting up has been mentioned one of those times involved my father saying he would find a shitty hole to do drugs and take one of his guns and blow his head off   while it was likely just words it scares the shit out of me i couldnt care if this relationship ended up with my dad being entirely at fault and making a huge mess him killing himself is something id go through any fruitless effort to prevent     my mother would likely fall into a similar depression less drugs and less guns but theres no way im going to sit by while the possibility of either of them going through this alone is possible     im no longer a child that can be thrown from house to house i cant even be used as a medium for repressing loneliness and invoking responsibility i need to do something
after lengthy conversation dad told me i am belittling him abusing him     no matter how bad his reasoning might be to say it it hurts it hurts real bad i cant stop thinking about the last time we went fishing and how happy he looked fuck guys it hurts so much can i just kill myself now is it ok yet when am i not a pussy for ending it
  he has a father that actually took his son fishing  some people just have it all dont they
  have  at this rate its had     some people have it all  it hurts anon i really did have it all i love him and i was convinced he loved me i hope he still does so i can make it up to him
  youre a lying bitch and im catching on  its your mom that is cheating and your dad knows or strongly suspects and your mom is trying to make him the bad guy here    at least your dad didnt do what mine did and show me text between my mom and her boss she was fucking it went into graphic detail her gushing about his performance last time they fucked up to that point she was the one crying around the house and acting like the victim
  at this rate its had   you retard noone is stopping you from seeing both your parents after they divorce   it hurts anon i really did have it all i love him and i was convinced he loved me i hope he still does so i can make it up to him  what exactly do you want to make up for  to me it sounds like your dad is doing a good job his wife cheats on him and he isnt willing to discuss whats going to happen next because hes made up his mind   sorry your mom cheated by the way my mother is one of those too
if youre under 18  youre fucked  if youre over 18  talk to them and explain how you feel then perhaps cut your losses
have you considered that they might be happier living apart it doesnt sound like they get along very well  how long have you been trying to serve as mediator and fix their problems for them  it sounds like its eviscerating you and that things arent getting better
  anon youre not a peacemaker just live on and dont try to listen to your mother about how the father is the evil one
  just live on and dont try to listen to your mother about how the father is the evil one  that one hits close for me  fuck i hate her for that shit so much probably more than for the cheating   i know men can be physically violent and do all kinds of bad things but women are in a league of their own when it comes to destroying peoples lives   danm i was so young when she did that shit too   i dont think ill ever be able to trust a girl to have a relationship with because of what my mom did to me when i was younger   i would have loved to make a girl happy to be with me one day but i guess that ship has sailed
  get into therapy and get over this shit man its massively unfair to good women and to yourself to avoid healthy relationships because your mom happened to be a huge cunt that shit is so bad for you its the kind of shit that develops men who are physically violent and who do all kinds of bad things men need to learn how to express their feelings work through them and come out healthier on the other side find someone you can work through this with youre sabotaging yourself and for what some crazy bitch you never chose to begin with fuck that
  get into therapy and get over this shit man  there isnt anything to fix my mom blames it all on her manic depression which runs in both the male and female side of my family   i have a lot of character flaws which i personally think might be from that too but i dont like shifting the blame from myself   danmed if i do danmed if i dont   plus therapy is expensive af id rather be able to trust someone and talk with them about what happened but its just too much baggage my friend   its massively unfair to good women and to yourself to avoid healthy relationships because your mom happened to be a huge cunt  thisd only work if the relationships were indeed healthy i have trust issues which would just destroy both parties   that shit is so bad for you its the kind of shit that develops men who are physically violent and who do all kinds of bad things men need to learn how to express their feelings work through them and come out healthier on the other side find someone you can work through this with youre sabotaging yourself and for what some crazy bitch you never chose to begin with fuck that  ive never been violent or had any intention to hurt people except for my father when i was younger   my parents divorced when i was 5 by the way and mom had some bfs after that she married a junkie for 5 years he had money from criminal activities which was really convenient for a single mother of 2 boys  when they divorced he told me he fell in love with me and my brother and not so much with my mom   i guess ive never had very good role models but in the end i dont blame them  life fucks us all some people just enjoy the sex more
  my mother will tell me my dad is evil but i hold no prejudice my father will say the same about mother    the reason i want to help so bad is that neither are evil

  nothing is going to cure your autism might as well hold on to the girl as long as you can
  why exactly am i an autist
  you are on 4chan asking about whether or not you should be in a relationship you are 100 autist
  you can keep them close but then it just starts getting shitty and difficult  yeah no shit retard relationships are difficult learning to live so closely and openly with another human being is difficult trying to interpret what they think and what they want using only our hilariously limited speech is difficult fuck you for pretending its ever been any other way you sheltered piece of shit

  i critisised him and he never does that to me i didnt mean to hurt him and make him feel bad i dont even know why i said that and we had talked about this before and i promised i wont critise him and that i dont want him to feel bad but i dont know why i said that i am so fucking stupid one stupid sentense to fuck our relationship
  and he always supports me completely and he never says bad things abot the way i look or talk or do with my career and here is me a fucking idiot needing to point out something to make him feel bad and hurt him especially at a time when he feels bad about other things and he is vulnerable
i know its difficult but he doesnt care about you i dont know what you said to him exactly but that was probably just an excuse for him to book it i know it feels impossible to move on but you have to he clearly doesnt want you in his life anymore you cant chase someone who doesnt love you they will not return your feelings no matter how hard you wish for it
criticized how what did you say and was it of particular significance to him  also is your relationship defined by just curbing your tongue if communication about potential problems is occurring thats an issue  also it seems like an overreaction on his part if he just broke up with you for 1 statement which is why it would help if i knew what it was  what exactly happened
  no its my fault i fucked up of course he cares about me he was always here for me and loved me
  from what she describes it sounds like they had a pretty real relationship i didnt know it at the time but i would criticize my ex and she did it back to me up to the point where i packed my shit and left when she exploded one day because of all the pain i caused her     youd be surprised how fucking painful it is when your significant other criticizes you and vice versa its been 6 months since that happened and while i want to say im over it i still get sad thinking about what we couldve been       op the fact that this is long distance makes it harder i wont lie you should probably mention what exactly you said and more of what type of person you know him to be so we can see make better judgement on why he left how much he cares for you still etc    the best thing you can do is maybe give him a little space but let him know through a text like i know what i said was wrong etc and just let him get some air if that makes sense before trying to have a serious talk with him again
  it will sound stupid i just told him we should still go to the gym right after he told me he felt good about me complimenting him on his appearance i am so fucking retarded and we have talked about this beforewe had a whole fight about me making him feel like he is not enough for me and all that but after that we were okay and i never brought it up again and i promised and i dont know why i said that today i am so sooo sorry i love him i dont want him to change or to feel bad and i didnt say that to hurt him but i know i did he wold have never made me feel that
 i did i told him right after it doesnt matter i am not sure he will forgive me again i dont even think i deserve to be forgiven i am such a terrible person
  how much time do you think i should wait before i reach out to him
  what the fuck its fucking nothing my girlfriend says worse things all the time i always try to set her straight and she usually admits she was wrong but your bfs reaction is hilarious exaggeration as is your regret
  leave your ex alone dumb bitch
  youll get over it after a good dicking by the replacement guy  youve already called him right
  this is borderline abusive as in hes being abusive to you him forcing you to walk on eggshells constantly close to blowing up on you at any second for any small illconceived mishap is abuse    forget about him before it becomes much worse
   as in hes being abusive to you  even with paragraphs of info theres still those handfuls of shits like you that would take the side of these wile women  youre the shit that flew out after a woman gave birth to a healthy kid  then they saw a tiny crying turd underneath the blood and birth slime and felt a need to raise your ass
  kill yourself roastie defender
  it will sound stupid i just told him we should still go to the gym right after he told me he felt good about me complimenting him on his appearance  that is literally nothing if that hurt his feefees so much that he dumped you the he is either some overly sensitive faggot or just looked for a semi plausible excuse to dump your ass move on
  oh yeah i would give it at least a couple weeks for him to cool off but at the same time id still let him know that you care through a couple messages like i know what i said was wrong and uncalled for and i know youre upset with me and im sorry i would just like to talk with you because i still care about you something along those lines     what the fuck its fucking nothing my girlfriend says worse things all the time i always try to set her straight and she usually admits she was wrong but your bfs reaction is hilarious exaggeration as is your regret    so fucking edgy i bet you brag about other autistic shit like your desktop computer and lack of virginity because you have a girlfriend and cant fuck girls unless you date them first  overall it sounds like you guys are young like no more than mid 20s and that he is obviously insecure about his body and most likely other things dont listen to these autistic comments i had a talk with my ex for something similar luckily we are both reasonable people i was able to admit to her that a lot of the things i said were uncalled and she apologized for the same thing     how long have you guys been together i know he means a lot to you but he sounds a lot like me in some ways i was really insecure about other things about myself and i realized it would only harm my ex if i stayed with her because of how i behaved due to these insecurities not saying you should break up but thats just the boyfriend perspective of someone who went through something similar
just leave the fatty to be youll find better
  both of you seem incredibly superficial and very young so i wouldnt worry too much about it better to learn from this and move on    also you wrote a lot of text and its like im reading a blank page so much unnecessary information learn to write better that would be my actual advice
  no fuck off you broke his heart you cant fix that ever just more on and go fuck up some other guys life
lisa
  this    op your ldr is displaying narcissistic traits and silent treatment in a relationship is a form of abuse regardless of what these other anons believe you would be wise to get out of this relationship before it destroys you    i would recommend googling narcissistic abuse in a relationship it will help you understand whats going on
  nop i am not lisa sorry
i mean sometimes when i say i dont want to talk i acutally do need time     depending on how long ago this happened try talking to him in another couple days
  i have been too emotional today to watch my proper language use or structure and that wasnt the point and no i am 22which i suppose could be young but he is in his early 30s and considering we are both very mature i wouldnt put it in the young and stupid category
  bahahahah what a simp probably has a hillary 2016 sticker on the back of his pink volkswagen beetle also he sounds toxic and controlling like me xd i do the same shit to have the upper hand in the relationship so take it from a piece of shit like myself he doesnt love you
that can be significant to some but quite honestly that doesnt sound like much for someone to break up with you over you saying that and its not even an insult it just possibly has negative implications he chose to look at while he ignored the positive is an issue   id suggest listening to this guy but thats just me  
  youre 22  hes over 30    you can do better dont worry about it lmao
  he is going through other difficulties currently so its not that easy to brush off and it was a mean thing to say especially after the fact that we have discussed it before
  lmfao this so much this    they both lack confidence and take everything personally im pretty sure hell come back you guys seem co dependant
  22  very mature  pick one
bf sounds like a pussy if hes that ready to leave you for making one mistake he was definitely just waiting for an excuse to leave and the fact that he blocked you on everything means he is finally home free and doesnt want to deal with the reprecussions of leaving someone who loved him for petty surface reasons and doesnt want to tell you he didnt like you anymore
            the boyfriend is a child  rationalize it any other way is unintelligent
  if this truly is literally all it was then hes in the wrong    but this story seems pretty onesided and i wonder how hed say it all went down
how do i find/make friends with chad i dont really know what to talk about with them
literally just talk about anything i spent like an hour laughing about military drones killing sandpeople with one of my friends
  weightraining every chad ever lifts weights
how do i address someone who is mtf when it comes to online dating im all in all mostly a straight guy as far as i know but i recently matched with someone who is trans im not a chaser im not looking for anyone to reveal my hidden sexuality to me i just find this person attractive and interesting ive never been with a trans person ive never been with another guy i just really dont care at the end of the day    do i need to lay out that i recognize that theyre trans that ive never been with someone who is trans do i ask about their journey do i ignore it outright and just talk about our common interests    whats the best way to go about this
  what youre going to find out is that even ignoring the fact that theyre trans trans people are unstable emotional wrecks even if they appear to have their shit together from a distance i wouldnt date them even if they werent trans
get to know her  treat her like a normal girl    you arent obligated to fuck and youre not obligated to her friend    just get to know her
  you say this as if you have lots of experience with trans women maybe op will like this one and have fun with her
  yeah ive heard this i just normally dont judge people much in advance im not really a red flags kind of person thats never treated me poorly but i also dont get myself into relationships much because im looking for something unique i guess      thanks do i bring up her being trans in my message or just let that part go
  why bring it up you can just leave that out
  maybe he will but i think hes wasting his time
  i think youre biased towards people who are different you may have met a small handful of trans people who were wrecks at that point in their lives or maybe you see the vocal majority which always means stupid of trans people online
  do i bring up her being trans in my message  she is surely well aware that youre aware of her being trans no need to bring that up until she does
  if she wants to talk about it she will dont bring it up yourself
    it seems like this answers my earliest questions honestly part of me wants to go oh god youre a person with a penis but you are attractive please talk me through this but im guessing she doesnt have the answer much better than i do
  do i need to lay out that i recognize that theyre trans  dont bring it up but if she tells you out of politeness dont say something like you already know unless its written on her profile but dont act really surprised either a simple thats no problem i like you for you or something along those lines will work  that ive never been with someone who is trans  no but if you have that conversation above you can tell her shes the first trans woman youve been with  do i ask about their journey  only if she wants to talk about it  do i ignore it outright and just talk about our common interests  yes just talk to her like you would a cis woman    there are stereotypes about trans people being crazy but my two best friends are trans and are very normal pleasant successful people and im fortunate to have them definitely give this girl a chance    lastly youre still straight she probably looks and acts like an attractive woman and very much wants to be treated as a woman for her own comfort because thats who she is she got the shit end of the stick but shes making things right its fine if you are a little gay but dating an out and transitioning trans woman as a straight man isnt look up aiden dowling thats gay
  thanks yeah its listed on her profile so its out there i have a really really good eye for trans women and i only barely suspected when i decided i was interested i dont think anyone else would    thanks for the advice i messaged her about her profile and left out any of the gender stuff well see where it goes
  hahahahahahahaha
  lol you can make it sounds stupid but hes right expect the majority of trans people really arent likes that
  im sure you know a lot about trans people
hey advice its saturday night and im sitting in my dorm room alone once again like a sad sack the semesters coming to an end and i was wondering if you fellas have any advice on how i can avoid this going forward i guess i dont need to tell you but im pretty autistic i dont exactly have any friends im trying but its not my forte is there anything that you wished you did in college that you did not do thanks
  lots of people who are shy can make friends when they join something what are you doing to address this issue if anything
  i go to club at my university but its a film club so we only talk for a half hour at the end i also have a hard time with this i mean today there was this girl that i have know for years i saw during lunch i wanted to go say more than the hi that i did but i just hid away ive begun with my own version of expression therapy but i cant give myself the push a lot the time
  if people at film club are cool with letting you go back to your dorm alone every time then you might want to try another club if you like the film club keep going but you get the point
  yeah i do you have any suggestions on where i can meet people i would appreciate it immensely
im a male engineering student on his fourth year of college theres this girl in my project group who is basically very pretty charming and intelligent shes really nice to everyone and i have feelings for her sadly shes out of my league genetically    im not going to ask her out because i know she will reject me im just not up to her standards which is something that i accept    ive been visiting escorts for about a year now theyre usually nice and once every few months i see one for one hour    i know that this girl im attracted to girl from college doesnt have a boyfriend would it be possible to talk to her and offer to pay her the same as highend escorts for the hour escorts usually give me nice times but this girl is just something different    what are the possible outcomes of me asking her that how should i proceed should i make jokes about it so she consideers it dont really have many female friends i can ask about this     by the way im a hardworking and fit student i own a car and stuff but shes just out of my league im not a creep i have never hit on her and she sometimes asks me how college is going just typical stuff between college people    so topic how would she react to my  proposal any advice is appreciated
offering female friend money for sex  what a pathetic fuck
  dude youre better off just asking her out and seeing what happens plenty of people get dates out of their league you probably would have to offer her a larger amount than you pay escorts for her to even consider your proposal
every woman has a price     just dont make her feel like a literal whore and youre good even pros dont like to think of themselves as whores
  shed just reject me im aware of how romantic relations and know that i dont stand a chance yeah i probably would need to offer her a lot more than that but how much exactly i can maybe offer her 700 for one hour but anything above that would be too much for me i appreciate your reply a lot helps quite a bit thanks mate
  thanks for the reply and yes thats right but im not sure what this girls price is sometimes i think about just fucking my typical escorts and forgetting about her but shes a bit too special
  i think you should try seducing her first and if that doesnt work then offer money otherwise just bang another whore    i can tell your blueballs are fogging your brain a pussy is a pussy some just come with a better view dont underestimate yourself and dont overestimate her either youre better than her by virtue of being a man
  special   nigga seriously go bang another bitch your sexual frustration is clouding your mind if she didnt have a pussy you wouldnt think twice about her women are all the same dude
  she is more likely to reject your offer of paying her for sex than she is to reject a date
  well yeah with the former she actually has to put out     simple supply and demand if she values her pussy for over 700 and youre not willing to pay that then youre probably just going to spend 2030 bucks having your time wasted
  lol this wont work
  thanks for the reply and yes my balls are probably fogging my brain maybe my stupid feelings will go away after banging a good escort who knows      hahahahha you are so right mate i probably should just fuck another bitch thanks for the reply      maybe thing is shed reject me on a date so no point im just gonna bang some bitch probably
  i hope she accuses you of harassment and gets you kicked out of college
  why though i guess i dont really understand her point of view since im a man men and women are different biologically the latter are more sexually powerful when young and as a man id be more than happy to fuck a thin girl for even 50 an hour but as a powerful loved young woman she probably doesnt want anything to do with this
  how would it be harassment if i made a nonthreatening proposal and completely accepted her decision and respected her boundaries blows my mind youre a faggot
regardless of how inoffensive you might feel it is most likely shell take offense that youre treating her or a part of her as a commodity that you can buy out instead of a person you can call this bad women logic but itll be how she feels regardless
  do you honestly think someone with ops level of autism would be able to consider her as a person its classic goddesswhore complex either shes an unobtainable goddess or shes just another whore     careful for this scalding hot take but men on 4chan dont tend to have the healthiest attitudes towards women
  dont do this you risk expulsion
  because on an existential level you wounded her women get pissed off when a man points out their smv the worst way to do this is to directly approach with sexual intent     in a females brain this is happening     ugh  that fucking loser actually thought i was in his league  disgusting  oh nowhat does that say about me  gotta save face    and now you know why women always blatantly shit talk about guys they turned down even if they were nice about it     putting literal dollars to it is even worse     ugh  that pathetic fucker thought my pussy  eggs are worth 700  he actually thought 700 was enough for me in order to let him squirt his putrid dysgenic dna inside me  insolence
  eh maybe not women love getting objectified by men but his smv needs to be greater than hers
this is honestly one of the saddest posts ive seen on here in a while
  be me  femanon studying engineering at university  get placed in group with this complete weirdo  fat unshaven smells funny cant handle conversations  looks like gollum   creepy but whatever  just need to get through the semester  leaving class one day  see this creature following me down the hall  fuck he wants to talk to me  cant outpace him  he cuts me off  hhey can i ask you something  can already smell his breath and his greasy face glistens in the light  holding back vomit  yeahuh sure  him i know you would normally reject me but i thought i could pay you to have sex with me if thats ok  wtf  this goblin man literally just asked me to be a prostitute  he seriously thinks offering to pay a girl for sex is rational and normal behavior  dont know what to say  ummmm no please leave me alone  runwalk away  text my friends what just happened  group chat is losing their minds  word gets around  entire university now is aware of what happened  mfw this kid now and its a running joke  mfw he doesnt show up in class the next week  mfw he was apparently expelled from the university for sexual harassment
  its not really sad its just how romantic relationships work in college 90 of women go for 10 of men this happens in literally every college in every country not everyone was born to be loved
  lmaooooooo so fucking good man my tens out of tens youre a bright person whoever you are
  how severe is your autism
  exactly this paying her for sex is so fucking desperate itll turn her pussy into the fucking sahara
  90 of women go for 10 of men  i sincerely doubt youve been to college
    i have sadly man and thats how shit works here u can ask any anthropologist or biologist about this hell agree 100 dna proves this along with surveys and data
  im sorry you had such a bad college experience because my college was nothing like that
one of my old friends who isnt unattractive but isnt my type recently propositioned me for a night together this came after i told him my past as an actual prostitute    if i werent taken id have jumped on it im still thinking about it but he has a gf now so i dont know if its a possibility anymore but no she wont shrivel into a desert as long as you arent some fat fugly greasereeking basement dweller and put effort into your appearance and education and social interactions she might say no because a lot of women havent even considered prostitutes are just people sex work is still work etc     a warning though if you want her to genuinely like you and not see you as a walking wallet you should befriend her first
  dont offer her money thats sick just ask her out with confidence maybe talk to her a few times first ask to hang out as friends if she takes to you then ask
  i do want her to like me but im average height and have been receiving chemo for a year and all the hair in my head fell off so i look like a cancer patient well im one i dont really think any atttactive girl will feel attracted to me sadly i appreciate the escorts i visit a lot as people and i dont know im confused because this could be my last year and id like to sleep with someone i love x_x
  shes going to be insulted that you only value her for sex and shes going to tell all her friends what a pig you are and get you blacklisted    if you want a chance just ask her out
  dude i highly doubt you actually love her have you ever hung out just the two of you it sounds like youve just had polite conversation do not ask her to fuck you for money you are basically a stranger acquaintance to her it will only come off as weird     ask her out or dont but if you want to sleep with someone you love then find someone you might like hang out with them to be sure that you do then eventually form a relationship
  bruh speaking as a dude who hasnt gotten laid and probably wont for a long time i know thats bullshit the guys that cant get girls are firmly in the minority  fuck you this thread is bait
    love/like why does it matter i like her a lot and id like to sleep with her before i fucking die you really think id be thinking of her if i had someone else i liked to hang out with i like her thats it   ps youre a faggot
  up until the pay for sex part you described what im pretty sure most girls think of me rip in peace me
  says the guy who feels he needs to pay women to sleep with him    dude im trying to not talk down to you because your situation is rough but you need to get over this girl im sure shes great but if you lack the courage to ask her out then theres nothing there     also what is it about her you love/like because if its anything attributable to basic human kindness then that isnt a good reason
  trips and a fucking based post to boot
  either just ask her out or straight up ask her if she would like to make some money and you better have like 2k to offer    check out my formula that i just came up with right now because im stoned    you have to hit above the womans self worth meter low value women would fuck you for 20    average 20year old college maybe 2k maybe 5k  most women want money real bad and sex just doesnt have much meaning anymore    go for the glory mate
i thought about this but obviously it would cost more than an expensive prostitute since they arent per se prostitutes and then i realise its not worth it  she wont let me do the things i want to her and costs more    what you are looking for op cant be bought like a one time purchase
  well played good sir
  7/10  i foresee many yous in your immediate future my son  well done
  im not a creep  youre about to make an unsolicited offer to pay her for sex like shes some tijuana crack whore you couldnt be anything further from a creep  there is a 99999 percent chance she gets freaked out tells everyone in your major and you get ostracized in your university is that what you want the other 001 percent is you get lucky and she thinks its a joke and you play it off that way though i dont think youre socially competent enough to be able to play it off in that case because if you were you wouldnt be offering to pay for sex with a female colleague dont do it especially thinking long term if this goes bad for you and she tells everyone what you did this can potentially taint your future pool of references and contacts for networking because no one wants to give a job to a creepy dude who offers random girls money for sex its a total pr risk no one is gonna want to hire you if that happens think about the future here dude
  a literal whore giving advice
  youre fucking delusion whatever friendship there was between you two will be destroyed after you call her a fucking whore you degenerate
  all women are whores m8 they just dont wanna feel like it
dont ask her  its very inapproprite
no matter how you present this proposition to her she will react badly and refuse there is a very good chance others will hear of it and it will damage your reputation significantly    logically it may not seem like a big deal to you when evaluating it in comparison to other social behavior that everyone considers normal but a lot of social mores and taboos arent 100 logical or there may be a logical explanation for them but most people will not be able to articulate whatever that is    at worst she may report you and you will be booted from your uni  considering todays general attitudes and social climate i would hardly be surprised    please do not do this  it is guaranteed not to work and you will demonized relentlessly and held up as a symbol of everything wrong with men  they will not care that you were wellmeaning or trying to be respectful and every word you speak in your defense will serve to further incriminate you
to be fair it is exactly what she deserves
i did some work for a guy who contacted me on reddit nigga payed only half of amount 22 remaining  i can provide you his fb id yahoo mail id can you help me terify this little piece of ghetto shit to pay half ill pay you11

i have only crushed on one girl ever and im 26 yo shes unavailable what the fuck do i do i cant stop thinking about her
  lay on your couch and listen to layla by derek and the dominos on repeat while feeling physically ill that you cant be with her
kidnapping people is frowned upon so dont do that if you want this girl show her why she should be with you and not numb nuts make her want you
  mate i havent managed to make a girl even remotely interested in me in 26 years i just want to forget her i wish i was fucking asexual
look up oneitis dont fall into the trap just talk to more people and you will eventually forget her
bump
meet more women
  oh ok just play vidya and fap to other girls so much you cant think about her then loser
  26 and only one im 20 and had one oneitis who left my life and its hard but u get over her takes years now i have this girl im obsessed with and think im not good for her even tho she likes me and i like her were young and insecure and failed past relationship and poor and dependent on our parents and everything i think these are just excuses youre 26 and probably more of an adult and i am we should stop being pathetic and be more honest then maybe we wont regret
  yeah i have a hard time with people in general since im very shy im also very bad at getting more intimate with people which helps with not catching feelings this girl though shes just so amazing you cant help but fall for her      shes a coworker thats the entire problem
a dude on runescape literally once talked with me for 3 hours to convince me not to kill myself he wouldnt give up until he felt i was stable     anyone else have deep ass convos in mmos
    i dont play games anymore because i have a life lol not trying to offend you but that guy is a great person
i fucking love runescape you in a clan im looking for one and im pretty high level
  i was in an iron man clan that lasted for a few years but that eventually drifted apart still play when i can but i got more stuff to do these days
i dont know whether not i should feel depressed about this or not i couldnt have asked for a better mum but looking at her now i feel like shes led a life somewhat unfulfilled i know that might come off as pompous being her son but for her whole life shes been a stay at home mum     whenever im with her shes fun to be around and has an immature sense of humour almost juvenile but when shes out her face is stoic always keeping up appearances and smiling as she see fit with an unwavering posture     shes always so worried about what others thinks of her and i feel like she can only feel comfortable around me and me dad she was married off at a young age so maybe she never got to really experience the world she seems happy but whenever shes out it always seems to be otherwise     have any other anons experienced this with their mums im a bit curious
  thats what a woman is supposed to dumbass shes happy all the thots you see on tinder arent
whenever something bad or aggrevating happens i actually have to force myself to emotionally react or feel angry and 99 of the time isnt genuine is this bad i just dont see the point in caring about something thats already happened or something you can do nothing or little about even things that have a medium impact dont seem worth putting all this effort into fighting for now ive never been robbed but say my bank account with 1000 something gets robbed of all its funds and thats all i have id get kind of frustrated and heated for a few seconds but after that i just dont feel like its worth it to stress so much over it when i can just tough through and get over it and instead spend my time thinking about what i can do to solve the situation    is this a bad thing or am i right people often call me distant and cold and a robot because i dont react with an overthetop volatile emotional reaction and yell and scream and shout at the top of my voice and gain everyone with my vicinitys attention if someone say pulls a gun on me when i can just think about how to enjoy myself afterwards instead of crying and whatnot in fact my father has told me that i should just become a combat sniper in the military because of how aloof nonchalant and apathetic i tend to be
whats the point of living if ill never be loved
  who says youll never be loved
  i do
  i do too
  who says your opinion is valid      oof cant argue with that youre fucked op
  well are you lovable what traits do you possess that make you feel eligible for a relationship    would you choose yourself as a partner exept for mutual pity
  yes there is so much in life to enjoy the only real reason to kill yourself is if you have treatmentresistant depression
  so the discomfort you feel about yourself has to be fixed  get your act together or resign yourself for real
  guess op is dead
  its not just my opinion its the facts o the matter of fact no one wants a ugly dicklet manlet like me
i want to go to the dr to explore but i have heard that there is a rising crime epidemic going on there    would it be safe for a caucasian foreigner like me to go there and have a very low chance of being mugged or kidnapped or worse    i would like for the dominican 4channers to participate in this thread    is it really that bad thereor is it blown out of proportion
  do you speak fluent spanish  do you have a deep understanding of their culture and why there is a boarder with haiti
  im from germany but i lived in spain for 4 and a half years  no
i want to go to the dr to explore but i have heard that there is a rising crime epidemic going on there    dominican here what are you exactly looking for to explore this is a third world country but touristic places are relatively safe if you take normal precautions
how do you know your level of attractiveness when going for the opposite sex 
what good will knowing do you
  hair fullness well kempt  body shape smell  standing occupation financial security  presence physical security  dependence live alone or with parents/friends  outlook do you have plans for the future    see where you stand with all of these and youll know unless youre a woman in which case you just need to not be deformed
  thats pretty hard to say i think its harder for women than just not be deformed you shouldnt have a mental disability as well
  you cant really there are certain characteristics that all women find attractive but there are also a wide range of traits that are entirely subjective some girls like tall and lanky some like big and burly some like rico suave some like gangster or biker looks some girls are scared by tough guys other girls get their basement flooded by them the sharp angular features of a male model are attractive but to some girls not as attractive as chest hair and a beard similarly if mr male model gets his ass beat by a tough guy some girls will start finding otherwise less attractive mr tough more attractive than mr male model and some wont    i was a lanky edgy dude with a buzzcut and boots and band shirts and i did just fine with women now im an overweight dude 200lbs with a beard and i still do fine with women
  how do you know your level of attractiveness when going for the opposite sex   look at a few natural pictures of yourself photos being taken of you when you dont know they are being taken thats what you look like is your head a normal shape flat face big ears wonky smile some people are attractive some arent some are unfortunately unattractive    then consider how socially capable you are eg do you approach and talk to women without any issues do you have interests and hobbies that involve leaving the house have you been on holiday without your parentsare you the natural leader of your friends/group are people happy to see you when you arrive    are you ambitious how ambitious are you in a secure job can you progress in it does it pay well does it infringe on your personal life    ultimately having some self confidence will help you more than most things because women are being sent emojis by chad on social media if you actually approach them and chat you stand out to them dating and fucking women isnt difficult at all
hi guys i need some advice when it comes to sex just to preface with this first but i have never had sex there is a girl i really like and that likes me as well and ill be seeing her soon we talked about it and will be having sex when i come over i feel lost though i am not a total idiot but was wondering when do you put a condom on for example also want to go down on her any advice when it comes to that

gf kissed somebody else at a party  confessed the next day crying and feeling like shit  told me there was no excuse for it and that shell never do it again and that she wont attend parties without me now etc etc  tell her its okay  thinking of fucking someone else to get back at her    does this make me a shitty person
nah itll show her there are consequences for going behind you back
  would she be a hypocrite if she left me for it after i forgave her
  what the fuck is the point of staying with the bitch have some balls and hate fuck her right before breaking up
  im not as full of hate as these other anons  the fact that she came out immediately and confessed and was rather broken up about it shows she actually has some remorse perhaps try to work it out normally and tell her that you are upset and she is going to have to work to gain your trust back set a couple healthy boundaries like her not going out with the girls late late and maybe you two being able to look throw each others phones together    really depends on how much you value the relationship though senpai also i wouldnt go fuck someone else thats just throwing more shit on the shitfire and kind of dumb
  now this is your average cuck  why the hell would you ever forgive something like that
  yes an evil doesnt void evil also why keeping a relationship up if she clearly made out with someone else
  just leave you know as well as anyone else that if she gave a shit shed have done no such kissing  she just doesnt want the slut label accurate as it may be
its over senpai
you and she are young primates dont look for marriage until youre fifty fuck instead knock the bottom out of that pussy other pussy even boipucci and move on     treating every bf/gf relationship as some foundation for marriage is one reason divorce is so common fuck when young give up and settle when old you wont regret any of the orgasms or at least i didnt
  i didnt  how old are you even  what constitutes young in your contexts    just curious is all i dont agree or disagree as much as my stance is if youre not having fun maybe youre doing it wrong
if everyone takes revenge then civilization would be impossible     its important to recognize empathy and guilt in others when it exists and forgive good people forgiveness is a virtue vindictiveness is a vice     however this goes out then window when dealing with bad people you can screw them over to all high hell
time to move on op
  depends on the kiss peck sure whatever forgiven but full on making out nah gtfo
  somebody outed themselves as garbage therefore ill be garbage too  yes it makes you a bad person let her rot like the whore she is no reason to join her but thats irrelevant since you already have    the worst possible thing to do  treating every bf/gf relationship as some foundation for marriage is one reason divorce is so common  its literally the opposite you mongoloid the people who actually take it seriously and show restraint have the lowest divorce rates while the degenerates that fuck anything that moves have the highestif they even get married that is
  they didnt make out but she kissed him twice      she feels bad about it she threw up twice while talking to me
  they didnt make out but she kissed him twice  there is zero incentive for her to be honest about how far she wentthe fact is she went to the party and slutted up with other men and now she wants to be forgiven     she feels bad about it  i can guarantee she wouldnt have felt bad if she knew she wouldnt be caught    she did tell you which at least saves you time just break up and be done with it and spare her the invectives as a reward for the confession if she starts begging or trying to paint you as the bad guy then go all out but remember cheating on her is only harming yourself
so do unto her as she done unto you go with her to the next party and kiss a girl there yin and yang light and dark all that crap
  casual cheating is a necessary evil of any healthy relationship humans werent meant to be monogamous and shes going to fuck some other dude eventually if shes decent looking and socializes with other guys might as well get the head start on her
  i can guarantee she wouldnt have felt bad if she knew she wouldnt be caught    but i didnt catch her she confessed to me no one else at the party saw it happen i didnt ask her she told me
  her true self reviles itself but at least she told you shes trash pump and dump and definitely cheat on her lol
jesus preached forgiveness for a reason anon hate is toxic and taking hateful actions even more so just drop the issue
  wow actual good advice
  whatever you do you must take action and it should not involve getting back at her to make it 50/50  if you really want to fuck someone else just dump her if later you want to get her back you can still try that you might lose her to a chad though  but you did something to make her act like this  also read this
im sort of in the same boat  how long have you been dating for
  9 months
  no one else at the party saw it happen  and you know this how the guy she did it with knew the point is she didnt feel safe so she confessed look your consideration of cheating yourself is aside from being an issue you should fix in yourself also proof that youre repulsed by what she did dont bother looking for reasons to take her back while breaking up is a must you would be cutting her slack by not yelling at her over it initially even though she deserves it       jesus also physically whipped the moneychanging snakes out of the temple and anon should do the same with this viper by kicking her out of his life  lel what would jesus do  if he saw the pitiful state of modern degenerates weep
the problem with this situation is the possibility that your mind will not stop thinking about the fact that she did it and youll keep doubting her despite her best efforts to redeem herself its going to come down to how mature you can be and how much you trust her it can become a real problem in the future especially during fights so    i advice you not to do the same its stupid and doesnt make anything better if you actually care about her plus you have the moral high ground if that matters to you
  this fucking meme again
if this happened to me id probably kick her out of my house and tell her i dont know if i can get over it or not then maybe a week or two in if i really wanted to get back together id meet up and talk things out     theres the obvious possibility shell run and fuck someone once you do this if she does she wasnt that into you anyway m8 you could also run and fuck someone else this would indicate to me you dont really have that much invested but usually dumb guys who fuck thots are different than your average woman who fucks a guy they get more emotionally involved in the intimacy ime not always but     idk its a tough situation man good luck
everyone in this thread manipulating their partners emotions  this is why i dont do relationships
  she only said it because youd find out
  if she confessed and genuinely seemed sorry id chock it up to alcohol and mood lighting and let it go its better for her to know she can be open with you than to punish her for her honesty by deliberately trying to hurt her for coming to you    id have a talk with her about the circumstances and try to make a plan for next time shes in that situation so she doesnt lose her shit if she does anything like it again leave her
  women  remorse  haha  heres a little life lesson 99 of women make up the most absurd bullshit just to get out of trouble remorse is something that doesnt exist in their dictionary
    this pleb talking about women as though theyre one unified group  not in their dictionary like women speak some foreign language    how many people have you been with anon
  the fact that you responding with that its okay bullshit tells me that there is no hope for you if you really cared youd probably crying or puking instead of comforting her look at this from her point she just did something completely unacceptable and youre like its fine lol  youre perfect for each other
leave her    do not contact her ever again    end of story problem solved leave that whore
  gf kisses someone else  op wants to fuck someone else to get even  sexkiss
  heres a little life lesson 99 of women make up the most absurd bullshit just to get out of trouble remorse is something that doesnt exist in their dictionary    women always tell the truth its just that the truth happens to be whatever helps them most at the moment or whatever hurts you most at the moment    and the real trick is they actually seriously will believe the truth theyre saying when theyre saying it even if theyll contradict themselves the next day and say the opposite    truth for women is whatever is most helpful for them    i want you guys to sit down and seriously think about what kind of weapon evolution gave women it gave men big muscles and fast reflexes what weapon did evolution give women manipulation
  in short women lie kinda contradicts your starting point
its over     
yes that makes you a shitty person its hard to tell if you should give her a second chance though i dont know if i would unless we were wellestablished but even then man i dunno
  dump her now  she only confessed because she felt scared like a child   she couldnt control herself at the party like a child   i swear i wont be bad again like a child   your better off without this whore  will you tell her its okay next time when a kiss is a blowjob  or what about the time after that when she accidently rides a guys dick  have some selfrespect for fucks sake fuck this bitch and throw her to the kerb
  does this make me a shitty person  dont even be shocked if it turns out she cheated on you full on  the classic drip feed first itll be i kissed him then well i kissed him and maybe he felt me up a little etc and eventually shell confess the whole truth which is she was kissing him while he was balls deep inside her  so if you cheat back dont do it to get back at her do it because youre planning to leave her      boundaries like her not going out with the girls late late  if this is the first line of defense against cheating the relationship is essentially already over
  tell her its okay  oof    dont do that  she did something wrong and she should be comforting you  not the other way around    ill break it to you once something like this happens in a relationship its pretty much over  no matter how you continue there is just too much you can interpret into what happened  any time you two will have a fight this will come up    just break up with her  if you want to get back at her try to fuck with her mentally a bit or just be nasty to her no matter what you do she will talk bad about you in the future even if you are the nicest person there is so why not be bad
what a fucking bitch  if you accept that behavior then next time she will push the boundaries more  fuck someone else then go back to her revenge fuck her tell her you fucked someone else then dump her
  you really should have just beat the shit out of her
  kissed she most likely made out with them best case scenario worst case she kissed his wang dump the whore we men have been run into the dirt our entire lives like cheating dogs even when we never did because men do that and they assume we are all potential cheaters or rapists but women just float throughout their lives free from the consequences of their behavior dump her abruptly and make it hurt
dont cheat just leave call her or meet her and tell her its over and just walk away dont talk or argue with her just walk away think about it if the roles were reversed would she forgave you the trust is lost and just leave
  there are a few exceptions where i would say you can forgive her for example if the guy initiated the kiss and she rejected it after only a second or two its acceptable      they didnt make out but she kissed him twice  she kissed him twice so not just once if they kissed once for a few seconds a bluepilled guy could argue its an accident they kissed and a while later they kissed again thats already enough evidence for me that she is an unfaithful slut doing it twice cant be labeled as a mistake    they didnt make out  problem is i dont really believe this sure it might not have been a fullblown make out session which lasted hours but i dont believe it were just 2 peck kisses they kissed and she reciprocated or even initiated idk you are her boyfriend but at that particular moment a few intimate moments with a random hot guy at a party were more important to her than her loyalty towards her boyfriend massive red flag    bottom line is she kissed another dude at a party aka she cheated on you a proper girlfriend will not let that happen no matter how attractive she thought this dude was by comforting her and telling her its all okay you are already putting yourself into a cuck position me personally i have a nononsense approach when it comes to cheating when your girl cheats on you you should dump her doesnt matter on how much alcohol was involved or whatever fucking excuse she will give you
dont say its okay its not  dont cheat  id say leave her    you know if this accident happened and she apologized and blabla she wouldnt say she cant go to parties alone why not no self control somehow i dont fuck ppl randomly when im alone without my gf what basis is this for the future    bye honey off to work  dont fuck your boss if possible okay   ill try bye baby    shit life
  yes considering you said it was okay but still want to go behind her back for revenge the only reason you even want to do it so you can hurt her just break up and save both the trouble
  thinking about cheating because you are hurt doesnt make you a shitty person if you actually cheat on her does but wanting to be the bad guy somehow in this is a way males cope with a cheating gf or wife like somehow the unsuspecting man is the bad one in the relationship and if nothing apparent you concoct some shameful behavior to be guilty of    going to a party your gf knew you wouldnt be at spending most of the evening with another guy drinking and partying and ending it with her kissing him is being a shitty person telling you doesnt make that unshitty nor is it a guarantee she wont do it again like shitty people continue to be shitty duh    i know guys immediately try to mitigate what really happened by saying it was only two kisses she was drunk its out of character she was whatever excuse including her reaction and retching when she tells you histrionics by the way bottom line she had an opportunity and took it and if the guy would have made the move he didnt or wanted a bit more shed be telling you they didnt really have intercourse only the tip went in    no way you will ever believe a damn thing that comes from her mouth and you shouldnt she will go to a party without you or out with the girls for a drink or some work or school function and youll not be there and she will get drunk and there will be opportunity and guys she has proven impossible to resist and will be absolutely miserable your ego overruling your head
  yes you are vindictive and shitty  kissing isnt cheating kissing and sex are two totally different levels  shes willing to never do stuff without you a sign she doesnt want to cheat and shes very submissive  be grateful shes scared and shamed straight without going beyond kissing    no
    kissing isnt cheating  not even gonna comment on this cuck/roastie
  she admitted to kissing so likely it was worse than kissing
  hershel is that you
  if later you want to get her back you can still try that  thats really not how it works
robowaifus cant come soon enough womankind is doomed the age of information ruined any semblance of purity our forefathers told us they had
i have had recent reason to shave the problem is that even with an electric razor im petrified to cut myself i legitimately thought about dunking my balls in nair but i asked around and its a bad idea    any help is greatly appreciated
  dip your balls in nair
get a razor for womens legs has a lotion pad on both sides of the multiple blades slick just rinse it lots and you can use the razor for a month of upkeeping
  that sounds promising ty
  ive only shaved my balls once and its a long and painful process dont bother with it get a body hair trimmer with a guard and trim your pubes leave your balls alone
  use an electric razor for the main bush after you get all the long hair go into the bath tub and get the rest for the balls all you have to do is go slow and stretch the part of skin your shaving never had a problem
go slow even slower than when you shave your face i cut my balls once while shaving down there because i was an impatient fuck
dont use an electric razor use a fresh manual razor with shaving cream do it in a warm shower so your nuts are moderately saggy
dude i shave myself whole groin area with a dualedge disposable i dont save in one direction i go backandforth until its smooth i dont use shaving cream but sometimes ill use bar soap either i save the shaving cream for my face    despite all this i dont get cuts down there why its all about angle and keeping warm water on it as you clean up
saggy nuts always cut myself shaving dont shave them anymore does nair dipping work or will it fuck with my balls
  shaving yourself to look like a child    i dont get why people do this just trim a bit with some nail scissors and youre fucking good to go mate
use a gillette mach 3 no cream required any hairs you cant/wont/shouldnt shave rip out eg hair around/between buttocks  with time you get used to the ripping    i do this when i can the smoothness feels great afterward and lasts for a long time
dont shave you risk getting a wicked infection potentially flesh eating bacteria trim with electric trimmer and guide or scissors the kind with the curved blades work good for this unless the hairs on the shaft i have no clue how to handle that
  shave balls in shower trim the rest with a 1 no issues takes a little work but i dont cut myself i dont like to shave anywhere else cause it looks weird and i get razor bumps and risk ingrown hairs
anyone just really bored all the time how do i correct this seriously just always huffing and blowing air out of boredom i havent found anything yet thats really satisfying to do for more than a couple of days
practice gf keeps talking about marriage    how do i make it clear to her that im not interested
tfw you realize practice gf was the best you could get
  tell her
  make her a single mom
say im not interested next time the topic comes up
practice girlfriends are good if youre gaining experience with gaming women     but its also not the best idea because women want to get treated like beta orbiters
  break up
how do i make it clear to her that im not interested    reverse psychology demand total submission have her bring home other women for both of you make her rim your dog
tfw practice gf gives good sex but is incredibly toxic     what do anons
tfw when you dont have a practice gf let alone a real gf    why even live
  in a very similar situation anon it comes down to what youre looking for long term what youre getting out of the relationship and how long you think you can stand her before losing your mind or wasting too much of your time the most important thing to remember is not to catch feelings remember she is literally practice for a real girlfriend you can easily trick yourself into thinking shes the real deal by lack of goals or availability so do reality checks constantly and remind yourself youre worth more and that this is temporary  take my practice gf for example  non white  overly opinionated girl power type   hypocritical  know it all  tries to gaslight me  shes available though and im now graduating college soon so im in a transitional period in my life where i dont have the time or money to go out and seek better women atm its a matter of convenience she has a good job and always buys me shit free pussy as well so i balance the pros and cons of staying with her and the pros still outweigh the cons at this point no matter what though spending a lot of time around a woman in a romantic fashion is always good experience for down the road you learn a lot about female psychology and how to carry yourself around women what their weaknesses are what their strengths are what makes them tick etc so its still always a net positive if you look at it from a trial and error context i know im gonna get shit for posting this now from people saying either im an asshole or an idiot for wasting my time with someone who is toxic or someone that i dont see a future with but i thought i could share some stuff i learned with you since were in such similar situations
  fuck her anally and let her know shes not wife material
  it depends if you want to stay in the relationship and shes making little hints or jokes about it semi seriously just dont acknowledge anything she says about marriage if you even slightly try to play her games shes going to take it as an open invitation that youre interested in that sort of thing all women do this if youre done with her or shes actually making serious aggressive moves about marriage abandon ship asap
  taking eggman as a practice gf
  non white  m8 its only gaslighting if you arent actually a nutjob
how does one obtain a practice gf
how did you obtain this practice gf were you initiating or it was her
  why are you trying to be a sociopath
  im not trying to be a sociopath
  correct youre succeeding in being a sociopath
this triggers me how can people toy with others like this
  how do i make it clear to her that im not interested  you stop fucking her and break it off you manipulative asshole
practice girlfriend    do people really do this you do know not all women are literally the same and the things you learn are going to be pretty small in the long run plus youre looking at trouble in the future if your first gf isnt already gf material because you wont actually know how to be around a good girl
  t practice girl
    25yo guy whos been in relationships since 17 and has broken up with all but one of my partners
  thats not true maybe brainlets cant learn from experiences that are similar but women are not that different
  everybody broke up with all except their current partner fucking idiot amerimutt brainlet
  how many girls have you asked on date this year
  delet
  not him but 5  3 said no  2 said yes and established within the first ten minutes that we were just here as friends and then proceeded to ask for advice about other men
  its okay because women dont have feelings
  im just using you until something better comes along
  thats not really true practice girlfriends are just those girls you carry with you to be able to fuck regularly without effort like if you had a girlfriend but you dont care at all about but these women are still stuck in the 1950s so they dont know what a fuckbuddy is so you gotta fake an entire relationship just to get that pussy    it is exhausting man i wish women would just mature and be able to establish sexual relationships without needing a title i dont particularly enjoy lying to a woman making her think im her boyfriend but if that is the only way shell suck my dick then what am i supposed to do i am not being given any other alternatives this is especially true with those christian girls that have the tightest pussies i tell anything to those kinds of bitches as long as the end result is my cum down their throat
  i wish women would just mature and let me live out my teenage fantasy
  hey you can call it what you want the bottom line is i have no problem at all with lying and ill keep doing it until im too tired for this shit and then ill just get a wife im just saying that women could save themselves from a lot of emotional pain because trust me i have a sea of ghosted girls that i dated for 2 weeks that every now and then message me crying telling me they love me if they just played the game like im doing    or heres another tip for women dont fall in love with guys like me but well i know you cant help it
  ive actually run into the opposite problem i found a fuckbuddy but shes not interested in any serious romantic relationship i really want a romantic partner but im just going to enjoy this for what it is while i continue searching
  everything youve posted itt is bait i doubt youre above 18 and i doubt youve had a girlfriend you should talk to a therapist and figure out why you hate women it will make your life to so much better
  well thats normal a lot of people want romantic partners but they also need to jizz every now and then so that is another common use for practice girlfriends but well you got lucky and found one that doesnt need stupid titles so use that pussy as much as you want and be on the lookout for the partner you need
men once again proving they are subhuman
  local woman admits that even subhumans can trick her and other women taking advantage of them proving women are subsubhuman    the ride never ends
  ask out more or lower your standards
  well the main problem is that im looking for a spoilerdominant woman/spoiler and nearly all of them are poly which im not interested in pros which obviously arent looking for romance or incompatible on a personality level     im trying to use okcupid since thats one of the few dating apps that would let me know if a normal woman had those interests but pretty much every woman has declined to respond which has put me off and ive been using personal ads on spoilerreddit/spoiler but thats not going far either     i really need to grow some balls and message more women on okc but i overthink every message i send and its exhausting
  aw fuck me i thought spoilers worked on this board im retarded
  lower your standards  what would trying to date girls im not attracted to accomplish except making me feel even worse   im genuinely curious because thats an advice i see pop up a lot but i legit dont get what its supposed to mean
  im not even implying my standard are even that high theyre literally just    is not obese and i mean clinically obese i love chubby girls  is not disfigured    i dont care about her religion about her being a virgin or not about her past or future i just want someone who likes me
  tell her shes your practice gf shell never talk to you again
  islamic moral police death squads cannot come to america soon enough    dominant women who arent mentally ill dont exist anon youre neglecting a fine horse to look for unicorns  why not just ask your gf to act dominant in bed sometimes
  i dont have a gf i have a dominant play partner but shes not looking for a relationship     i might have to tolerate some mental illness then
  shes outlived her utility ghost
  asked out 5 women in a whole year  lmao you could knock that out in an afternoon get bent you fucking pussy
  i dont get why youre getting mad at me for not asking out as many women as you i mean good for you anon but i for one could not knock that one out in an afternoon because im not confident or active enough to meet new people on a regular basis those 5 women were literally the only single women i met all year that gave me their number/added me on facebook
  hope she turns into a psycho bitch and ruins your life
  this is literally whos the idiot the idiot or the one who has to be around him straight women are literally doomed
  these bitches love me too much to ever hurt me thats my insurance and if this wasnt the case someone would have murdered me a long time ago even when i completely fuck them over they end up apologizing because they just assume they were not good enough for me which is kinda true but it is not like i was judging them by any standards other than has a vagina and is hot enough for my dick      hey you should learn how to be inclusive lesbos have it even worse because lesbians are some of the most poisoned human beings in existence like ill ruin a girls life but i will have 0 ill intent while doing it i was just trying to get my dick wet and as i said i even wish i did not have to do it but lesbos are so vindictive and toxic they will absolutely ruin your life with 100 illintent
tell her anon you may not be able to have her anymore but its better than making her go through the relationship thinking shes gonna get the white dress and giant cake just to be left in the end
  dont have sex with her
  no its okay women are used to this kind of stuff i am pulling out this number out of my ass but if my experience with my relationships and those that exist around me is any indicator 999 percent of girlfriends are practice girlfriends this is why women get dumped like 10 times before finding a guy that will settle down with them and not treat them like shit    ill say it again man i dont know how it happened but feminism ended up serving men in the end back in the day the only way a man could manage to fuck hundreds of girls in their lifetime was only if they were a rapist rich or both most people just got married at 17 for their first love but now we are living in the male paradise where a man can get as much pussy as he wants and when he dumps the girl the girl has now been brainwashed to think she is a strong single woman that dont need no man so shell move on regardless of how badly we fuck them over every time we use them    feminism has been a blessing for my cock imagine wanting to fuck a girl then having her father tell me i need to marry her first ha
  not obese  so if you are in usa you want only top 20 of female population and you dont call this high standards
    youre pulling this entire post out of your ass along with the anal beads
itt incel larping as insensitive chad it looks a lot like those fembot/femanon here threads with a neckbeard role playing someone based on his own broken perception pathetic
how do you know if youre a practice gf
  say what you want if you want to actually learn something today learn how sexual relationships worked in the past no sex before marriage sounds like a meme today but this was an actual thing that people did back in the day you had to commit an entire legal agreement just to get your dick wet fuck that shit
  by breaking up  practice is over
practicing for a life of failed relationships  why
  well this is enlighting
why the fuck would someone have a practice girlfriend imagine if you were totally into a girl just for her to tell you after some months oh yea you are just my practice boyfriend i hope karma hits you hard if you just see her as an object and dont value her as a person then just fucking break up with her
  these men dont consider the women they have relationships with human
  there are only 3 ways to have consistent sex  1 picking up girls at bars and clubs every night this is very time consuming and going out every night is practically impossible once you have a full time job  2 getting a girlfriend this is the ideal way but any man who knows what he is worth is already limiting his true dating pool to about 1 of women the ones that are not shit this means that it will take a while for you to even meet one of them  3 jumping from practice girlfriend to practice girlfriend this is very efficient you can get a new practice girlfriend by just going out on saturday and then you can milk her for weeks or even an entire month and then go out the next saturday to get a new one this is like the clubbing strategy except that you keep the same girl for longer and thus you dont need to be constantly going out    i just laid out how the game works if you were a man you would also use strategy 3 dont lie
    lol people had sex there were no cameras to catch them and marriage wasnt for sex it was just what people do to guarantee their descendents and security as women had no income and the husband paid the parents for her in return that she takes cares of kids and her husbands aging parents    feminism gave women jobs so they could choose the life they wanted you act like sex and love isnt natural but some gift to men    at least learn real history not incelistory
  feminism gave women jobs so they could choose the life they wanted  thats true but you should be so hard on them everyone makes mistakes i would not expect feminists to only do good it is clear that whatever they gave me was at the cost of something else nothing is free after all but i dont mind it i can now get casual pussy 24/7 and the cost was that there are now women at the office using metoo as a weapon well dont worry about me as you will never catch me thirsty at the office trying to get a lawsuit i can get my fix of pussy anywhere i want
playing some videogames  person adds me to friends  sure okay  they never start a conversation or ask to play or anything  i have to be the one to do it then  theyre usually friendly and talkative for 10 minutes  then we dont as much as say hi until next time i start  this has been the last 10 people not one dude  what is wrong with me that makes me so unlikable
  same thing with me op  its why i dont bother anymore really the reality is probably both sides having this conversation with themselves but after a while you realize your efforts can also go unrecognized the internets just like that    more importantly dont let it get to you people are a dime a dozen on the internet
  i discussed it with a friend at one point they insisted that anon you gotta put in some effort yourself despite being told repeatedly that im the only one putting in any effort  its like im expected to create and maintain every friendship on my own
  most people exist to absorb your positive energy for their own entertainment or conservation of their own energy for what are on their own more decidedly important pursuits strong stable longlasting relationships are rare on the internet those types of relationships come from situations where there is a common suffering or malaise and you are rare enough to find someone you relate with on multiple important levels on the internet there is no need for this all the comfort is in front of you and so theres no need to try and communication on the internet already erases most of the meaning and expression of conversation to begin with starting a relationship up and hoping to hold that relationship out of charity like you described op misses out on the fundamental requirements of a good relationship and is just that charity youre free to do it but dont be surprised when youre left emptyhanded
  then i guess i can renounce the idea of friendships in my life  if i cant even meet one online these days when its already laughably worse to connect to someone in real life then it effectively doesnt exist anymore
  thats what they all say  me i say if they wanted it to work theyd make it work  the internet just isnt great for socializing and people who rely on it as such are usually not socially adjusted people anyway
i want to run away    where should i go
  far away as possible but cut off contact with everyone you know
cant give you any good info unless you tell me roughly where you are
disappear into the jungle or forest
i have the tendency to act like a devils advocate when interacting with people irl how can i stop this
  what advantage do you get out of it people might think youre very cynical and pessimistic just practice listening to other people and see what they do ask others if they like how you treat them
  i want people to validate my view points  yup i agree that may work
  theres nothing wrong with that it can make for good conversations just make it clear to yourself as well as others that its just an intellectual game and dont let it get personal
metoo  my dad also does this and i think its annoying as fuck cause he then looks at me to validate his joke  idk do it if you want to have an actual debate from all angles dont do it just to make a joke
ive been a gambling addict for many years i dont play much but probably gambled away 10k euros over the years im still a student so dont earn much money but im really depressed of losing so much and i cant stop i always try to win back my losses tried going to ga gamblers anonymous it didnt help anyone here thats been a gambler or still is that can give some help
how come girls on tinder never respond to my openers  i never say hey or anything along those lines  usually a corny opener about their bio or pictures  what do should i just stick to the generic hey or whats up
  your lines are boring or dumb anyway
  quantity over quality
  tinder on the womans side is a lot like window shopping  doesnt matter whats in the store if she doesnt really care about shopping out of the window you get me
  girls are tricky sometimes you get lucky just keep at it
im going on my first date tommorow    matched this cute girl on tinder we going for drinks tips kinda nervous
  shit man that aint no dame thats goddam drake
its lower than you think
  ive had sex before but yeah it was definitely lower than i thought
im a girl cis who is really into this guy i met online im really really into him but i dont know why  met a guy online  think nothing of it at first   dont really care about him   casual friends  over time get to know him  talk about more personal stuff  start liking his appearance and quirks  we start flirting and bantering  talking about romantic stuff and emotions  i really fall for him hard   tell him  no reaction   move on   2 years later  reach out  get mostly ignored  try to move on  literally cant  so what is special about him is being passionate and knowing a lot of stuff he is my type because i like nerdy guys but he is so allof and its obvious doesnt care about me so why do i still like him i tried dating other guys but could never even think of kissing them because i just missed that one guy who doesnt want me like i dislike him now because of how he treats me and started noticing his flaws and shit even when i look at his pics i see he is not that handsome i thought before but i still care so much about him what do  pic not realted
  im a girl cis  back to tumblr please
just gotta give it more time and find someone else who can capture your interests i was illogically into a guy before not as much as you even at the time knowing this was ridiculous didnt make the annoying feeling go away need to give him less of your head space
  im just saying that so guys know im not a tranny      i know time is the best medicine but honestly two years is so long and i have met so many interesting guys in the meantime i just want to speed this up you know
  mostly a sign of no interest
  i liked him as much when he acted interested
  theres no logical reason note that you did not care about him sexually at first but as a woman you expected him to eventually try to push things in that direction but he never did so subconsciously he was already a guy you could not get and this made you like him then you got feelings and tried pushing it but he still didnt want you which just makes you want him more etc etc    yeah basically women dont make sense and you know that there is no way you can get out of this cycle unless he tells you he likes you at which point you will stop liking him and can move on with your life but he seems to be pretty alpha so good luck with that
bump
bump
  just ask him out you autist
  but he is so aloof and its obvious doesnt care about me so why do i still like him  youre a woman alright
  i got rejected       your opinion doesnt matter to me
  then take it from  think of it this wayyou need to convince yourself that its some other reason you have these feelings and by seeing my name attached to what you dont want to hear you can safely dismiss that uncomfortable answer  youre welcome
  did you ever actually meet him in person
  no but we skyped
bump
  how old are you
be me femanon   have a close male friend whos now abroad  we grow a very strong bond over texting  hes depressed and has diagnosed bpd  both lonely  tells me how much i help him and trusts me only this much  i have a planed trip to his current country and will definetely visit him  anything romantic would be a big mistake but i would love to just fall asleep in his arms    should i break it to him that id like to snuggle together would that even be an okay thing to do
  bait   fuck off  sage
  r a p e
  should i break it to him that id like to snuggle together would that even be an okay thing to do  yea if it can makes you happy  be aware that its the first step on a slippery slope
  would the average guy even get the cuddling with either sexual or romantic following   itd make me happy but i value our bond as friends more and leading someone on is the last thing i want
  asking for a cuddle can make him think youre leading him on  just be clear with him
  if you dont want any romance are you fucking stupid do that with someone you like its impossible to be this close with the opposite sex without developing romantic feelings
slowly getting ghosted by friends  even the friend i considered my best friend doesnt even seem to be interested in being with me  friends ghosting me and my best friend are not related they dont even know each other    i just needed only one friend idk what happened  like somebody has spread some shit behind my back and i am getting isolated by everyone i considered a friend    i am just so fucking sick of this shit  go to the same college as my friends  they found new friends and still hang out with their old ones  tfw i am the only one who hasnt got any new friends and just lives in an illusion    i have tried getting friends in college but that hasnt worked out so well  how do i get rid of this lack of friends thats making me feel like everyone hates me
meditate
  maybe try being this ascended anon over here 
christ its simple    ask people questions  dont talk about yourself  help them in some way
  its exactly what i am doing
  maybe youre just a boring person anon like me
  help them more    when there is a girl nearby dont just try to impress her introduce your friend and without prompting tell her he is a really great guy  automatically he will always want you to be his wingman    you need to proactively improve their lives
how can i stop my extreme anger outburts ive been getting around 5 hours of sleep and i realize that it is mainly me being tired but ive had difficulty sleeping due to my medication im taking i work 50 hours a week on top of another part time job and going to college in person any advice would be greatly appreciated
bump
finale bump i guess
  ive had difficulty sleeping due to my medication  start taking zolpidem it works miracles
  is this something i could get over the counter
  prescription
  would this be hard to get i know some psychiatrists are funny about benzo
  every time you get angry turn around literally turn your back on it dont give in your better than this its almost over you can do it i believe in you
  its pretty commonly prescribed you shouldnt have a problem
  it usually only happens when i havent slept for a few days but i do try i really do thanks anon       great thanks again or appreciate your advice
am i insane if i dont like positive nor negative attention what does this say about me
  that you just want to be left alone
  it suggests you have low selfesteem and have troubling believing the good things people say about you the negative things still sting
i need help i want to become a fighter im gaining height muscle and working on wrestling and kickboxing i want to join tournaments but im a pussy for example when i get disappointed i want to cry when i get hurt and somebody gets concerned i want to cry when im seriously arguing i want to cry how to fix this its killing me
my workplace as sport groups is it a good idea to join it to meet men given how i am not good at sports and dont really exercise
  if you intend to start a legitimate diet and exercise routine sure
  i just dont know if i will be kicked out as i am too shitty at sports some of these guys are in the company sports teams

ive been struggling with the thought of dying one day and ceasing to exist recently  religion doesnt satisfy me since its basically gambling and do i really want to exist forever  ive been struggling with finding my purpose in life mainly because i feel like nothing will matter once im dead and as of right now i think nihilism is edgy  i just feel like ive been wasting my life up to this point but what purpose do i have to begin with i just no longer find enjoyment in anything at all since i feel like its a waste of time like i should be doing something else but what is it everything feels like a waste of time because once im dead it wont matter  i dont want to ever stop doing the things i like and the thought of my loved ones and myself ceasing to exist one day haunts me 24/7  both religious and atheist povs are welcome
  death is like an eternal dreamless sleep as described by people who have died and been revived thats kind of how i accept it living forever sounds like shit as well as existing in an afterlife for an eternity i used to go through intense moodswings involving existentialism until i eventually broke down in happy tears at an adequate answer    everything you do matters even if its for nothing it doesnt matter if you stop existing all that matters is that you were     
  living forever sounds like shit  huge cope
  living forever sounds like shit as well as existing in an afterlife for an eternity  why
    eternity scares me
i just finished my basics at my university so im wondering what degree should i study im interested in using computers but dont what degree time get should i do computer science computer systems information technology etc i want to mange computers really i can do programming but dont enjoy it

yes dumbass
  but shes ugly crazy and a total bitch no common interests stupid and so on
  wow you mean like 90 of the women ever just gotta do it man it flips a switch for sure
no why would you be with someone you dont like youre missing the entire point of relationships its not something you can grind experience for you wont get the same experience from a relationship with someone you dont like as you would from a relationship with someone you like theyre two completely different things     you want experience go out more talk to more people be open and honest try to surround yourself with people you like and let the girls you like know youre into them being with a person you dont like just to gain experience is the height of autism
  i dont even know how to kiss what to do on a date whens what ok nothing   wouldnt little practice help
    this dude is a incle trying to give you advice ive been around the block more than a few times knock this bitches boots if you fuck up its not like it matters or you can find out that youre a suck ass kisser meet a girl you like and have it not work out because you suck its in our nature to wanna bone get out there and do it

sup /adv/ how do i deal with my anxiety when i know im a loser and having no friends makes me a bigger loser  have annual office christmas parties coming up  always hate going to workplace socials alone  everyone else goes with a group  before an event literally see people going around to their friends and asking hey you coming  no one cares if i go or not  annual end of year lunch next week  need to go and sit at a table  ill have to ask a group of coworkers that are sitting together if i can sit with them  annual party next week  sit down dinner  most coworkers got together as a group and booked tables together  i will be assigned a random table possible even with coworkers  how do i deal with either of these situations when i always feel like an awkward lonely loser having to ask to sit at a table and being assigned to fill a table with a group    tbqh thinking of skipping both parties
i dont go to my office holiday parties i just schedule meetings with clients on those days and tell my boss they couldnt schedule any other day just come up with some reasonable excuse and skip
  i dont have client meetings often just thinking of saying im feeling sick tbqh
  youre trying too hard like way too fucking hard     your coworkers didnt pay for the table theyre entitled to nothing you sit wherever the fuck you want and eat your free food for putting up with everyones bullshit for another year were all full of bullshit and spew it on everyone else all year its part of being human so yeah youve put up with everyones bullshit for a whole year youre entitled to some shit believe it or not    get assigned a table eat your food and drink your drink talk if the conversation interests you if it doesnt just eat your free food thats fine you dont have to be social man you really dont every other human being is too self centered to notice believe me and if theyre not theyll probably approach you or at the minimum not be thinking random negative thoughts about you if no ones talking ask what people do or about their hobbies i personally enjoy hearing about what people are most passionate about in their lives helps me learn about the world but thats just me

  i get two dozen phone calls a day from indian call centers trying to scam me it makes me wonder how annoying you really think it is to have someone receive a whole bunch of phone calls its annoying but in the way the smell of burning leaves is annoying if you put your clothes in the hamper instead of washing them right away its nothing
  totally your personal army
  not your personal motherfucking god damn army
how can i tell the girl im dating that i have a dog without making her think im a beta bitch or a manchild    im really liking her and im pretty sure shes really liking me and i dont want to ruin this but if things do work out between us shes going to find out eventually so i want to get this embarassing problem out of the way now
  what the fuck how is having a dog a problem
worrying about if a girl likes you or not    already a betabitch manchild
  yes
  it isnt when youre a kid/teenager or starting your own family but a single guy with a dog thats pretty weird     especially since its a small dog since big pets arent allowed in my apartment complex if it were a large dog like a lab or a golden that might make things easier but a small dog shes probably not going to want to continue dating me
  cuck
  tell her youre taking care of the dog after your grandma died and if she asks why your parents dont do it you tell her your mom is allergic to dogs
    youre a beta bitch for hiding the dog from her and thinking its unmanly any other guy would not give a fuck
  fuck thats good thank you so much man
  what a fag
doesnt anyone know how long it takes for tinder to forget about you after you delete your account i stopped getting matches a while ago and now no matter how many times i delete my account and make a new one i dont get that newbie boost that i used to get
been dating this 8/10 girl for about a week  hear that she actually likes me a lot  catch feelings  why am i so retarded how do i stop it how do i not fuck up this time
  how is this a problem     why am i so retarded  male sexual instincts     how do i stop it  keep pursuing the relationship until you get rejected     how do i not fuck up this time  be yourself insofar as youre not retarded
how do i leave my small town if im on probation for being black and i have a curse from god making it impossible to leave/succeed and making my life a living hell in every way possible    live in cold shitty small town  literally in the middle of nowhere 7 hours away from the closest real city  2 hours even from a small town with one mall and nothing in it  have like 23 people in my town and theyre all crazy as fuck poor aggressive angry stupid   no jobs around just cleaning toilets and fast food and thats literally it  worst weather in the world literally 30 degree winters with 70 degree winds and the wind is constantly blowing at gale force  always dark snowing blizzards ice frost snow storms   literally everyone in my town is crazy as fuck like schizophrenic hearing voices in the psych center crazy  everyones poor addicted to drugs stupid typical white trash poor people just drama asking for favors liability helpless  have horrible health problems  unbearable anxiety cant sleep feel tired as fuck no matter how much i sleep always have bags under my eyes completely black pale as fuck zombie like   no way to leave because the government tries to trap you here and rape you for taxes and peasant labor   finally get enough money to leave after years of trying  god strikes me down in one swift blow and i get arrested and trapped here on probation  my probation sentence is long as fuck even tho i did a minor crime because im black    wtf do i do god and this shit world is just out to get me
  ask your towns sheriff this as often as you ask /adv/ i guarantee hell kick you out himself
  this
what was the crime
  is the curse from god that you commit fucking crimes your threads about this are routine comply with parole dont commit any more crimes and then afterwards go where you please
  jesus christ its a good post from you
  no its that everything bad always happens like dude i had my ruined over a small crime that wasnt even my fault its god and im going to just run and go to jail im not being the white mans bitch
  youve got to be a troll or something you are responsible for your crimes just comply with parole and then do whatever you want after how long is it
  id rather go to jail then sit in a frozen small town     im not being the white devils slave anyway
  military man  thats how im getting out  so long as you dint do a felony youre still ok  fucking michigan right
  no its a felony but being reduced but im fucked anyways my state treats low level misdemeanor crimes like other states treat high level repeat offender felonies
  also either way it doesnt matter one way or another god is going to find a way to trap me here with my curse it doesnt matter if its this itd just be something else    i need to just take my l and go to jail its the only way that god cant control it but im afraid knowing god ill end up with some fucked up punishment like he literally always finds a way to just trap me here i might just have to give up my license and have a warrant for my arrest for the rest of my life
ok so the people around you are schizophrenic yet you believe you can talk to a magic fairy named god you think this magic fairy can control reality ok so that means you think he controls all reality oh wait  you just broke your own rules because now you think there is a thing called the devil so therefore your god doesnt control all reality both the devil and god control reality  but not one of you stubborn schizos will ever admit that your claims are based on nothing and there are billions of different narcissists claiming everyone needs to be their slave while looking humble by saying god     maybe your problem is you are a blaming faggot who cant even find the right people to blame if every black person stopped rapping and playing sports and said we wont provide entertainment for the whites so they go through their shit job unless the system is made fair then change would happened instead black people prove over and over again to be just as greedy as whites and lebron james happily lets hundreds of africas starve so he can get a new car     you also committed a crime ok you knew full well you could get caught you got caught you look like a little bitch saying its the white devil i was on probation for literally nothing black judge wanted to further his career just like anyone else who consents to this system maybe something will change if you quit directing your hatred at useless fucking people and going it was the white man we would have already had world peace but every time people say lets change things you go um no lets not change things for whites lets change things for blacks dumb fucks thanks for singlehandedly building the police state for them too by always filling up prisons i live a horrible life but you have to be mentally retarded to be like lol armed robbery dude
  no i hate god and dont want anything to do with him but hes an evil monster who strikes me down and rips away my happiness    i know for a fact its god cursing me because everything that can go wrong does go wrong literally i had nothing to stop me from leaving and i got a bunch of money and all this shit happened and it was bad luck    and i have horrible awful coincidences around me all day every day and everything i dont want to happen happens and its always bad shit happening to me and every time i find happiness its just ripped away from my face a million miles away while god kicks the shit out of me and takes away everything and just keeps cursing me with disaster after disaster even tho i dont do anything bad     this is all god
  on probation for being black  stooooopppppppp
  you were saying that youd run two weeks ago with this same post whats wrong you still too pussy to do it you gotta try to be gangsta on the internet since you dont have other apes to spout of at you never say what you did just that youre black
if you had the balls to do something by now you would have     you dont really want any advice because everyone is going to tell you to not be a retard     blame your shitty public defender not god
  youre not being persecuted for being black youve made your own mistakes
how do i properly explain to my boyfriend that he doesnt last long enough to satisfy me
tell him you want more action
  by hurting his feelings
  bitch if you wanna keep nuttin in this pussy you better work harder cause if you dont ill call a plumber ya hear me nigga
  lmao
he cant really change that so i think youll just give him a complex break up and find a better cock to ride just tell him thats why lie anything else
  roastie pls
listen to this  
  thanks for the ragefuel roastie
just tell him what he needs to do to get you off try to tell him in a playfull manner what you want
  bluepill him literally
  kek
  why do you ask when you already know the answer  the cock carousell is endless ride it till youre used up and ugly then find a sucker to raise your kids
  thats like the easiest thing to fix dumb baitposter
tell him to pick up a habit of masturbating at least 4 times a day by that time his meat pole will be so numb hell fuck you for 4 hours straight
  i had this issue with my ex i loved him to death but he was so bad in bed his dick was below average and pretty thin but the worst part was thet he would cum after three of four thrusts i was lucky if he lasted 3 minutes i wrote him a letter explaining that the quality of our sex life puts a strain on me and i cant do it anymore he refused to use any toys to help me climax and his pussy eating skills were abhorrent so i told you to either change his mind and improve or i will leave him he packed his bags and left two days later never heard from him since sometimes i feel guilty about giving him that letter but we have been together for almost five years and he made me orgasm maybe a dozen times i couldnt go on like this
  jesus dont feel guilty perhaps the only thing you should feel guilty about is not doing it sooner desu i cant imagine how thatd feel for you i can give my gf cervical and vaginal orgasms and found her gspot so anytime i want to it happens for her multiple times/interchangeably you lot get super greedy once you find someone who can actually do the things you need staying with someone whos only made you cum 12 times in 5 years is basically a friend i cant imagine how sexually frustrating it must be as a girl to not be able to cum the best unless someone or something else helps you out in the exact way you like with no compromise male orgasms are simple
  you can try but men do not respond well to anything that may disparage their sexual prowess or your desire youre a whore or a bitch or both and the one with the problem youre either frigid bipolar on the rag or a wanton sexual deviant go ahead and try but hell tell ya
  refusing to satisfy your partner is grounds for a breakup especially 5 years of it you were a saint
  you lot get super greedy once you find someone who can actually do the things you need  t larping
  youre a fucking whore
  t anon who sucks at sex
  sex is an important part of relationships like it or not
  just use a vibrator after sex like most women ya dummy  you can ask him to help if you want
  t incel
  you should leave him a woman that still thinks that her pleasure matters at all is not ready for a married life and should just keep hoeing around stop having relationships you are fooling men who think they have found someone special
  your fragile ego is sickening and it explains where you probably are in life      you arent lasting long enough to satisfy me should do it    but consider that he can probably go twice but you just huff and puff once the first time is over and if he gets sore from going more than once it may be that hes circumcised or something  try lube and theres more to sex than simple penis in vagina and conclusion so it is your responsibility to assert your desires and sex more than that its supposed to be a fun thing hello take some responsibility for your half    and yeah if 4 mins is too short or something and you want him to push for 8 or even 15 its worth mentioning
  i wrote him a letter explaining that the quality of our sex life puts a strain on me and i cant do it anymore  what the fuck did you try having a normal conversation before doing something so stupid
  your fragile ego is sickening and it explains where you probably are in life  what ego kek i know your longest lasting relationship was 2 days but when you finally finish high school youll find that sexual dynamics are a bit different when you are not a useless piece of shit every night i come back home from work my wife is there waiting to make me cum it is clear to both of us that sex is completely for my pleasure this is not something i discussed or forced her to do this is just the natural state of affairs she just fell into her role as a woman and provides her services she is happy just getting dicked by me every night regardless of if that night i last 15 minutes or 2 hours and every now and then texts me about how much she craves my cock the only thing that can properly satisfy such a nice woman like herself     if you are still a hoe because trust me i dated a few hoes myself that to get pleasure needs her man to follow some kind of retarded standards then please dont worry at all this is a free country and a whore has the constitutional right to be a whore you can decide to finally become a useful member of society whenever you want or just die hoeing
ignore incels    tell him you want to try something new and set the pace next time you have sex    go as slow as you want ride him how you want guide him tell him where to touch and where to play    when it feels good tell him how good hes making you feel  positive reinforcement is the best way to help someone improve    tell him to warn you before he cums so you can slow down and keep him lasting   make sure after you cum to please him then tell how great it felt going slower and being able to cum with him hell enjoy you having fun and will feel good
  not op i mistook you for an incel of some kind sorry maybe you are just a /b/tard or muslim    youve got a point there but i dont see what wanting more than 4 minutes of whambamthankyou is whorish
  excellent bait
  pretty good job telling op how to have fun just keep in mind 30 of women have clits too small to cum without a jackhammer and probably 60 cant cum from penetration
  holy shit kid calm down
  why would i tell a woman how to please a woman    you have to be 18 to post here retard
  i dont see what wanting more than 4 minutes of whambamthankyou is whorish  ill say it again then any woman that has sex for her own pleasure is a whore simple as that and this has a scientific explanation i know that in this day and age biology does not exist but i hope you dont mind discussing fiction with me biologically men and women are not the same the reason men need to have sex every day sometimes multiple times a day is because everyday men produce 300 million sperm cells also every ejaculation contains 100 million sperm cells that means that every day we have enough sperm to properly impregnate 3 women any men here wondering why they typically masturbate 3 times a day every time our balls fill up with that next batch of 100 million babies or brain starts the chemical dance again and we now need to fuck again this is normal and a biological reality    women on the other hand produce only one baby cell per month one per month biologically women need to have sex at most once per month this is their biology this is also why women only get biologically horny once per month but of course a woman does not typically only have sex once a month if a woman has a man she has to take care of those 3 baby loads if a woman does not have a man and still fucks around she is a whore plain and simple in other words women craving sex is an anomaly a disgusting perversion op is a whore sex is for the mans pleasure read biological relief
this whole thread is finished with one word foreplay
  foreplay for men is i have to give him head
  positive reinforcement is the best way to help someone improve  if hes a faggot yes    how about you be honest for even a minute or are women incapable of that
  so fucking mad jesus  cry harder incel
  no foreplay for you then sex after for him this isnt really a problem
why dont women ever tell you whats up directly    i invited a girl out she said she was busy but would love to some other time    i ask again and she gives the same excuse which can def be true    then i invite her to a party with dozens of other people and i hear from other people that she is telling everyone i am harassing her    bitch if you arent interested just fucking say so you are ruining my reputation    can a fem anon explain why the fuck you do this
  pay it no mind m8 some girls are just fucking dumb but not all of them unless she starts outright making shit up and exaggerating the situation nobody with a brain will give a fuck what shes saying about you  he harassed me  really what did he do  he asked me out a few times  if some girl told you that story would you give a fuck would you think wow that guy sounds like a creep no youd think she was being dumb and most other people will have the same reaction youre lucky youre not dating her or she would just bring more dumb shit into your life cut your losses and move on
  that she is telling everyone i am harassing her  how did you meet this girl
  i work with her
  why dont women ever tell you whats up directly  i think the more pressing issue is why you didnt get the message yeah it would be wonderful if we lived in a world where everyone was open and honest and unafraid to say what was on their mind but thats a fucking fantasy op so let it go how about instead of putting the responsibility on everyone else to spoon feed you you just stop trying to pursue people who obviously dont want anything to do with you we can talk about how terrible other people are all day long but it doesnt do anything to address the fact that theyre always going to exist either learn to deal with it or do nothing and keep bitching about it on a scandinavian hackey sack forum your choice
  woman detected    are we to assume that if a woman is busy twice in a row she obviously isnt interested
theres some truth to this    if a man really likes a woman hell put in the extra work to get to know her and unravel the mystery     the problem is many women take this too far and just become impossible cunts to get to know     this habit dies pretty hard by 27 when single women start getting desperate for a husband
  not op but you must either be a woman or a virgin or maybe both she gave him convincing excuses so he decided to believe her and try again if he gave up right away one might assume that hes easily insulted or gives up too soon or something plus the guy just asked a girl out three times calm your fucking pants down    you seem to be clueless about the fact that asking a lot of girls out a lot of times is the only way an average looking guy can score my best friend basically followed his current gf of 5 years for 2 months until they ended up together
  actually thats pretty much what the rest of us do
  yes youre supposed to assume that people dont like being honest and you have to learn that it doesnt matter what you say what matters is your actions and the girls actions are her flaking on a date
   reason 1 generally we dont want to be outright rude or mean if we tell someone that were busy it is a polite way of putting things off until youve lost interest   reason 2 being straightforward doesnt always work some men will persist even after theyve explicitly been told no and that never leads anywhere good     you are ruining my reputation     omfg really your reputation lol
  a woman saying that a man is harrassing her often has serious consequences for the man
   yeah which is why men shouldnt harass them
  thats why you dont harrass women or even men just keep to yourself youve got your own stuff to worry about
  are we to assume that if a woman is busy twice in a row she obviously isnt interested  youre to assume that regardless of the reason she doesnt have time for you it doesnt matter if shes busy because shes lying or shes busy because shes a cia assassin and cant blow her cover she cant/wont make the time to a nonautist this is more than sufficient enough information to make a choice       the guy just asked a girl out three times calm your fucking pants down  again a nonautist would of said something like listen im very interested in taking you out sometime but you seem busy so whenever you find time in your schedule you should get a hold of me and ill take you out for drinks after the second failed attempt and just left it at that there are many logical adult ways to handle this kind of situation that dont involve doing the same thing over and over again despite the fact that your approach isnt working based everyone who disagrees with me is a woman post aside this is just basic common sense     you seem to be clueless about the fact that asking a lot of girls out a lot of times is the only way an average looking guy can score  fucking kek please tell me youre joking
    no one is being harassed retards op asked a girl out she made a rain check thats it
  some men will persist even after theyve explicitly been told no and that never leads anywhere good      saying it just wouldnt work out  would be a lot better than telling him im too busy some next time     you should be honored by your humiliation
  why cant women into real talk
  why cant you into social cues
women who talked back or spoke up historically got killed by angry men or shunned and starved by angry women theyre not wired for direct communication    women are wired to be indirect and give off subtle emotional cues about things its annoying but its how they evolved
  social cues
  women act like children theyll use the patriarchy as an excuse to be cunts to men     just take this as a lesson that most women are indecisive and spoiled if she was really interested in you shell stop being too busy and make time for you on the spot ive dealt with this shit and ive hit rock bottom over 1 girl dont do the same find a woman thatll want you too
  putting a lot of quotation marks around the phrase doesnt somehow invalidate it
  name one 1 social cue
  asking a girl out more than once is akin to being hitler didnt you know
  men are more direct than women its not cues women are just cunts
  yes it does look  quotation marks  see
  women do tell you things directly you just have to know what to look for    anytime a girl turns down your date without offering another time when shes free you should drop her 99 of the time idk why the fuck you would ask her two more times when she clearly wasnt interested the first time
  people on the whole arent very good
  thank you not enough guys understand this women will never play hard to get if they want you badly enough sure she might toss out the odd shit test for interest but she will not duck and ghost you and shit if she wants you to fuck her    they just dont verbalize it to maintain their selfperception of smv women only get direct with others when theyre scared of losing mental  emotional control in a situation
  last girl i dated was getting harder and harder to schedule things with i could see the writing on the wall and i figured she wouldnt come out and say it openly so on our last date i tried to subtly steer the conversation to a way she could back out without losing face hinting that it was too far for her she was too busy stuff like that but she doubled down and said she hadnt been blowing me off she was just tired that day etc so i thought gee maybe i was wrong but of course she flaked the next time i liked her a loti admire her stillbut never contacted her or tried to see her again    i have to say her inability to be frank really sucked i know there are reasons girls dont give straight nos but she knew me well enough that i didnt deserve to be treated like a potential stalker
  as a man i feel that generally when girls dont take the time to try and hang out with you thats a cue every guy should hint that shes not interested/ doesnt want to waste her time with you/ doesnt want to deal with you if there was no chance for rescheduling or getting back to you about it she doesnt care the thing i know with girls is that generally when this happens i just cut them off and ghost them out honestly theres millions of girls out there yea theres hot ones to but a lot of them know what they want and you should know what you want and if you both dont want the same thing than itll never work some girls come back around and do end up wanting to talk/ date/ hang out but ultimately it comes down to    1 the connection/ vibe you have with the girl when you guys started talking    2 whether she has an interest and likes you    3 her understanding that your not just wasting your time trying to catch tail on her all day that your busy with your life you got stuff going on she knows where she stands when it comes to spending time with you    honestly most girls dont like the overwhelming communication like when theres some distance and understand that your doing what you got to do and she also gots things to do but just as girls got social cues so do guys so its not just a girl thing because i know ive ghosted out girls and stopped talking to some after theyve tried communicating a month forward usually at this point im moved on and they get the hint to leave you alone
older guyyounger girls do thatit really is sort of form of cowardice in my opiniondont have enough guts to face situations directlybut then again men are always bigger and many women do get beaten  older women not that way at all  after living with men for years   and raising kids will almost always  tell men what is really on their  minds
  totally agree woman who are older are more willing to speak out what they feel for someone they would expect to understand them most 25 and under girls still play the game and social cues
  shut the fuck up    i hate you you are part of the problem no ones saying you need to spoonfeed anyone anything but if op is telling the truth and you still want to say this im gonna tell you to fuck off    i invited a girl out and she said she would love to some other time    no shut the fuck up i feel this anons pain if i ask you out i am saying this    hello femanon i like you and want to get to know you better    you have 2 options here    1 agree because you are also interested or think you might be if you are busy   2 say no you are not interested polietly decline and say youre only interested in being friends    its called being a human being fuck off it sucks yeah and ive had to do it before too but the other person usually understands and ive become friends with these women afterwards whether it was me or them that was interested its not hard anon it might be uncomfortable but we all have to do uncomfortable things sometimes
girl thats dodged dates with me before recommends a mexican restraunt  say my friends are all busy and i dont want to go by myself because id feel weird mostly just to see whatd she say  said shed go with me if she was in town    girls dont usually say this stuff if they dont mean it right this girl has straight agreed to a date to my face before and blew me off does she just want attention     when i asked her in the past i didnt exactly have my shit together or even drive so i accept she might be interested now but she could just be crazy
  perhaps she had a reason that if she outright stated it she was worried that it would offend or upset you some people make up vacuous excuses as an alternative to giving someone an answer they might find insulting most people dont like confronting others and just want an easy life by saying she was busy she is avoiding going out with you but without the worrying and challenging problems of having to explain to you why
  why dont women ever tell you whats up directly  its just the way they are when theyre dealing with people they dont care about the behavior is rude but soon as you pick up on it you should just start expressing a lack of care towards her    for your situation ill admit she was atypically shitty but honestly you couldve avoided this by just being a bit more inquisitive i mean you let her have you walk twice with broad excuses first time around you shouldve asked her if not then when is another time shes free to hang which shell probably feed you some oh i dont know that you can suss out is bullshit then you start laughingpoke fun at how she needs to get her life together and go off to find a more enjoyable person    really as a guy you really just cannot be taking general excuses like that thats one of the main ways a lot of girls try to be loose with their relations and you either gotta show that you arent some fuccboi who has 4 years to wait on her or you just take it and of course i think finessing it and displaying your tact is better for your mental health
in your specific case op its because shes keeping her options open she now knows you are needy and she probably feels in control as a result you can still continue to text her though i know a guy who got blown off 5 times then got the girl after she broke up     in general women are not straight forward like men are because they value emotions over rationality and they are brought up to believe that some forms of manipulation is the way to survive in the hyenaesque social setting we have created  they essentially try to limit the amount of damage they can do to their image and part of that means never outright telling the guy the truth he needs or usually the one he wants to hear men on the other hand value honesty more out of a rational desire to move on if they have to young men in particular have clear strategies when it comes to women and part of implementing them requires blackwhite answers to their questions when life and people in general are full of grey areas
  yes unless she suggests an alternative date/time herself even if she is genuinely just busy being busy twice in a row and making zero effort to reschedule or make time for you is indicative of her level of interest its not harassment to try again but youre honestly just wasting your time
  bitch  she sized you up correctly and knew it would be difficult holding you at bay once you locked your sights on her were in a damned if we do and damn if we dont tread lightly and not anger hoping they go away or get distracted by another unfortunate girl or be blunt and get trashed or hit right away thing is ill take being called a bitch to being punched any day
  the behavior is rude  i tell you whats rude constantly harassing me for a date
  asking a woman out and being told next time is harrassment      then women like you wonder why so many men hate women when women like you literally can not be fucking honest
  asking a woman out a second time when she said next time id harrassment    fuck off back to tumblr you dumb cunt
  starting a sentence with bitch isnt at all like calling someone a bitch its a simple colloquialism like starting a sentence with man or christ its just an expression of often comedic frustration
  dog if a girl you work with ever declines an invitation to anything even once just move on
just start going to alot of partys and then make really many rumors about her
  female niggers everyone
  yikes bad idea
  ive just been getting into dating and it absolutely pains me to have women acting like 14 year old girls    like i can understand even being 18 getting cold feet before a date and unmatching because you lack the maturity/dont want to deal with negative emotions related to why you changed your mind but when fucking thirty year old women do it were both adults just fucking tell me dont just leave me wondering what the fuck just happened like that
  based pajeet
  the problem is many women take this too far and just become impossible cunts to get to know  you got that right
  some men will persist even after theyve explicitly been told no  and how does telling them you are interested but that you are busy help
  because i cant read your mind  because whats a social que to you is literally just a lie you expect me to call bullshit on
  just expect the worse and hope for the best with the way women are brought up since gen x its not like young males dont have a serious entitlement problem too
  theyre perfectly capable of real talk but theyre also able to detect gigantic spergs and are terrified that theyll be rapemurdered if they upset their fragile egos
  terrified that theyll be rapemurdered if they upset their fragile ego  a very real possibility no fooling
  i call women bitch all the time in annoyance even my girlfriend its like saying nigga

why the fuck dont girls buttholes smell  i have now eaten two different girls asses and neither one had any smell or taste at all what the fuck  its not like they were freshly showered either the first one was in the morning before her shower and the second one was in the evening so im assuming she hadnt showered since that morning and i could smell/taste both of their pussies    explain yourselves ladies
my gf had a double mastectomy  therefore she doesnt have boobs   she doesnt feel like a woman anymore she says she cannot satisfy me anymore which is not true  she dresses as a boy because of this  any tips on how to deal with this particular situation
what even are girls
  reconstructive surgery and/or lots of patience and reassurance
  boobjob will give her tits again but im a dude
  expensive sex toys
  did they know butt stuff was on the table
  what even are girls  2d representations of maleconstructed companionship im convinced they are solely visualized abstractions as i have never interacted with a verified gynoid over the course of my daily activities in the past 20 heliocycles save for my waifu whom i met in episode 7 of a certain japanimation
whats the best way to show off that i have money for the purpose of attracting women that isnt too on the nose and ostentatious i finally have a good portion few mil after many years of work am now wondering how best to use it im also trying not to get gold diggers just average women who will now see past my face
since i was a wee little penis i dream of marrying a princess because of disney  disney princesses are my childhood dream why cant anyone respect this _
  they probably use wet wipes people are more open to anal play nowadays so many girls make sure to stay clean down there just in case    im a dude and i use baby wipes myself because my girl likes to like my ass during a blowjob sometimes
  lick
reposting  since other thread is dying    so i met a girl on the old internet a week ago and we went out to see a movie on tues and then went to a diner for a few hours after had a really good time with them and shared a lot of interests from what i could tell they had a great time time too during the film they wanted my arm around them and i obliged it was great in the car we kissed a bit dropping them off they said they definitely wanted to see me in a few days and kissed goodnight    now its well not tuesday and we havent made more plans they take a while to return texts now and weve only had like 15 since    so what am i doing wrong am i doing something wrong i really want to see this person again they said they were busy today going to practice music at a friends should i suggest plans for a day or two or wait i dont know also if this matters the person is trans and im a cis male hopefully they arent reading this or be understanding if they are 
dear girl  do you fart and poop like humans
  if talking to low tier poor girl trash if you need to show its probably here   mention making a big purchase i got this 700 dollar sofa and had to return it i didnt like it   mention you being able to make purchases without caring about the price paying for a drink without looking at the machine makes you look confident with money    if you are dating a economically good or neutral girl   mention job   mention plans to take a long vacation away from work  mention thinking about long term investments
pretty sure this thread has no girls    bump
  youre being clingy as fuck people have lives and arent available to hang out 7 days a week leave it a few days then try and set something up for friday or the weekend
  but the one that i rimmed in the morning couldnt have done that for like 12 hours beforehand    not really i didnt tell either one and we hadnt done butt stuff before
ok so i went out with coworkers and exchanged numbers  ive literally never had friends since 5th grade what do i do now
  get involved in a hobby that puts you around a lot of people its like work without the working because people will talk to you eventually right and then you say youre right mr anon sir
opinions from either gender  men make a lot of really weird assumptions based on the size of your dick what if anything do girls assume about guys based on dick size  i know theres a few common stereotypes small guys are overcompensating big guys are lazy in bed etc but how common are they in practice
  i work full time and am in school i dont have much free time for new hobbies let alone my current ones
  maybe you should scrap a hobby if its not progressing you i really should open a few more threads
  if youre with a woman who is coming up with horoscopes for your penis shes seen far far too many of them and you should bail
  big guys are lazy in bed  this ones actually true though
  me plump  gf still like me    how
  i have a question about assholes is that an asshole question
1 men what assumptions do you make about women who dress well like a step above malltier if any  2 for everyone how much do you think is acceptable to pay for for example a nice sweater and a pair of jeans    personally i wont spend more than 100 on a single item of clothing or more than 200 on a pair of shoes i pretty much only wear boots but whatever and i mostly wait and watch for anything more than 40 that i like to go on sale before buying
  what assumptions do you make about women who dress well   i dont notice it at all  unless you have obviously ripped clothes jewel studdings or dress like a prostitute fuck yoga pants it doesnt even register just wear something practical and cheap
  
  1 men what assumptions do you make about women who dress well like a step above malltier if any  i dont know how womens clothing is priced or what the tiers are if she looks nice she looks nice if she looks trashy or uptight she looks trashy or uptight thats all there is too it
  1  2  2honestly not everything is the same price i think as long as you can facilitate the amount to pay then you shouldnt worry as long as youre not out there whos gonna bother worrying
  if she really dresses up shes probably not too compatible for me im a casual guy who would go more for the yoga pants and tshirt girl than the one wearing fancy clothes but it varies by guys some are the opposite
  yo /fa/shonista here  1 i dont mind that much as long as you have propper clothes for your size and clean   2 i usually spend 50 but i dont mind spending 150 for a nice suit that i can use a lot
  1 i wouldnt be able to tell a designer dress from a kmart dress its the same for how a lot of women might not know make/ model of car and how many cylinders they have just looking the fit and her not being fat are way more important  2 idk i only buy stuff on clearance or sale so like fifty max for jeans and like fourty to fifty for the dress shoes i wear to work  3 you didnt ask but this is bonus those dresses with the belt just below the boobs that used to be in are really unflattering and for every time a woman has ever gone in public wearing one at least one guy has wondered when she was due
  how do a be normal and not clingy
  lol yes
how do i know if theres something between me and the girl thats nice to everyone any subtle hints i can look out for
  the fast way is to ask her for drinks    otherwise you are just another guy
  shes a bit shy i think drinks out the gate like that would be a little too forward
  do you know what she is into maybe i can suggest a thing for you to do
friday and saturday  bowl of oatmeal about 300 calories  hard boiled egg 70 cal  box of cheezits 1050 cal  fat ass cookie 500 cal  can of juice 120 cal  today  bowl of oatmeal 300 cal  total 2340 calories or 780/day    my daily caloric needs are about 1300 convince me not to go to the convenience store across the street and do another binge like i did on friday and finished up the leftovers on saturday im skinnyfat and disgusting i need to lose weight
  you mean like in guys no and weve never really talked about hobbies yet
  convince me not to go to the convenience store across the street  youre skinnyfat and disgusting and you need to lose weight
  i would suggest you to have something healthy and fulfilling available to eat  i like oatmeal   loosing weight is also psychological if you force yourself to eat healthy stuff that you dont like it wont work  try to remove the fucking big cookie and the cheezits and you will be done      wow literally hitler      try to get that info if not invite her for coffee
  yeah tonight i asked her if she was walking home alone which in hindsight is a tad creepy and she said shes walking with a girl so i said id see her tomorrow then and wished her goodnight    its a bit creepish but fuck it a guys gotta be slightly creepy initially to get anything done
  no man thats borderline psycho  sorry for the other day i was tired do you mind sharing a drink
how do you jump back into dating     im 26 and havent been on a real date or been with anyone since college ive been super career focused since graduation but now that ive got my foot in the door i think i can start dating again     any advice for jumping back in how forth coming should i be hey i might be terrible in bed bc its been 2 years since i last had sex sounds ultra depressing but its the truth
guys    fresh off a breakup  fool around and set up a profile on okc  see work crush im too shy to really talk to irl on double take  mfw    what the fuck do i do i want to be cool and like his shit but hes going to fucking know that i did it hes going to see me at work after i do that shit what do
  well it didnt come out of nowhere we were talking about how we both walk home and since it was after midnight i asked not entirely weird i would think
girls ever been hit on or approached by a store employee
    this eating ass was the most disappointing experience of my life it just doesnt seem like at all   why dont women have stinky butts
ive never had this problem before but this girl on tinder seemed really into me she wanted to add me on fb but i told her it was deactivated for college finals it has been and she said oh thats a red flag and then unmatched me is it really that big of a red flag
  it sounds worse than it is out of context that could be someone trying game tinder to take advantage of women     the dating app experience is already somewhat dicey for women and if some guy has no profile than what does she have to go off of for who you are deactivating your profile is nbd just a case of bad timing turn you profile back on after finals or be prepared to provide some other social to back up that your not some psyco
  skinnyfat  need to lose weight  no you need to gain muscle start lifting and get 
  you dodged a bullet she sounds like a nutter with unrealistic standards
  ive really enjoyed not having fb so i will probably keep it that way ive been on tinder for like 7 months and only a handful have asked for fb the rest is just snapchat/text      i think so too i cant put my finger on it but she seemed like something was a bit off even before all of that
    rright dont leave me hanging at this critical moment
  yes i was buying a mattress recently and the guy who was helping me made a couple jokes that seemed pretty flirty
  i wouldnt normally say this but youre right    i caved a little and had a bag of microwaved steamed broccoli 100 calories total i like it and oatmeal but simpl replacing unhealthy or healthy doesnt preclude me from binging i dont really know how to not do that
i recently bought a vintage tigger crew neck pic related for best gal friend for christmas its the same one she had as a kid and she told me a story on how it was her favorite but it got ruined by a ant infestation anywho i was wondering if its wierd to give her the shirt as a gift were quite close but never done gifts shes also in a relationship
how to avoid getting clingy whenever i fall for someone i get bad i want to text her constantly i keep looking at her twitter to see what tweets she likes i keep looking at her snap score to see if shes snapping other people i havent looked at her twitter today and im going to avoid doing that again     i think about her all day i dont even like her that much this is weird and unhealthy and i hate it
  i really fucking hate fast fashion any girl in a fast fashion dress i just assume youre trash i dont care that much about someone elses choice in clothes bargain basement thrift store upmarket whatever but fast fashion really grinds my gears it looks like ass in both design and quality and its destroying the planet  that said if someone pays a lot for clothes i think they should know what theyre paying for and have enough passion about good design to justify the expense otherwise they just look like a brandbewitched chump i can respect someone paying top dollar for a fair trade silk blouse but paying the same price for some 2 shit made by an indian child yeah nah
  you already bought it no turning back now
  i wouldnt sweat it
would you date your female boss assuming it wasnt against any code of conduct
  no id date a female exboss maybe
  i might start dating one but at the point it becomes serious one of us would have to either get a new job or change departments
  wtf kind of job is that not against code of conduct ive had interoffice relationships before but there is a reason why that shit is looked down on
can women feel love for men in the same way that men love women    it seems to me that the men in womens lives even if theyve been together for many years are only wanted until their usefulness runs out whether thats because they lose their ability to provide or something else
  a womans love is unique because it is tied to dependency a man loves a woman for entirely abstract reasons while a woman loves a man for convenience
  depends on how confident i am the relationship would progress smoothly for longer than i will be working at that place
    what if it was kept casual or downplayed and not mentioned at work wpuld either of those make it better    work at a specialist clinic i dont want to say too much since there arent that many in the field technically im not his boss but im responsible for him and he reports to me    its a long term sort of job everyone heres been working here forever and id expect thats his goal too
do guys enjoy getting their balls licked i like doing it but im not sure if thats unusual
  thot
  i wouldnt stay in a casual relationship long term but as long as its casual id be ok with it downplaying it and not mentioning it at work are just simple courtesy i would expect no matter what
  like it but it can be surprising when someone just goes for it without warning
  theres plenty of women who love men who are useless deadbeats who are in prison
  can women feel love for men in the same way that men love women  i dont know im not a mind reader    it seems to me that the men in womens lives even if theyve been together for many years are only wanted until their usefulness runs out whether thats because they lose their ability to provide or something else  im sorry youve had so many shitty experiences but what youve described is not the norm
  fuck off hitler
  surprising like how does it hurt or is it an unpleasant feeling
  its nice but i wouldnt really ask or expect a girl to do it honestly a woman enjoying doing something during sex is always a plus i hate feeling like sex is just my job
  doesnt feel like anything in particular and its not pleasurable stopping to play with my balls only gets me further away from finishing so i hope you have the extra time on your hands
  its hard to describe to someone who doesnt have balls it kind of hurts/tingles/feel good all at once
  surprising like unexpected as long as shes not squeezing them or biting them it doesnt hurt
  get over her
im a big simpsons fan would it be lame to put in the job section tomacco farmer
  makes sense thanks
  on tinder profile
  my boyfriend practically insists on it if i neglect them too much hell often reach down and handle them himself
  are you unemployed because thats what the assumption will be
  it really tickles but can be pleasant dont suck on them though because if you do it even slightly too hard its really painful
ladies    how often do you want to have sex with your partners     is it a retarded idea to ask you out at the gym
  dont suck on them handle like eggs its a nice extra to a bj but by itself its sort of dumb
      the jokes on you guys i dont feel this way because of shitty experiences with a relationship but because im a based and blackpilled incel
  yeah i try to just gently lick them
  i crack eggs and scramble them up for breakfast
what would make you say yes to a one night stand with a stranger
  how often do you want to have sex with your partners  once a day usually sometimes with a dry day between if something is messing too much with my day stress etc makes it tough when im not dating anyone    is it a retarded idea to ask you out at the gym  as long as you do it afterwards and not during training i dont see the issue
  probably nothing     you might be asking the wrong place though
  deepthroat and lick the balls at the same time sis
how do i find a gf that wont try to kill me in my sleep
  id like to have sex 34 times a week
  can women feel love for men in the same way that men love women  of course usually seems to be a lot worse too and women are generally the least likely gender to fully get over someone genetics and all that men are not supposed to be with one women their entire life women biologically doesnt have that issue   it seems to me that the men in womens lives even if theyve been together for many years are only wanted until their usefulness runs out whether thats because they lose their ability to provide or something else  who hurt you because this seems like a youproblem and not something that generally happens
where can i find a pure virgin bf
since this is a balls thread now can a guy explain what getting hit in the balls feels like no one has ever managed to explain it well to me
  there is no feeling like getting kicked in the balls women were born to endure pregnancy and childbirth balls were not made to be kicked
went out to a bar yesterday  not a single woman in sight  ive been lied to
  like your balls have folded in on themselves very sensational
  like getting hit in the funny bone but painful enough to make you want to puke and it doesnt need to be a hard hit
girls    what makes you think a guy is a creep
im officially done with chasing women no more thinking with my dick and doing everything with the sole purpose of impressing someone or getting laid   from now on im going to focus on myself instead of other people     any other guys try this ive made way to many poor decisions in the past just to get pussy
meet guy  he seems all over me and goes to great lengths to interact with me  a bit difficult for me since i have 0 experience with this sort of thing and dont even have friends the usual stay at home and away from the public as much as possible  start to hang out with him more but spends a lot of time with a lot of different friends including girls  asked me yesterday if i never make plans with my friends since i always have time whenever he wants to schedule anything with me   i dont have friends   i avoided the question by saying i prioritize him which seemed to make him happy enough to not bother following up on it but i feel like im in a strange position i dont have friends like nobody i dont even have a family to talk to     so i guess my question is guys if you met a girl you liked and went out of your way to spend time with would it be a dealbreaker if i literally had no one else in my life at all what concerns would you have and what could i do to alleviate some of those concerns
  he acts creepy
  pic  perhaps a bit much given the state of sexual freedom i can deal with 1 or 2 previous partners     much more and eh itll start to be a bit sketchy
  have you ever hit your knee in just the right spot for it to get that particular kind of pain that isnt like how it feels anywhere else take that feeling and put it in your pussy
  specify anything
  for me at least i think a lack of friends is less of a problem than if i felt a girl had no ambitions of her own i dont want your entire life and personality to hang around me you dig
  not necessarily a dealbreaker but id want to know why sometimes women who are like that have a bad/psycho past theyre trying to hide    what could i do to alleviate some of those concerns  you really dont have anybody else not even like an old church couple who invite you over now and then nobody from work or school no siblings in your city
  nerve pain like that doesnt make me feel like puking though  so just a tap and youre fucked then how come it conveniently doesnt hurt during sex when its going everywhere
  asking inappropriate questions inb4 whats an inappropriate question staring being unable to tell when someone is uncomfortable and continuing with their behaviour anyway etc
  im a guy who has dated a girl who was kind of in your situation had 1 best friend irl the rest were internet friends in that particular relationship there was no real red flags that werent obvious from the start she was introverted shy and into nerdy things but i knew that going in we ended up not working out but that was for other reasons that arose during the relationship
  he slithers on the ground
girls if a guy was trying to you were dating a year ago tried to get back in contact with you would you prefer him to call and try organise a date or to slide into your dms first and build a rapport again before organising a date
  our scrotum is very elastic and malleable so them flying around a bit isnt so bad when something is hitting the two testicles themselves is when it gets uncomfortable
  sounds like a good plan speaking of   literally what makes guys creepy and undesirable when you act like you are chasing someone with your dick you come off as someone who cares very little about the person you are interacting with and just want a pussy to smash     speaking as a femanon its much better to just act interested and talk a lot with girls who catch your interest rather than waste a lot of time specifically on them time spent on improving yourself is time spent on girls for the most part if you work out get yourself a positive attitude and mentality smile and generally are relaxing to be around youll be a lot more interesting to the average girl
  when you spend your life with a ballsack hanging between your legs you learn how to keep pressure off it like a wounded leg or a bruised finger the scrote provides enough cushion to keep indirect taps etc from hurting but any direct hit will make you want to curl up right away even sitting down wrong or having your undies in the wrong place can hurt like fuck if you slip up
im really shy even online interactions give me anxiety if i like a girl and told her but never asked her out and she could possibly like me would she    await until i asked  bask me out instead  cgive up and move on with her life
  ships sailed son
why do girls ghost instead of just telling you straight up they dont want to go out again or arent into you just be upfront instead of making me think that i might have a chance only to block me i get it if youre not interested whatever but just say it
she told me she loves me and i told her i like her too and that im really glad i met her did i fuck up this was not in person and we are dating
  if a guy was trying to date me and wasnt successful hes not going to have much better luck a year later
  not femanon but 1 frankness is socially awkward not a valid reason but its true and 2 they worry about saying no triggering stalkerish tendencies    sucks to be the guy in that case if youre not one of those weirdos but thats the reality
do periods suck so much just because your cramps are that damn painful or are there other reasons
  because people are cowardly and ashamed remember that it is as hard to reject someone as it is to admit love emotions are hard and relationships are harder
  many guys loudly and/or violently freak out at rejections girls dont know if youre one of them theyre taking precautions
      i get it it hurts but i mean if she thinks im interested and she isnt and feels uncomfortable being straight forward i get it either way its happened pretty much every time ive gone out with a girl so i think its officially time to throw in the towel
    nah it dont be like that  ill explain   we had an extremely casual relationship   would go on a cute date once a week/fortnight  huge amount of hot sex after date  best sex of my life  barely talk for a week  id give her a call and wed organise something  repeat date  repeat hot sex  i went traveling to america/canada whilst she went to japan  we barely spoke at home so when we went our seperate ways we just dropped communication    we are both home now and i really want the hot fugg    not to mention its hard to find a chick as hot as her who doesnt become a stage 5 clinger after a few dates its literally the perfect set up for me as i dont have time for a full time gf
  it depends some people can have extremely painful cramps i used to get pretty bad ones but its gotten better nowadays the part that bugs me the most is it can be inconvenient having to go to the bathroom more frequently and the blood can be messy and stain my clothes
  the blood can be messy and stain my clothes  hot
  i dont know what to tell you other than keep trying and maybe youll find a girl you click with even if you thought you clicked with the girl she might just be trying to be polite or she might not be looking for something beyond friends or whatever and sensed you wanted something more i dont know but you gotta keep at it if you really want somebody you cant just give up even after 10 or a 100 failures because every girl is different
  so its things hitting it that hurts not it hitting things    that sounds awful im glad i can at least tell when im gonna be hurting
    cramps bloating and sore tits all contribute towards physical doscomfort sometimes the cramps are just a constant lower abdomen/back pain that doesnt stop so its pretty horrid theres also an element of constant worry that the bleeding is too heavy and will bleed through tampons/pads hormones also affect mood so the annoyance is sort of doubled so its a pretty overall experience
  an nba player who went 0/10 from the 3 pointer wouldnt keep taking 3 pointers
  bumping for friend
  because theres no need for girls to learn how to let someone down gracefully guys have to learn how to ask someone out or theyll never get laid girls dont want anything from a guy theyre rejecting and most times will never have to deal with them again once its done so their only goal is to remove themselves from the situation with as little conflict as possible engaging only increases risk of said conflict rejecting someone will likely lead to either feeling bad if theyre a nice person or feeling scared if theyre a psycho so theres really no benefit to doing it  ts not very nice but thats just the reality
  what indications do you have that she possibly likes me
  not true every girl is a variation on the same theme they dont have individual preferences as far as attractiveness goes if youre not in the top 10 of men then 99 of women will think youre ugly and the only way to avoid getting hurt is to stop listening to your dick and avoid women
  rejecting someone will likely lead to either feeling bad if theyre a nice person  if its actually a nice person giving a straight answer is kinder the psycho excuse is valid but this one isnt
  theyre not excuses theyre just reasons im not defending or condemning the behaviour just explaining it no amount of moral arguing will change the fact that its more beneficial to girls to just ghost and that ghosting is therefore more likely to be the goto tactic of most girls  hurting a nice persons feelings feels bad therefore girls are less likely to face rejecting a nice person it may hurt the nice person more in the long run but they dont have to witness that hurt so it may as well not exist also its not a given whether youre dealing with a nice person or a psycho until met with their reaction
  nice excuses enjoy your loneliness
theres this girl i matched on coffee meets bagel shes nice and shares alot of the same interests as me she isnt really attractive looking though i would probably rate her around a 4 im not too good looking either /soc/ usually rates me a 5    shes asking to meet up for a coffee i dont really get the chance to talk to girls much now that ive graduated college is it worth meeting up with her even if i really dont have any intention to actually date her
  she might wait a while and then give up girls dont initiate
  so if i have a solid job where i work the usual 40 hours a week thats fine i am working as a developer so i do have some kind of ambitions more or less       but id want to know why  social anxiety mostly id prefer not to make that too obvious so far he is surprisingly easy to be around for me which is a rather unique situation for me     anybody  no its a bit strange i know but work was looking for an independant developer to send requests to but i work from home for the most part so i dont even have any coworkers i interact much with i avoid people for the most part because i cant take being social for extended periods or too often im really hoping this might work because its the first time ive felt comfortable being around another human being     family cut me off because they think im insane because i see a psychiatrist so they are afraid of being near me telling them its just because of social anxiety had done nothing to change that nor has my psychiatrist reaching out to them helped they fell for the mental issues all inevitably end in a psycho scenario meme      she was introverted shy and into nerdy things but i knew that going in  im pretty sure those things are why he is interested in me so thats a good start i suppose
  im not defending or condemning the behaviour just explaining it  fair enough  also its not a given whether youre dealing with a nice person or a psycho until met with their reaction  no shit thats why i said the psycho excuse is valid
  do you have anything better to do shes probably a lovely person
  do you have anything better to do  honestly not really i just recently started trying online dating i wouldnt mind meeting with her but should i tell her off the bat that im not looking for anything serious i also dont want to make her feel bad i feel like im using her to practice talking with girls i dont mind being friends though
how do i tell when a fake girl is being real
  some people were meant to die alone its just a fact of life
  what the fuck are you on about
  because some guys thinks they have a chance no matter how you reject them so theyll either go rage mode stalk or spread lies about you and harass you on social media either directly or to friends     it might only be the insane 10 but no one wants to play russian roulette like that
  no shit thats why i said the psycho excuse is valid  oh i get you now i thought you meant they should somehow only ghost the psychos and be up front with everyone else my bad
  typical incel shit
  every girl is a variation on the same theme they dont have individual preferences  wew the incels are getting more stupid by the day arent they
      i say this because men generally have a much wider range variance in what they find attractive youll meet guys who prefer black girls guys who prefer tall girls guys who prefer chubby girls etc for girls however pretty much all of them want a specific type which is tall slender white guys call me an incel all you want but thats just a fact women dont have individual preferences when it comes to dating and if you dont fit those characteristics you shouldnt be participating in the dating game
  true girls have the same issue if you dont devote 50 of your free time to look like a goddess and have good genes you might as well adopt double digit amount of cats because thats the only beings you can legally force to live together with you
  thats not even true i see disgusting women who dont take care of their bodies whatsoever dating perfectly normal looking dudes its not even a challenge for them they go on tinder and still get an endless list of men same as any other woman
  i say this because men generally have a much wider range variance in what they find attractive  for girls however pretty much all of them want a specific type  this is completely incorrect theres a very clear image of the typical attractive woman no one can agree what a typically attractive man is men can agree like incels who cant get over not being a chad but plenty of women arent interested in chad and youre too selfinvolved and unempathetic towards women to ever understand that    
  if you actually talked to women youd knew that its not like this  the only difference between men and women is that generally women are attracted to details while men are attracted to the full package      if you dont devote 50 of your free time to look like a goddess and have good genes  wrong
  for girls however pretty much all of them want a specific type which is tall slender white guys  not remotely close to my preferences i prefer a guy my height who keeps himself fit same as myself so just putting in some effort a few days a week is fine and asians  white guys    i just generally prefer the more feminine looking guys so thats probably why the cute asians do more for me than the usual white guys    call me an incel all you want but thats just a fact   citation needed  if this is hard fact it should be easy to find a solid verifiable source surprisingly google isnt giving me any information to support this fact
  this desu
    wrong  i apologize i thought i made it obvious it was a sarcastic joke but i guess i didnt go far enough
  theres a very clear image of the typical attractive woman no one can agree what a typically attractive man is  except for george clooney thats like the female gay test if he doesnt get your engines running you cant possibly be straight
i am one of those girls that is embarrassingly attentive with the guy i like i always text back right away and basically wait around for him to reply etc im a neet so i usually dont have much to do sometimes he disappears for 2448 hours and then texts me like nothing happened i never complain about it yesterday for the first time in months i was busy all day and couldnt reply right away when he texted me today hes sulky because he says i ignored him    why is it ok for him to not reply to me for a day or two but when i do it to him hes getting an attitude
  why is it ok for him to not reply to me for a day or two but when i do it to him hes getting an attitude  because he is entitled
  sounds like hes an asshole i think he got use to you needing him when you didnt respond right away his ego probably got hurt
be me 24yo virgin  kiss whats about to be my gf my first kiss  closed lips kiss lasts 2 seconds   she turns around to leave  i tell her something sweet  she turns around and hugs me  repeat the closed lips kiss    i choked and i didnt hold her face or open my mouth slightly/interlock with her lips how bad did i mess up
  its about expectations youve set up the expectation that youre always available so it seems strange when youre not hes set up the expectation that he might take a day or two to respond so its not unusual when that happens  basically hes gotten a bit spoiled when he texts you hes used to getting a response right away and was confused when he didnt its all well and good for him to be sulky in the moment when he didnt know why you werent responding but once youve made contact and explained he should get over it pretty soon and hes just being a brat if he doesnt
  doesnt matter if its unusual anyone has their kinks me personally not a fan because it makes me feel uneasy and it tickles like crazy
  its good that he noticed my absence though right it means he missed me honestly ive thought for a long time that if i stopped texting him he wouldnt even care or notice but apparently he did
  incels instantly shut up  amazing im saving that link for next time
  i choked and i didnt hold her face or open my mouth slightly/interlock with her lips how bad did i mess up  not bad at all
  interesting links      this study indicates that penis size is also relevant outcomes showed the bigger the better   females documented the most appealing penis size was even bigger than the researchers tested surpassing the penis size of 98 of italian males
  ok but a woman cant see your dick when she first meets you so that has literally nothing to do with why you cant get a date in the first place
  thankfully dick appeal matters very little in getting a girl and most girls dont care enough about your size if you arent a selfish asshole in bed
  women like proportionality  this is the only interesting thing in this article and its not really an obscure fact        these
  yeah probably accentuate the positive
  females documented the most appealing penis size was even bigger than the researchers tested  well appeal means pretty little in this regard     if i look at a dick yeah bigger is more impressive and it looks better but thats literally all it is looks it doesnt feel all that different and has a pretty low impact on sex     its like rating how appealing your ears are sure you might find that a certain type of ear is vastly more appealing but unless he is capable of using them it doesnt really matter how appealing they are
  wait why
  why are you so determined to be miserable
  cute i would call that a pretty great first kiss
  you dont have to hold her face or interlock the lips to kiss her  theres a lot of different way of kissing
    seconding   first impression appeal doesnt mean much no ones marrying a guy based on a 3 second glimpse of his dick
  because ive tried changing for the better too many times but it never worked ill stick to the familiar instead
  the study also noted that larger penises are ideal but were much more attractive on taller men than shorter men to put it bluntly if you are short and pearshaped a large penis is not going to increase your attractiveness dr mautz said  so basically you are most attractive while naked if you arent a disproportionate abomination    what an absolute shocker i never would have guessed so happy we have science to clear up these mysteries for us
    wow you just made me feel 10 times better about myself today anons thank you
  so happy we have science to clear up these mysteries for us  yes some studies are really important and useful
  no problem anon  carry on and enjoy life with a significant other
  someone paid people to figure out which countries prefer cats over dogs   governmental science programs were a mistake
  first impression appeal doesnt mean much   its actually worse because its not a first impression you already know if you like the guy when you get naked how big his dick is wont matter at that point     ive ridden the dick carousel and trust me when i say you wont notice the big difference baring the outliers and in those cases ive found that the guys are usually selfaware enough to deal with it ive had 2 guys with stupidly small dicks one still managed to make sex pleasurable the other couldnt but made up for it with the best cunnilingus ive ever had     then i have had the one guy who straight up couldnt have sex with me properly because he was too big and he just went super depressive and ruined it by basically crying over it i managed to somewhat salvage it but it was far more difficult     i have come to know that it literally doesnt matter how good at sex someone is or how big they are i can easily fix any inexperience a guy has and size practically means nothing unless you are literally in the 2 of the smallest dicks in the world a massive dick is only fun to look at and suck off so it is definitely more appealing but not to the point where i would ever factor it into choosing someone i have already made my decision before we even get to sex
my workplace as sport groups is it a good idea to join it to meet men given how i am not good at sports and dont really exercise a lot of these members are very good at sports and are members of the companys sports teams
i really like this guy but im not sure if he likes me i feel like im always the one texting him first always the one asking him to hang out etc i tried talking to him about it and he got upset and said if he didnt want to see me he would tell me to fuck off but if he really does like me and want to see me why does he always wait for me to ask him out first
  sounds like a good way to start getting good at sports and exercising     go for it
  because he is worried about being annoying by texting you first
  give her some breathing room this will improve your chances
  he did recently tell me he feels like hes a pointless annoying loser that people  dont really want to be around and just tolerate but i love him i dont feel that way at all i want to spend as much time with him as possible i just wish he would make the first move sometimes and make me feel like he wants to be with me too
  id give it a shot maybe youll be surprised i wouldnt give it more than one or two dates if you dont wind up feeling it though
would you turn down a nsa blowjob from a fat female friend if you knew nobody would ever find out about it be honest
  yes
  im really infatuated with this girl but she has a boyfriend but her boyfriend literally raped several people in his past and shes aware of that fact are they both just crazy and i should steer clear how do i get her out of my mind why would she stay with him knowing that she otherwise has a very strong and sensible moral compass
  i have a big dick but i cum pretty fast during penetration however i am very horny and enjoy sex so i tend to not let the girl focus too much on me or it wont be enjoyable for me for example the other night i went down on a girl for an hour and probably only actually penetrated her for 5 minutes felt bad actually but she seemed to really enjoy it overall
  depends if she had a pretty face or not
have a thing for a female friend i know she doesnt feel the same way thinking of avoiding her for a while get it out of my system think its worth saying anything before i drop off the map or just keep it to myself biased towards the latter
  dont say anything
  i think you should say something shell be really hurt otherwise i did this to a male friend i had feelings for and really regret it now it affected him worse than i realized it would worst part is i later found out that he actually had feelings for me too
  how do you know did she tell you
  shell be really hurt otherwise  on the flipside i feel like it would make everything weird if i just popped back up once i got over it if i said anything to her     worst part is i later found out that he actually had feelings for me too  im sure it sucked but i know thats not the situation here
  among other things she was never physically flirty and never expressed interest when we were both single shes stressed many times how im like a brother to her which im fairly confident is her way of defining our boundaries
  i mean you dont have to be totally honest and say its because youre in love with her but dont just leave without saying anything at all thats just cruel
  if hes still single you could apologize and date and get together unless you that much of an asshole to him
  among other things she was never physically flirty and never expressed interest when we were both single     means nothing i was never physically flirty with the guy i liked and from bus pov i never expressed interest or made it clear either    shes stressed many times how im like a brother to her which im fairly confident is her way of defining our boundaries    even if she feels that way now it doesnt mean it cant change also im guilty of saying things like that to a guy i actually liked id call him bro say youre my friend and i love you youre like a brother to me all bc i was terrified of them not reciprocating my feelings and ruining the friendship but in the end nothing ventured nothing gained youll never be able to have a normal friendship with this girl if your feelings are true theyll most likely come back as soon as you start talking to her again    i think you should be honest even if she does only think of you as a friend right now if you tell her you have feelings for her before you leave it will give her time to miss you and also think of you and consider you in a new light
  his not bus lol
  hes not single     he told me he still has feelings for me too but i told him i dont want him to dump his gf for me i think its bad karma i think if that relationship is meant to end it should end on its own time i dont want any potential relationship between us to start with that kind of negative energy
  also im guilty of saying things like that to a guy i actually liked id call him bro say youre my friend and i love you youre like a brother to me all bc i was terrified of them not reciprocating my feelings and ruining the friendship but in the end nothing ventured nothing gained  did you try making a move with this guy
  i dont find chubby or fat women attractive so id turn it down
  no i waited so long trying to work up my courage to make a move that he ended up finding a girlfriend in the meantime was totally heartbroken and avoided him for almost 2 years in a feeble attempt to get over him thought i was but the feelings came back as soon as we started talking again
  you never get over some people sadly
  yeah this time i was honest and basically told him i love him and that if things ever dont work out between him and his girlfriend i hope hell give me a chance
  yes most girls are shit at giving head to the point where it actually matters how much i like you as to whether id bother
      reading your other reply sounds like this is more your own insecurity and neediness talking than anything im not saying its unwarranted on your part but if youre dealing with someone who has explicitly told you has severe selfimage issues youre going to have to be cognizant of the fact that he barely has enough of his own shit together to deal with himself let alone you thats the reality of the situation limits up to you if you want to be in it or not and if you can maintain a healthy mindset knowing that youre not going to be able to get all the things you want since hes just currently not capable of stretching himself much more as it stands      i have turned down multiple nsa blowjobs im okay with casual sex but thats a bit too casual for my tastes
  when you started talking to him again or are you talking about another guy
  same guy i told him after we started talking again
  youre going to have to be cognizant of the fact that he barely has enough of his own shit together to deal with himself let alone you    this really helped me put things in perspective thank you anon im going to try to be more patient and understanding
  depends if i liked her and was attracted to her at all same goes for a thin chick im not automatically attracted to a girl just because shes skinny
this guy claims to be in love with me and is always asking me out and telling me how beautiful he thinks i am etc this has been going on for years but im fat and if 4chan has taught me anything its that its impossible for men to love and be attracted to overweight women so whats his game
  thats 100 the case with online dating but i doubt its also the same in real life
    any online dating statistics will show you any male that isnt white shouldnt even bother
  any online dating statistics will show you any male that isnt white shouldnt even bother  still no proof id you have these statistics why not post them    also  online dating  ahh yes the only place where anybody could possibly meet where else the real world not in 2018 thats for sure
  no proofsjpg when its a google away  jeez also read the entire post you smug prick
if a guy is always offering to carry my stuff for me including my purse does he probably like me or is he just being nice
  can you share any more details about your relationship
  i did dont backpeddle on us here you started bringing this up you look for it for us
  1/2
how do i know if my dick is too skinny
  all compiled
  wont even state response rate for the rest   full of pointless information that is completely irrelevant as well as nitpicked twitter posts   good job anon you sure showed a good source there     how about a link to a proper source instead of a handpicked selection of shit that fits your narrative maybe youll learn something while you look for it
  at worst about 10 difference   still close in most cases some even have other races do better   no point even trying   you must live in a strange world when you can literally compile evidence that defies your belief and still miss it i dont know if that makes you insanely stupid or if that is just willful ignorance on a godtier level     either way good job provided proof to demolish your own claim
drunk texting your ex nothing bad just a decent conversation isnt inherently bad is it
  stop listening to 4chan
  its impossible for men to love and be attracted to overweight women  lol no there are plenty of fat/chubby chasers besides maybe he sees something more than fat physique which can be ultimately fixed
  weve been friends for a while but recently have started hanging out a lot more often one on one we go out for lunch or dinner or well go for a walk together and it feels like he goes out of his way to be a gentleman holding my hand to guide me carrying my bag and my jacket putting down his jacket for me to sit on so ill be more comfortable or offering to let me wear it always walking so that hes in between me and any traffic etc he also calls me sweetheart and darling and stuff like that i dont get that kind of treatment from any of my other male friends
  if a guy is always offering to carry my stuff for me including my purse does he probably like me or is he just being nice  if a guy is doing obvious nice things to me does he like me  the female mind everyone
  this lol this poor guy to think its all 4chans fault he keeps getting rejected
  well i know he likes me as a friend im just wondering if it could possibly be more than that
  to be fair this is 4chan it probably isnt representative of the general population     i was not sure if a guy liked me after he specifically asked me for a blowjob you have to remember the kind of people youll get asking questions here
  for the guys  the guy i crush on is substantially bigger/taller than i even the girls i see him with are bigger/taller its weird any bf i had before was not nearly as big as this guy im around 5 and 100 lbs but this guy a ball player 6 4 and 230 lbs according to the football roster so my question is do guys this big ever like someone when there is such a size difference i mean this guy is huge compared to me and its not fat huge hes just a big man
  dunno its a preference thing some guys like height difference and some dont
  what about the weight thing hes over twice my weight even im intimidated a bit by it
  girl i went from having no luck with guys to suddenly have a lot more attention simply by acting small and insecure and in need of male help     a guy literally twice your size would be easy to hook simply because of how easily you can stroke his masculinity and make him feel like a protector if you like him go for it i am pretty sure it would be easy to make him feel great with someone like you
  eh im a girl but i have never seen the appeal in guys like that id prefer a guy who didnt seem like he could accidentially break me in half if he was careless for just a few seconds     i knew this one guy who i did pretty well with but was always afraid of being physical with me because he was really strong we never got anywhere because we were both afraid of me getting hurt somehow     didnt help i saw him accidentially tear a door off its frame because it was stuck its one of those things you see and then never can unsee i kept imagining that being me having my arms torn off during sex
girls    how can a guy quickly know if a girl he just started dating has a lot of experience in hook ups
how do i learn to text not girls but everyone i am fine in person but i cant hold text conversations
girl always implying she wants to see me when can i see you i didnt get to see you today i missed you etc  ask her to hang out  has a reason she cant  every time    whats this girls angle why am i being fucked with
  shes not serious about seeing you she just likes the attention    ive had girls do this shit to me too
  i see its probably cause im pretty much the only dude that talks to her here what a waste of time meh
  like getting hit in the cervix
  
  start giving her 1 word answers or just ignore her i hate girls like this     im getting mad just thinking about it so many fucking women have done this to me fuck
  ive started only texting her if she initiates im too numb to this stuff to get mad its just whatever to me now
  dont let her use you
is it even possible for me to have a relationship at this point how can i form any sort of connection with a woman when weve lived such different lives    im 25 and ive never had a girlfriend ive slept with two women a total of three times    compare that to the average 25 year old girl in the uk who unless shes been in relationships and actually stayed loyal she has been fucking a new guy every weekend or more since at least age 18 if not earlier    it doesnt bother me that much if theyre experienced but you just cannot expect loyalty from a woman whos annihilated her ability to pair bond like that
  youre an emotional tampon to her
how bad of a turn off is it to girls when i still manage to cry on a daily basis
  i feel the same way i dont care if a girl has had a few boyfriends over the years but i really dont want to date a girl who got into the whole hook up culture    in your case to be fair if a girl has had 2 hook ups you should be ok with that since you did the same
  im not sure what that tweet is implying i mean i can literally read what it says but all those retweets her photo all those retweets and most of all her being a woman make me think if this was meant as gotcha joke against men who prefer pure women as marriage material as a virgin man i think her tweet sounds like a reasonable thing assuming that she herself is a virgin
is it too soon to be exchanging i love yous on the 3rd date    also if a guy tells you he loves you for the first time during sex does it really count
  its implying that if women become impure after sleeping around so do men
  yes    no
  it wouldnt be a problem to me at all because im the same way but i would like to know the reason for it im a loner because of autism and my personality is just that way so if its anything along the line of avoidant personality mild autism or anxiety disorder its no problem to me
  how do women react to their bfs if they pop a random boner
  invited to a birthday party at a restaurant today  mostly girls gonna be there  max 3 guys are invited including me but dont know if they are going      should i go to this party
  if my gf and i are alone she will usually start to play with it in her hands
so i met a girl a couple weeks ago well we didnt meet weve known each other for a while but i got her number and started hanging out i told her im content right now as i want to focus on myself and cant afford to date i thought this would turn her off enough to leave me alone but she wants to hang out like every day even if its just for a few minutes     anyways i think were settling into being friends which is cool with me but shes been clinging to me she texts me every day in the morning throughout the day and late at night and if im going to do something she wants to ride with me which i dont mind sometimes but im generally a loner and dont always want the pressure of having to feed entertain someone how can i reduce contact to normal levels without seeming like im blowing her off im interested in getting to know her and i do like hanging out but as im not a teenager anymore im just not up for running around every day with anyone
  this has been going on for years    if someone has been doing this for years i think its safe to assume hes in it for real during all that time he has most likely learned to like you as a person and that will override physical faults just go for it
why do women hand out their real numbers to guys they dont like and then text back i know you shouldnt assume anything else but professionalism if you get the number for school or work project but i got a number in casual situation which had nothing to do with work it wouldnt be such a big deal but i overheard her talk to her friends about me and how im a creep for texting her my messages didnt even include anything sexual and she always messaged back so i dont know what she found creepy or why she would even text back to my supposed creepy messages
  how do i get over the anxiety and stress i have about my partner putting other things in her vagina instead of my dick i have to ignore the thought of all the previous people shes been with but even dildos and fingers trigger me does it actually make that much of a difference to women or am i just crazy
  why do women hand out their real numbers to guys they dont like and then text back  because creepy guys back off once they get number
  i understand that but i thought i was in the clear because she gave it so casually after i asked wouldnt it make more sense to just say no or even give fake number texting me back seems like the complete opposite of rejection so how the hell was i supposed to know im starting to think shes not a very nice person
  you cant    if she has she knows how to hide it if she hasnt she has nothing to hide
  compare that to the average 25 year old girl in the uk who unless shes been in relationships and actually stayed loyal she has been fucking a new guy every weekend or more since at least age 18 if not earlier  what where do you get this from     i dont know anyone in the uk who has slept with 20 people and you are claiming the average 25 year old girl has had almost 400 different partners     i know like 20 girls ive spoken to about these sorts of things and a few of them brag about having had 20ish partners total with a threesome thrown in once 400 sounds crazy
  yeah shes a bitch and has the emotional maturity of a teenager i would lose her number and not give it anymore thought is this something that happens to you often
    meh my point still stands me and the average woman my age have had such different lives theres no way we could possible relate and shes always just going to have her eye on the next branch to swing to anyway none of them are ever loyal when presented with a better option
  sure chances are you are invited either because someone likes you and wants you there or because someone is trying to hook you up with a friend     that or you have become the gay friend
is it ok to date a girl who was promiscuous in her past i was never slept outside of relationships is it ok to date someone who did it seems strange
  none of them are ever loyal when presented with a better option  well from my point of view you already left 2 behind why wouldnt i be number 3     seriously though i dont know what to tell you im a virgin and id maybe be fine with someone with a partner or two behind him but i know how you feel worse from my side actually because guys are much more prone to go for sex just because they want to lose their virginity so virgin guys are a gamble or so im told i would be very surprised if you couldnt find a girl with 2 or 3 partners just like yourself that should be fine match and it doesnt seem that unreasonable from what i hear your 50 partners sounds like tinder whores not remotely close to the average girl    just avoid tinder and stuff thats probably not the platform you are looking for
  is it ok to date someone who did  stupid question of course it is okay     whether you are okay with it is another question but thats up to you if it bothers you dont
  this is the second time but first the time felt more like an honest misunderstanding i asked girls number she gave it to me and after while turned out she didnt realize i was into her it was still very strange but i believed her and we both ended up laughing about it this time though the girl had to know i was into her considering the context how i asked it
  i barley talk to them or do some stuff with them i will go and see how it gonna be i will post results
  ok well then let me rephrase it is it smart or dumb to do this
  good luck anon
  still a stupid question     is it still ongoing how much has she changed how promiscuous are we talking how easily do you get triggered and hurt     its smart if you dont care its dumb if you do there is honestly not much more to it unless she is still whoring it up and are only now going to stop just for you hint she wont    all it comes down to what you want in the end
  so you think its ok if your gf used to hook up with tinder guys before you met    is it possible for a girl to value sex even after shes had ons on tinder
    how on earth do i meet someone then i have no idea how outside of tinder all the women in work are taken i dont like clubbing and i live in a small town
  from a femanon but ive had the same happen  a friend invites me to a birthday party of a friend of hers  not fond of parties but goes along anyway  she gets sick doesnt tell me  i show up at the party   literally 8 guys and no girls other than me  panic and run around confused for most of the night hiding in the bathroom for large portions of it   had nothing but humiliating interactions with the guys there who mostly acted like i wasnt there or acted like i was a guy and constantly made sexual remarks not involving me but jesus christ guys can be really crude when they try to be  turns out the one fucking guy who never even introduced himself to me had a crush on me and this was supposed to be a way to introduce me   never again had i been less of a spagetthi monster this might have been fun but im not
  so you think its ok if your gf used to hook up with tinder guys before you met  im a girl but no i wouldnt be fine with a guy having hooked up that much especially on tinder of all places     but im a virgin my opinion on this doesnt matter what matters is what you think about this yourself   is it possible for a girl to value sex even after shes had ons on tinder  is it for a guy    same answer you tell me
  how do you initiate sex  do you just ask the girl if she wants to have sex now or set it like an appointment
why do people like dry humor so much i thought thing of it until recently when i started being social and people always laugh at my jokes not to brag im genuinely curious is it just the people i hang around with or is this everywhere  i was asked if i can pop peoples backs like chiropractic i say do they need to be alive and they laughed  i thought dry humor was too dark and emotionless for real life    see above ive only recently become social  for me it was work my hobbies are pretty solo surfing my dads jeep my truck woodworking etc  but you should not stick to work only find things you like productive hobbies productive hobbies would be something that you can make money doing what local events does your town have   really you just need 1 friend who has friends to get your foot in the door  also if you have no male friends make those first its good practice to make male friends because they are much easier to talk with and understanding of everything    it depends also where you hang around my workplace is a very christian place everyone believes in god lots go to church its really great so dont hang around places clubs and bars where bad people are church and outside activities are a good place to start sports for male friends too    if you are having this much trouble you already know the answer if it wasnt a big deal you wouldnt ask us for validation that its ok dump her and move on there are thousands of girls like her
how do i turn that egoistic feeling that some other guy is touching and doing stuff besides bed too with my exgf
  there are plenty of apps not associated with random hook ups
  youre going to find a lower quality girl online rather than in person
  well i dont think so either i didnt sleep outside of relationships because i think hooking up is gross i dont like the idea of dating a girl who sucked random dicks    but it seems really really hard in todays world to find girls who saved sex for relationships its frustrating because i held myself to the same standards that i seek but people keep telling me grow up its ok if girls sleep around it upsets me
  spagetthi monster  can you fly if so how come you never answer my prayers
  there are thousands of girls like her  but thats bad i would prefer a girl who values sex and saves it for boyfriends
  i thought dry humor was too dark and emotionless for real life  this reminds me of the article from the onion that said they has to shut down because they couldnt come up with more insane shit than real life     life is just shit at the moment so much stuff is happening that just makes you think whatever so much more often so this kind of dark humour is just more relatable at the moment
  do you just ask the girl if she wants to have sex now or set it like an appointment
  definitely but tinder literally scrappes the bottom of the worst whores of both genders you can imagine    looking for your pure waifu there is a mistake
  kind of reminds me of my situation i dont understand why i get along with so many people easily it doesnt even matter their personality type ghetto loser nerd i get along with all of them i dont fucking get it
  dry humor has always been funny i inherited a really dry kinda britishish sense of humor from my mom and a german sense of humour from my dad so ive been making dry deadpan jokes since i could form full sentences never got a bad reaction unless it wasnt clear enough that i was joking
  then if you are the op then the answer is clearly no this is not okay    but it seems really really hard in todays world to find girls who saved sex for relationships   i feel like this comes exclusively from guys spamming tinder and nothing else
  this tinder girls are liars    they might say im here for friends only lie they want sex talk to them for a few days and youll see    they say looking for a real relationship maybe she is now because shes filled her appetite of getting dicked by tinder chads
  i dont use tinder tho but the few girls ive taken on date which they all seemed like nice girls i found out they used to use tinder
  she acts pissed if i interact with other girls she gives these subtle hints but i cant be sure cause its all online interaction
  they might say im here for friends only  thats not a lie you just misunderstand tinder slang     tinder is for sex take it from someone who racked up a body count there when i wrote looking for a friend what i meant was a fwb not a ons but a more long term fuck buddy     thats your fault for using the wrong app for the wrong purposes thats like complaining that your hammer is shit at cooking a steak you are using the wrong tool for the job
  i know thread is about to die but anyway here goes  whats the best way to tell a girl that you like her but only want to be friends i dont want a sexual relationship with this person but i want to express my feelings
  ive literally messaged with a girl whos profile said not here for hook ups im just looking to meet some new friends dont message me about sex    we matched and messaged about random things for a few days after the third day of messaging we were talking about a netflix series that we happen to both watch and she said to me are you off today you could come over netflix and chill i have a comfy bed lies
  why do people keep saying that you can find relationships on tinder one of my friends is marrying a girl he met from tinder but this sounds like a terrible idea like you said its a sex app so why do people keep saying this
  not really you just quickly get tired of the hundreds of desperate guys out to get their dick wet so adding   dont message me for sex  will deter a solid 80 of them usually only leaving the persistent and thus worthy ones left     but again tinder is a different beast its great for hook ups and sex but thats it im not apologetic for that decadent place i know full well what it is and im sorry if some people mistakenly thought it was meant for anything else but it is not
  no idea its popular i guess     marrying off tinder isnt necessarily a bad idea mind you i can imagine doing it myself but then ive been a resident there for a few years and id be looking for someone similar to myself maybe he did the same or maybe he is just not as sensitive and can handle a partner who fucked 50 different random guys everybody has different limits they are willing to put up with and everyone has a preference
  i dont make negative jokes like about depression or stuff     me neither its a plus though everyone likes me even though i dont like everyone ha    same
  i dont like this place     how many guys did you sleep with from tinder
  whats the best way to tell a girl that you like her but only want to be friends  just saying lets just be friends
  everyone has different limits they can put up with    yes so advise me i expect from a girl what i expect from myself ive only had sex within relationships so how do i meet girls who are the same ive never hooked up before so i dont want to date a girl whos had 5 fwb/ons or whatever
  27    i kept count because i dont want it to have been faceless guys i never even knew the name of and also to keep in touch like i said i liked the friend angle more because guys are fucking awful at sex so if you want good sex you find a guy you like and then you do it with him over and over again the chad wont be able to get off your average girl on the first try and trust me they are pitiful when they smash away come prematurely and then sit there wondering how they managed to fail as if girls are supposed to spontaneously cum by their mere presence     i dont like this place  im pretty sure im a rather unique one here i mostly chime in when people ask about these kinds of things that only people like me can really answer and it seems to be either me or a guy who answers it
  27  sorry for your future bf
  so how do i meet girls who are the same  no idea buddy try real life     alternatively try some of those other apps like okcupid or whatever the hell you have in your country im pretty sure theyll be better than the app most commonly used for sex     i use tinder because it gives me what i want and hooks me up with people who want the same no idea if ill find the one here or not but then i dont care and i am not sure what the other options are because its not really options i am interested in
  will you admit to your future boyfriend your count    ok cupid   i live in the us all of those online dating sites are memes there are not many profiles and the ones who are there are usually fat or just weird most girls here go on tinder to meet people all of my female coworkers use tinder and one of them told me once thats the easiest way to meet people
  sorry for your future bf  why its not like id go looking for that pure virgin to corrupt ill almost definitely hook up with a guy from tinder who has more or less the same history anyway if ill get a permanent thing at all i have no desire to have kids and i dont plan on forcing marriage anyway if it happens it happens if not eh ill be fine
  will you admit to your future boyfriend your count  why wouldnt i if he was that opposed to it i wouldnt want to date him anyway hed probably be a jealous little bitch anyway     i live in the us  cant help you there then sorry i am from eu not sure if the us is just inherently more depraved try churches maybe i heard they are popular over there
what does this shit mean    talking to girl  she tells me she thinks im attractive  be thanksgiving  compliment her over messenger  she does awww ur sweet  notice she posts something on facebook imply shes seeing someone    did i just inadvertantly become a beta orbiter
  we are missing context here because from the sounds of this that someone she is seeing could just as well be you
  why wouldnt i  well because some girls lie about it because they know theyd be rejected  churches   im not religious but religion is dying    it really seems like most young people hook up here everybody i know had done it im considered abnormal and have been teased because i dont do it people keep saying to me well if you dont like that a girl has hooked up with guys then you should go hook up with girls make it even but i dont want to do that
  im 100 i wasnt with on thanksgiving and didnt give her the flowers she posted a pic of    by talking i mean messaging thats it
  because they know theyd be rejected  then they would be idiots for dating a type of guy who didnt also have a comparable body count     i know the situation is far from similar where i am from i doubt it is as bad as you say though i have a feeling you are overlooking quite a few potential girls in your social circle or hell grow a pair and ask one of these girls if they have a cute inexperienced friend ive helped out a borderline incel coworker get hooked up with a shy virgin friend of mine they have been really happy for about 4 years so that seemed to work out great he literally just asked me if i knew girls who didnt sleep around and i got them connected not that hard and its not like those tinder chicks care much about you anyway so theyll have little issues directing you to a more suitable option
  not finding someone with a comparable body count  they do that on purpose tho they want to fuck around and get dicked hard by chads in their twenties but then in their late twenties and early 30s they want to settle with a nice guy who spent his time focusing on building himself and his career instead of fucking around this happens all of the time there is a saying here in the us nice guys finish last    hmm i dont know i just have a hard time trusting girls who sleep around i dont trust my coworkers they act like im a beta because i dont do what they do ive had 2 girlfriends before  a long time ago tho so ive had sex but even still these girls will sometimes be talking about something turn as look at me and say anons never seen that before and laugh american girls are mean to people who dont do what they do
    you need subcouncious attraction girl should never tell youre cute pretty its red flags you need her to act nervous and akward around you and getting her to meet with you one on one
  they do that on purpose tho they want to fuck around and get dicked hard by chads in their twenties but then in their late twenties and early 30s they want to settle with a nice guy who spent his time focusing on building himself and his career instead of fucking around this happens all of the time there is a saying here in the us nice guys finish last  tfw im said nice guy  tfw my ex is on the dick train again    wew
is it normal for a 28 year old guy to have trouble staying erect
  they do that on purpose tho   yeah i know the type not from girls but guys its the stupid minority its safe to ignore them  but then in their late twenties and early 30s they want to settle with a nice guy who spent his time focusing on building himself and his career instead of fucking around  uh sorry to burst your bubble anon but the relationship guys with 1 girl for 10 years is far more likely to be in the gutter compared to the chad who fucked around i say that from my sample size of guys as well as my personal situation i fuck around like most of my guys because i focus on my career and building myself instead of spending insane amounts of energy and time on a relationship i focus on myself why do you think the usual meme is that people get fat when they are in a relationship because they stop working on themselves     people who fuck around dont because if they stop attending to themselves they wont get any action relationships are the path to laziness which is why ive avoided it
  relationships are the path to laziness which is why ive avoided it  fundamental problem why people like you fuck around is because you think that this is true
  anon the answer is real life alright go places where conservative women are physical activities outside not tinder not bars not clubs go to church no excuse join clubs for hobbies not weebshit hobbies but real ones
  projecting this hard  just because youd fuck up a relationship by being lazy doesnt mean others would
  see nice guys finish last     you dont have to fuck around i chose not to     if i expect to have a girlfriend who keeps herself only for her boyfriends then i should keep myself to the same standards
  i had two relationships in my youth it took less than a year for both guys to gain 20 pounds of pure fat     they quickly shaped up after we split up im not doing that again     why people like you fuck around is because you think that this is true  and just to clarify i dont fuck around because of this i fuck around because i dont want to devote the amount of time and effort a relationship requires until i have reached the career goals i have same with a lot of the guys i am fucking around with    just because you think the only true way is staying a pure virgin doesnt mean its true for everybody you do whatever you feel is the best use of your life
  never said anything bout virgins maybe its time to get off of 4chan anon    so youre feeling guilty every guy in a relationship with you will add weight  cmon
  but you didnt have to fuck around though you just wanted to     you could have just focused on building your career and exercising and pursing hobbies instead of sex
  28  no youre not 58

i was on first date with a 18 year old and actaully touched her on her knee under table and her forearms  she froze up probably never been touched before but i deff created that spark in her     metting her for next date soon  but this week we both have exams    so just wondering can you gain more or loose if you go for touch or not to touch i know whis varied with girls as well 
about to ask my crush ive known for 1 year with a circle of a friends out/tell how i feels soon i feel like we have been growing closer latey and want to make a move before its too late her birthday is at the end of this week is it awkward to ask someone out on thier birthday night out or my feelings personally is yes
    you guys are so dead set on making this all seem bad its kind of funny     you realize i dont mind this right i regret nothing and it limits me in absolute no ways thats meaningful    i guess stating a different viewpoint gets people pissy here we are really turning into reddit or whatever hugbox shithole is the favoured platform these days next time realize i am just answering the questions of an anon who wanted to know how these things work i know the world is a scary place with a lot of people who live life differently but we exist whether you like it or not
  im actually a bit amused because it sounds like the guys going after you really hate their choices to be relatively clean in terms of their relationships     i cant say i understand you though and im afraid i cant say i respect your choice either but its interesting food for thought for sure     i guess sex just doesnt seem appealing enough to me
  i wouldnt make any moves this date you dont want to look like you just in it for the sex and if you pressure her too much she may not feel comfortable  if she wants more you will easily get the hint also you wanna rile her up      story time i met a girl i like asked her out shit is going great were touching holding hands all that cute shit i drop her off it is obvious she is avoiding the kiss so i dont kiss her next time she invites me to her dorm i thought that was a sign of her being ready for next step wasnt too sure so decided to go for a sweet kiss on the cheek she didnt like it and recoiled back  next date i dont do anything physical third date she is the one who kissed me on the cheek i kiss her back repeat twice and got to make out with her when i dropped her off
    well before we meet for first date we knew each other about a month on part time job and were flirting and talking to each other one time she leaned close to me and accidentaly touched my elbow with hers and left it there but it was subcouncious so she probably didnt realize she was touching me also women are very subtle and it shows    yea i must let girl come to me how do i rile her up 
got a gal im seeing off and on when were together i may as well be her personal jungle gym lots of hanging hugging pysical contact at large ladies y u do this
  because physical affection is nice     i mostly do it because i got literally no physical contact growing up so when im around a guy i really like i cling like superglue if he lets me
girls  im a man with a lot of fetishes  range from sweet pillow talk to large object insertion  is this a turn off for you  how do i bring some of those to the sex life
girls how can i be less intimidating physically  i look scary to most people i have scars in my face and crooked nose from combat sports training and an imposing physique and body language just comes with the sport buzzed head etc  plus a somewhat permanently scowling arab face which is really just my relaxed expression i cant go around grinning like an idiot 100 of the time can i  to get an idea think pic related im pretty good looking but i look like a scary gangster when in reality i am quite introspective and sensitive so the women i do manage to not scare off with my looks get turned off by my contrasting personality  what can i do
  dress gayish  i have the arab face my normal expression intimidating and i was told when im deep in thoughts i look like a predator  after a night in the police station a drunk whore told me i should wear more pink and it helped me so far  though now i attract twinks
  imma let you in on a little secret  girls are huge freaks when it comes to sex stuff  many would never ever admit to the fucked up shit they fantasize about but most if not all of them are into shit that is bordering /d/ territory  be open with your girl maybe dont start with the freakiest shit but talk about stuff like that  make her feel like she can be open with you as well  if she likes you she will want to make you happy maybe you can do a sort of trade where she fulfills one of your fantasies and you do the same for her and so on   just be honest just maybe take it slow with how much you reveal at a time
  im a man with a lot of fetishes  range from sweet pillow talk to large object insertion  to large object insertion  really thats the apex of your fetishes     this is why i dont tell people my fetishes ill just let the guy set the limits because i am 120 sure i am into more freaky stuff than he is
  freakiest shit  many is not freakish as much as its just plane weird  for example armpitsjob or swaping underwear for a day or just combing her hair  maybe you can do a sort of trade  im an open person an ex of mine wanted to try pegging im not an anal person but i did it anyway  just be honest just maybe take it slow with how much you reveal at a time  im but it seems just one sided for me and my gf isnt really into it when i bring it up    thats the apex of your fetishes  no the other are borderline illegal or many find it a big no
  no the other are borderline illegal or many find it a big no  im intrigued now
  i am into more freaky stuff than he is  like what
  bestiality always seemed fun but in context with a guy only not really fun if its just by myself fursuits also sound fun at least to have the guy wear one while doing me    also violent rape preferably in public somewhere
  like a guy watching you get fucked by a dog or a guy and a dog double teaming you or something
  a guy and a dog double teaming you  more or less    i also wish tentacle stuff was actually possible in real life
  i see now to try to get her to dial it back a bit without coming across as an ass
   i cant really say how she might deal with it but i didnt react well the first time i was told to please cling a bit less not english but close to that wording i learned how weird i was being pretty quickly but it took a bit before i fully accepted it main thing that fixed it was a guy who told me to not cling but instead just go for a hug worked a lot better at satisfying that need than me just clinging to him     i also stick a lot less for a while after sex if that helps
it is to be expected in a relationship that a man plans dates too right my boyfriend has a lot of hobbies but never asks me to go on a date its always me that plans or comes up with ideas honestly im hurt that he doesnt express an interest in taking initiative but i have no idea what to do ive communicated that im very sad and disappointed but it doesnt seem to do anything what can i do
women of the online dating world should i mention in my profiles that im only looking for a longterm relationship or is it tacky for a man to do so    before anyone says the apps are only for hookups two of the longterm relationships in my past i met on tinder just gotta dig to find what you want
  if it wouldnt kill the romance consider formalizing it come to an agreement like you each plan 1 date a month you both jointly plan a single date a month or something similar just make it clear in a nonconfrontational way that dates are an obligation
cybersecurity where to start
  download webgoat its kind of fun to fakehack
do people usually judge you badly based on your background im not very social but i just always imagine how cringy its going to be to have to tell people i grew up poor and my dad is a loser alcoholic and had a broken home etc i feel like people would avoid me just because of that
yes always just lie unless you want to be lonely true friendships are not possible without some bond anyway
no reason to bring it up unless somebody asks  no reason to tell the truth unless somebody cares
no i dont judge people but again some people do i wouldnt because i also had family issues too i hope everything is okay anon
how to stop feeling like shit after every time i masturbate  i stopped watching porn i stopped all the fetish and chastity sissy shit  all i think about now is fucking a cute girl i know  yet i still feel bad afterwards

i hate my job ive had it since july and i am working my ass off all weekend the culture sucks etc    i want out how long do i need to stay at this job before i bail currently sitting at 6 linkedin months and i cant keep doing this is a professional job so it has an impact on my career
  well first of all you should use whatever tools are at your disposal to improve your own work environment you will probably not be a hero that saves the entire culture but you should see if there are things about your own experience that you can modify if you have no tools at your disposal or using them is not effective then start looking out
  if the next job hires you then it doesnt matter how long you are there for   keep applying for other positions if you arent already   reasons for departure are you are moving for family/gf commute is horrible etc
be me  23 yr old recent college grad who cant find a job   dont really want a job now no idea what i want   feeling aimless i work out but thats it really   still cant get gf    dont really have any main skills outside of creative writing knowing about pop culture   wtf do i do bros losing my mind uhhh
bro just be your self
if it makes you feel better thats pretty common im just 2 years younger then you and i am in the exact same way  and almost every single young adult that i know or heard of also is in the same situation
so had a date with this bird on thursday we hung out on friday doing some work together the whole time she was talking about not having a bf and maybe never she wont ever get married so at the end i said i really enjoyed thursday and thought we had fun and we should do it again not very confidently i might add she did a long pause so i said i know you are swamped with work which she is and she said yeah we had fun ill message you about it later im pretty sure that meant a no do i just ignore i leave uni at the end of december anyway thought she was into me advice was gunna send a message saying dont worry about it but my sister voted against that
  had a date with this bird on thursday  reminder that interspecies dating is degenerate  golden eagles are honorary humans though was she a golden eagle
just message her making concrete plans some day this week/tomorrow on sunday if she says no shes probably not interested
  weve got a comedian
  t spoonbill
  hitler can you just leave please
  im probably gunna see her on monday soooooo pretty much fucked if i ask again
  youre a fag   why the fuck did you gave her an excuse for her to bail on you
  in all honesty ive never done this sort of stuff before and being 21 it pisses me off im confident in literally everything else bar this even if its fucked good learning to get more confident
  i could tell it also took her by surprise and i wasnt giveing her an excuse i said i know your busy so even if its not possible this week we can do it whenever
  based
so i got in a long distance relationship and the moment i did i was hit with the now what what do you guys do in yours other than what for your partner to visit   weve been calling a lot and watching movies and stuff together as well as a tonne of messaging but what else is there really
thats about it man you can have phone sex too the point is that a ldr is not a real relationship there is so much more to a person and what it means to be in a relationship with them than can be expressed online its a fine thing to be used as an alleviation from loneliness or a confidence boost but be very wary of actually believing there is commitment between the two of you ldrs are glorified pen pals and she will drop you the moment a man presents himself in her daily life and youll do the same
i want to break up with my gf because our relationship is just super toxic in general    my problem is that shes extremely extremely fucking codependent and even has gone to far as to say that she would kill herself if i left her and some other things along those lines i know that shes manipulating me into staying and i know that i am being manipulated but its still hard for me to break up with her just on the chance that she does really kill herself as much as i want out i still dont want her to die shes got a promising life ahead of her i could set her down easy and that is what i would do but still i dont know    my options are to leave her now and i think itll just get harder as time goes by or to wait it it out and see if itll get any better thanks in advance
i dated someone like this as well she was very manipulative always wanted to argue about literally nothing to make me feel bad and said she would kill herself if i left i stayed for about another 3 months but it was making me really depressed i felt like i was trapped and i would have to stay with her for the rest of my life even though i hated it my ex did not kill herself after i left but i was really afraid that she would and it would be my fault but i dont regret leaving one bit it is not your fault if she does kill herself you could try talking her into seeing a therapist before you leave but people are pretty stubborn about this i find
  in your case leaving was the best option due to the abuse    in ops case i recommend you sit her down and talk to her before you commit to leaving just express how you feel tell her you love her but she needs to get her emotional shit together if she wants to have a future with you    if she keeps acting like a codependent desperate person and threatening suicide then drop her but talk to her first bro like a serious sit down relationship convo
  this is good advice mine and ops situations are not exactly the same and its easy for me to be bitter about it thanks for adding another perspective anon
how do i banter how do i be witty what do people even mean by charming
  affecting an aura of selfconfidence and practicing an appropriate amount of animation/character during conversations is charm some people are better at it than others for everyday conversation the easiest way to invoke a sense of wit is to offer opinions stances or ideas which are unexpected/contrarianbut be prudent because you risk being merely chaotic and exhausting everyone just the right amount of novelty in a social setting captivates    take this with a grain of salt because theres a fairly good chance im a turbo autist and my success with the above is just a dumbluck equation that happens to work for me
  that actually makes a lot of sense anon thank you   i wish i knew how to deal with the possibility of ridicule unfortunately that boils down too  confidence  wit/banter  i have a little of the first but almost none of the second
not op bit i think i have wit/banter nailed  im considerably bombastic and confident but i feel as though im exhaustive to be around for extended periods of time   am i loud and annoying no im random lol xd look at me    not sure what i expected to gain from saying this    have a good night
gf sent me this pic  made me feel sad  why also is there something similar i can send her so she understands how i felt
  dont understand she send you a meme or some other guy fucking her
op if youre not a troll then just promise me one thing promise you will not marry her no matter what ok
teehee what would you do if i cheated  teehee id just kill you both and then myself silly goose    if she feels like thats extreme say exactly    alternatively draw a mustache on your dick and then text her a picture asking her if shed really cheat on this handsome guy thats probably an actual equivalent that should make her as uncomfortable as she made you
  the meme      why im not but why      ill take that into consideration
  she send you a fucking meme bro chill
  this
i think that there have been some people with crushes on me in the past but i for the most part am just way too oblivious to notice that kind of stuff until reflecting on it years later    i had a gay coworker hit on me have had several old women and a trans woman call me handsome and i also had a girl who was obsessed with me in high school though the feeling was far from mutual i guess that means im not terrible looking    my problem is that unless its blatantly obvious i dont really pick up on any subtle cues    i have a female friend who im meeting up with tomorrow she invited me along to a brunch with her and some of her friends shes really friendly toward me but i think she just might be a friendly person i havent known her very long any cues i should pay close attention to
  ask her out on a date if she says no shes not interested this is the best and easiest sign ask once not more if she gives excuses dont delude yourself shes busy judge by actions and not by words    also dont get upset if she says no lay back and chill that you finally got your answer    good day
  ask her out and see how she reacts
this roastie in my uni class keeps looking at me at first i thought she was looking at one of the chads that sit near me but i changed seats and she keeps looking my way from time to time  recently she started saying hi and greeting me its the first time a female has ever talked to me of her own accord  this is obviously one of those make him think theres a chance then humiliate him prank so she can have a laugh with her friends  how can i turn the tables on her or should i just ignore her
if you seriously think its a prank then yeah completely ignoring her would be the best option dont give the roast even one opening to embarrass you
ask her out on a date and have sex with her
just let her do the work
  im not a total sperg and i semihide my power level but im not a chad so theres nothing else it could be  is there any way i can turn this around and embarass her instead
  im gonna get laughed at and potentially reported for harassment and kicked out  no thank you
  she might like you stop sabotaging yourself if you dont like her then just ignore her if you do then you have a chance here and instead youre planning on how to blow it
  im not a total sperg  one girl looks at me and greets me from time to time so i assume she wants to humiliate me
  she might like you  im fat and socially awkward im not a complete sperg i sometimes talk about video games and sports with some of the chads but im not one of them and never included in anything  also i never received any female attention before so why now  common sense dictates its a humiliation prank and i really want this roastie to taste her own medicine
  common sense dictates its a humiliation prank  you arent in high school anymore nobody cares enough to humiliate anybody else
  happened to me in uni i didnt bite but they pushed the trap onto me doing nothing may not be enough  you may need to escape
  what happened  how can i avoid it
  how did this trap play out       things can never change   this attitude will only hold you back op you might just be this girls type
  you should chat her up and see if shes cool dont think any further ahead than that
    i haver nothing a girl would want from me especially when theres so many chads around  im a fat socially awkward nerd  and youre telling me that somehow this girl who is decently pretty mind you starts paying attention to me out of the blue when i never received female attention in the 24 years of my life before  fuck off you normies are naive as fuck
  yeah thats exactly what im telling you you really think girls only like these chad types youre thinking of youre wrong the only thing that could turn her off is your anger and bitterness it sounds like youve had a rough time socially so it makes sense to be hesitant but you should drop the attitude for your own sake what did you expect when you made this thread
  i had this happen to me when i was younger so i know houw you feel but i promise at uni age that shit just doesnt happen at the absolute worst she wants to copy your work lol     she probably wants to be friends with you
  so why now  my uni class  youre at the age where even the worst of us get laid youre fat like video games and are kinda a sperg which means youre cuddly probably dont want sex all the time and will drone on at length about your special interests which readily fills the conversation void    the worst thing to do here would be to ignore this and realize years later that she did want to fuck and you passed on it
  how when she doesnt even know me  i doubt she even aknowledged my existence before she and her friends came up with the idea to prank me  and by chads i dont mean just cocky jocks there are good guys that are also good looking in class im one of the worst looking guys in my class im fucking fat  what did you expect  tips in order to find out how she was planning to go about it and ideas on how to turn it around
also one thing you guys might misunderstand is that im 24 but most of the kids in my uni are between 1921
  yeah im saying that people arent logical some people literally get off to eating shit some people fuck their dogs its not that unbelievable that some unsuspecting girl would have a thing for you and you dont have a leg to stand on in this argument because youre an unexperienced r9k autist it would probably kill you if knew just how much pussy youve missed out on with your rigid self hating ideas also fuck you for coming here under the pretense of needing advice just so you could commit your poorly synthesized truths about dating dynamics asshole
  people can take interest in people they hardly know especially when theyre young theres often no physical difference between 21 and 24 some girls like fat guys maybe shes observed you and thought you seemed cool
    lets examine 2 statements  young pretty uni student girl takes interest in socially awkward fatso she hasnt really interaxted with all that much  and  young pretty uni student girl wants to prank the socially awkward fat nerd so she can have a laugh with her friends  which one sounds more logical to you which one sounds more likely to be true  i stopped being a shutin neet to go to uni and turn my life around but i dont have any delusions or wishfull thinking
also fuck you normies for playing with my feelings and getting my hopes up  i want you to be right but i know youre wrong
  the first one retard
  you have many delusions that youre unwilling to let go of if you really think shes malicious then just reject her if she happens to make a move theres also a third option which is that shes just being nice and youre having a fit over nothing
its hard to judge since i dont know what you look like i dont know what she looks like and i dont know what her other options or competition looks like    its kind of hard for me to imagine people engaging in such childish and meanspirited pranks in their mid 20s while going to uni but some places/people are worse than others and people in general can be pretty fucked    its possible she doesnt feel she has a chance with the chads or doesnt feel as comfortable with them for whatever reason one big clue would be how often youve seen her speaking to them if at all and if she flirts with them or shows interest when they do
  ive had girls do shit like this to me before so the people pretending it doesnt happen are retards  however from what youve said i dont think shes trying to humiliate or fuck you she probably sees that youre awkward and pities you or something probably wants to be your friend pretty girls like being friends with guys like us because we know we dont have a chance of fucking them
  i want you to be right  yeah i know why else would you post this thread when you knew people would try to convince you youre wrong post on r9k if you want other bitter people to conspire with you
  183cm 125kg average face propably a 2 or 3/10 and socially awkward  shes a solid 7 maybe more im not sure about her age but most people there are around 1920  chads flirt with her she responds like every other roastie there does i dont know how to really describe it its all just playfull young people stuff with no real meaning  most of the other guys there are around my height but not fat the one guy thats as fat as me is much more outgoing though    how would i find out i dont mind a friend i dont have delusions of having sex anytime soon anyway    i know its wrong that i want it to be true but i cant help it maybe once ive improved myself enough some day  but what you normals cant understand is that its not the same for everyone
  so why did you come here so we can tell you you have no chance and not to get your hopes up    you have no chance no chance fatso dont get your hopes up just ignore her and shell lose interest soon there are many chads on campus so it wont take long thread over
just ignore her anon   and close this thread   or go to r9k
  maybe she oh i dunno actually have an interest in you anon not all girls desire chads maybe she see something in you that she couldnt see in other males go for her if you think she id being genuine dont attempt it if you think shes not being her true self around you
  not all girls desire chads  yes they do a lot of them just settle for less just like a lot of males
  also i never received any female attention before so why now  anecdotal answer here remember that episode of the fairy oddparents where it were revealed the popular girl trixie tang had a common interest as timmy turner ie liked the same comics and shit as him thats probably the case here she like video games and sports but have to act a certain way around her inner circle of friends
  lol dude she literally is just saying hi to him and looking at him occasionally she does not want to fuck him she is being a polite person
im a femanon who has previously been interested in a fat 24 year old dude when i was 20 he was funny and shared my interests i thought he was adorable as fuck and i love it when guys are passionate about a subject meaning spergs are great for me i dont view myself as attractive but i guess i could be viewed as such by certain tastes    please dont sabotage yourself op if you could put up a picture so i could assuage you id appreciate it but i know that takes tonnes of confidence that you may not have
  what is your situation now if you dont mind me asking   because it sounds like you just pity this guy which he doesnt like
  yes youre twentyfour and those around you are in their twentysomethings also at that age that middle/high school mentality is gone nobody is out to reap grudges or humilate you its all about psychological maturation
    chill niggas trying to make op feel positive and shit and yall out here trying to debunk it all at this rate hell be the next supreme gentleman keep a watch on your television and be sure to watch fox news not cnn
  he rejected me he said he only viewed me as a friend but a mutual acquaintance said it may have been a situation similar to op which was like a kick in the teeth to be honest    im sorry if the way i was describing it sounded as if i as pitying him i was honestly really into him and wouldve loved to see where dating him would have gone i have been in and out of a relationship since then so its been a while
  trying to make op feel positive and shit and yall out here trying to debunk it all  something about fish climbing trees
  which was like a kick in the teeth to be honest  how is that i mean i can see why rejection is hard especially for a lot of women but how did you take it personal even after an acquintence explained it to you
  look even if the light isnt the brightest for someone right now they still deserve to see at least a glimmer of it nobody should fall into despair so easily over past misfortunes and trauma seriously op hit the gym and lose that fat then reclaim your chance with her the more youre sitting on your lazy ass here couldve spent on getting /fit/ and becoming a chad yourself
  it was a kick because i dont mind being rejected because im unattractive or unappealing this guy however may have rejected me because he was scared that i was taking the piss out of him    it means that somewhere along the way i made him feel like that thats shameful somehow someway when i was trying to be lovely and flirtatious and kind he thought i was looking to hurt him that hurts me to be honest
  not all girls want a chad op dont worry  alright time to stop crying and hit the gym to be like chad op  this shit always makes my day     the road to hell is paved with good intentions   im not saying you did anything wrong its just that you shouldnt take it personal because it wasnt
  oh aye i get that i shouldnt take it personally but saying is easier than doing nobody wants to be the person who drives those theyre interested in away
  i changed seats and she keeps looking my way from time to time  try to sit somewhere where she cant easily look at you anything from 45 to 135 behind her    dont engage further than saying hi or hello back and try to not get involved into a conversation with her while others are around you if she approached you while you are allone start walking into her direction and greet her while you walk past her this way it wont look like you are actively avoiding her  if one of your friend brings her up during a conversation try to stay cold and answer with short or oneword sentences
  nobody wants to be the person who drives those theyre interested in away  thats the thing though you didnt and its starting to kind of annoy me that youre making this about you
  sorry my man but you absolutely are a total sperg youve given 0 information that even so much as hints that this person wants to humiliate you in anyway in fact taking your spergness out of the equation everything hints that you are doing something to catch her attention now whether its because you sperg out or she finds you attractive i wouldnt know from your completely biased view of the story
  turn the tables on her by asking her out on a date and if she says no simply say ok and never talk to her again
  thats more like the advice i was looking for  i dont have any friends the chads i talk vidya and sports with somtimes arent that close that theyd ask something like that  it just surprised me it makes sense id assume the worst  thanks anon
  its just common sense  roasties like to bully loners and theres really no other reason i could be catching her attention for
  truly pathetic my man you are doomed to a self fulfilling prophecy for which there is no escape i hope you get a eureka moment one day and turn it all around
  jesus christ op youre a god damn wreck even if you think its a prank you should still try to do something with this girl having a small chance is still better than having no chance and with an attitude like that you have 0 chance of ever having a gf and you will die being a waste of space
  noooo noo no no no no no no no no no  jesus christ please dont make this mistake
  by thinking she wants to humiliate you she does not want to
just assume that she wants to become your friend be friendly and chat with her as you would with a friend then you will notice what her intentions really are
  youre welcome    dont fall for her constantly looking at you  one of her friends probably saw you looking at her and thats why she constantly checks to see if you are still looking at her  thats why she wants to talk to you all of a sudden roasties especially in college want attention she thinks because you dont look like chad she can easily manipulate you and get stuff from you for free  its not worth interacting with her
  a real mind reader
nerds actually think girls in college will date guys as a joke  no female past high school cares that much
op is obviously a fucking retard but some of you itt eg   arent much better she doesnt have feelings for him all shes doing is being friendly
  i dont think she wants to humiliate me for the sake of it or some hate for loners but for laughs with her friends or something    thats actually a decently realistic assumption although i never particularly looked at her i try as much as possible not to look towards females    noone said date as a joke but rather bait me into thinking she likes me then make fun of me for being so naive
  uses roastie and chad unironically as a 20something college student    dude get fucking therapy even if she was trying to be mean whats the worst that could happen she looks like a bitch and you move on with your life go get laid you big fag
  im already on therapy its how i stopped being a shutin and went into uni  youre right theres not much that could happen aside from me getting laughed at its not the end of the worldif youre a normie id propably shoot up the place if it happened desu  go get laid  i need years of work before i can ever consider dreaming of getting laid unless i get a whore theyre legal in my country
  i dunno why not just go for it and not care about the possible attempted humiliation what if your perspective is wrong     i wouldnt preemptively try to do something to her because in case you are wrong youre ruining your chance and randomly hurting someones feelings for no tangible reason     she may also just be trying to be friendly
  id suggest you kill yourself you bitter self hating cunt no one needs people like you around   i feel bad for that women for wasting even one second giving you attention
  well more than likely shes not giving me attention she just wants a laugh with her friends on my expense
  are you good at uni
  its too early to judge we havent been marked at anything major yet  but id say im one of the few people that give the vibe that they want to be there and are actually interested in the lecture engage the teacher with questions etc
  mistery solved shell probably ask for help or to study together its not necessarily a bad thing as long as you dont illude yourself you may learn something about social interaction with the opposite sex
just remember that broken people attract broken people themselves   even if it werent a prank shes not a quality woman shes probably got bpd or some shit and she views you as an easy target to make daddy angry   focus on your studies get fit get a high quality woman
  yeah that was the plan no delusions of friends and women for at least another 6 years  but too many new things for me recently after years of being a shutin neet so i cant motivate myself to hit the gym as well
  im not a total sperg    you say things like roastie and chad and more importantly the telltale sign of saying female    you are 100 a sperg    then of course theres the whole thing of you thinking that theres a roastie conspiracy to humiliate you because this female said hello to you    stop brainwashing yourself with r9k memes
lighten up op things arent as horrible as they are in your head
  roasties and chads might be buzzwords but their meaning is decently clear and most of the time accurate  and whats wrong with the word female  anyway i dont even browse /r9k/ that much though i understand i share alot of their mentality
roastie  kill yourself
    roasties and chads might be buzzwords but their meaning is decently clear and most of the time accurate    the meaning is actually 100 clear and the meaning is that person using those terms is completely fucked up on r9k memes and thinks that everyone is out to get them    and whats wrong with the word female    its an incel attempt at dehumanization female could mean aything from a female lobster to a female grasshopper    if youre referring to female humans then we got words like women or girls
  youve just recently started leaving the house and you think you can label and read people accurately
  roastiesshallow whores which 90 of young women are  chadsgood looking guys  as the word female now youre just being anal  everyone is out to get me well i didnt think so before now but when a miracle happens youre gonna look for the logical explanation right    classes arent yet that hard for anyone to need help really i dread the group projects in the 2nd semester though
this is obviously one of those make him think theres a chance then humiliate him prank so she can have a laugh with her friends  anon you autistic fuck i think youve watched too many cartoons this kind of shit doesnt really happen at least not in university  your blatant retardation aside just ignore her if nothing else it will give you peace of mind  have you considered she might actually like you dont take everything /r9k/ tells you without 3 fistfulls of salt you dont have to be some athletic blonde charismatic manly adonis to have a girl show interest in you  have you also considered the fact that maybe just maybe shes just plain old being friendly with no strings attached either way maybe she just thinks youd be a a good friend or at least friendly uni acquaintance    let me give you a bit of general advice theres nothing wrong with being a virgin or awkward or bad with people or a loner or liking anime or any of the typical characteristics of a neet  on the other hand developing this /r9k/ bitterness thinking the whole world is a secret cabal against you and your peers both resenting and being jealous of normies and accepting this disgustingly shameful defeatist attitude of i never had a chance im a sub 8 male those normies will never understand fucking stacy is not only incredibly pathetic its cancer to you as a person it will drag you down to the deepest pits of depression and will not let go because it will whisper shit in your ear like this is all youll amount to better to flourish in these condition  what you are trying to do is label people based on a handful of what i assume are bad experiences before reaching maturity and anecdotes of strangers on the internet you have never met but you cant do that no one can  the first step towards getting out of a stagnating funk is to be aware of it and to be able to point it out to yourself when you act by it  uh ive just projected a 4chan post on a real person
  this kind of shit doesnt really happen at least not in university  while i agree op is being an autistic retard it happened to me twice in the last year of high school so its conceivable that it would happen in university
  roastiesshallow whores which 90 of young women are    tell me more about how youre not an r9k poster    as the word female now youre just being anal    not at all unless you learned english as a 20 year old and its your third language or youre some kind of fucked up space alien that only just arrived on the planets surface a few hours ago and still trying to make sense of the world no one in their right mind says shit like a female talked to me
  i had something roughly similar happen to me in middle school where a bunch of fuckheads put love notes on my desk pretending to be from a girl  but after the age of 18 and for the subject girl to take part in it i cant imagine it happening more than very rarely  is it some sort of common american thing im not aware of i cant imagine grown adults yes 18 is adult to do that sort of shit  either way op can either ignore her for peace of mind or be at least friendly and see what she wants maybe shes just being friendly and nothing more
  i dont think the whole world is out to get me  tbh i thought alot of the things posted on /r9k/ and /pol/ were complete bs when i was a shutin but i kinda changed my mind when i got out there  this is just the one explanation that makes the most sense to me if she just wanted to be friends she would be more direct and talk to me about class and stuff right  theres no way she likes me even assuming i can be liked she doesnt know me so that leaves only one alternative
  this     this is /adv/ not /pushingchantardstupidity/ so take this with you    first thing to learn is incels are selfdestructive even if they think otherwise i used to be one before the term existed and the rules havent changed incels may not like this being pointed out but they blame others while wallowing in their own ignorance and memes young humans where incelism begins have unformed brains little real world experience raging hormones and poor coping skills     this is not to say roasties and chads dont exist but that incels are so bad at understanding people including themselves they project like mad i was reasonably personable but what i didnt know because my incel head was planted firmly up my colon was that i wasnt being rejected most of the time my severely defective social skills were my problem incels choose not to apply healthy skepticism to their own thoughts and deeds they selfinflict a learning barrier which enhances their reality distortion field   incels are emotionally vulnerable and seek affirmative feedback for their misbegotten way of life its social selfharm     op should neither turn tables which exist only in his mind most women dont troll mentally ill men so if shes nice to you its absurdly unlikely to be some plot nor ignore but merely be polite and reasonable thats not a commitment costs nothing and allows practice of social skills primates learn social skills they are certainly not innate     anyone can learn social skills relinquish philosophy helps and dont get yours from ubangi pedo image boards unproductive beliefs if you are young replace your wrong idea that you know much of anything with healthy curiosity learn to learn     women are people for good or ill if someone taught you the madonna/whore world view kill them for the good of humanity then make the choice to grow up     incels are miserable because they are doing it wrong
  you sound like you have very little world experience but somehow you think you know how everything works
  if she just wanted to be friends she would be more direct and talk to me about class and stuff right  why are you so sure of that  gosh that anon guy seems like he could be a nice guy but hes also kind of a quiet loner maybe i should take it easy and have him warm up to me maybe i could get him out of his shell  alternatively she might have been trying to be direct but saw you were giving her the cold shoulder out of discomfort or awkwardness  dont mistake the above for romantic interest this sort of thought can happen entirely platonically  shes an individual different people do different things in different ways its not as if normies all do shit based on a template i could sit here and come up with 8 million reasons why she might not have been entirely direct at least half of them about how she adjusts her approach specifically to how she perceives you  theres no way she likes me even assuming i can be liked she doesnt know me so that leaves only one alternative  question did you ever get a crush on somebody that rode the bus with you and only lasted for that bus ride some girl youve never met in your life you dont know anything about her but something about her looks the stuff she carries around and the mannerisms youve managed to pick up on attract you for some reason  you dont need to know a person personally for longer than 5 minutes to start building an attraction to them if she likes you which i emphasize again she could be just regular friendly it could be because she spotted some mannerisms in you she liked or you uncovered your power level about some hobby she happens to share and she wants to talk to you about it  its a sort of protocrush a curiosity that comes before the crush those need very little basis to develop  fuck maybe she likes scrawny quiet goofy looking nerds she sure as shit wouldnt be the first girl to do so  you really dont appreciate just how much 4chan influenced your mind
  i wouldnt classify myself as an incel i dont hate females they are what they are its not their fault i failed at life and started late and with no social skills  that doesnt explain the reason this is happening though    enlighten me then  what other possibilities are there i havent thought of
  your options are currently 1 she likes you and 2 she has some evil plan what about 3 shes being nice and you hardly ever cross her mind
  delicious tears
  yeah keep your guard up no reason for her to like you she probably thinks you are some desperate nerd that she can get homework answers from
  i dont hate females    females
is there a point to moving out of your parents house if youre an incel and you despise women
  i have no idea why you wouldnt want independence from your parents though  i guess if you guys have a good arrangement then go for it or if theres another reason like i am parttime caregiving for my inlaw  but i dont think thats the same thing here
  because even if independence was worth the price of a mortgage payment id still be obligated to go over there and help them out constantly
  i moved out when i was 17 i dont see why anyone would want to stay with their parents forever  the only point in living with your parents is to save up for your own space and that only works if your parents are well off and can afford to have you leeching off there    getting out early teaches you a lot of important stuff you need to know that is hard to learn in theory or through your parents    obligated to go over  then you didnt move far enough away  i live 2 hours away from them so getting over is not possible all the time  when they need help i help them out and i often stay with them when i have vacations  they do the same for me so whenever i need some improvements done on my house i can always count on them to help out  when i was living together with them i always had them around so i would usually talk to them whenever i had problems or something wrong in my life  when things were great i celebrated with friends so i brought a lot of negativity to them  now i call them to tell them once a week about how great life is or what i have been doing which means we have nothing but great times together  it is good for me and it is good for them aiming to be a person my parents actually like is a good goal for any kid being around them all the time might be a help to them but it is not what they whish for you
  if youre an incel and you despise women  id say its only ok if you live with your dad and hes the same way then you can both be together that way    but if you live with your folks it would cramp their style for sure    imo that would be the point to moving out to relieve your parents from the irritation of your constant presence adults always irritate each other in the end
yeah there is living on your own will force you to get out of your comfort zone a little bit more and become a little more independent which are things you need to do if you dont want to be depressed lonely and suicidal in 10 years and miss me with that incel shit you need to grow out of that most people do
yes    women arent the only point to life
a lot of responses in here thanks guys      then you didnt move far enough away  no choice really if i move its going to be only 10 or so miles away in any case my job is too good and my city is too cheap to leave its metropolitan area
  if your family is laid back enough for you to bring friends over why not stay if you dont have any friends you have social problems and i imagine thats why you hate women and still live with your parents
  i dont have friends over i only ever go to their places or out elsewhere if theyre only my friends out of pity or amusement i wouldnt know i am 26 years old
  if theyre only my friends out of pity or amusement i wouldnt know  damn yeah good relationships can be hard to come by what made you ask the question about moving out
  i moved back in with my parents about 7 months ago after my roommate moved in with his gf i hated it so damn much at first mostly because i felt ashamed i had been 100 independent for 7 years at this point i have a shakey relationship so i didnt move in with my gf    overall though i have just as much freedom as before no obligations minimal rent of 100 a month and occasionally get free food  i think about moving out often just because the stigma of living with my parents at 28 is so bad but god damn if it isnt a decent gig i go to my gfs for privacy i pay next to nothing and have built up a healthy savings and have more money to do things i enjoy doing with people  the only downsides are i just lie to my coworkers about where i live i dont need that getting around i dont invite people over and having a somewhat cramped living space with much of my personal stuff in storage  im having a hard time justifying to myself why i should be looking for apartments right now when things are like this but regardless i will probably leave within the year
  it was outlined pretty well by     basically each year i get older and sadder and was only able to really keep it concealed at my work for a couple years   more than anything living with the parents is getting a little annoying i only moved back in after college
  is there a point to improving  say no plz
bit random but i need to print 4 photos for a project and i need feedback on which are the best 
ask an alcoholic for advice never know what you will get drinking vodka now half a bottle in
  i hate how vodka tastes but i love how plastered it gets me are there any brands out there that dont smell and burn like rubbing alcohol
  probably not drinking smirnoff which is under 10 dollars for a 750 ml bottle with a orange soda mix usually drink beer or super cheap whiskey
how do i fight the urge to not do something that i really want to do but definitely shouldnt   and its not something you can just silence by occupying yourself its like needing to pee but having to hold it  forever
  fuck me depends if murder seek help if something more mild live with it i do hence the drinking
  also general alck thread
  whats the thing youre trying to hold in forever that you need to distract yourself from with alcohol     and for the record its not something illegal just not beneficial for myself
  ive been through the ringer the argument will be why are you qualified to give advicei am definitely not but i can think more clearly about others problem than my own elaborate on the not illegal problem please anon
  meh nobody is actually qualified to tell anyone else wtf to do so youre not worse than every other person     im compulsively picking my skin since 20 years and im sick and tired of it it  has a huge negative impact on my life namely how i feel about my body if a can go out in public what i wear my sex life and so on ive tried therapy/medication and what not but its still here and it hasnt gotten any better infact its just getting worse with the years first it was just my face now its every inch of my body i do it several hours every day
  i have a little experience with this my gf will pick herself and cause small wounds to her face and head claiming its stress she also bites her nails perhaps the root cause is stress
  sure im aware of the triggers and reasons i do it unfortunately this is my way of coping with everyday life life wont go away and apparently medication doesnt help me with this either its frustrating that i cant seem to find a less damaging way of coping
soon as you have your first drink do you get spleen area pains shoulder/neck pains back of head and upper chest pains
  this is my second sober day im waiting for withdrawal symptoms im gonna have to start maintenance soon     i like being drunk but its equally nice not being drunk if you can keep yourself occupied with something productive ive been cleaning my house for the past week and ive drunken significantly less heres to day 3 someone take a shot for me drink where i am not able to
  no i generally lose pain as the drinking continues but i am relatively young 28 but the pressure in my head does increase and then completely subsides if that make any sense
  keep going just do it i dont believe alcoholism is a disease ala 12 steps but just keep going
  as much as i want to give you advice i must impotenl say that you must go deeper sorry anon
  huh  pain in those areas gets worse the more i drink  was out with friends last weekend and went from mild ow to being at home hours later after drinking going aahhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhh
  well thanks for lending an ear and try to enjoy being drunk since then you atleast enjoyed it
  it might be psychosomatic but as said i generally become painfree as i drink     hence why i drink
  i dont have to try thanks anon i hope it all works out
bamp
  if you dont mind me asking how much you drink a day  i was drinking 10ish pints a day years back but i stopped that for a few years and now its 23 sessions a week at about 46 pints each depending on event  just checking in with an alkie no offense before i go to doctor and say somethings wrong here and it aint booze
  that might be alcoholism just go in case i drink a lot more than 5 pints of beers a day doctor is always best
how do i get rid of my internet addiction
  wrong thread if your internet addiction is related to alcohol then youre in the right place do you drink while you browse the internet do you not having else to do when drinking
  no just desperate since ive been refreshing 4chan since 10am
  segrams on ice
  dont worry thats normal the ride never ends friend youre here forever for example try closing all your 4chan tabs see what happens its probably not the internet youre addicted to its 4chan its like a drug do you have any other addictions     also what are the main boards you browse
  my tolerance has gone up from drinking too often does the type of alcohol make a difference i usually drink cheap vodka how long does it usually take to bring your tolerance back down sometimes ill drink on an empty stomach to save alcohol and money but then i have some gnarly stomach turns the next day
  cheap vodka is made from grains itll tear your stomach up for sure drink potato vodka its better quality and its easier on the stomach
  smirnoff is a no go then what else can i drink i dont want to go broke
  i personally drink luksusowa its reasonably priced but when i want to drink on the cheap i drink nikolai its a little better than vladimir or crowne russei dont think ive ever drunken smirnoff how cheap is it
  ask for advice someone who is glaringly incompetent at life   why
  because there are people worse off than op and no matter how bad someone is they can always use their experience to teach others what not to do every single person can give advice and the advice is only as good as the one that takes it if they decide to use it or not
  implying there is an objectively right way to live life
im going to an aa meeting today finally gonna admit im an alcoholic
  midtier like grey goose or svedka go down smooth as water   one time i drank a whole handle of svedka bc i didnt feel the harsh burn at first and blacked out  then when i woke up everything in my apartment was carefully turned upside down in place and the trash can was full of pancake batter
  drink tolerance is tricky  if i stop for 2 months and start back up i usually catch up to tlevel i had when i stopped drinking in a week or two if i take it slow   but i drink a liter of black velvet a week so i guess start slow and youll take longer to catch up to your previous level of tolerance
  aa is a cult and a cancer to relationships romantic and platonic get a real therapist
can you recommend a good wine im tired of stella rosa there has to be better shit out there but id rather not spend a lot of money just to find out    also been trying to get into whiskey bought some jameson as a starting point but any recs
do you get any weird stomach pains/discomfort when you drink think i might have gastritis but i dont have health insurance so no doctor
be me 23 yo virgin   see a nice girl  finally get courage to ask her out  couple of dates go by  today we kiss and she is my gf  now what anons  next time i see her in class or just meet her in general do i kiss her first time i see her or just a hug and kiss her when im dropping her off  i want to tell her i am a virgin but we didnt about sex yet she is super shy and so am i how do i bring that topic up
  just interact with her naturally and youre fine
  rip i guess
  first kiss is the hardest but you dont just jump straight to casual pda afterward go out on another date and set the mood a little better kiss more than once make out if possible     you need to be comfortable with it before you really do the whole thing where you give them a quick kiss when greeting them or whatever
  makes sense  thanks
so ive been planning to buy a gun to kill my self for my 21st birthday this april my mother has had no suspicion of this she would think i would buy it for protection until i turned on this laptop and went to this website i left it alone for a few seconds and you know how theres a little gif/animation above the name of a board right well this one was an animation of a noose being tied mother saw broke down telling me not to do anything stupid this was shitty timing considering i came home from class and broke down before any of this happened now shes probably gonna be suspicious for a really long time anons how do i get a gun i hope this post makes sense
  do you have to get a permission slip from your parents if you want to buy a gun like the guy wont sell it to you unless your mum tells him youre allowed it
  listen you fucking asshole after what just fucking happened my mother definitely is definitely going to make my life a living fucking hell more than it already is if i told her im going to get a gun she might even put me in jail cause suicide is illegal
  holy shit     1 get therapy  2 stop trying to kill yourself  3 if you are actually going to kill yourself ask yourself why it matters that your mom is going to make your life hell   4 if you still live with your mom you dont have enough life experience to know that suicide is the best option and it sounds like your mom cares about you and wants you to keep existing so you already have a good reason to stick around  5 if you do decide not to kill yourself depression is actually pretty easily treatable  and even though it takes time thats one thing you wont have if you an hero     good luck
  its better to live as a failed human being for others than killing yourself with dignity
  thanks for the advice at least
  first off your 20 year old so your life is already too late to be saved    second when you die im going to fuck your mom so hurry up and die so i can nit in your mom
  killing yourself  with dignity  oh anon  also you need to be 18 to browse this site
  wow so edgy here have an upvote
  killing yourself with dignity  theres no such thing
    it way better to suffer  is /adv/ just bunch of masochists
  post nudes of mom before you die
dont kill yourself you literally have your whole life ahead of you
  okand
  nvm go die
  that makes no sense because life ends everyone dies what remains is timing    exit bag or dry dive  reliable
  whole life  oh wow even more misery
  what is a failed human being the meaning of your existence is in the process of existing  brought by you     the only failure of existing is death/not existing  so theres no such thing as being a failed human being  because you and every other human being already is a human being     as far as failure in life addiction depression mental issues physical ailments etc those are all able to be changed/transcended and your life isnt a 0 sum game that ends right now up until the moment you end it     so the dignity is in actually putting forth the effort to live and be at peace with living naturally as long as you are able to  while simultaneously trying to make the best life possible under your particular circumstances     dying has no dignity  but the problem of existence ceases to be the act of death is the sum total of your existence ending thats where the sum really matters dying as a human who has failed at getting their life together is ending all options to change  and the sum does in fact end in failure
  failed as in you have no faith in anything  nor world nor yourself
  better to suffer than to not exist     who knows not anyone who doesnt exist at least while alive you have something to compare after death the meaning of better or worse goes away and youre not left with anything better than suffering     suffering is inbuilt into reality i can say from experience it is better to make peace with suffering and try to find meaning in the short enough time we have than to succumb to suffering and give up and im a full on absurdist its not masochistic to believe staying alive is better than dying  its just recognizing the only way to know whether being alive is better than anything including being dead is to in fact be alive     what a conundrum its easily solvable by continuing to exist even if for no other reason than to have something to compare at all
  faith isnt the determining factor in what it means to exist or to succeed in existing if your definition of failure is loss of hope youll find no shortage of those who have overcome that failure and are now successful just about every adult you see walking around has already or will one day grapple with the problem of existence and statistically most make it through     so if you consider yourself rational at all that isnt a good metric for failure/success in the endeavor of existence
  most make it through  because they have something which helps them to run away from existential dread once you really lose hope then you realize how futile everything is but that doesnt liberate
  i dont know how much time youve spent in existential dread  so i wont assume     however any serious thinker on the subject of existence finds ways to argue against the rationality read existential writers  most of them are open and honest about having been suicidal and explain the way in which they crawled out of the void     yes its immeasueably difficult and liberation seems impossible but no liberation isnt impossible to assume that your version of existential dread is the real version thats worse than anyone elses experience is to assume wrongly simply put the depths of darkness that existence can plunge someone are extreme but theyre not infinite and theyre most definitely not inescapable     pick up some sartre or nietzche  you may be surprised how much existentialist writers have experienced
  rationality of suicide didnt mean to end the sentence there
  have experienced  i dont negate their experience but in the end its their experience my experience is not applicable to them and their experience isnt applicable to me as im not them
  thats true but there are two things that are true as well     1 consuming art/philosophy/music is the way in which we learn about the human condition with reliability it isnt perfect but its what we get reading existential writers may speak to you thoughts you thought only you had and show you that you arent alone in your experience     2 humans are evolved to exist in the face of existence each existential approach differs from person to person but to assume you arent equipped with the tools to deal with existential crisis is to assume that sufficient existential crisis can happen to any human with no tools to escape it     you have the tools both within and external and even if it seems like it has no meaning the clinical literature teaches us that statistically sometimes it takes someone pretending existence matters for a period of time without believing it in order to eventually feel and believe it     nonexistence doesnt concern those who exist because upon nonexistence we arent existing to experience it death therefore becomes nothing to fear it simultaneously becomes nothing to reach for     with unlimited time which for all you or anybody knows you actually have and death isnt even real  you would find new answers cutting off the one avenue to find new answers existence doesnt solve the problem inherently     the problem of existence can be solved and has been with various iterations of realizing that nonexistence isnt a viable option and youre only left with one option which itself is the problem     the buddha laughed at this fact nietzche argued to overcome through becoming our own god and bringing our own meaning to the nihilism that exists as a fabric beneath it etc etc  each person/thinker deals with it a bit differently     but the one truth through all of it is that anyone who has dealt with existential crisis and can speak on it continued to exist at least long enough to speak on it
camus is also good to read     think in pascals terms with existence for right now if you plan on not existing what do you have to lose by sticking around and searching for an answer to your problems     escaping suffering seems nice but wouldnt it rationally make sense that escaping suffering while remaining alive would be better by simple fact of being able to compare than by not existing at all
  tools  i seem to lost them somewhere i guess the biggest question is that ive been born into this madness and i have to even be thankful for that its like someone kidnaps you makes a slave out of you and puts into salt mine then slave warden asks with surprise why im not happy about the situation
  who is the slave warden     you want to be angry at existence for existing  then fine it doesnt seem to react to things like that youre absolutely accurate about your assumption that you didnt have a choice whether or not to exist     but were you happy before existing the answer is no you werent anything     so you dont have to be anything you dont want to be grateful or thankful included but the strange fact about being plopped into existence without choosing it and being plopped into an unstructured existence with no goal  again whether you like it or not  is that we have the opportunity to choose to make it whatever we want     again none of this is even considerable without existence  so we find out that the one true reflexive and inherent truth in the universe is that existence is what it is and you get to decide what that means     you can hate that the decision is yours or love it but its still ultimately yours and the only alternative is not existing which is also your choice it just happens to be an irrational one given the circumstances at which you find yourself     the dead end the circle comes to be when you fully realize that you cant debate the nature of existence or be happy or unhappy about it without previously existing and to think that not existing solves any problems at all is foolish not existing just removes you from the equation  and even then youre still at least forced to exist on a particle level whether or not youre conscious on a particle level is anybodys guess though id assume no
  thinks theres dignity in having his brains splatter over his bedroom wall  thinks there is dignity in destroying the heart and soul of his mother who will have to live the rest of her life thinking she is a failure    there is no dignity in suicide its just selfish plain and simple
  who is the slave warden  other human personification  decide what that means  how can i create meaning when i dont have a material
  living for others is okay
nowadays generations are turning so nutella
op just light yourself on fire a gun in those soft pathetic hands is just going to be a one way trip to veg town
  people who want to kill themselves dont tell others they dont go online to chat about it they dont give any symptoms at all usually    they just do it     so since youre here babbling on you clearly want to draw some attention to yourself why dont you call the crisis number at the top of the page and get attention from them instead theyre unpaid volunteers but unlike us theyll actually pretend to care about you
  just buy the gun and kill yourself she wont find out until after youre already dead why does she need to know youre going to buy a gun
  nothing means anything whats so bad about that why do things have to have a meaning
i had a relatively rough unhappy life filled with depression and struggle that was until i met the women of my dreams at 24 we had a year of absolute love and light together i had joy like a young child had joy for the first time since i was very little    you never know when life can suddenly turn beautiful out of thin air just keep pushing forward push forward and try your best consider reaching out to jesus for help too hes helped me a lot and he can help you too if you wish it
  thanks fren
  buy a flamethrower instead you attention whore  go out like a man
  wants to kill himself but is afraid what his mommy will do to him    jesus christ you dont seem too suicidal if this is your biggest problem
  if youd lived with her your whole life you would understand
  fuck off
  no
  tthanks chad ill just be myself and find women of dreams
  other human personification  human personification is a concept like anything else     example of common existential crisis thought   look at that airplane just a collection of matter/particles in a chaotic universe we cant even percieve in reality not colored by our inescapable perception  it means nothing  wrong  no matter how you try to get away from it  all those words are just human concepts to explain the actual experience of you observing something in consciousness while simultaneously being you you could think absolutely nothing about it and still experience it the same way or in a more real and authentic way just by allowing yourself to experience the sight/sound/internal breath happening at the same moment     how do i create meaning   you already have by asking that question you are at least subconsciously valuing the act of valuing things you think rightfully that things dont have objective or moral values outside of your perception  and that seems bad or worse than things being good to you so youve already created value and decided the value you think things have is less than what it could be     congratulations for making it that far by the way  youve gotten rid of a huge illusion many people never escape youve recognized what is wrong youre having trouble finding out what to do about it     so heres what you do  take a step back and 1 experience things authentically and 2 realize like everything else that it can be as absurd or as bad as you percieve it to be but the only thing that you can do about it is to consciously bring meaning to things within your perception you bring the meaning to things by assigning meaning to them thats the secret  and it can literally be anything the only thing that cant possibly be meaningful is the act of nonexistence because then theres no human or perspective to assign meaning to things     following
  heres something i did im 28  and i started running a few months ago i suck at it but im way better now than i was in october i can now run a 10 minute pace for just under 2 miles my normal route     is running inherently meaningful in reality no not at all is it beneficial to me sure but eventually ill die anyway so i recognize that but instead i just assign meaning to it and enjoy what i get from it  an escape an experience in nature im in co so its cold now but still enjoyable and i get to experience it     i just assigned meaning to it and it became meaningful that simple     once you start and you can start as small as you want it just gets easier to do its a skill and the existential crisis and dread just fades away you learn to realize that 2 things are inevitable you are human and you exist     and then youre faced with the choice 1  do you melt into existential goo or do you just start randomly assigning meaning to shit and experience it for as long as you have it     i can tell you what feels better  but i bet you can figure that out on your own    you dont have to run though thats a good one  you can create something write shit down in a journal you can go outside and stare at a tree or try to draw it you can throw yourself into a random career path you can go to an airport and max out a credit card and go live in thailand     you literally have all possible human experiences in front of you and the only responsibility you have is to pick just any random thing and say to yourself im gonna value that
  ive spent all day talking with you you can gather from that that i feel like your life has meaning     well youre wrong to believe my life has meaning     the beauty is you cant actually say that  because i get to decide what has meaning and i chose to spend my time talking to you and doing my best to help you out who knows if i did or if i will make a difference  i dont maybe you do     but i still get to decide your life has meaning to me and that talking with you was valuable to me     its a very basic philosophy  you can go in infinite directions from where i am right now and come to infinite conclusions about the world you can do it because you are your own person     so response or not  hope i helped if you need somebody to talk to let me know  ill make up an email for us to correspond if not  i wish you good luck and hope something i said stuck with you
  killing yourself with dignity  suicide is for pussies i overdosed when i was a kid and im glad my younger retarded self failed because if i hadnt i wouldnt have grown up into the successful man i am today do something to improve your situation instead of choosing the easy way out you coward
  thinking it was all over at 20  haha i remember that feeling  if only i could have recognized how easy it was and how many chances i had at that time i wouldnt be 31 and really screwed
  hey op dont kill yourself i lost my friend 2 years ago and it still effects me till this day i dont know your mother or your relationship with her but any son knows that his mother deeply loves him i watched my friends my grieve for minths on end and she still gets choked up just mentioning his name just want to say i hope things get bettet for your life try to remember the good times and push through the tough times you have my heart and soul brother    were ll gonna make it
  thanks anon
  why the fuck do you need to tell her why do you even need a gun to do it you can go cut your wrist in the bathroom right now if you want jump off a bridge eat a fist full of pills the truth is you arent serious about killing youself and want an excuse not to go threw with it go to counseling and stop being such a mommas boy
  wrist cutting is the most little bitch way of going outbut i dont ever get that gun its always an option
  everything boils down to assigning value to random things  this seems both absurd and complicated yet i cant do it for a longer time being i can try to assign value to something but existential absurd just erodes it quickly
  before you kys try xanax
  this happened to me except i met a dude we had a month of relationship together then he ditched me for someone else that he loved more than me    help
  welcome to guy reality
  i am a guy this was all gay shit
hi im in my early 20s do you think an older guy might like meor do you think he would be put off by my age i only like older men because they dont play video games are more social and likeable in general
im sort of ugly but here is a picture
  you look like youre in your early 30s  learn how to dress like you arent an old spinster in a failed attempt to defy her biological clock less animal print actual clothes etc
  i try to dress so i look older so maybe an older guy might like me im always told i look in my late 20s
27 and id do you op
im 47 and i dont play games  you look my type
    guys generally swerve on chicks who arbitrarily label people over hobbies or interests usually when older guys want them young they dont want anything above the shoulders just so you know    its not like young women are know for their riveting conversation pieces nowadays
when will the janitors clean up this shitty bait it smells
  47  on 4chan  son your whole goddam life has been a game  a bethesda game at that
  im prettier than you and im a man
  i think jannies on /adv/ are concerned with underage b even then only sometimes  /adv/ is just gonna sort of be notquitebutalmost the worst board i mean the sheer amount of flak and bait youd have to prune and whats left after it a bunch of sad boys who put sex on a pedestal in their lives and they all have the same problem that feel when no gee eff
im an older man but play video games is that a dealbreaker
  oof
  you look like a really boring person  id pass on you
we dont really care about what you like or what you dont we want one thing from you if we catch you flirting  your hole
my bf of 3 years is breaking up with me to see other people the worst part is that im pregnant for the second time with his child and hes forcing me to get an abortion the first time we mutually agreed that was best but it really fucked me up for a long time and he swore that he would never put me through that again how do i let go of the hatred and resentment i feel to move on with my life
op here  also want to say that we were using birth control both times the first the condom broke then i got on the pill but my dr at one point prescribed antibiotics that interfered with its effectiveness and didnt tell me 
    how can he force you do you live in a 3rd world country if not and if you want to keep it just do it
  he cant force you to have one    my ex bf tried that with me too i refused he was livid we had the baby hes 4 now and the light of my life  baby daddy helped me up until this year he was also abusive to me the entire time  enough was enough and now hes out of our lives forever   i have my son with no help or support from him and were quite happy  i also told him he was not trapped and was going to find a nice gay couple to adopt my child at first the daddy didnt want that and insisted i keep the baby and he would help me with him  he never helped financially ever and his help with watching my son so i could work was not worth the physical and emotional abuse he put me through not to mention his crazy mother was involved  moral of the story  you decide what you do at any point no matter how you think you might have fucked up in choices you can still turn it around and have a happy life  having a happy life is up to you and you alone
  keep the child  make him pay child support  or  abort  tell him youre not aborting and youre going to fuck him over with child support  pic related will ensue either way
  get off the pill that shit fucks with your hormones and brain chemistry amplifies any intense emotions like these trust me youll be way less bitter and mad
as horrendous as it might be to have another unwanted abortion think carefully about whether you want this persons child  do you really want a kid with this cunts sucky traits not to mention a connection to him and his family that will last the rest of your life
20308820  i am definitely thinking about that even if i could somehow raise this child on my own id still be connected to him and he has made it abundantly clear what a coldhearted asshole he is these last few weeks i just feel so devastated and lost and full of hatred which i know will not help anything
after the abortion she wont be able to have any more children
my family are dumb pieces of shit i mean theyre not retarded or anything but theyre poisonous and live as people who might as well have never existed in the first place i already dont take it personally so how do i stop hating them and being pissed off
  move on with your life
maybe dont treat them badly    i just woke up and brother said i woke up on the wrong side of the bed    dont be a fucking reaction
  whos the bottom you or your brother
  hah
  i feel you on the hate though    kind of weird but it is acceptable to channel that energy in enjoyable ways playing guitar working out ect
  i usually wake up on the right side of the bed and then my day sours once i interact with them they were always bad people but now theyve all gone stupid for some reason my mom went to an ivy league school yet hes one of the most foolish people i know especially now    thats a cool saying though dont be a reaction im going to think about that for a while
  i use the anger to not be like them underneath the ugly and stupid exterior im forced to wear i know that the world is an amazing and beautiful place filled with innumerous possibilities its too bad were social animals who usually cant find a place to exist without being dominated by social superiors
  dude just move out my first apartment i slept on the floor ate ramen and had a bottle of cheap wine was the best dinner of my life 
  without knowing any details     first this is one of the bigger problems any human can encounter in general  so congratulations on making it to the point of wanting to let go of the resentment and anger you harbor     the first thing to remember is that if they are not the caliber or type of person you want to be around  you dont have to be around them forever everything is temporary and so is this  keep that at the forefront     second practice mindfulness of anger/resentment instead of trying to escape the feelings and frustration you experience try to leave the situation and sit with your anger not try to escape or struggle against it this is extremely hard at first but with practice you can skillfully wield the sense of self to watch as the anger rises within you not react to it and watch as it subsides and you are left again with the feelings of not taking it personally or being at peace with the situation this will also help you focus on the exact nature of why youre mad at a person     third recognize that your family is made of humans like you and humans are imperfect this doesnt mean forgiving them immediately or wanting to engage with them for the greater part of your life but it does mean finding sympathy in the years to come on how easy it is for some people to lose their way in the world and how hard it is to exist and live this life both in general for all people and specifically to do with your family     last and most important practice patience with yourself this problem as i said is one of the bigger ones people have ever faced throughout history just below the severity of existential threats violence famine etc  because humans all have psychological and emotional needs and family/community is supposed to provide that the road you seek to be on is long and hard  dont expect progress quickly and continue doing the work even when it feels like it isnt working in your favor you will come out the other side
  good point bud i lived like that for a few years and it was pretty glorious but the economic reality of housing around here means i 20 to 25 an hour live safely wages are gradually going up here so itll happen eventually    my family is also changing a little bit for the better one of them used to drink really alcoholically and while on medication and theyve finally been convinced to cut that out since then theyve been more receptive and kind
  maybe so thanks also bud
last year of highschool and i finally wanted to turn my life around and improve my grades so that i could get into the university i want    i kept it up for half a semester but im falling behind in my english class and cant bring myself to finish my assignments anymore how do i get back my motivation i really do want to do well but cant force myself to work
  is there a question in there or are you just bragging
i want to steal things from a local kaufland store    how do i stop myself from wanting this i am not even stealing something worth stealing im just poor and i dont want to spend upwards of 30 euros for 4 aaa chargeable when 9 euros can buy me up to 25 kg of white potatoes    long story 3 years ago i moved in with my gf we had some pretty fucking rough times we had money only for potatoes some oil cheapest shittiest bread that cost least per kg we had a few months where all we ate was potatoes barely salted because we didnt afford salt and wed have only one kg of it so it had to last wed use the oil over and over and over again until it would turn brown and the potatoes would start having this shit taste but we had nothing else to do or eat sometimes wed have the great pleasure of affording pasta with condiments  water nope nothing special or amazing just literal boiled pasta with around 3g of condiment mixture per 150g of pasta amazingly shit taste but at least it wasnt potatoes all over again especially not the crap tasting ones    we had this store at the edge of the city i became desperate my pay per month was barely cutting it i mean wed only allow ourselves to have up to 15 hours of light per night really lucky we managed to get an 20w bulb that offered 100w worth of light somewhere around 1400 lumens if i remember lasted us a whole year before it died wed shower 4 times a month her 6 because of period and for like a maximum of 34 minutes each shower in the dark btw wed let the shit pile up in the toilet until only a bucket of water could dump it pretty fucking rough were in a second world country right now that was about 3 years ago    anyways the only thing keeping us together being the will to live  fight this store at the edge of the city was a pretty large one 2 employees in the store at all time 3 employees at peak hour
  tldr fucking hell long story lived in worst poverty of my life stole 3000 euros worth of goods now today i stole 50 euros worth of goods after i promised my wife i will never do it again    tomorrow im going again for a bigger catch what the fuck do i do
  how are you posting on the internet right now not judging or accusing just asking
how are you not in prison yet
  firstly what country did you live in to be this poor     if you keep stealing you will get caught    get creative and find a way to buy some local tradition craft and sell that shit for crazy money on etsy     i remember buying this gandolf looking pipe from the ukraine it was super cool and didnt cost much but 20 usd would probably go a long way for you wouldnt it  find a way to make money any money  hell put up a kickstarter to help you get a university degree and see what happens    what would you want to study if you had the chance
    always extremely safe never once have i behaved suspiciously always did it with family in mind      that is an actually good idea a friend of mine is a shopify guru makes about 300 bucks a day only by buying shit online and reselling it much more expensive    also id want to study the forex market but it needs actual money so its a no for me
people say they like to hear me talk that i say interesting things and seem knowledgeable and often that im funny too  what could/should i do with this and how can i  ps i am pretty severely depressed
  what could/should i do with this and how can i    what do you mean like start a podcast or youtube channel
  yeah something like that  or whatever other professional avenues there are to go down
is there a blog site of some sort where i can post 100 anonymously regardless of my ip address using tor probably there are some opinions i wanna express but dont need any of the credit directed at me
you child molesters will be the first against the wall
also why cant i see any images on this board right now not the case for some other blue boards
  im condoning it not promoting it i just dont want to put it on twitter and go viral
  dont want to be a figurehead basically as arrogant as that sounds
should i go with my plan  i realized that high school ends in 6 months and that nothing will matter after that i psyched myself up to try and get a girlfriend by then  now theres this one girl in a different class we had no interactions at all and she maybe doesnt even know my name but i find her really cute i chose her because she always seems so lonely and sad now i see her at school maybe once every second day or something but i never have a chance to talk to her one on one   ive devised a keikaku an exam is coming up and her class already had the test should i randomly follow her on instagram and ask her if she remembers some questions and just start a conversation with her   the problem is how did i find her ig why ask exactly her i know how i found it by stalking but she doesnt know her picture is not her and i follow like 140 people i feel she will think im a stalker should i do it    ive decided to make a change and i think that this is a good start should i do it or is it too creepy
i should add that she probably doesnt even know my name i do have friends but im never in the front im always in the back because im introverted
come on anons im desperate
  i see her at school maybe once every second day or something but i never have a chance to talk to her one on one    then just talk to her even when you/she is with other people around  just straight up ask hey did you allready had the exam in x subject    maybe if she is shy she feels better talking to you when others are around
  we never talked before and im shy as well would never work if there are 5 people from her class near why ask the one i know virtually nothing about
  we never talked before  you need to start somewhere or with that logic you wont talk to her ever    if there are 5 people from her class near why ask the one i know virtually nothing about  when there are others around her you can direct the question to the whole group but look at her while you ask the question not staring but focus your body language at her
  and what about the plan i have is it doomed to fail
  i know how i found it by stalking  enough said    if you wanna go with that plan make it more believable or actually get her ig from her or a classmate of hers    i dont know enough about the technical stuff of how you add/share friends and stuff for example if it synchronises you phonecontacts
  you just request to follow she accepts or ignores     ive sent her and she accepted it and even followed me back im happy now for the phase 2
    now for the phase 2  allright case closed wrap this thread up bois    i wish you good luck
  the bois are just the 2 of us  shes typing the questions she remembers as i type this how do i segue this into casual talk
  i think asking about the test is a bad plan while you can springboard a conversation she might react negatively i at least get a bit pissed and annoyed when someone i dont talk to suddenly asks for help with a test or notes or something even if their intentions were like yours it comes off as lazy and that youre just using me surely youve heard her talk in class either in class discussion or to other people in the class what are her interests if you dont know ask some of the people she does talk to then ask her out on a date doing something related to one of her interests if nothing else ask for her phone number/insta and talk to her later in the day asking her out then theres no reason to beat around the bush when you talk to her ask her about going on a date in 10 minutes or less in my experience the quicker you get to the point the more likely shell say yes
    shit too late oh well good luck anon
  i at least get a bit pissed and annoyed when someone i dont talk to suddenly asks for help with a test or notes or something  well shes typing it out and it seems pretty long is it safe to assume she dint react negatively if shes typing a lot just for me     we dont have any shared classes
  maybe do you have any ideas on things she might like if nothing else you could always just ask her out to coffee or dinner somewhere after getting the answers thank her for her help maybe throw in a compliment then go for the date just ask what kind of food she likes maybe frame it as a way for you to thank her
  id say its going pretty well after she finishes typing try to make some conversation with her and then you can talk to her more and more both through text and in person although you gotta make sure you talk to her more in person than through text after a while you can ask her if she wants to go out sometime dont wait too long though
    ive said something along the lines thanks wow that seems like a lot its a line where she can end by just saying no problem or continue by responding to that seems like a lot so ill see how ti goes
  dont rely on her to keep the convo going you are the one who should make conversation
  she responded no problem 3  but the heart may be just because i sent a heart when i wrote the thank you   im asking about another exam just trying to keep it going
    eh  id say the point of the thread is done so thats why i said that    i hope it doesnt sound salty but you took none of my advice and just did what you wanted to do before you made this thread so i guess anything id say from now on would be just wasted energy anyway  also it looks like others started to be interested as well and maybe they give advice that resonates more with you  so good look with them
  i didnt mean to disrespect you it was just that i didnt see your response in time
okay weve talked a bit about tests well see how this develops thanks for answers even if nothing happens im still happy i went out of my comfort zone and tried it
  make sure you ask her out soon that way you either have a date or you have rejection and can move on winwin
  im rooting for you anon and im proud of you for coming this far
  im extremely scared of rejection       thank you
  if youre rejected then at least youll be able to say to yourself hey at least i had the balls to say what i needed to say trust me not doing anything is worse even when you fuck it up i still have some dreams related to the same and what if i wasnt such a pussy on that exact moment question and thats been wandering in my head for like 2 years a goddamn parasite that wouldve been evaded if i did something on the right moment  please anon try as best to swallow your shyness and ask her out  i dont know why but this exact same situation reminds me of densha otoko
  talking to girls on the internet  never do this    hey there my names anon whats yours  oh i just figured id get the name of the cutest girl in school before we graduate  wry smile    this might work assuming you can fake confidence long enough  if not your failure wont be remembered very long even by you
  i may try it need to get closer to her first       its a small place if i was 1 on 1 with her i would do it
anything wrong with staying in my bed after work everyday   i hate work but need the money and being a lazy cunt keeps from going insane

nuclear is my first choice
i dont see how global warming is such a problem literally just make more cold air and pump it into the atmosphere
  a big chunk of co2 isnt from powering the electrical grid its from just everyday consumer habits whether its buying a new chinesemade iphone every year or eating fresh tropical fruit in the middle of winter in canada    the way the average firstworld person lives now they live better than a king from the 1500s or whatever back then kingdoms would go to war over things like salt and pepper you pick that shit up from mcdonalds next to the plastic straws and napkins      but really theres no solving climate change and we dont even know yet what the real consequences of climate change will be this is 200 years of industrial pollution only now starting to manifest itself in obvious ways it has plenty more of catching up to do
in the broadest possible terms we need to uproot capitalism and implement socialism to change course from catastrophic to manageable climate change    the things we do as individuals although meaningful are nothing compared to the pollution and havoc big corporations create    you can and probably should recycle walk or bike or use public transit more often eat less meat and fish campaign for policy changes and vote for more environmentally conscious politicians in city state and national government etc but the best thing we can do is make a concerted effort to organize and overturn an economic system built on infinite growth and profit for a few to the detriment of billions
  not to mention that there could be a massive boiling point so to speak where a huge part of the ecosystem just dies off in a relatively short timeframe theres no getting around that solving it would require going back to the stone age relatively speaking but i doubt human civilization would exist at that point
  and where would you dispose of the energy you take from th air to make it colder  inb4 hurr durr a joke post
  could be or maybe some fucked up diseases surface up from the melting arctic ice or maybe its just really windy a lot most of the time    im not a nihilist or some kind of ecoterrorist or have a boner for apocalyptic scenario and i do think that mankind is clever enough to at least adapt to these changes whatever they might be    im gonna do my part to not make it worse but im still going to enjoy myself and modern society
make more clouds
  use that energy to make more cold air you retard
  actually wind is expected to become weaker significantly so wind itself is caused by the earths thermal dipole and if the north heats it reduces the energy difference
the world has seen global warming and climate changes forever it has been recorded throughout history  thats not to say that we shouldnt be good to environment sure we should plastics is a much bigger problem its large corporations that need to be accountable first and foremost
  run via is on their way to your crib dude youre too dangerous
  its an everlasting gobstopper of politicstheres very little incentive to actually solve what gets you elected over and over again the simple fact is that there are too many damn people and it isnt possible to reconcile concern for preserving the environment with the death cult of eternal growth as long as the meme of we have to grow the economy persists youll see continuing damage to the environment to fuel the expansion  the only way you can grow the size of the economy is by increasing consumption and the most reliable way to do that is to increase the consumer base      nuclear is definitely needed for a transition away from fossil fuels      what i fear is that climate change is too longterm and limited in its impacts to cause enough backlash to humans the sad reality is that it simply wont be damaging to most people not in noticeable ways and the alarmism of climate activists while wellintentioned is just a bunch of hysterics to get people to care about something that barely impacts their material wellbeing      socialism is hardly the only solution such a system would probably erode what little humanity has by way of caring for the environment by atomizing people and making them less inclined to nonselfish thought i agree inasmuch as growthoriented capitalism is shit but the solution needs to be authoritarian on a scale matching the problem and thats a means rather than an ideology
the planet has seen its ice caps melted and it has seen the near entirety of its surface covered in ice climate was meant to change and man believing that they need to control it shows its inherent weakness and insecurity on this planet instead of trusting nature and letting go of control it chooses to live as a stranger on this planet treating the natural world as something that needs to be constantly beaten into submission  diving headfirst into a battle it will never win    all plans to this point that have been devised to combat climate change have been economic constructs which will not create any impact with the exception of redistributing wealth amongst the countries of the world if your politicians were serious about climate change legislation would be passed to cap co2 emissions instead you get cap and trade where a felonious carbon backed currency is created by the very bankers that have exponentially inflated the value of your money away for more than a century    what we can do quite simply is to allow the natural homeostasis of the planet take care of itself while simply stated this would take a monumental shift of our relationship with the outside world and with ourselves and at this time in the age of narcissism it cannot happen
  you underestimate the impact the natural world has on our lives take ocean algae it produces 70 of the oxygen on the the planet all that would need to happen is the ocean becomes too warm for it to adapt and boom mass die off it would be beautifully destructive to the earth fish die off literally all of japan and south asia enter mass starvation jellyfish blooms have already become commonplace and are increasing due to climate and fishing desertification of the western us and boom a majority of our foodsource turned into sand the effects are countless
  figure out how to make money doing so theres no other realistic incentive
  the red sea can already get extremely warm over 90f in some spots and very rarely below 70 and life thrives theregiven that global ocean temperatures are well below that theres a significant buffer between temperature rises and the collapse of an ecosystem im not denying that the effects to global ecosystems will be massive im just very skeptical of the idea that humanity as a whole will feel that impact take out one species of algae and another one fills its niche the process of change is too gradual to allow for doomsday shifts as an example we are tracking the steady northward movement of a number of arctic and subarctic species in the north american pacific only the far northern species are suffering large losses since animals there have nowhere to go     were worse than cockroaches when it comes to surviving disasters of our own making dont get me wrong i hope youre right that we see at least one thing that kicks us into taking this seriously i just dont think itll happen realistically
  no its not humanity itself that would die off its civilization were expected to lose it around 13 years from now by the point anything significant happens it would already be too late to do anything yeah the world has some heat tolerance but at the trajectory were going now its going to get exhausted pretty soon
stop geoengineering and solve overpopulation
my gf is hinting towards me getting her some kind of pewdiepie bitch lasagna merch for her christmas present i dont watch his videos and they are personally not my taste but id love to see her happy im trying to find this merch but cant find it anywhere could i get assistance with this
  use google
  also give her lasanga say its made of bitches
  this  unless shes a veganfag
  vegan lasagna is probably possible im not vegan but i guess it would require a sub for cheese
  vegan mozzarella cheese is a thing that exists but it tastes a bit strange
  vegan mozzarella cheese is a thing that exists  stop promoting this shit there is no such thing as vegan cheese just like there is no such thing as vegan burgers etc they call it the same thing but its just shit they ruin food with ideology and word games
  i tried to go from vegetarian to vegan a few months ago to lose weight but vegan food honestly tastes like shit and i found out a lot of it has a shit ton of calories anyway
official      unofficial        t googler
in every aspect of life of course
  i like the 5 minute rule
  recently i experienced a very drastic transformation  this is a nice idea and all but where is the long term proof assuming everything is factual he could have relapsed a week from posting /
1  make timed short term plannings of realistic goals it can be for example working on something from 1000 to 1020 if you anticipate you wont do it plan something else instead    2  remove from your vocabulary things like try maybe probably and replace by i will    3  respecting your own word should be easy afterwards if not dont blame yourself for poor execution blame yourself for poor planning
no more 4chan
  read anything by buddha
  i cant leave this place
when i study i close my phone and computer into a closet works pretty neat
  same
can only get erect through physical stimulation visual doesnt work when i watch porn if i dont play with my penis it will only rarely get erect without me touching it    should i go to a doctor    what is wrong with me
some dudes just need to work it a little to get hard    i personally get boners instantly but i got a short penis
  stop watching porn still masturbate imagination otherwise youre fine you should start worrying when you cant get erect through physical stimulation
  this is a good thing its embarrassing and a pain in the ass to be a guy who pops wood just by being around/seeing people
bump
bump
  stop touching yourself   go eat right and workout
nothing wrong with you im the same its rare that i get hard just from thought usually after i havent fapped in a few days also stop with the porn
  actually thats pretty good fra
  the same as in you watch porn and can only get erect if you jerk it
bump    anyone else with similar problem
are you all kids this is not abnormal sometimes you just need stimulation especially irl some bitches are just ugly
  depends how turned on i am usually i have to stroke and if i do the boner goes down quiete fast
  yeah same i dont think its normal im a virgin and im worried that my first time will go terribly wrong
  bump
  i came in 2 thrusts during my first time we laughed about it and did it again shortly after you got to chill worrying just makes it worse stop watching porn and death gripping if you do that there is lots of stimulation when you are fucking her so dont worry about it im pretty sure its all nerves in your case
  honestly cutting out porn and not jerking off for a little bit 24 weeks helped a lot with this youre used to the same stimulation and need to lower your threshold while also getting more in touch with your arousal
  you had the same problem and fixed it  explain please
bump
stop watching porn and stop worrying about shit before a girl even touched your dick jesus christ
bump
  similar problem but i dont get excited with visuals the problem is not just erection but visuals too decided to go on no porn no fap two weeks to start
  but excitment too
  and how did it go how and when did the problem start
  i probably have this problem from years ago but i noticed it last week when i was in a very sexual situation orgy level and felt nothing im virgin but not asexual and this is stressing me a lot also im considering to lose my virginity asap as porn has been my only sexual factor all my life and its really causing me problems 22yo btw
  being upset that porn doesnt get you hard  perfect reason to just stop watching it then dumbass
guys the truth is that i am not very talkative that we say i want to talk to a girl i know it sounds stupid but the problem i have is not how to start a conversation also that there are always silent moments when i talk to people  loneliness i think i fucked
honestly the way i stopped being scared is by forcing myself to talk to people its a skill man and you gotta train it just like any other skill if you talk to one new person a day eventually youll be a master at introductions i wish you the best of luck man take care
hi sorry for posting here but i need to get a haircut and i was wondering what kinda style should i get and should i bleach itblack and white and i have no beard    thanks l
shave the sides to a 1 have the fade higher than usual cause it makes the head look more square than round which is your face type  do your hair like youve got it currently but its far too heavy on top and a tad long i assume thats wax and not grease put wax in your hair then comb the fringe over instead of pushing it with your hands  either way its the bushy sides which ruin it for you
  can you shove me pic i am stupid xd and yes that was wax
honestly nothing its good     i may be biased though i also have longer hair all though i dont style mine and it just curls and look like deku
  nice cool to see people still have long hair yeah i was thinking of getting a haircut like a pic down below but i have no idea what to tell hairdresser
  ah yes the l hairstyle i can pull it of pretty good when i push it all to a side after washing it while its still wet   for the l hairstyle you have to let it grow more youre already way of your way let your hair fall over your eyes try not using product it gives a more natural look and can make hair look longer other than that try blowdrying it in a direction it makes it look fuzzy and will stay like that  the air from the drying will make it look natural   other than that do the thing i said i do when i want to have his hair    im 
    also do your sides only in one direction in your picture you seem to have done the top to the right and the leftside to the left instead do right right or left left  again let it grow a bit more people underestimate how long his hair actually is its a few months away from raditz
  thanks for the advice i will try that will report in week xd
  with your current hair you can do a near maybe just run through it with your hands dont use product and let it dry naturally  after washing it just shake like a dog instead of using a towel dont comb it dont style it dont use products dont blowdry it 
  ok i can try that too but i am going to aim for l hair it just looks more cool xd
didnt you make this same fucking post like a month ago with a chick as the pic instead of whoever the fuck that is
  do you mean all to left with hand only
  you mean this  i am going full emo
  other than that i have no idea what are you talking about lol
  why are you asking this again ted cruz werent you satisfied with the answers from your previous thread
  dude hahaha stop bullying me xd as i said i am going now emo style i look too much like a nerd
  like this     anime haircuts look good in pictures but not in real life
  never going full normie sorry bro /s  i just dont think it would look good on me because my head is big
  listen dont be a fag if you ever want to get laid or look remotely attractive dont get some gay ass emo anime haircut and dont bleach or dye your hair women are into short natural hair go to a professional ask them what would suit your face the most and get it cut big hair like l makes your head look even bigger and stupider
            do not listen to this fucking faggot     never get a npc hairstyle
  wow you definitely look better now you looked like minecraft steve
  women are into short natural hair  professional will just shave on 0 but i am going to ask them just to see what they think never the less thanks for the advice
  your head isnt big it looks bigger because of how heavy your hair is trust me      nothing more irrelevant than someone with a shit haircut  npcs have no self awareness of how they look
  thanks for the roast xd
  trust me whatever the professional will do will sure as fuck be a lot better than how it looks now and how youre trying to make it look
  do you even understand the npc meme    its better to be unique and stand out even if only 1 person likes what you do she will go for you if you are like everyone else you get compared to them     and i can assure you much more than 1 girl like longer male hair
  ayyy my man youre making progress keep it up
  shave the sides of your head trim the top  dont get a skin fade you look like a pencil neck
  ayyyy going to neck my self
  yeah will ask a pro about that and a long hair but i am not going skin fade thats for sure
unironically show them a picture of l and say you want to work to something like that
please please please do not get an anime cut
  fuck i will have to find someone that looks like l i cant just go there and show them anime pic i live in slovenia a normie country
  why bro let me see how you look
  because hair doesnt work like that in real life dont get an anime haircut you fucking weeb
  billie joe armstrong from green day he changes his hair a lot but there are some times where it looks like ls
    id say this looks close
  
      you cant pull of that hair style if you want to be a normal member of society  when you are selling music internationally and raking in scrilla then you can look stupid
  fuck both this and the billy joel armstrong haircuts look fucking horrendous for the love of god op dont do this shit to yourself please
  why whats so wrong with having little longer hair than avg npc but as far as i know girls like ling hair
  your hair looks like spike spiegel if it was real  deku is also applicable 
    if you think billie joe armstrong looks bad you have no eyes  the dude is 46 and has been stealing hearts of many women around the world you can only wish youre like him
  holy shit that is accurate
  not really no most women dont like long hair and when they talk about long hair its like flowing locks of hair like fabio and shit like that not some weird gross emo haircut that no one but cartoon characters can fucking pull off dont do it it looks awful
  op just need to grow it a little more  you need to be blessed with curly hair for deku tho
  its because hes rich and has talent not because of his hair
  bakugod hair  decuck hair
  was he also rich in 1986    they had their breakthrough with dookie and that was in 1994
  i find it funny how bakugo talks trash about dekus hair but his hair is just spikier and a bit shorter dekus hair
  do you have any example where it looks awful
  the video you showed me listen it doesnt work on him and it doesnt work on you
go for the longer sherlock   is also pretty nice if you can pull of that look
  dude if it doesnt work i am going to cut it why not experiment when i still have hair
  nah i like more l look
  then  is pretty much the closest you can get to l in real life without looking weird as fuck
  will take that pic and l and ask a pro what he thinks and also will take that npc pic going to post here tomorrow when i get a haircut
  if you show  youre going to get what you want but its basic everyone has it you will be compared to others a lot if you dont have something unique why would women go for you instead of chad 36 over there
  if you think billie joe armstrong looks bad you have no eyes  you can find people who look like him in shitty metal bars near universities they are all unemployed celebrities can have virtually any hair cut or look because they have fame and money it doesnt make that look cool  celebrities also have teams of people to do their hair and all sorts nobody needs to wake up 30 minutes earlier to rape their hair with products that will get ruined with a hat/slap/short walk in the rain
  i better not my uni is full of those hairstyles 
  nah dude i was being genuine you werent ugly in you last thread but the stubble looks better than totally clean shaven keep up the good work
how do i leave the toxic thought of incels r9k racism antiislam the redpill etc    ive been apart of all these hate subreddits and websites for so long ive been on 4chan since i was around 13 i started browsing r/theredpill when i was 1718 and ive also been hooked on racist subreddits like r/coontown for years     i just want to let all the hate go i just feel like its eating me up inside and ive become such a bitter and twisted person    i dont browse these sites anymore except for 4chan where i try to stick to more open minded boards such as /adv/ /fa/ /ck/ etc and avoid r9k and pol like the plague the problem is i feel like its not enough and that this terrible way of thinking is part of the way i think for example today i saw a kind of unnatractive white guy holding hands with an asian girl and i just thought to myself what a stupid slut probably one of those whores who fucks a different white guy every month to feel alive i just hate that i had that thought but i couldnt stop it i feel like a lot of the stuff you read on these so called redpilled sites makes sense or at least in your mind you can rationalize it to make sense and after you take the redpill it becomes impossible to forget the information you learned even if its hateful twisted and probably untrue its like once your older sibling tells you santa isnt real you can never go back to believing that he is    i just want to let it all go and try and become a happier and more normal person but how can i change the way i think
dude im so glad to hear you say this happy for you you will release it i believe in you man
  dont forget youre here forever
how though understand that we all have these ticks in our minds where we think lies towards other people but acting upon that tick and not is what seperates over time you will find that your misgivings were infact misgivings and the ticks will get more and more silent
ive been on 4chan since i was around 13  youre doomed my nigger
  anti islam  a bad thing
  yeah they werent lying i still love this website and it feels like a second home to me ive met people on here who are for the most part normal and balanced which makes me wonder where ive gone wrong      thanks anon
im a female who browsed those boards for years since probably 13 or so it warped my view of the world sincerely  stopping browsing is the first step so youre on the right track the next is correct destructive and mean thought patterns i remember phrases when i think mean racist or sexist things like practice compassion the dhali lama maybe spelled wrong has some fantastic quotes out about compassion look at your fellow human and realize that there is so much to them that you cant see even the real fill fledged whore the literal prostitute who sells her body for heroin practice compassion she is probably so fucking sad and so broken and just trying to not kill herself she was probably abused growing up whether repeatedly or just a few times sexually practice compassion feel angry at the slow and loud black man walking in front of you maybe hes exhausted and was taught that loud  masculine and thats what he knows especially when feeling threatened  the next serious soul searching maybe your mom didnt verbally abuse you or anything like that but maybe instead she lashed out when she caught you masturbating mumbled disgusting or maybe she paid you zero attention or maybe fellow classmates were fucking horrible to you basically practice compassion to yourself and figure out why you feel this way
its not enough to stop going on those sites actually challenge your way of thinking learn what other viewpoints have to say read arguments against redpill stuff
  this brings up a big issue for me i cant tell what is real and what is something wrong that my twisted mind has convinced me is true i want to be able to look at something objectively and make a conclusion obviously everyone has their own bias and worldview that forms their opinion but i feel like mine is very messed up i think islam is dangerous in my mind and that other people more welladjusted than me can draw the same conclusions
  probably untrue    yet your real life keep prove you than aside the cringy behavor of the aderents there is some truth in the ideas you want to repel    if your mind know something is true you will not be able to reject it i would suggest to accomodate to a solution in the mid point keep a lighter version of the redpill the minimum your mind can live with and reject everything else return to the bluepill is almost impossible
resist bro resist youve been living with some fucking dark energies for a long time and its not gonne be so easy to dispel those demons of yours but with time which is a great tool and gift btw you will be able to
  ive become such a bitter and twisted person  im just glad you posted the fedora pic for me casual racism and sexism is not twisted you fucking 12 year old baby boy nobody fucking cares that the most carefree part of your life was on cringe college build a bridge and get the fuck over it loser
  i did that and i just became a nazbol
  so do it again dummy
  im not a casual racist i genuinely feel disgust when seeing a black person and seeing a black man with a white girl fills me with rage you clearly have no idea how bad people here can be so why dont you take your generic dad advice over to reddit
  thanks ill try this
  unlike you im not a blind soft as putty retard who lets clowns on the internet influence my every thought you need to log the fuck out of life you brainslurped dipshit hurr durr i get mad when i see a nigger your rage must be some real pussy white boy shit considering you havent shot up a school yet which other people on this very website have youre such a bad boy anon mustve gone out of style considering youre a permavirg
  it takes time and practice
  oooh what an edgy villain you are 
  now you know how you look
  le college is bas meme  le build a bridge meme  muh real man pussy shit  youre cringy as hell and not interested in helping the slightest so why are you even on this board
  thanks anon you made me feel a little better tonight since at least im not hateful enough to type shit like this out to strangers on the internet 
  why to be an edgelord of course once he is the lord of all the edges he can finally move on to bigger things in life like biting cacti and hissing at the sun
      absolutely shooken  case closed my work is done here
  points to what people have said drops the mic creative genious truly secretly he just ran out of ways to say fuck you
  i found 4chan around age 13 too i was lucky i did have blindspots but i usually saw through the wasted energy people put into hate anger perversion of just plain deception and manipulation i was used to toxic environments already so it was easy to say hey theres neat stuff here buried waistdeep in bullshit good thing i know how to handle bullshit so well    not wanting to be think like those shitheads is a good first step youre right that its hard to unlearn you already let it become a part of your thought processes theyre intrusive thoughts they come without you willing it and wont go just because you want them to    so you need to think against those thoughts prove them wrong if you can that helps but just thinking to yourself that the truth is something different works to it takes time but if you make yourself repeatedly and deliberately disagree with those toxic thoughts and think something else that you can believe in that helps a lot   youre basically giving yourself a targeted alternative to all the bullshit you learned from r9k/etc and making sure every time you think like that the better alternative comes up too actively remind yourself the bad one is wrong and give yourself reasons to believe the alternative
  this might not help you anon but here it goes  well i also found out about 4chan in a very young age poisoned my mind and ended up as a shutin foreveralone incel with literally no social interaction outside 4chan  i always thought all the incel and /pol/ crap were exaggerations funposting is fun but exaggerations about women minorities etc etc  i started turning my life around recently losing weight starting college getting my license etc  and all these shitty toxic things i thought were exaggerations almost all true   i always thought /pol/ is exaggerating/ /r9k/ is spouting bs but when i got out there i saw that /pol/ was fucking right and /r9k/ isnt that unjustified after all
  thats the most outrageous bs ive read in some time either you are lying or the most gullible person alive
  how about starting to think for yourself instead of taking everything written by web trolls as gospel
  how am i gulible if i thought most of /pol/ and /r9k/ shit was bs before i saw for myself
  as i said you can be lying second your perception does not mean truth in any sense you could be a raving lunatic for all i know and see the world in a severely skewed way what you see as truth and what is truth are in fact two different things
whats so good about islam do i need to remind you that in islamic countries homosexuals are hanged that muslims have never apologised for 9/11 and they actually think americans deserved it look for a muslim that actually spoke against islamic terrorism they never really do all they do is say we are not terrorists but they never actually speak against terrorists   islam is also extremely mysoginistic in some islamic regimes women are not allowed to study the same as men do so that they can more easily be oppressed   if you believe islam is a good thing you are probably going to remain stuck in the incel and r9k mentality and thinking about women as objects you have to own
i hope you idiots are just larping and havent actually got indoctrinated by something some random troll wrote somewhere in any case its not the websites fault if the userbase is not intelligent enough to think for its own
  this islam is cancer
1/10 made me sage
go outside and realize 99 of the shit posted on this site is blatant lies
  when youre so weak minded that you get brainwashed even when you openly state youre not falling for brainwashing
  name some things that are posted on this site that are lies and post some proof that they are not lies  many things that trigger you retards are actually true yes i do go outside meet people and have friends
i think people who fall for this shit are weak minded honestly ive been coming on 4chan since i was 14 im 29 now i knew it was full of autistic retards then and i still know it i come here to laugh at how deranged some people are never once crossed my mind to start thinking like them why would you want to theyre all so miserable
  nice fallacy if a miserable person tells you 224 i guess its time to start denying math too
  whatever helps you cope loser
  i can tell you are insecure
  but are they miserable because 224
  read about projection then read about political solidarity
  well im certainly miserable i just go to /r9k/ to confirm my biases
  be hikkineet for 6 years  go to college finally  all the girls are literally orbiting chad  the fat lonely kid in the corner looking hatefully at the others  girls in class talking only about chad is mine im telling you stfu bitch im trying to listen to the lecture  literally impossible to fit in with any group because theyre all tight knit already even though its been a month  normies only talk about sportball nothing else ever  at least most people actively make fun of sjwisms and actually roasted a lecturer when she tried to present something as racist  but other than that /r9k/ was pretty fucking spot on desu
  thats true about sjws idk why 4chan pretends normies are sjw when in reality normies have that why should i care mentality and actually hate sjws normies are more traditionally homophobic and sometimes racist
  fedora  hate  im confident youre trolling or seriously mentally ill  im aware of the issues of racial conflict and stats on interracial violence i left /pol/ for trs long ago and continue to accumulate redpills it has no effect on my interactions with black people at work church or recreation    a religion about world conquest but more importantly practiced by shitty people as an excuse to prey upon others
so this is the power of the alt right bwahahahajajajajajahhahahahahahah
  this is such bs im 28 years old in uni and i was able to fit in just fine sure i dont go to frat parties because i feel out of place there but im living it up in the local bar scene there are some good points to redpill shit but that story is delusion rosecolored glasses whatever the fuck you call it
  identifying the issue is the first and best step to solving it go for a walk listen to music you like and chat with older people they have stuff to say eventually you will learn that r9k extremism is childish and eventually youll get a gf
  duh thats because you are a normie
  ok bye enjoy your lies
genuinely cringe thread no matter the intent
  name some things that are posted on this site that are lies and post some proof that they are not lies  why should i even bother its clear from your post youre not interested in seeking the truth youre just interested in proving me wrong  im not asking you retards to give up your ideals and join a cult its literally as easy as going outside and seeing how people interact in real life
  you leave it by leaving your room  seriously ive been here since i was 13 or 14 as well /pol/ mainly i still believe in that stuff since it is factual and you cant not believe facts   the thoughts of incels and /r9k/ are wrong but the underlying cause is correct they just blame women instead of realizing that men control the world and always have some women not all or even many act like whores because its what they think men want if malethots stopped and the culture shifted back to being more conservative women would follow  because they are natural followers    i have this same issue but its actually a blessing you i and others like us are constantly challenging our worldviews use that to your advantage sometimes i go on /pol/ and argue for things i actually believe in and then in my head ill argue against them other times ill argue against my own beliefs on /pol/ for sport  this isnt an issue or a negative unless you make it one    also youre probably just socially awkward i want to live in a white america sure and i understand that blacks generally have lower iqs yes but i still treat blacks like humans and dont chimp out ironic around them same with women   turn your anger into self betterment
  glad to see you trying to move closer to the light op as other anons have sugested actually engage in other peoples arguments look up youtubers like contrapoints shaun three arrows and destiny dont take their word as gospel either i dont fully agree with any of them but expose yourself to what actual evidence looks like not meme graphs with no sources actual studies made by neutral parties and not christian think tanks  also when the intrusive thoughts come in actually force yourself to think what evidence do you have to justify all of those asumptions you will find that more often than not you are just proyecting fictional stories you heard on 4chan on random people as if they were characters     good luck op
  name a flaw with the nazis economic or political policies
  they made the jews into victims now they are even more powerfull
    i think i read somewhere that eastern religions think of kindness as necessary as water kindness is like water and bhuddism is like tea you dont need tea to live but definitely water gratz on being a kind person this world needs more of that and less assholes with pain in their heartts and mind for sure
you made it out the 4chan maze congratulations    now put your energy on things that bring you happiness
  islam is a backwards religion whichs followers abuse the freedom of the western world to spread their retarded ideas
  there is a decent person here     wow good to see
    you were just biased by all the propaganda you read so you were more likely to interpret all of your social interactions in those terms  you were probably socially inept and misreading social interactions too as is often the case with people that pedal this kind of shit and its useless trying to argue with you because you will never acept that maybe you jumped to conclusions like its imposible to convince an incel how ridicoulous it is to think that women dont want to date him because of the size of his wrists      whats so good about islam  very little is good about islam like with most religions but your comment is so retarded i needed to respond to it islam is shit but you are a retard    do i need to remind you that in islamic countries homosexuals are hanged  like it happens in any country that has christianity in their goverment too we are better because of secularism not because christianity is so against killing gays    that muslims have never apologised for 9/11 and they actually think americans deserved it  are you retarded how on earth would an entire religions apologise when was the last time christians apologized for anything made in their religions name    look for a muslim that actually spoke against islamic terrorism they never really do all they do is say we are not terrorists but they never actually speak against terrorists   completly false ive seen entire mosques speak agains terrorism and stand in solidarity of the victims saying that there are individual muslims that condem terrorism goes without saying have you ever looked it up or are just taking a right wing nutjob at their word for it    islam is also extremely mysoginistic  just like christianity     in some islamic regimes women are not allowed to study the same as men do so that they can more easily be oppressed   just like christianity did less than a 100 years ago
    ops just a naturally kind person so much so that he instinctively knows that incel/pol talk is something that doesnt fit his person such a person is very valuable in a way that cant be measured in worldy currency
what i do is i find another outlet for my stress and anger i try to workout or maybe practice guitar and it helps a lot i used to be very into r9k and pol but i had a reality check when i was looking at myself in the mirror at 21 got my shit together and havent been on those boards since
  im jealous i finally stopped being a shutin neet and went back to college but its making me feel even worse and much more hatefull  how did you find the willpower to hit the gym
  regardless of if they did it or not blaming a nations failings on a specific ethnic group is retarded only autistic racists think ethnic groups are so homogeneous in belief and organization that they can intentionally sabotage nations
  regardless of if they did it or not  regardless of if they committed genocide or not is what i meant to say
    still waiting for that flaw take out the holocaust and there is nothing
im not sure how you stop hating women and other races without hating islam that does sound like quite the problem    hope you find a solution op maybe you should try endless whataboutisms and apologetics for an iron age war monger that masqueraded as a prophet
  i was on 4chan since about 1314 too im 24 now and i truly pity people who hold those beliefs    i think it all comes down to entitlement and generalisations dont act like or be fooled into thinking that the world owes you anything be grateful for what you have and work for what you want how other people carry themselves does not concern you    and generalisations any time that you believe in stereotypes of any kind youre allowing yourself to be biased before you even meet a person let go of that and learn about the nuances of each person you meet everyone is different regardless of their background    other than that just focus on being a decent person and look after your mental health if you truly feel like you cant let go of these negative thoughts on your own seek professional help
  youre shitposting we get it
  its succes hinged entirely on a massive unprecedented military industrial complex and a perpetual state of war to keep going even though attempting as much proved to the world that this was an impossible feat that left the population of europe literally decimated and the continent destroyed
this is why underage retards get banned stay the fuck off 4chan if youre a stupid underage kid you dont belong here
i started 4chan when i was 12 and it became an hoursaday thing stopped using it maybe around 18 but occasionally revisited it here and there long spaces between unplanned visits over the years almost 23 now funny that we talk about 4chan like its a drug and it kind of is     any way probably good to just leave it the reason i stopped was because like you i realized theres a crapload of toxicity even on the good boards     if you want to change inside its helpful to change the outside as well where you go who you hang with what you look at what you listen to these all have effects and so you should really weed out the stuff that feed the bad qualities within yourself starve the bad stuff feed the good stuff    over the past 5 years i spent about one total at a buddhist monastery not as a monk and so i would say that living in some sort of wholesome communal setting would be super beneficial i think the monastery abhayagiri in california is the epitome of the ideal community without the creepycult or blindlyfaithful qualities people tend to associate with religious communities and so i would recommend visiting but im biased point is that while i was there i got to meet with people that i could look up to and learn from     without a doubt it changed the way i think and in fact i learned how to not think and just feel things and see things instead naturally as you age your thinking changes but your thinking can go all over the place think rightwing to leftwing the monastery made my thinking just stop and settle down right in the center ie with meditation i remember there was a point where my mind became less inclined to label things and more inclined to just take it all in and let things speak for themselves and it was incredibly refreshing that really helps when it comes to relationships    pic related me on left

what can i do to overcome my obsessive guilt    i wrote some unkind posts about a couple of people online a few years ago due to jealousy frustration and childishness i managed to get the worst removed but there are still a handful online on archive sites    i am planning to email one of the people to apologize and ask for forgiveness he doesnt know who i am or anything i was also hoping to email the second person to encourage them in what theyre doing but im afraid they will see my name and join the dots up and realize it was me who wrote those things    every day i think about this for at least two hours and at this point i am mentally exhausted and deeply ashamed and sickened by myself and just want to commit suicide since i no longer feel worthy of being alive    i would appreciate any help or advice youre willing to give
bump
you have no real problems and nothing you said carried any real consequences
  how do you know that for certain    even if true which i hope it is i am consumed by guilty at the moment and right now im home from work and my mind is in overdrive obsessive over the fact i cant remove these negative posts from the internet and that i am a terrible person i really am struggling right now
how do i stop the biological urge to find a partner it get in the way of many things in my life
  gets
  when something starts you must see it through  ergo find a partner
theoretically you can do a lot of things that may work to some extent you can look into buddhism and meditation and the idea of removing desire you can try to find some higher goal that will be more meaningful to you than relationships you can try to make a very busy schedule and load yourself with so many responsibilities that you dont have the time to think about relationships      realistically you cant

ive been dating this guy online for a few months now i love him but i wonder if it would work out he lives so far away what are your experiences with ldr are you living together now did that person change or disappoint you in any way i just wonder if the guy i know is the real thing
e relationships arent real relationships i waited until i met my gf irl to ask her to be my gf and when she had to leave again it stayed a real relationship due to the real experiences from irl i think   it might work out if you guys can meet up somewhat often the longest ive gone without seeing my gf is like 4 months and now im going to be seeing her monthly since plane tickets are lower after christmas then shes going to move in with me this summer   if its online with no plans to meet and no plans to be together physically for a long time its not going to work
ive been in an ldr for 4 years hopefully moving to her in april we were living together for a few months and it went well but i wasnt able to pick up a job out there so had to move back before i blew through all my savings the time i was with her was great didnt disappoint me at all since i moved back to my origin it has been harder since im feeling lonely again    probably different for everyone just like in normal relationships if you move to him make sure youre properly prepared for it have a couple jobs lined up ready and an emergency place to stay in case it doesnt go to plan its really heart wrenching to have to leave
  it was 3 years before we met in person
isnt it hard to wait for so long until you can meet though i dont when ill meet him
ive been trying to move with him but it is really hard i have to leave my family and pets behind some of them are old i wont see them again if i leave i do love him a lot but what should i do
how do i get a mail order bride and is it a good idea just out of curiosity i want an asian one since im done with white women in general and i dont mind having some other races but asians wives are usually loyal and love you no matter what right
  no they dont  stop believing obvious lies you gullible fool
not true just go hiking or something in foreign country and try and connect with women naturally helps if you can learn the language i suggest mexico
quick i meed impromptu conversation starters with a girl

post about how its a waste of money youre happy you figured out after amount of yeats before you dropped out before spending even more on student loans and that you make 300k as a plumber on 4chan
bump
  bump im 18 failing my first semester because school makes me depressed pursuing a creative project that might allow me to drop out and have a new job otherwise im fucked
im 25 turning 26 in a few months is it weird that i never seemed to have connected with any girl on a deeper romantic level for my entire life there are girls that i find attractive but never ones that i feel like making the effort to pursue further in a relationship
what are your interests do you ever expose your deepest interests to these women or do you hide it from them
  video games photography hiking    i dont really hide my interests either its just i dont seem to feel any spark with any women ive ever met i have many friends that are women but to me they are all just friends     i guess my real question is how does one know when they found the right girl
  dont focus on right just focus on being with them if u played video games constantly asking yourself do i like this video game do i like this video game forever then you wouldnt enjoy it just play the game or just be with the girl the right one is created you grow and change together you grow apart it happens you grow the right way thats good but obv u need to be growing from the same base find a girl not necessarily exact same interests who is accepting and willing to try ur interests go from there
 it comes naturally and it can just occur and the emotion of this is the one can come    its not really something that can appear until you find someone    attractiveness is what people can have but a deep emotional connection that can drive you two to be inseparable is something more of a true relationship that you can love and feel a connecting bond    otherwise its best to live your life and talk with people and see what happens usually all lovers are friends before they meet or some just click like that in a day like me     hope for the best for you anon
me and my friend both like this one chick its been a while since hes told me he likes her and nothing has happened like i dont even think she realizes how he feels should i make some moves i dont wanna lose him as a friend but i feel like i will if i do
easy rock paper scissors
friend or best friend some people are merely friends and dont qualify as bros bros are those who you would do anything for punch a kitten in the face for type shit that is what bros are if hes your bro you dont ever break the sacred rule of bros before hoes    otherwise if he is just a friend fuck him for not making a move get you some
im not gay or trans but i thought about how much easier my life would have been if i was born female and whenever i look at cute girl clothes i always wish i could wear it im a straight red blooded man but i like some cute girly shit  is this the tap water and plastic bottles  what do
  im a straight red blooded man  but i want to wear dresses   doesnt add up
im /fit/ and have a gf but id still fuck a trap if i was single  wanting to be that trap is gay though
  well you sound like a fag and youve more than likely always been like this you need to put yourself through a stress test to prove if you arent as gay as you know you are deep down inside
  fucking hell im the same especially with the clothing part
you dont have to have a vagina to wear pink clothes  but people are still gonna know youre an faggot
  but thats not cute and it also makes me look like a faggot
i feel ya dude   im a red blooded male too but people seem to think im a faggot just because i like to dress as a french maid while my daddy sticks his 9 shaft inside my body  its just a stereotype well live with just get used to it
this ones a bit different but im going to a party tomorrow on a boat its a byo my goto for byos is always to bring a bottle of vodka and some juice but the stupid boat doesnt allow any bottles of spirits on board    so it doesnt seem like a big deal to get something else except i have some restrictions  i cant handle fizz/bubbles it fucks my stomach up and i bloat like a balloon and fart everywhere which is not cool for parties  i wiped out on wine twice which makes me associate wine with puke i cant drink wine    that eliminates like 90 of alcoholic drinks to buy beers and ciders have bubbles wine is wine rtds are always carbonated    do you have any suggestions for what i can get thats not a bottle of spirits and not fizzy
where is the line can you bring liquors that are around 20 alcohol
  dude just premix ur vodka with juice in normal bottles
  where is the line can you bring liquors that are around 20 alcohol  im not sure its not specified my guess is is if you go up with a 1l bottle of smirnoff theyre not going to let you on board but i dont know if there are going to be really involved drinkchecks this is my first time on a partyboat      dude just premix ur vodka with juice in normal bottles  fair enough suggestion but i dont have bottles and i dont think ill be able to get any before the party
  drink bitter  do they have pic related where you live
i cant talk to my gf about my feelings as soon as i do she thinks she is not doing enough starts blamming herself and then proceeds to get mad at me for the fact that she got angry before she will proceed to not talk to me for 2days    thats happening everytime i express my feelings to her how im feeling or anything related to how i feel and stuff i need maybe ill be stressed out about something so i talk to her about it    she always has me there for her but i dont feel i can count on her in my weak moments if i do seek her help she will eventually end up mad and not talking and behaving like a kid would for the next 2 days    thing is she was a virgin and i spent the last 4years with her supporting not financially and encouraging her to further her career and so on    as for everything else she is close to wife material    should i marry somebody like that feels very selfish sometimes where ill listen to her always and help her but i cant hardly count on her for that  am i supposed to need that in a relationship  or men just dobt need to express or feel just do
  does she have an alcoholic dad or something
she needs to go to therapy or leave her
  curious question a bit of context  we are in vietnam im spanish she is viet she is the nerdy black sheep in a market family she reads mangas while her siblings gossipher father duns money loans loves to lend people money amd have them owe him wth interest  her mum is a simple woman but is cool    i dont like her father much she has always been kinda rejected in her family most asian families have tough fathers in her case is the opposite he is very relaxed and throws her at me and tellme to go away with her haha    she is the nicest most empathic person ever to everybody except with me 
  i dont think i can answer the question then im just thinking from experience and our societies are different
  am i supposed to need that in a relationship  yes but dont break up with her because she cant help you you have to talk to her about it if she cries she cries tell her before you start talking that it is something you think is hurting your relationship and need to be addressed and tell her that even though you expect her to cry this conversation will save both you some weeping later on   now she knows that she is messing up somewhere help her fix it get her a book that deals with that issue and read it together  good luck anon
  that sounds pretty unhealthy you should break up tbqh
  father is a baller who controls the money  women hold their tongues and are property of the father  she doesnt respond to my feelies   you arent man enough for her traditional families like that need real values to stay under control
talking to your gf about your feelings  youre just asking to get burnt
so ive met this girl about 3 months ago she moved here from abroad and is staying for a year she is bisexual and in her first relationship with a girl for about 6 months mow    this girl comes over to my flat often because she is friends with everyone here and sice the beginning she has been very touchy with me it started with hugs and sitting on my lap but slowly it moved to these hour long intimate sessions together    we have very deep and intimate conversations and we also get physically more intimate so i kiss her neck hands belly etc whilst she caresses my head ears back etc    the thing is that so far weve always been very sweet to each other and not overtly sexual so im not sure if she actually wants to have something with me even if just a kiss    what do you think is the best approach should i sit her down and talk about it wait for when we are alone again and shoot my shot other options i havent considered
bump
  shoot your shot trust me shes looking to get dicked doggie
  we have very deep and intimate conversations and we also get physically more intimate so i kiss her neck hands belly etc whilst she caresses my head ears back etc  at a time like this just take it a step further and give her a real kiss and see how she reacts dont wait much longer before making a move
  hahahah bisexual shes 1000 a thot anon stick your dick in it make sure to wrap it up also protect your heart and dont fall in love

you just gotta put yourself out there force yourself to do things its pretty painful but it beats sitting around alone think of it as a visit to the dentist it may be mad uncomfortable to go to then but if you put it off for too long your gonna lose your teeth
get some confidence anon watch some videos about charisma on youtube they helped me a lot i try to worry less about what other people think and just say the things that come to my mind anxiety is the ugliest personality trait showing confidence will have a really good effect on women
  i definitely second this i think one of the biggest things is just realizing women are just people just because she has a pussy doesnt mean that you cant talk to her like anyone else if you have trouble talking to everybody then the other guys advice works for that too
i ate out a girl for roughly 45 minutes yesterday and when she was begging for my dick she only got it for a few minutes i felt bad because she was enjoying it    do i have to use viagra at the ripe age of 20
  just jerk off or get a handjob beforehand
  dont shove it in and out like in the pornos that will only make you come quickly and wont do much for her you gotta stay all inside and keep pushing your pelvis into hers so that your hard dick keeps rubbing against the wall of the vagina she can have multiple orgasms this way and you will have made relatively little effort when you push push with all your body
  dont use viagra you might become mentally dependant on it when you masturbate try and do it slowly stretching out the time before cumming as much as you can it helps build endurancedoing cardio helps to not get tired too kegel excercises help become aware of a muscle that can stop you from cumming for a whileuseful when you need to last just a few seconds more    this is some good advice    good luck anon
  vigara    wait so you couldnt get it up or you just busted too fast if you cam early then viagra wont do much    do you smoke and/or dont do any cardio exercise        this also dont try to fuck her as fast and as hard as you see in porn pretty much ignore or do the opposite of everything you see in professional porn    obviously you can go hard and fast if thats what she wants but for gods sake take it easy for the first 510 minutes and go from there
  you only take viagra if you cant get him hard that well forget all the shit youve learned from porn its useless nasty and gives you a false idea of sex since it only panders to male fantasies if you want to learn some shit watch women friendly porn
  i went slow for like 2 minutes and she asked me to go faster i came shortly afterward    any recommendations for finding good women friendly porn
think about non sexual things when you first start fucking her untill youve made her cum and shes had enough then focus your attention back on her body and cum  i usually start thinking about all the things i need to do for work and reflect on things i can improve some people visualize 3d shapes and make them spin apparantly it requires alot of your mental capacity
    joining the question  any recommendations for finding good women friendly porn
i asked my boyfriend what he does if he feels like hell cum and he said that he usually switches positions or stops just a bit and changes the rhytym
  promotions
  im not watching porn anymore but i watched shit like that    
  see      also there are many how tovids on pornsites and amateur vids are also good pro porn is shit i swear
just fuck her again a few minutes later  you could stay inside of her till you get hard again

tell me how bad it is    tell me the truth about this nose no matter how cruel and raw     should i get a nose job
gime one from the front senpai
many nose jobs result an uncanny dissonance where its a perfectly good nose for someone elses face if you do go with a proven plastic surgeon if you cant afford it fucking wait because a bad nosejob will trash your looks for life men dont actually care much about reasonable noses and the ones who are obsessed with noses are psychos to avoid    that 3/4 view doesnt give us enough to work with full frontal is required if you look average from that angle leave nose be
  jew nose is cute embrace your flaws anon
  i will need to see a pic without your shirt just to be sure
well if i had to judge just by this picture alone id say youre cute and would mostly ignore the nose    definitely a flaw on such an otherwise cute face though be glad that its such a small issue
  looks decent from these ones but then look at this
  this pic is shit post better frontal picture
meh its not a pretty nose but it doesnt turn you into an undateable uggo on my scale from 0 to 1 where 0 is wouldnt fuck and 1 is would fuck youre a 1
  last one please
  post feet
a bit large on the tip but not suited to digging truffles a few millimeters worth of contouring on the very tip could look better bridge and overall width doesnt need changing and if changed incorrectly would be considerably worse not large enough to be a real liability and it has a bit of character im not saying character the way someone trying to boost your selfesteem would my comment is purely esthetic     now before you break out the chainsaw and angle grinder spend a few hours checking out every modified nose you see on the internet and remember the reasons you noticed them     two things to ignore when seeking esthetic feedback  incel white knights who instantly say youre just fine the way you are   idiots who shriek kill it with fire they arent getting laid at least not by humans    when choosing a nosemod do not imitate hollywood thots no person worth being with is into that shit its a question of art you want the flesh artist your surgeon to create a more proportional tip not make a weird micronose and produce an end result where the nose and rest of face work together to lure you the bbc or whatever youre searching for     we are terrible at seeing ourselves as others see us take front and side views both sides and open those in tabs when comparing other options you wont make an accurate call if you visualize your nose as larger than it really is find examples of older ethnic art paintings can work well suited to whatever you are not photos this time but to see how similar features look to an artist youll thank me later
  thanks anon this comment sounds very honest
  tell me the truth about this nose  it can sniff money from miles away dddd
you have a perfectly fine looking normal nose plastic surgery would be a huge pointless waste of money for you
some useful reading        poor preoperation planning  lack of precision in placing incisions  excessive extraction of cartilage and bone from the bridge of the nose  damage to nasal tip cartilage  excessive extraction of septal cartilage the septum is the wall of skin dividing the nostrils  unnecessary or poor use of skin grafts    take care and be in no hurry
  it is and its accuracy is testable look to classic art and youll promptly see what i mean
  dont get surgery you are cute as long as you stay fit youre good to go i like unique looking faces anyways
  this for science do it for science
    a straight noseback and a smaller nose tip would go a long way    t been in the same spot some betas did the duh youre fine the way you are hurr thing but postop literally everyone said its looking better already while it wasnt even halfway healed and still partly swollen
  are you male or female
  both of those things were said to stroke your ego why do you believe one but not the other
  confirmation bias people who have cosmetic plastic surgeries are mentally unwell and it has nothing to do with their physical flaws
  judging by the non english lettering in the background im gonna assume youre not white or at least not western european in which case you look fine dont worry about your nose stop attention whoring on 4chan
  this one is beautiful
    because ive never heard someone tell me you looked a lot better presurgery        i dont have physical flaws anymore kek
  sorry guys i am not trying to attentionwhore here i really feel deformed disgusting and masculine i dont even smile because i feel uglier i am almost obsessed and want to look at my nose in the mirror all the time i always need to look at peoples noses to compare to myself    where i live everyone has small pretty noses and plastic surgery is common among women     i just want to make sure i posted the right pics and not just ones in which i accidentally looked decent
    ultimately the only one who can judge your nose well are 1 you and 2 your surgeon and by all means since its about your face dont look at the price tags but check credentials of the surgeons you are interested in and make sure the surgeon actually does nosejobs not all of them do
  you look fine you retard youve just got a kinda mediterranean and/or middle eastern nose literally nobody cares your i havent slept since last tuesday eyes are a bigger problem get some rest and eat healthy
    its called not wearing concealer not that guys would know anything about that    in b4 some dudes start posting celebrities walking around who dont look as amazing as they do on the red carpet after 4 hours of professional styling so they must be not wearing makeup too yet still look flawless
  either way stop whining about your nose
    not op sorry
  you look perfectly fine ugh  do you get bullied for your nose or something i didnt read the whole thread  i get made fun of for my chin even by literal strangers on the street  anyway have a nice day
  shut it down
  i dont even smile because i feel uglier i am almost obsessed and want to look at my nose in the mirror all the time    thats why i suggested what i did in  those who arent careful get unsatisfying outcomes and if you have too much removed because you obsessed its more time/money/pain to sort out     take active measures like studying your options to get good medical care you need to be an informed patient and take nothing for granted
  careful now
  ignore all the sycophants  if you have enough money get that schnozz tapered to a point  your face is cute youve got lovely eyes but your nose is not so cute  get someone to cut that fat bulb off and girl youre a looker    heres the caveat though some people can see through what you look like now and see what you could your potential is great so some people who can see through the nose end the bulbousness   they can see you after surgery even before and they still like what they see     depends what you want i guess
op    i love bigger noses yours is amazing there are guys like me out there you just have to look love yourself
no its fine  youre cute
  no its a cute nose lots of dudes like noses like that
    man you are a really good person judging entirely by this post
  just get a boyfriend then you will stop worrying about your nose
        can you post a picture where youre rubbing your hands together
     you are cute very cute in some of the pics    your nose is a bit big aestheticly if you have kids they may feel weird if they have your nose before you fixed it to fit in    the only people who give a shit are you and people that are uttery disgusted by slightly large noses and there arent that many    you would definitely be better looking with a better fitted nose assuming the guy that does the job does it right    but what do you want to be better looking for yourself is the only correct answer and there is nothing wrong with that
the absolute truth is that yes your nose is oversized and abnormally bulbous its also true that most guys would not pass on a girl they liked solely because of a schnoz the guys that would you wouldnt want them anyway so then its also true that the real problem here is your perception of yourself and obsession over physical imperfection make that your goal to love yourself and to appreciate yourself as the flawed individuals we all of us are the difference between overcoming this problem by hacking off part of your body and remedying the way you view yourself cant be understated surgery will not teach you the important life lesson we all should at some point learn
  honestly it seems totally fine to me and i wouldnt change it  perhaps being black im less likely to see a nose as too big so maybe my opinion doesnt count      incel white knights who instantly say youre just fine the way you are    some betas did the duh youre fine the way you are hurr  yeah first step of a convincing argument is to dismiss the opposing point of view as insincere
  maybe get a skin whitening job
gimme an eskimo kiss
  i think youre beautiful and your nose adds character to your face
  to be completely brutally honest anon  dont worry about it i also have a big nose turns out my boyfriend absolutely loves it if it bothers people they probably didnt matter anyway
  im a girl who really hates my nose too ive wanted to get it done since i was like 12 but ive never been bullied for it and everyone says my nose is fine the way it is and i dont need to get it done i guess were just too hard on ourselves because i dont think yours looks bad at all
  not bad enough to warrant spending that kind of money
    you look fine nose wise  but those nodules on the inside bridge need to go they would put me off and if i was honest  i think they put you off too and have a lot to do with your dislike of your optics     get them sorted  shouldnt be difficult or expensive then really assess if you are really that right about your nose in the face of everyone who says your look is cute
          pretty sure i read your diary as required reading in high school
  because ive never heard someone tell me you looked a lot better presurgery    theyre not going to say that when youve already had it done and cant change it back its like when your friend gets an ugly haircut you tell her it looks cute even if you secretly think she looked better before
your nose is not a problem    i really feel deformed disgusting and masculine i dont even smile because i feel uglier i am almost obsessed and want to look at my nose in the mirror all the time i always need to look at peoples noses to compare to myself    your reasoning is i feel this way because of my nose which is understandable to be more accurate would be to say i feel this way in spite of my nose though it might feel wrong    your nose is a good way for you to understand bigger issues that you have a normal nose like yours should not cause feelings of deformity or disgust if you give your nose less attention and devote more to your life exercise friends hobbies etc then your nose becomes mentally smaller or less important    i know its not easy but the most practical solution given that your nose is a little bigger than average and not disfigured is to put a lot of effort into other areas of your life to make sure that youre confident and really engaging with life if you were living a typical neet lifestyle the surgery wouldnt change anything after that surgery youd want more surgery    surgery is an option of course id even suggest researching and planning it in the meantime but surgery is best when its arrived at calmly its better to get surgery under the pretence of i would look better with this done than to attach a lot of baggage to it i need it because i feel deformed and disgusting    for me thats the issue i dont want you to get surgery out of desperation only to find that youre the same person as before the surgery
anon ur rly pretty your nose is cute and doesnt make ur face any less pretty dont worry about it too much 3   im not a boy or gay girl so dw im not just saying this to get in ur pants
  god damn you ugly mf you really do need the attention here dont you fuck that nose and fix those alien mutant lips and manjaw
  incel detected
  yfw your gf can smell a hard dick a mile away and by the time you get to her house shes already waiting in position
  im not a boy or gay girl  youre worse youre just some basic slut worried about more competition once shell get rid of that snout cant fool me toots
i have to a read 200 pages by tomorrow and have to write an essay on those 200 pages by thursday and i just cant do it  i have adhd bad so i have to take adderall to accomplish it but the adderall makes me feel really sick and groggy if i dont do the essay im not sure if ill fail the class but my grade would definitely tank   i have a c in every other class and my grade tanking would destroy my gpa even further making it impossible for me study abroad in australia and new zealand which was what i was most looking forward to this summer all of this hinges on my ability to complete this and it seems impossible  i have felt groggy sick and incoherent for a week now and it is killing my motivation to get anything done my sleep schedule is out of control as well this post likely makes little sense but i just feel terrible about everything right now  and this is only my first semester of college i am terrified of what is going to happen when i start taking more difficult classes and i dont know how to retake control of my life
whats the book you might be able to find a decent summary even just reading half of a quartera summary will help
  half or a quarter
  the latino threat by leo chavez the essay is only 5 pages so the book itself is mainly what im worried about
  im in the exact same position been contemplating whether to take adderall or not since last night
  i need to find something new to help me focus adderall just makes feel like shit so much
  yeah i know ill get a ton of work done for about 34 hours when the adderalls at its peak but the next day when i wake up if i can even go to sleep ill feel like i got hit by a train so do i accept half of a good day in return for 2 bad days or just not get work done
  well being online is the best option
so a girl asked me whats wrong that guys lose interest in her over time in the span of 34months even though they want to be in a relationship with her i kinda dont have any experience with it so i told her that maybe because they dont meet irl often it makes the relationship not become stronger physical contact with each other would strenghten the bond and she replied by saying if the distance is the issue why even bother with such relationship in the first place whats the point of it and that the time and enegry spent on this failed relationship would be used more efficiently by her on some other stuff is this really the cause for this issue the usual activity with her just consists of texting and sometimes phone calls are just both sides not strong willed enough to keep this up
yeah i believe meeting up irl is essential for a good relationship plus i find when i text for too long i see the person as an algorithm like a bot that auto replies and i lose interest
its hard to know what being in a relationship with someone will be like until you actually do it that being said yes physical proximity tends to be a major factor for all the obvious reasons
ok 4chan made me slightly bi not gay but anyway i am conflicted about this bicuriosity since i always thought of myself as straight guy on one side i think i should just accept it but on the other i realise that this is just fantasy i am attracted to and whenever i am looking at a dude irl i am repulsed i am 100 sure i am not attracted to men yet when stumbling upon trans or gay shit im fucking captivated and horny as soon as i come to my senses i am disgusted and remind myself that i wasnt attracted to this stuff how come is it psychosomatic or did 4chan showed me my true self
  yet when stumbling upon trans or gay shit im fucking captivated and horny  youre gay im sorry
  but i enjoy vagina much more and when thinking of fucking or being fucked by a dude irl i am repulsed there is nothing attractive in it for me irl but on a video its different
  but on a video its different  youre going to start shoving things up your ass soon
  well you are not gay unless you actually have sex with another man if i was defined by every fetish i have now and then i would be the most degenerate thing on earth truth is we all have fetishes they dont define your sexuality though who you have sex with does
i was bi from the getgo 4chan just broadened the spectrum for me a bit
  i think this is how it is for me as well as a kid i had some thoughts but always brushed them off as something wrong since in the country i was raised in being gay or bi is something looked down upon so i always repressed it now when i moved to america and spend my time on 4chan this bi curiosity opened up again i am not sure if this is a mindtrickery by american liberals to control birth control and make people gay or i should just accept that i am bi and live on accepting it tho will be much harder because i really dont want to be a faggot
  you could steal my line im not a faggot im bi technically that only makes me half a fag
  how is male ass play gay its the male g spot  if you imagine some guy ramming your ass then yeah but if youre only doing it for the feeling its not gay at all
  does ass play count
  well imo thats pretty gay but again strictly speaking only fucking another man or letting him to fuck you will make you a certified homosexual
  but if youre doing it for the feeling and not the thought of a cock in your ass
  this is the reason you are gay
  nigga thats gay
  research shows that gay men are not attracted to traps you arent gay
    you think liberals mind tricked you into being gay thats fuckin stupid anon
normalization through repeated exposure more extreme tastes due to normalization
so my friend is being a cunt bc some shits goin down in his relationship with his girl bc hes being kind of a cuck towards her i feel like hes in the wrong here but if i side with her hell yell at me for being a dickhead or some shit so should i just go with what i really think or just go with him were good friends and this is a pretty small problem    just wondering about the thoughts of /adv/ anons
  dont meddle with a couples shit
  be a friend and support him    or you know root out her anus with your flesh probe
just like stay out of it try to avoid it
you could handle this peacefully if its a small deal than dont go static over it just show your opinions about how you feel as a friend in the situation he might not give a shit but that shows how much of a friend he could be maybe its best if you get involved once it affects him/her in a pretty big way that hurts either one dont be afraid to say what you think friends can just be stupid as fuck sometimes anon
if a badass tyrant space chick like this existed in real life what would it take to score with her     i like shooting for chicks that are way out of my fucking league and i need some pointers
  woman here anon if you want this to actually apply irl tell us what you mean by way out of my fucking league    as for the actual question you asked youd need to be a powerful person a warrior most likely or someone of royal blood at the very least preferably both  someone of importance its necessary for you to be a challenge to her in all ways mentally physically and in pure value or power in the general/societal sense    that is unless she likes weak boys like you someone she can control ill admit theres something attractive in that its a bit of a power trip for certain women generally though people are the opposite in private as they appear in public ie lady in the streets freak in the sheets goes both ways people desire what they dont usually have  if a badass tyrant space chick exists shell probably want to feel weak small and vulnerable in your presence shell want to be dominated and overpowered though dont take that desire for a willingness to roll over for you she wont make it easy for you to win
  good answer
my dick bends downwards at a half point when erect something like pic related its not 90 degrees but its pretty curved   ive no problems jacking it but will i have problems having sex
  you need to be 18 to post here
lemme suck it
  i am you faggot       only if youre of the opposite gender
  virgin kek
can someone answer
dont fret about it women like variety and she will find yours reaches the parts other dicks dont     also be very wary of letting a surgeon at it better to just shove it in a blender  unless you think you might like a non functioning abomination
  none wants to hear about your bend duck chris
doggy style and reverse cowgirl are going to be great
well i have a curve exactly like this and quite a small dick and many girls say i was the best fuck theyve had dont worry about it
well you can always try out to turn upside down while fuck
be me   crush on a guy  try to get him to like me  he sometimes responds   usually not  try anyway  get ignored  okjpg  after 7 months of chasing him find out from his friend that he has a gf     can someone please explain to me why some people wont just say that they are taken or not interested like he didnt even ghost me completely accepted my friend request and ocassionally talked w/me giving me false hope and just having a gf all this time why
  so incase his gf breaks up with him he has a talking relationship with you he knows you want to fuck him so youre on the back burner of incase i need pussy
  because he thought you wanted to be his friend
  can someone please explain why girls cant just come out and say they want to fuck to get this shit out of the way
  he isnt a fuckboy       yeah but if he wanted to be my friend then why ignore me give me cold shoulder that isnt how you treat friends
  isnt a fuckboy  so hes not a man 
  i didnt mean he wanted to be your friend but that he thought you wanted to be his friend he was probably just pitying you and eventually gave up trying to pretend
  he is a man not a thristy boy      nice projection ive never done anything pitiful or creepy
  lol im saying he pitied you because he thought you were weird and lonely girls dont chase after guys generally   im not trying to be mean just saying that in this situation he did nothing wrong
  girls dont chase after guys generally  not after 4chan incels
  first up hes doing that in case his relationship is fucked or because hes being polite    you shouldnt think of it as he was giving you false hope or something maybe u got toooo much into ur attraction to him that your brain made u feel like hes feeling the same way common thing to happen    stay away from him and dont talk to him first ever again remember ur not the one to hold warm if his gf isnt the one for him youre in the upper position so dont let him play with u sista
  just keeping a background option senpai
  this      that is not a fuckboy way of acting thats what many people sadly do in relationships both male and female  besides if someones massaging your ego by showing you attention why shut them down
      i agree but its not like saying hes got a gf would make her not want him anymore its being honest  if he breaks up op will still be here wanting him in both cases
the odds of any given woman other than my gf being into me are low enough that 9 times out of 10 telling her sorry not interested is just going to make me look like a fool on top of that girls try to be subtle about that shit so even if i know what shes doing shell have plausible deniability and a motivation to get back at me if you want an explicit rejection then ask an explicit question and not just heyyy wanna hang out ask him straight up if he wants to go on a date and if hes not into you hell tell you unless he has a reason to think youll turn into a psycho if you get rejected
  just saying you are taken turns off potential thirsty people but nasty people never admit to that bc they know they wouldnt lose attention
  this or he is a beta who doesnt have the balls to reject thotties
  why didnt you take that hint
  some people cant read hints i cant tell whether someone really likes or really dislikes me until they tell me so im not even autistic just not that good at social stuff
is guitar easy to learn    i dont want to play anything complex just wanna learn to strum slow songs to myself as a hobby like the one below and improvise         how many months will it take
not gonna listen to your song as im at work but you could play some open chord songs within a month of an hour a day learning guitar in the beginning is difficult because of chord shapesbeing able to press down hard enough to have the strings ring properly especially on an acoustic the feeling of this is inpossible my fingers hurt is a good sign just power through it and one magical day youll go this is easy as shit
fuck it i listened to your song you could play that within 2 weeks of never having touched a guitar
  seriously
  that song sounds simple but it has a lot of hard decorations ill tell you my experience since ive gone from nothing to something at guitar recently  before i decided to learn guitar i knew how to play the piano eg fig leaf rag and had mediocre experience with music as a whole it took me about three months of playing every day for a few hours to get somewhat consistent in switching basic chords consistently and id say half a year to play a simple fingering song fluently i didnt really train though i mostly just played for fun until i became better and after the first three months i dropped my playtime a bit   i suggest you find songs you like that are simple to play and just practice them try to dodge songs which contain bar chords because those will be very hard for you to play in the beginning songs that you can sing along with can be motivational because it easily gives you the sense that youre playing the real thing
  no you cant at least not in its full form you could maybe play a simplified version without the hard techniques afterall it is really slow and not very complex
thanks for the info all    should i buy nylon or steel
  steel is more fun gonna hurt a lot more tho
  i recommend nylon classical since youre an absolute beginner its cheaper so you risk less if you decide against playing and its a lot easier on your fingers prepare for a lot of worn out and painful fingertips on your left hand  the only disadvantages are that classical guitars are more quiet and its not really worth it to use a pick on them
  nylon classical and make sure to hold it in the classical way when youre first learning  with a guitar  stool  too that would be my personal rec
  my bad look up guitar foot rest thats what its called
but you can play all genres with both nylon and steel right
    on the other hand steel acoustic guitars are much louder and have a stronger sound in general they sound a little more piercing and of course metallic songs like the op will sound better on an acoustic guitar
  all genres that use acoustic guitar
  yes though some may sound better on one or the other the difference will do nothing for you until you can actually play something though and learning will definitely be a lot more enjoyable on a classical guitar
trust me buy an electric not an acoustic youll regret not getting electric
    oh right you obviously wont be able to play electric guitar songs with the full effect using a non electronic guitar but thats a whole different choice
  as i said i want to play slow guitar songs heres another example of what i want to play        so im thinking that nylon strings may be better for slow mass music    also how well do electric guitar songs translate to acoustic    for instance can i play this on acoustic    
  this on acoustic you can only play acoustic on electric you can play both
sorry op may i ask a question  theres a really fast solo in my favorite song and im unable to tab it out  is there a service i can pay cause its been a whole year and still cant figure out this one figured out a bunch of other songs tho
  fuck off cunt electric guitars are for fags who just want to feel like a cool rockstar
  i meant slow sad music not mass  cuz i think nylon sounds more emotional and uhh soulful
  go play wonderwall with your autistic guitar
  you cant get the sound of the second song unless its an electric guitar
  can you buy an electric and use it as an acoustic if yes whats the catch
  it doesnt sound as good or as loud but yes   if you like indie rock rock metal math rock emo rock etc get an electric one and download guitar rig / amplitude on your computer
  you wont get the exact same acoustic guitar sound out of an electric even with using certain effects but you can get a nice clean guitar sound from an electric
  is switching guitar types easy  for instance if i start with classical nylon can i move to acoustic steel and then electric easily or will it take a long time to adjust    i feel like if i should pick something and dedicate so much time i should stick to it
  you can
  depends transition from electric to acoustic is harder than from acoustic to electric electric plays easier and allows you to do all kinds of wacky shit you cant do on an acoustic
  yeah i suppose an electric would be best for you im not familiar with the electric world but from what i understand youll have to fuck a lot with settings to get the right sound for each song if you want to get an electric i suggest researching the inner works a lot more    as for translation to acoustic and nylon the most important thing is that it loses a lot of the immersion and background noise that comes with an electric the wwwwwwww kinda sound that often gets under peoples skin you can still play it and it will sound good but maybe not as youd like to hear it here are two examples of what i think are acoustic guitars playing the first is from my country and the second is english      
  do electric guitars always require power or an amp i think i like the portability of an acoustic more since you dont have to carry extra equipment with you
  yeah the styles are pretty different they almost feel like different instruments
  it will take you some years to play well but it is a nice hooby i started playing guitar and bass 13 years ago i never played on a band or took clases i only do it for fun i suck but it doesnt matter cause it is only a hooby after all
  this is true   and also this   its hard to choose without experience i chose classical because i liked the simplicity and portability plus i wanted to use my fingers not a pick with an electric using a pick is pretty much a guarantee
  can you play jazz or blues on classical nylon and a few pop songs
  few months if you are talented 1 year if you are normalfag     first your fingers have to be used to play strings which biologically happens after a few months then you should learn to play power chords which implies your index finger has to be strong enough to press all the strings then the last thing is to learn theory chord shapes and finally scales if you want to play that song i would look for a phrygian dominant scale or any similar variantsgypsy hungarian and so on it gives you that exotic feeling
  it depends op i barely play any strumming songs because i like do play fingerstyle songs nylon might hurt a little less but it will still hurt a had a nylon one but didnt like the sound it wasnt as sharp as the covers a liked to play so it was demotivating in a way so i stopped but bought one with steel strings years later my fingers didnt have calluses anymore but they stopped hurting after about two weeks so its not that bad as for getting an accoustic or electric again it depends on the kind of music you can play acoustic on an electric but it wont be the same for example you cant do percussions like in this video    
  learn to press chords hard enough  cant learn how to press soft enough  my frets are absolutely fucked and i only had my guitar for two years of sparse playing    you dont have to plug an electric into an amp if youre just playing for yourself in a quiet bedroom youll get enough sound out of an unplugged electric
  open chords are easy bar chords are hard
  acoustic guitars are for fags who want to larp as emotional artists
  continuing on from this and about that song you posted youll need to learn a few intermediate techniques    alternate picking  slides  bends    alternate picking is easy enough to practice but may take some time to get into a solid rhythm    slides are pretty self explanatory    bends are absolutely absurd on acoustic guitars you generally have to bend alot harder than an electric guitar to reach the right note     youre better off with a decent classical / nylon string guitar if you dont plan on buying more of them down the road theyre alot easier on the fingers
  why would you play fingerstyle on a steelstring guitar this seems like a bastardized form of flamenco or classical either of which should be done on a nylon eliminating the need for a thumb pick    kino shit  
  just preference dude as i stated in my post i started playing to play the fingerstyle covers i liked to watch nylon sounds really good too ive grown to like it a lot i just think that for more contemporary music like pop or even edm covers on the guitar i find the sharper sound to be better as oposed to nylon which is a lot softer
  i use classical though
  yeah of course you can play anything on anything but every time you use a different guitar than in the original the sound will obviously not be the same in any case whatever you play will not sound exactly the same as the original the guitar sounds different when youre actually playing it
  can the majority of people who dont play a guitar hear the difference between nylon and steel
  i dont think so if you put them side by side then of course but mostly its similar wonderwall intro is actually a good example of how steel sounds desu i think the two songs i posted earlier are both actually nylon if youre gonna go for non electric go for nylon strings
  thats what im thinking of going with   nylon if i decide later to go from acoustic nylon to electric steel will it be easy
  sup fag  i cant play guitar so theres a heads up i was paid to write about guitars    nylon has a small range its usually called a flatter range because the sounds arent as vibrant nylon is obviously softer and that makes it easier to learn on nylon is usually good for backing music or spanish tracks    steel has a a sort of u curve its not as good in the middle but its really good with lows and highs there are tons of steel strings to choose from including different balances of brass and zinc to get different tones its a deep rabbit hole    steel is harder to play just because its physically harder
learn guitar its awsome  ive been playing for 5 years here are some things that will happen or you will need to do  you left finger tips will hurt but after playing for 12 months the skin becomes hardened and it doesnt hurt anymore  youll have to decide between electric or acoustic guitareventhough they are similar both are different tecniques that take time to learn  learn to play with both a pick and your fingers
  this guy again   unless you need a really good builtin pickup for playing gigs and shit or to avoid pissing off room mates get an acoustic you can get some bitching acoustics for way less than you can get an acceptable electric    yamaha do guitars with nato wood which ends up being a really good choice with steel strings for low cost might want spruce for nylon make sure its listed as having a solid sound board and not laminated
  yeah its easy though reading sheet music and playing techically is hard its an ongoing process so you wont just reach six months and then get a big confetti explosion like in a video game    one thing that helped me with the guitar is to think of it as an instrument just like any other and not as some guitar legend bullshit
thanks for the answers    is tuning a guitar easy can i use something from the app store to do it and for how long can a new guitar last before say it needs some kind of maintenance    as for learning to play are there any games and apps that make learning fun and easier
  fender have a learn and tuning app    there are other things like carltune too depends how good your smartphone is tuners are pretty cheap though
  for newbs guitar pro seems like a cool program it plays guitar tabs fret numbers written on a musical scale where each line represents a string in real time the flaw with guitar tabs is that theres no tempo and this computer program solves that issue    mel bay books teach classical guitar for beginners    for me classical guitar always seemed more natural though i mostly listen to rock music
  i also use garage band to record random melodies either hum or play them tap the drums out and stuff that pop in my head and a text file app to record lyrics this is pretty much how pop rock is normally written    you could use the voice recording app or some kind of garage band android equivalent to record melodies fruity loops might work protunes is the proffesional one
  nylon has a wider fret board so it is easier if you have large hands
  nut width depends on the guitar  classical guitars have a wider fret/nut width because theyre intended to be played with more finger picking styles
songsterr has tablature with tempo info and plays the song
  sounds more natural how
  not that poster  be aware classical  acoustic  classical is a style of acoustic      personally i think grand auditorium and dreadnoughts make the comfiest guitars
i have a guitar here and i have been putting off learning it for so long i hate myself did any guitarbros learn to play at home through tutorials books videos or plain old trial and error    i am ultimately interested in learning classical guitar like actually being able to play for real but i am fine with that being way down the line i checked out an old book on how to selfteach classical but its so fucking rigorous that i feel like im learning guitar  like its going to take a year before i can do anything fun at all
  bump
  post a link ill see what i can do
  tuning a guitar is pissed easy just get a tuner you can get an app on your phone too but tuners are more reliable mostly  unless you treat it like crap your guitar shouldnt need any kind of maintenance for a long time except simple dust cleaning
  it is going to take a year before you can do anything fun at all thats why you shouldnt look so far and settle for playing very simple things for a long time if you like singing i highly suggest you that you play songs with simple chords which you can sing along with my first two months basically had me trying to grab a chord for 20 seconds playing it a few times while singing the verse and then trying to switch again for 20 seconds i had a ton of fun though because i was happy that i could reproduce so many tunes that i like
  a year what the fuck why is this shit so hard im getting discouraged
  he is making it sound harder than it really is just go buy a nylon string guitar to satrt and look up the tab for a favorite song of yours and try and play it really isnt that complex and you will pick it up fast i started the same way and i love it
  one year is nothing you pussy if youre not terribly untalented youll be able to pick a simple song in half a year or less depends on how you try if you go in wanting to play your favorite song like the original asap expect to get disappointed
  he can play a simple song in a day lets be real
  define play of course you can pick a song in a day if it has no techniques its not like your guitar will start making proper sounds only after some time but to reach a point where something you play is worth listening to will take at least a few months  or maybe im just too critical i personally dont actually remember how long it took me to learn some fingerstyle because i mostly focused on chords after a while i started focusing on fingerstyle and i caught up very easily
  again i dont want to play anything complicated or sing this is just a small hobby not trying to make a career out of it    i just like how the nylon guitar sounds when its slow and sad and enjoy the more exotic ethnic scales arabicindianspanish     
  how long until i can play this    
  or how long until i can play this     
      it depends you could probably play a stripped down but nice sounding version in a year but to play with their precision and flare will take years quality of the instrument matters a lot too but theres a lot of solid mid range brands that arent that much more expensive than entry level stuff
  would this be a nice starting guitar    
  you could force through it after not very long but the skillful way that guy plays come from a lot of practice over a long period of time    youve got actually want to play music not just want to be automatically good at shit
  yeah im not expecting to learn everything in a day but i keep reading people say that it takes decades to get good at it and that kind of annoys me  might as well go for a violin if the guitar is so complicated    i guess ill know when i try it
    fuck all that shit get pitchlab lite all other tuner programs will try to get into your wallet if you try to tune your guitar to anything other than standard pitchlab allows you to make as many custom tuning setups as you want for free
  bump
  not trying to make a career out of it  singing is just an addition that makes playing much more enjoyable    a year for sure but youll never know until you try    afraid of the learning curve of a guitar   considers violin instead   lmao    as this  guy said you just have to enjoy playing music if you find a song like you posted and your only goal is to play it then youre not going to be happy if you start with simple stuff and focus on the playing itself instead of waiting for the finish youre going to be fine even if it takes long  you seem to be very interested in playing so just fucking go for it nobody started out knowing everything and the longer you wait the worse it is think how skilled you could have already been if you had started when you first thought of it it was better to start yesterday but the best time to start is right now l
  i was joking about the violin thing i know its ridiculously hard    i dont have a nice voice to sing and i dont think i want to either i like instrumental music with no lyrics or vocals lol    anyway i will defiantly buy a guitar and try to learn i just want to soak as much info and advice i can
bump
if your main concern when it comes to choosing to learn an instrument or just about any hobby is how hard it is you shouldnt bother as it clearly displays a lack of motivation or genuine passion towards it that is a prerequisite towards getting good i mean seriously if youre genuinely asking this the answer is youll never be good
  bump
  what if its a concern about literally anything you do then youre just lazy and op can fix that overtime no
    learn how to make chords and switch between them and them learn on how to keep a strum pattern  145 principle and you cna play like 90 9f mainstream songs peopel think ican play guitar but i barely know shit i can fingerpick a bootleg version of black bird and strum a simple song and thats it   i also know all the pentatonic scales
  im not familiar with that brand do you have a local music store
  your first goal is to learn the 5 basic chords play a song you like and at least make it recognizable  by that point you should know what your second goal is  90 of fingerstyle is in a minor  90 of country is in e maj/min or gmajor these keys will use the f chord which can be tough use your thumb    the majority of music theory is bullshit all you need to know is chord tones are 135 chord progressions are iivvvi and everything else is dissonant learn how drones and walking tones work for some easy virtuoso tier shit
  yamaha is generally your best best for a beginner instrument i can say mine has served me pretty well
  op do not listen to these guys buy yourself an acoustic guitar with 80/20 bronze strings if you have swag otherwise be a fag and get a nylon guitar which you will regret because they are not very versatile beyond traditional styles of music
  thats incredibly false
i dont want to create another thread so ill post here again please answer    ive decided to buy and learn guitar  but there are other instruments that i really love the sound of and i wish i could learn to play those too but because of time and energy restrictions i have to ask this    can i use garageband to play instruments like piano electric guitar or saxophone electronically through software with just the computer keyboard do some artist actually make music like this i know the experience wont be the same but is it still possible this will be a hobby of course nothing serious
  what guitar did you buy  and ill help you out op   garage band is really fucking bad download fl studio there is a free version i think then if you want to download a new instrument learn how to install a vst and open it with fl studio  a vst is basically a digital instrument they are either free or cost money if you want a good free piano vst i would suggest checking out iowa piano or salamander piano  if you want to play these easily you can buy either a midi keyboard control this is a keyboard that you plug into your usb port and you can use it to play your vst or you can buy a synthesizer with midi features a synthesizer will be able to make its own sound by itself without the help of your computer unlike a midi keyboard but any synthesizer with a midi port will be able to plug into your computer make sure you buy a newer model synthesizer if you do this though just to make sure and by that i mean a synthesizer from at most the early 1990s 1980s synthesizers are a pain to work with using midi  also you will not likely find a good electronic saxophone sound the saxophone is pretty notorious for not being able to be emulated using keyboards its a really soulful instrument that is literally breathed life into it when you play it on a synth it sounds like shit if you want to learn sax that is something entirely different
is it worth getting a teacher in the beginning so you dont pick up bad habits
  yes and no i personally didnt have a teacher but my father plays guitar so he gave me a few tips from time to time whatever you choose the important thing is that you enjoy yourself if you like having someone to guide you and tell you what to do then go for it but if you just want to play to yourself as a humble hobby then a teacher might not be good for you  i like what i had someone that leaves me alone but occasionally tells me what i can improve a teacher usually gets more into your business but if you can find a good one and communicate with them then its worth it
  guitar is easy to learn and before you ask no you will never get good ever even if you play for 10 years and practice everyday you will never ever get good  that said you could play the link you posted its easy to play you may not be able to understand the musical theory behind it but you could pick up a guitar and play individual notes like a retard   all of that said dont buy a fucking guitar buying a guitar to learn the guitar is one of the biggest wastes of money people always seem to do
  all of that said dont buy a fucking guitar buying a guitar to learn the guitar is one of the biggest wastes of money people always seem to do  how the fuck else are you going to learn guitar
  rent one if you need to most people give up within the first few months and end up having a 500 guitar laying around for years that they dont use
 2 years ago   go no contact with ex after she cheated and threatened suicide on me   today   hey anon this is no contact ex i filed some harassment claims against the guy i cheated with you with our campus police   what   actually get called by police from college   i miss the call    is there any repercussion if i dont call the campus police back i dont want anything to do with her at all
  the reason i got the call is because she wanted me to testify about what happened even though i have no idea what did happen
also no idea how she got my new number
  sociopaths love using the police as their defender when theyre corneredthis is most likely whats going on here i would ignore it and go on with your life
is it still weird/off putting to be living with parents at 22    growing up it was just me and my mom living in my grandmas house   once my dad got out of prison when i was 10 we moved maybe a year or so after and thats how it was for a while  about every year/year and a half the three of us would move houses due to my parents not being too bright with the money or landlords screwing us over and its been this way from 10 to now  had never really considered moving out after hs i did community college for a couple years auditioned and got accepted to university but decided to take a gap year to get better job save up money practice etc  only since i left school have i really considered my living situation  my parents have had problems in the past with money dad up and leaving us randomly some drug abuse among other things and i think the constant moving coupled with the fragility of my mind growing up in a somewhat dysfunctional family did a bit of a number on my motivation and determination to get out there on my own i found too much comfort in being home isolated that and having my younger siblings being exposed to the same thing i did not want to leave them alone to face it by themselves
  cont    as of relatively recent past 2 years/2 1/2 years or so things have settled down  financially everything is better than its been  my parents have worked out many of their issues and things are better than they have been since my dad got out   the three of us split rent utilities etc and work to keep everything in order around the house no more drug abuse no more real problems  i aswell have worked out some issues mainly being a homebody who cut ties with a lot of people/friends and now i find i have the drive to wanna get out there again and seize my independence that i forgot about long ago  the thing is considering my situation im atleast gonna be living here another year/year and a half to save a good amount of money deal with paying school stuff off and finding a better job that fits my schedule and i find it hard to get out there and find someone knowing that i still live with my parents
it isnt but im 23 so take my advice with a grain of salt my plan is to get out or cc in a year and either dorm in uni or move into an apartment with friends i meet here its becoming too humiliating to me to live with my mum i love her though
its certainly not weird if youre in school living with them or if youre taking care of them because theyre old   i dont see why anyone should care nothings to stop you from getting a hotel room if you needed to but im social ruhtard and wouldnt know    but fuck moving around and shit maybe im pretty detached from my parents but living on my own and knowing where ill live is way fucking nicer than living with my parents
  that is the plan  i find it increasingly off putting and a bit annoying though i do love them to be living with them still once i pay off my debts my universities dorms or the apts down the street are where im headed      well now that everythings settled i know now too where we are moving if we were to move and i have a say in it not like how it has been before  but i definitely want to leave soon but rent can be a motherfucker over here  also in talks with a couple buddies to get a place but idk
  im 25  i live with my mom  i will propably keep living with her untill at least 30 since i just started uni and the house is pretty close to it
i moved from my parents house the day after my 23rd birthday they actually kicked me out this was a couple months ago i have my own place now but no if you and your parents get along i dont see what the issue is
so i started dating a girl 2 months ago went alright we once had a little talk about trust but overall we had no problems     so she had to do stuff over the weekend which meant we couldnt see each other on saturday she only texted me back like 2 and i just thought she is busy but on sunday i didnt get a reply at all im a quite uncertain person and cant really handle it if a person i care about ignores me so i texted her that we should talk about why she is ignoring me did not get any answer tho    later like 10pm i got her to answer the phone but the call endet after a minute with a bad excuse and without talking at all about the problem     then she was back to ignoring me again until i told her that we have to talk or im just going to break up with her    she just told me she wants to sleep    havent texted her today any ideas
stop being so clingy christ but desu you seem to have already fucked it telling someone not to ignore you is stupid since if they are ignoring you they wont care but if theyre not then you come across as needy
never beg for anyones attention anon you are better than that
hello newfag here still not used to this feeling asking some oldfags for help bear the shitty greentext youre about to read    be me turn age  today  think about all the things that happened this year  remember this one girl   lets call her m  m had same interest as me animerpg and pvp vidya etc  m and i talk for awhile she sends nudes  woohoonigga  never been in a relationship so idk what this means  she eventually confesses  woohoopt2nigga  some time after she suddenly stops talking to me and becomes inactive  felt like i had a hole in my chest  ff some months still think about m but meet normie girl to forget about m  forget m but talking to normie girl wasnt fun so break up  ff now memories of m comes back along with that hole in my chest    what do robros asking you guys is beyond retarded desu but what do kill myself
i turned to drugs for awhile heroin xanax and alcohol abuse every day for fucking years i wasted so much of my life trying to forget dumb shit that dosnt matter i have a gigantic leap in my life where i remember nothing just nut up and cope with it dude time heals all wounds
  go back to r/greentexts to start with and stop frogposting
update from the thread a few days ago      i confronted her about it i stayed calm because i have a way of getting angry and then shed probably have lied to protect herself  i found out that they were talking on instagram for about a month before my gf met her ex at the party and when they were there they made out  this led to another month or so of sexting and meeting up to makeout which she insists is as far as they went since she was waiting on me to come back to break up hence the text i found    i made her swear on her future kids lives thats all that happened so im inclined to believe she didnt fuck him shes very maternal and superstitious so i dont think shed risk something like that    i havent spoken to her in two days but its so hard i really dont know what to do like i said its my first love ive known the girl since we were 11 and now im 24 and broken  i really need some advice im sorry for boring you all with this sob story but i dont really know what to do im too ashamed to talk to people in real life about it and ive been lurking since i was 13 so you have all become my family now    do you think i should meet up with the guy and ask him for his account or in this situation should i either trust her and work on it or assume otherwise and leave her    thank you guys love you all
balls i forgot to put a subject on the post oh well    i think my longterm girlfriend has cheated on me part 2
she made out with her ex  thats already cheatingit doesnt have to be sex   id break up with her in your stead   but i understand its hard for you considering the length of your relationship   cheaters usually wont stop cheating    and even if they do stopjust for this one time id break up with her
  how do you even leave somebody you love one minute i want to talk to her and tell her everything will be alright the next i want to be sick and cry
  the truth is you must always love yourself more    i believe in love i think theres someone out there whos the right one for everyone love is appreciating the person youre with having fun and understanding them on an intimate level despite all their flaws being with them because it enriches your life spending moments with them because it takes the monotony away    fairy tale love is till death do us part no one can do any wrong destiny and faith its all bullshit some people are able to sculpt their relationship in a way that looks like this we all know grandparents that have been together for 60 years but even they i assure you are not perfect you believe in fairy tale love and havent accepted that people can be bad for you and must be cut loose    to get out of fairy tale love you need to love yourself its quite easy after all youre always with yourself in every situation and its you whos done everything for yourself but you need to wake up every morning and tell yourself things are gonna be okay and that you love yourself because you do good things for others and are charming and hardworking and whatever other positive traits you exhibit eventually you will love yourself too much to have your progress halted by some girl who cant do the right thing    the best thing for you id say is write out your feelings in a letter break up with her tonight and go no contact and hide that letter away in a box somewhere this will be your closure you wont need to hear an answer from her because you wrote it all down in your letter take some time to brace yourself and pull the plug now
  believing they only made out     kek its the oldest lie in the cheaters handbook
  how can i write a letter of my feelings to support this when half the page will be anger and disgust and the other half would be love and desperation to go back to normal  im taking a week or more away from her to clear my head before i make a decision but i dont know if thats just me trying to stall what will ultimately be the hardest thing ive had to do in my life so far  its our anniversairy on sunday as well just to make the plaster even harder to rip off    thank you for your wise words it really does help to have a better perspective that she just might not be the person for me its just weird having spent so long with her certain that it was her and imagining how our lives would be togther and i genuinely think she feels the same we just had the toughest test of our relationship and she failed
  thats why i wondered if its wise to meet up with the guy and ask him
  she mentioned that if things kept going the way they were she was going to have sex with him you are more than likely projecting your values onto her values which she doesnt share when you say she wouldnt do something like that    i think this anon  poetically described what you should do in this situation that being said relationships have survived infidelity in the past but those relationships are the exception not the norm and not the norm by a large margin the trust in the relationship is broken trust is the power behind every relationship and without it theres nothing to salvage
  yeah that text still scars me and deep down i think ill always wonder if she did go through with it or not thats no way for a relationship to go  im just so scared of actually pulling the trigger and losing her forever which makes me feel so pathetic that im still hesitating despite what she did  is any love as strong as your first
  no nigga you beta fucking cuck whats meeting him going to do for you your gf isnt loyal she doesnt love you and she betrayed you whether they kissed or he came in her mouth or they did anal or fucked in the kitchen doesnt matter youre such a fucking beta cuck for not dropping her the second you found out they were taking behind your back instead youre writing blog posts love poems about this girl on an anonymous forum the fact of the matter is you dont trust her and cant trust her every additional second you waste pondering on this girl or wondering what happened makes you slightly more of a faggot pathetic cuck shes playing you ya fucking idiot get it through your thick skull fucking retard asking should i talk to the guy that fucked my girl in the ass have some self respect stand up straight hold your head up high and block this girl on every platform you have her on and move the fuck on find a girl that wont fuck her ex and lie to you then after you stop being a cucked bitch delete this thread fucking turbofaggot beta loser
    i should add that i dont think they only kissed but at the end of the day thats irrelevant the betrayal is there trust has been broken no matter if they kissed or they fucked or whatever other shit they might have done
please leave her man dont look past this i know you love her but theres only gonna be pain if you carry on with her dont meet with the guy dont try and fix this because its beyond repair the best thing you can do is break up with her enjoy your own company for as long as you need and if you want to then look for someone that isnt so dishonest
  think of it this way anon she already emotionally left you awhile ago    my first love was with a narcissist so i dont think i can speak accurately to whether or not its the strongest or not what i can say is that there are other people out there who will be your companion and genuinely love you anon
      i really needed to hear this hell even  but yeah i think i need to leave i think deep down i always knew that  its a shame because we really were the best weve ever been the past few months even though she was hiding this dirty secret for the past half a year or so  its just scary to think that something i was so familiar with for a quarter of my life is gone    to the vocaroo man honestly you dont know how much that note has helped me i have it saved and i think im going to be listening to it a lot in the upcoming weeks    im not going to meet the guy it changes nothing  she did what she did and now i have to move on without her    thank you x
  its a shame because we really were the best weve ever been the past few months even though she was hiding this dirty secret for the past half a year or so  its just scary to think that something i was so familiar with for a quarter of my life is gone  join the club
  im loving this post this is what /adv/ is all about very nice
  my gf is actively disrespecting me betraying me and cheating on me i made her swear that she only cheated on me one way but didnt cheat on me another way this made me feel better but to get reassurance i want to talk to the guy who shes cheating with i want to know if he came inside her did she please him how did her pussy feel and if i can watch and maybe record it the next time they fuck
  best of luck in the future anon whether you decide to find someone else or keep to yourself i believe youll be a lot better in the long run without a cheater to worry about
so i have a question for alk the lawyerfags in the audience  is jailbait legal to download whats the difference between jailbait and cp im asking because ive come across many jailbait sites that dont require proxys or tor
the difference is in the conditions of detention  regime
  oof
  lets make it simple you can be prosecuted for having any underage photos of a sexual nature
ive been fasting for like 3 days as kind of a penance thing how long is safe
stop after 58 days drink a lot listen to your body
  ive done it up to a week and a half i dont think anything past a week is safe though
  make sure you drink a lot of water and break your fast with easy to digest food rice chicken stock fruit
  without going into too much depth you will be able to feel it when you fast your body goes into ketosis fat burning mode and after a couple days you stop feeling hunger pains once youve burned through enough fat that your body starts freaking out youll start to feel hunger pains again eat then good healthy foods dont binge on junk food meats veggies simple stuff
all memes aside i dont want to be a wagie i cant imagine the life i have ahead for me i just dont want any of it and everyone tells me i should be super grateful   wake up at 6   drive for an hour  work for 10 hours  drive for an hour and half cause wage traffic   get home 7pm  go to sleep to do it all again the next day  and i know this is where im headed and i barely feel thats any sort of life to live   inb4  xd anon wut about all dat munny  i hate money and i hate just about all material things i cant think of one thing that i actually truely want  inb4 just have kidz   i hate kidslooking back on growing up i was complete shitbag of a child  inb4  xd anon y dont u just gwirl friend wid big tiddies  every single girl ive ever met has been a boarder sociopath they dont love you they just want to lure you in with lots of sex then turn it off get fat and enjoy free wagie bucks that you waste your life away for  inb4 xd ur an incel  im acutally trying to find any sort of advice to not be a slave to the grind for my entire life i dont know what i want or whats even really an option i want to know what to do or at least how to come to terms with how worthless meaning and boring my wagie life is going to be
  find what makes you happy and feel fulfilled if you find a job you love and youll never have to work a day in your life
  stop saying this it doesnt exist   you cant go work for who you truely want it doesnt work that way half the great jobs that everyone wants know that people want the job not for the money so they give you shit tier wage and constantly threaten you with getting fired because they know they have lines out the door with people who want the job
  wake up at 9 am  get some breakfast  launch pc at 10am and log in remotely to the job pc  work from home 8 hours with breaks inbetween  job ends at 6pm  go to store buy some food  get back and watch anime and play vidya until 1am in the morning  go to bed    maybe you should spend less time browsing /r9k/
    what kind of job are you imagening    because you could be a shift worker at an industrial plant working 1321 or 21 to 5 in the morning  you could be a nighttime cleaner or janitor or security guard  you could work parttime if you set your expenses at the proper lows  you could start a business a youtube channel or rent a piece of land and do organic farming  you could be a male prostitute dabbling in viagra to keep those erections up for the old grandmas you would fuck  you could be a garbage man and work early morning to noon and get the rest of the day off    there are a shitton of jobs that defy the 95 coorporate wagie stereotype
  now do you really think 90 of people can work from home how long did it take you to get to that point what if you just wanted to not work one day could you do it or would your boss just remove your fucking face   maybe i am just scared because my father and like all my friends fell for the work for 10 hours a day and have a shiton of kids with fat whores   meme
  i literally just want to work as little as possible i dont need a fuck ton of money i dont buy new smart phones or watch tv just internet and vidya occasionally
  wake up at 5  hit the gym  drive for an hour  work for 8 hours taking breaks to relax  have a few laughs with coworkers  heat up a snack   read for a while letting traffic clear up  drive home  do whatever   go to bed tired and fulfilled  do you like your job op thats a big component of being a happy wagie if you dont enjoy the thing youre spending 40 hours per week doing of course youre going to hate life
    then you could easily pay rent in a small apartment and live somewhat comfortably with 2030 hours a week    i used to work 25 hours a week as a phoner asking questions and i could afford a 45 m2 apartment in the immigrant ghetto with money left over for food and weed    but now that i work fulltime as a trained factory worker i earn big bucks and let me tell you vacations abroad and being able to play new games on my computer really eases the burn of wageslavery
im only attracted to girls with penises please help
  taper yourself in the same way you did into dick girls but into legit male twinks and then you can admit to yourself that youre a faggot
  you do realize men find penises more attractive than even breasts and butts right   you also realize that masculinity has nothing to do with a fleshy tube and a sack of testicles right  i do not want to fuck a man  i want a futanari to dick me  why arent they real
on a more serious note i discovered porn at age 11 and it just so happened to be futanaria i feel as though i cant be attracted to biological females anymore
  why are you insecure about this anon just do it
  why do gays always lie you are gay as is every man who finds dicks attractive
  im only attracted to men with vaginas
  honestly always wanted to fuck a muscular chick   im normally fairly dominant but being submissive to a woman who can pin me down and ride me is super kinky
  agreed
  youre just gay
  brainwash some twink into getting surgery
my friends and me were making up some plans about where to go for new years eve and they want to go to a party at some kind of cafe or club im not sure now theres bound the be a lot of people there and im very anxious and avoid crowds as much as possible but on the other hand i might finally meet a nice girl there   im 18 khv standard 4chan stuff i know that the type of girls i like wouldnt be there getting drunk and partying probably only chads and stacys wil lgo there then again im not chad and i would be with my friends because they want to go so there may be a similar situation but with girls maybe i just find a shy introverted girl who got dragged into it by her friends     is it worth going to the party and stepping that hard out of my comfort zone for that small small chance
bump
  no dont go there why a nightclub for new years eve also your friends sound like tossers
  a lot of people my age here go to nightclubs and such for the end of the year / waiting for new years arrival party
  tossers  i know but its better than nothing
bumping again slow day or bad thread
last bump
  i think regret to not go will be worse anon just try it of course go while at your very best physically and dresswise
    regret about it may be the worst thing that could happen but theres also the anxiousness of knowing only 3 people there who are all more chad and more sociable than you
  but girls may notice a notchad is friend with chad and think he may have something interesting in him if chads whant to be friends with him
  thats a good point of view i never looked at it that way
  do it anon focus on having a good time with your friends and dont get disappointed if you dont find a hunny if you enjoy yourself you will have less anxiety about putting yourself out there in the future and will be a little more ready for any shy qt you may encounter down the road
  ill probably go any tips on breaking my anxiety a bit before it besides getting drunk
ill now let this thread rest only 3 people responded
depression resolve  my main issue here is lack of interest in things how do i get back on track towards the things i used to do without the whats the point line springing to mind in the end   i dont know where this is taking me but i dont even find getting a job interesting im down to my last 200 and im not even worried whats the point in going on if i dont even have the motivation to  im even beginning to ignore basic hygiene and even a want for food not saying i cant go without its just im just not interested should i just end it
  see a doctor you need medication that will give you a push and motivate you to do things and enjoy doing them   youre losing interest because of brain chemistry imbalance
  nah fuck that im defective if thats the case and the best thing to do is rid myself of the earth   spent yearsyears doing my thing only to get cucked by lol chemical imbalance rng fuck that shit man i already know life isnt fair but its still annoying that i have to dish out that much more money to livethat i have yet another thing to explain to a worthy suitorthat i have the chance of brining a child into this world that had to do the same thing   nah fuck that im out of this bitch
  dont think of it like that depression is a disease think of the meds as a cold medicine you can stop taking them after you feel fine and you will please dont think about ending it this is not permanent
any tips curious

  sleep a lot      thats what i do
i have this fantasy where my girlfriend is a famous actress or singer or olympic skater something and im her new personal assistant i have no idea who she is as a celebrity and im not actually a fan of hers so aside from professional courtesy i just treat her like anyone else shes mildly annoyed by the fact that i dont fawn over her and decides to get me to fall for her whenever were alone but this comes at the risk of making herself vulnerable to me would this sort of elaborate roleplay turn off a girlfriend
  if shes already your girlfriend and a decent person no it wouldnt i dare say most women would also love this kind of roleplay because they can roleplay as a famous person
life isnt a romcom or an anime  but you seem to be stuck in the delusion of it
  i love roleplaying m8 girls who are imaginative and enjoy a good story are attractive to me
26 year old khv history of illness and death in the family also clinical depression    finally got some of my strength back and have no idea where to go to develop socially and sexually    i feel out of place everywhere need help
just stay here man its nice and cozy
  are you working id say for now focus on your career make money and let it distract you from your problems
  i enrolled into an engineering program but everyone there just sticks to themselves
  in that case you are not going to have time to have a social life engineering students are antisocial for a reason
  what are your hobbies
  i lift weights/cycle and watch podcasts
  find a weight lifting buddy or a cycling one
  this op if theres a rachetball club or something to join that can lead to more social activity and tire you out more too     also dont be depressed over no luck with the ladies there is no switch that gets flipped after you get laid sex is only a big deal to people who are told its a big deal and told that they are lacking for not having it
  that image is just denigrating suifuel
  this picture disturbs me
father you got a girlfriend     prince yeah i got a girlfriend     father you gonna get married     prince i dont know     father never get married    never get fucking married
  dad you got a girlfriend    me no    dad 
  dad     we all avoid talking about it
just told my dad i was changing from my pharmacy major to computer software development he didnt take it too well pretty bummed out even though i knew he was going to bitch about it how do i make this feeling go away
you did the right thing drugs are bad
whats the big deal
  op is probably concerned that the ribits would take their job in a few years anyways so instead of doing a job that can be done by a ribit theyre going to learn how to into ribits language so that they can protect their family in the future ribit apocalypse
  yeah man drugs suck
    well the ribits do suck and have invaded pharmacy a little but thats not the reason i went into pharmacy really liking it but fuck after years in it i realized how shitty it really is
is it a bad idea to tell my gf that i have chronic depression and sometimes have episodes where it gets even worse
yes
  turn it around op  is it a bad idea for her to find out you have chronic depression during an episode when it is much worse    alternatively if youre too scared/depressed to tell her depression is pretty treatable consult a therapist and perhaps a psychiatrist then youll be out in front of the problem and justifiably dont need to tell her since nothing is going to happen
  consult a therapist and perhaps a psychiatrist  already did but didnt improve me at all and ive managed to hide it for a year now  i feel like its a better idea to just break up with her right now
  very bad idea only ever refer to your depression as a single day event  hey anon you okay  yeah just having a bad day   repeat every day she asks  never acknowledge you have a chronic problem if pressed    lurk moar and youll see girls lose interest in mental cases unless theyre mental cases themselves
  didnt improve  you either need to make this clear to your therapist/psychiatrist or move on to a different therapist/psychiatrist their whole job is to get you in a right head space help them do their job so you can be better
  this but not in an explicitly pessimistic way if you have a mental illness normies just dont get it you can be decent friends with normal people sure but they wont put up with your shit forever in a relationship only someone with depression can empathize with someone who was depression
  yes
  hey i got those too from septoct then i read the story from an anon whose daughter died in a car crash because his wife texted her while she was driving and she ran away to do heroine really gave me some perspective  if she doesnt have a nurturing personality she will be a horrible wife and mother so it doesnt matter if she leaves    then you go back and say these antidepressants arent working your gf can help with this if you feel powerless  i wish i had the willpower to do this
aint got no job i enjoy  aint got no girlfriend  aint got no qualifications   aint got no possessions that bring me joy    what am i living for i am so bored of life
  yeah me too anon
are you me

have you read the thread about the 30 yo female that has no future    old female here you are a dumb loser who wont realize it until your youth is gone and you hit the wall    the pack of 19 yo guys that are wandering a bit lost right now will be hitting their stride and wont give you the time of day nor the promotion you think you deserve for posting on instagram 5 hours a day
  yep i am old and dont know how to post a reply trying again    have you read the thread about the 30 yo female that has no future    old female here you are a dumb loser who wont realize it until your youth is gone and you hit the wall    the pack of 19 yo guys that are wandering a bit lost right now will be hitting their stride and wont give you the time of day nor the promotion you think you deserve for posting on instagram 5 hours a day
this is my first post lets see how this goes    i just broke up with my girlfriend after exactly 1 year and 1 day i feel like shit boys i wasnt feeling the same way when we first started dating and i wasnt treating her the way she deserved to be treated we both still love each other and thats been expressed multiple times at the breakup and shortly afterwards i dont know what to do guys ive never felt this way or cried this hard before     please help me i dont know what to do or if this gets better
music porn tv and lots of food youll be fine
i quit my job after a mental breakdown last night my anger issues and sensitivity got the best of me and an angry customer i had last night pushed me to my breaking point luckily my parents pay for everything im 18 years old but still in high school so i dont have to worry about bills but im worried that these problems will affect me later in life when i have to support myself how do you improve yourself how do you stop yourself from letting your emotions get the best of you i dont want to get upset so easily anymore
  i cant say i have the best advice  what has worked for me is changing my mindset  to one that anger and other emotional issues are residuals of our dumb monkey brain monkey is dumb and not to be trusted like an animal so ignore them also realize with modern society cameras everywhere and the repercussions that come with action out on your emotions  the price is too great just try to understand how you were triggered the logic and rational best choice to take if you believe you could retaliate against someone and get away with it after observing and evaluating your circumstances  then yeah release that anger  otherwise realize those emotions are just a liability
  get another mcjob then its not like they ever check your references better yet get a specialty position using your marketable skills so you dont have to serve the general population like a 60 year old cat lady
join the military for the shortest contract possible after highschool    after that you will be more emotional stabld
kissing her thighs   she hadnt take a shower yet for the day  fingering her  there is a faint piss aroma  another warm night  very late  hug her  regular pit sweat smell  both times feel uncomfortable at first  then it grew on me  now i think about it fondly    is this normal pretty sure i would throw up if i smell a guy s fluids
  pretty sure i would throw up if i smell a guy s fluids    well also in the context of hugging a guy and kissing his thighs it would be gay    but yeah its relatively normal its not necessarily a fetish or anything its just that you like/love this person and whatever bodily smells or fluids or whatever arent as repulsive as they would be outside of that context and with someone else
  its just that you like/love this person  i baawwd
anon thats so cute
  yes it is normal the human body is gross if you are attracted to someone you are attracted to their grossness along with everything else people who cant handle things like this who get disgusted instead of turned on are just too squeamish and selfish for real love theyd be better off with the comforting sterile safety and distance of watching sex through a computer screen and jerking off alone
  youre in love its a chemical thing
  thanks i guess its just how it is though    like this one girl would sometimes fart as a joke and i was really into her and so i would laugh with her    this other girl would also rip ass but i wasnt as much into her so i would just disgusted and totally angry and leave the apartment for like 10 minutes she also knew how much i hated it when shed just fart so she was doing it on purpose to get under my skin
i feel like i wont pass and my mind wont work without caffeine i drank a red bull and a cup of coffee today and i want more the thing is im really anxious that if i quit coffee i wont be able to achieve anything
im 20 and think its one of the most pathetic things you can do but this isnt a common opinion at my age    wastes the daylight hours  inconvenient when planning basic things like shopping  just shows a general lack of self control    what is the appeal to it instead of going to bed at early getting up early and having it be light most the time youre up
huh
  why do people do it
  lack of self control lack of structure in their lifestyle lack of foresight lack of responsibilies having been one of those people who would stay up til 5 am playing video games i can say those were the general reasons i think if youre 20 youll know a lot of people like this i didnt really have a healthy regular sleep schedule until i got a full time job after college
i can sleep on sunday sleeping when theres shit you could be doing is stupid
  so theres basically no pros to it    thanks
  he likes the sun  hes on 4chan  fuck were normie as fuck now what the fuck happened  just as long as you dont pawn off 10 am is early on me theres also people who work later evenings assuming you even work and so their schedule would be shifted ahead    as for pros or cons other than really needing a bit of sunlight for actual physical health its not like day and night are super different commerce has grown and youre still able to get your milk and your eggs at just about any hour anyway as long as youre not in bumfuck nowhere  i think its just a new style thats getting traction and reception
  and what the fuck is the point of this stupid thread exactly
  to bait replies exactly like this out of posters exactly like you id bloody well wager
  i dont know why people do it and would like to know why      why would this be bait
  why would this be bait  because it be like that sometimes
i know what you mean     people treat you like a manchild when they find out you prefer to go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 6 am   its ok though because theyll look like leather bags by 30
  they dont treat you like a manchild they just realize that youre a selfrighteous cunt
  why would this be bait  i have to remind myself youre 20 and too young to be initiated in this shit and youre a normie to boot
  i hate sunlight and dealing with people
  i am extremely successful and driven and this helps massively to keep it up
  i like staying up late because its when the vast manority of people fuck off and i can enjoy all the benefits of living in a developed/populated area without any of the noise and bullishit of human activity    i dislike it because its bad for my productivity and probably my mood and it causes me to miss sunlight so i could take it or leave it
  because fuck you im not a morning person
  ttthanks
  because not everyone has a morning job dumb wojakposter
  i am a student
  third shift reporting in  to me it works well to work at night and sleep during the day
  ok youre mature and responsible even though youre apparently not smart enough to understand why other people would want to stay up late which isnt exactly rocket science    happy
personally i have a hard time focusing and relaxing when other people are awake around me around 123am when everybody else is asleep i feel a sense of peace and calmness i am trying to get my sleep schedule on track though because staying up late is unhealthy and hurts my productivity
  whats considered late
  biorhythm
  i like being alone everyones sleeping hardly anyones outside if things are really perfect rain is ticking on the window and im just sitting in front of some paper/my computer doing some drawing/programming in peace its nice and cosy quiet at rest etc then maybe at 4 or 5 am you go to bed and when you wake up the regular world has started again im not some neet so i only do it when i have the next day off and even then dont do it often
    whats the difference between going to sleep early or late    wastes the daylight hours  we have electronic light    inconvenient when planning basic things like shopping  you can go to a shop in most towns all around the clock if not most of the time there is a gasstation that is on 24/7    just shows a general lack of self control  who decided what the normal waking hours are  before we had electricity it was the sun back then it was logical to say that he has no self control or is a lazy person because they actually couldnt do anything at night  now it doesnt matter because we have electronic light and you can do almost everything at any time    long story short anyone who says stuff like you are immature cuz you stay up late is just a self righteous cunt
  we have electronic light  not op but its not the same at all
  maybe if youre a dipshit who doesnt take his flintstones
  long story short anyone who says stuff like you are immature cuz you stay up late    from my personal experience its not wrong
lots of reasons but for most young people its because they like the nightlife and the freedom to move about the city pursuing their degenerate pastimes under cover of darkness
  wrong wavelength/ kind of radiation also electric not electronical
  it helps keep tomorrow away just a little longer
  ill take what is the night shift for 100alex
  you sound like a parent whos tidy widys are a bit too tight who the fuck cares when someone goes the bed
  everyone else is asleep  night is very comfortable
i have delayed sleep phase disorder because of my adhd basically it means that my circadian rhythm is fucked and my body doesnt start producing melatonin until 24am i have no choice but to stay up late trying to adjust my schedule to the morning is the equivalent of you trying to adjust your schedule to the graveyard shift and requires medication to knock me out    just how people are sometimes im just glad i live in a place where people and places are awake and open late living in a small town where everything closed at 6pm was hell
  also i would like to add that your circadian rhythm also changes throughout your life kids go to sleep early and wake up early teenagers have their sleep schedules pushed back so they typically start to produce melatonin at 11pm meaning its natural for them to go to sleep on or around midnight as a younger adult you tend to shift earlier again as a senior you tend to shift later again this is natural biological tendencies    naturally theres going to be some people who are outliers exceptions or edge towards the extremes but these are typical for the average person and reflect ingrained biological tendencies
  said biological tendencies twice in a row  look at me making myself look smart
i stay up late because i prefer it the nighttime over daytime     its generally cooler i live in a hot area  its quieter  less people about  less distractions so increased productivity    that being said i usually aim for a 2am bed time 810am up time     i think you are just caught up in the social norm of it all and youre too young to comprehend that other people are different it doesnt really mean anything you mentioned
honestly i just like the night good for listening to music among other things the real question is why as human beings do we still need sleep goddamn it imagine if sleep wasnt necessary i wish it was at least not as demanding so we could enjoy the full day more
why is op a faggot like i just dont get it
        how the fuck have you never heard of people having different circadian rhythms this is basic shit dumbass jesus christ
the most likely reason why i stay up late is probably because i have some sort of mental or emotional problem that i need to work on    part of it is because i want more time to do whatever it is i want to do when everyone is asleep is also when i feel like i dont have to think or worry about anyone else and its just me even when im with my wife and were playing videogames together i feel like were totally free to stay up super late and do whatever we want because no one else is awake    honestly its terrible because i feel tired all the time i know i would be happier if i went to sleep earlier and got at least 7hrs of sleep every single day on the weekends it just catches up with me and i end up up staying in bed until like 12 and missing a large part of the day its a vicious cycle too  im sure the fucked up amount of sleep and the timing of it screws with my mood and just about everything else which in turn feeds my depressive tendencies and anxiety which leads me to keep staying up late doing nothing productive
i tell myself its because im not tired or that i cant sleep because of stress and thoughts which is true but not specific enough its really because i dont want to reflect on how completely retarded i am the humiliation is unbearable i couldnt take the steps to fix myself so i became addicted to the internet  just wasting my life trying to come to terms with living like a pathetic lonely retard has proved to be near impossible so i wonder how much more i will dissapoint the people in my life  dont be a faggot kids
  it depends buddy i work 2nd shift so i go in at 3pm and get off around 1am so im natutally awake at night
  part of my job is working until midnight or later a lot of people mostly live at night ffs
  planning everything is obnoxious if i need something in a moment thats when i decide to do something about it following a rigid schedule is utterly arbitrary for my life since i work from home also my circadian rhythm is naturally attuned to being awake at night and i hate how busy shit is during the day interesting stuff happens at night and is more beautiful when the stars and the moon are out i like being alone and i hate schedules and regardless my circadian rhythm is different than yours i also work my ass off people who stay up playing video games are irresponsible so its different than that
      these
society is centred around the 95 us ubermensch anons ignore the arbitrary time schedules of society in place of our own also mama cant hear me fap then
  i used to have this stupid circadian rhythm of a night owl general wellbeing improved after i made some lifestyle changes now i only go to sleep before midnight sometimes at 10 otherwise i feel like shit in the morning drowsy with a headache and cant do shit that day i used to feel like shit before too but i was a stupid lazy teenager now i wake up with the sunrise and general energy levels are definitely better i even look better  better active lifestyle exercise diet
  you can literally change your own circadian rhythms so obviously everyone has different ones
  1 i enjoy the night  2 claiming it wastes daylight hours is like claiming that sleeping at night wastes nighttime hours  3 theres shops that work 024 h one right across my road works 822 h how is that inconvenient and why the fuck do i need to plan shopping  4 i dont need to sleep the full normal amount of hours if ive been up half the night i can just get off on 34 hours or sometimes ill skip a whole day of sleeping and stay awake for 2 days so i can study extra
  can someone explain the appeal of staying up late  viewing softcore porn/series reruns on late night tv  but i work to rehabilitate drug addicts/people with mental health problems  when they are addicts/have issues they will stay up later or even become nocturnal and nap throughout the day    people who have their shit together will wake up early to get ready/go gym they will have prepared tomorrows things before the end of the day    nobody is in the gym at 5am if you get that done you have the whole day to do whatever you like
what do you do if you get bored by everything very easily and dont feel fulfilled
is there anything you remember feeling fulfilled doing i was the same until i started pursuing my future career which i love doing everyday
  yeah i totally can think of something like being a rich and famous singer but thats the only thing i can think of and i dont know how to make that happen
  and in what ways do you pursue it

how often do you anons think about your exs this might just be babys first real breakup syndrome but i just dont have anyone else to ask i have seen other girls in the past but no other relationship lasted as long 15 years or was as intimate as this last one that ended 6 months ago in day to day life im now fine but when i randomly get reminded of her it just fucks me up for a good 15ish min even with seeing other girls and being social hookups/parties i still get those feelings when you think about your exes long down the road do any still make you feel or will that too go away with time    im a 23 year old at grad school for extra context
any one here dealing with /or have dealt with a pregnant wife with no libido does is get better or am i going to go 1years without having sex because her fucking hormones are all out of wack     my wife is 12 weeks along and were on week 4 of no sex weve had sex 3 times since she first got pregnant im going insane i actually went out and bought a fleshlight but its no replacement for the real thing     i understand that her body is going through a lot and shes not in the mood but it also feels like she doesnt want me to touch her she recoils when i kiss her and rub her back i miss the intimacy and im starting to resent her     she still likes to cuddle and and chill but im 26 and im hornier than ive ever been     i know theres no good answer but i just wanted to vent and see if any of you fuckers have been through the same     cheers
welcome to marriage and breeding     fap a lot get good because youll need that skill for decades love doesnt require sex but thats no consolation when you are young fortunately sex is not more than a way to orgasm so redirect your sex drive away from her shes under enough stress and hormones make any gender irrational note your horniness and preferably to something nondisruptive to your relationship after the kid gets out of school you can either divorce or just give up     your drive is of course hormonal too wear yourself out there really is no good answer but you can take comfort that there are many successful sexless marriages you dont need to fuck to cum and the rest of 4chan is ample proof     sadly im not being even slightly sarcastic btw dont try to have a rational discussion with her at this time because hormones make that impossible being pregnant is horrible and the end game is shitting a bowling ball with arms and a head give it time     learn to get emotional reward from your offspring be a good dad there arent enough of those
she probably wont feel too much up to it 1st trimester but it will pick up a lot in the second when she gets more energy in fact a lot of womens labidos pick up in the second trimester due to hormones     what you need to watch out for is 6 weeks after birth when she is possibly experiencing post partum and it could drop again in addition to her feeling down and tired just keep an eye on her and maybe go to therapy with her if need be

  i am reporting you this is a fucking advice board you underage piece of shit i didnt come here to be a plaything for bored teens
why is this board so terrible i never get any replies nobody ever wants to give advice why doesnt anyone care
match with a girl in tinder everything is gooing smooth told her to meet us at a bar tonight she said maybe now she says she is going with 2 friends to meet her there im lazy hate to meet new people but i like this girl what should i do
  you have to understand that her friends are probably going for security once you greet them and the formalities are over they will probably just sit a few tables away and just periodically look to see that you are not raping their friend
  why not
  its awkward i dont like to meet new people unless there is a chance to fuck them i have to pretend i had other plans other than fap and videogames
i honestly hate when women do this i dont want to fucking prove myself in front of your friends like some sort of show pony just to see if they approve i want to get to know you oneonone and yes i have tried this before and they always go confer with their friends and then tell me to fuck off
nah if a girl does this to me i immediately unmatch them or ignore them in person its just a way to get free stuff from your or judge you like a dog show
  you wouldnt want to meet with someone like this anyways they think the whole world is out to get them
  well i cant blame someone from having had bad experiences with online dating in the past you also have to understand that women are a bit weaker in this regard
well i told her i was going to another bar and that maybe i could go where she was she just told me she wants to go to the same bar now fuck
i did this once op and i have no regrets i found a wonderful woman and her friends were nice after that we keep in touch we hang out a few times and then we started dating  i dont think all the girls are like you describe i think you should try and go if you feel uncomfortable just make an excuse and go
  yeah ill give it a shoot have nothing to do will post in a couple of hours how it went
heads up i went she was ok but really childish typical rich girl she wanted to fuck but i played dumb was tired and bored doubt she wants to see me again but if she does she is pump and dump material
  it wasnt that bad right op i hope you have better luck in the future
  why does she need bodyguards to go on a date in a public space i think op is right in feeling spun out
i feel like im under constant overt surveillance also known as gang stalking is it even possible for our government to put cameras in your room if this is real would the news care that would be illegal right that and th e government sending people to follow you everywhere you go to mess with you them sending planes over your house to intimidate you them having people honk you constantly this cant be legal and i have never heard of something like this
  you have schizophrenia get help
my initials are djam for reference if you ever search gangstalking threads on google
  airliners are taking people to their destination not attempting to intimidate you youre having paranoid delusions
  what if i dont and its really happening
  its very coordinated its happening mainly they use horns they have cameras everywhere in my car     maybe im hearing things but if im right this would be illegal and considered intimidation and harassment correct
  lets just pretend im not crazy
  its not really happening and you do if you were an important person you wouldnt be posting about it on 4chan so youre insignificant and not worth the resources    if you were important it was happening and youre posting about it on 4chan they already know youre aware and now will be able to hide what youve been exposed to
  would the media want to know about this it seems very illegal
  how would they hide it ghost my thread and fill with bots
youre crazy get help  step back from feeling self important and realize what in gods name would make the government care about some dumbass 4ch user like really think about how insignificant you are and then try telling yourself youre worth being not just watched by the government but fucking memed and harassed by gangstalkers
  you would probably be the first person in history to have airliners rerouted over his house simply in order to disturb him the idea is insane and i cant really pretend otherwise    if this is just like every other case of paranoia ive encountered youre probably not even a person of significance to whatever government agency you think is harassing you
  name one thing youve done that warrants some kind of government plot against you hopefully you arent psychotic and imagining that youre some international spy
  its helicopters and small aircraft mainly but once in a while they do a big plane
that damn helicopter has been following me all day damn coke i should have listened to paulie
  nobody is doing a plane air traffic is normal in developed areas so is beeping
  nothing to warrant this kind of harrassment i have never heard of anything like what there doing to me for anyone hell pablo escobar only had like two fbi agents in cuba trying to catch him
  what about the horns look it sounds stupid but they have cameras in my car and will honk at certain times also lets pretend im telling the truth how illegal is this
  so its probably normal air traffic and normal beeping then i think you might need someone to help you with this paranoia since it can fuck with relationships and social functioning
can they put cameras in my room because i have never heard onereported case of this not even in the mafia
  have you seen one camera or camera transmission or are you just assuming theyre there
  my life is so shit no i can barely function and have lost all my relationships where can i chat with someone i have doctors but i dont see them often i need a psychiatrist
these schizophrenia threads make me sad every time
  they did it because i covered all my phones cameras they put things in my walls that make noises and will make my electronics make noises or turn them on and off they will do this in synchronized patterns or at certain times to let me know im being watched
  it makes me sad to watch as my life is being destroyed sad to watch me lose who i am
  you should call crisis screening to say youre paranoid that youre being harassed impossibly by the government and that you are in need some kind of social intervention    they have people who will take you out to lunch and talk to you about how to access services such as free psychiatric appointments and free medication this is assuming that youre in the us since you havent specified otherwise      you might be losing who you are because youre so isolated
  all of those patterns are just the illness in your head man you need help the patterns dont really exist
  isolation is a part of it but i have this strong desire to isolate i have a really hard time controlling my mood and concentrating everything seems so difficult if i were to commit myself for life if things get worse how bad of a life is it and how would i do this im in the us ill try what you said
  i just want to be dead sometimes ill try to ignore things thanks hopefully i turn go full a beautiful mind crazy
  its pointless to argue the legality of it because its not a thing that happens this kind of stuff is massively expensive and difficult to arrange and even if it was true it would require the person being surveyed to be a major and immediate threat to the government and they wouldnt possibly go through that expense without a concrete reason or listing demands    what could you possibly know that fits the criteria of major immediate countryending information the truth doesnt cut it it has to be a solid concrete tangible fact involving a known person place and time    op every single thing you have described is a symptom of paranoia every damn one you need to see a professional before it gets worse it doesnt make sense for the government to do all of this theres too much cost too much server dats for constant monitoring working in it puts it into perspective just how expensive it is to manage 24hour surveillance people pay tens of thousands for this and lets be straight theres not a valid enough reason for it youre small fry why would they monitor you when theres so many people it makes more sense to monitor and remember they cant watch everyone its too costly and resourceintensive    it makes much more sense that you have a wellknown and relatively common condition occams razor and all we love to think that our brains are infallible but theyre really not our perception is everything to us and you are exhibiting classic signs of skewed perception that align with classic paranoia    you need to see a psychiatrist and get help this will only get worse and you need to make the decision to seek help while you still have the presence of mind to decide that dont leave this alone paranoia will ruin your life if you let it
  life commitment for people in your situation is archaic its been outlawed the people at crisis screening and the state as a ehol just want you to get sorted out and back on your feet they will hook you up with treatment    you can ask them if youre considered safe enough to acess some kind of urgent outpatient intervention services pic related is an example of how to search for that on google i typed in a random county name be honest with them okay its time to get some help
  sorry if this sounds patronizing but outpatient services are outside in the free world inpatient services are usually locked doors    the average person who goes into a mental hospital only stays there for like two weeks and then ideally transitions to intensive outpatient
yes the nsa is a thing everything you do is monitored 24/7 this has been well documented but they still try to keep it secret some people love the prison state too im sure theres some delusion in there but wanting people to leave you the fuck alone is completely normal there are maybe ten people on earth who actually want every living thing to be able to live their own existence instead everyone enslaves other people with pieces of paper yes everyone is out to get you how hilarious would it be if somebody went to a psych and said im paranoid then they said youl never be a victim of a crime then they casually walk though a store and hear a gun shot and go oh the psych said i cant be a victim of a crime so that must be tv then they walk over to shooter and get shot
  what would be a good reason to report this post btw go rot in hell for trying to harm someone that needs help
      this    op get some help  you need love sleep and exercise    try to love the things and people around you go for a walk in nature where you can relax and soak in the beauty of the moment    also try not to worry too much and drink more water
  also nobody is out to get me personallly because nobody gives a shit about me that much to think the world revolves around me and the government is interested in me because i have cute dimples or whatever is flagrantly psychotic
  i also want to clarify that medication isnt the main solution though it can help therapy and socializing again are the main solutions
  and maybe youre an unregistered immigrant or a drug dealer even then the government mainly wants you to pay your taxes and not be a nuisance
  so they put you on disability and help you with housing and mental health care services    im currently getting help from the country by i need more ill take your advice
  yeah isolation breeds paranoia in anyone    we are social animals
  thanks ill try to
  thanks ill remember that
being paranoid that you are being gang stalked is like the opposite of naricism narccistist believe everyone loves them and thinks they are the coolest ever paranoid people think others are watching them or out to get them the truth is the majority of humans are selfishthey are too busy focusing on themselves and their own problems to gangstalk someone    i think paranoid peoples main problem is that they lack empathy to understand how much depth there is in a human life everyones life is huge and complicated just like yours is to think 20 entire human beings are watching you specifically is absurd
  im neither im a citizen
  then theres normal narcissistic behavior which is done by insecure people who dislike themselves i dont really like the dsm
  you are probably not paying attention in traffic because of a psychosis and other people honk to make you pay attention because you drive dangerously
  i was worried the guy talking about how getting help was bad social programming was you thanks for asking for help    i also get paranoid sometimes especially after things that have happened to me ive never had delusions but i know that living life on the defensive is tough    i hope you make some friends in this world again and that you meet the best proffesionals you can godpseed
  its when im parked
  thank you and just to clear things up nobodies heard of the government doing these things
  many auditory hallucinations are every day sounds this isnt a horror movie where voices are telling you to skin strangers its honestly more devious than that because its near impossible to tell if the sound is real or not
  schizophrenia is more than being paranoid/delusional
  although thats true he is certain at least in need of immediate mental health services as paranoia of this level is basically latestage psychosis    op the only thing out to get you is your own mind you can get past this you just need a little help i know it seems impossible but you need to try to trust the medication and that it will work for you    please reach out to someone that cares about you and you trust or even once cared about you and still would tell them whats going on and that you need support from someone you will to get through this you cant alone
  thanks i will try to contact some old friends
bump
maybe its not the government but maybe some random person you pissed off  and that person decided to get revenge by making you paranoid and scared
wife told me she loves me but no longer in love with me two nights ago but says she still wants to make me happy we have kids and live together buying a new house and will cohabitate i am super confused about what is happening said she would have sex with me every night at 10pm but got the told im tired the first damn night    so installed one of those dating apps and got a date with a fitness instructor within a day she is super fit and has a kid ive been asking wife to lose weight for 4 years and she just started to try in the last few months talkimg about at least she is trying she also interviewimg for a job she has been full time mom for a few years    probably going to see this fitness girl tomorrow after work might bang     am i justified i feel like i am in some type of pause in the marriage but wife wants to cock block me while she loses weight and leaves probably    what do you people think should i sow my oats during this time of uncertainty and never mention it in case wife decides she is in love with me again seems like the natural thing to do
  if your wife does not provide sex then it is okay for you to look for it elsewhere especially now that she told you all that shit you are basically not married anymore
if your spouse tells you they dont love you dog then wtf is there part of being a mentally stable happy healthy individual is having your base needs met one of those needs is usually sex for a man so yeah you tried to have that need met in the most responsible way for yourself and society via marriage but your spouse has reniged on that agreement and since we do not live under sharia law you cannot take what is rightfully yours so you must go elsewhere     the best advice i can give you on this is dont feel guilty about it at all you should be discrete theres really no point notifying your spouse of all the dirty details but also dont act like you have some dirty little secret to hide be mentally prepared to matter of factly lay out your reasons without emotions     its essentially just you making yourself whole on a busted contract    the bigger problem is that your wife doesnt love you id be talking divorce if i heard that shit
  idk what you should do id probably just kill myself at that point because it sounds like you have a horrible and lonely existence ahead of you
you are pathetic
am i justified  adultery is never justified and it certainly isnt here you dont even know what the hell she meant by that and for all you know it could simply be the obvious statement that she doesnt feel like she did when she first met youwhich happens to essentially every couple go to counseling if you want to talk about that more but the fact that you decide to cheat on her at the drop of a hat tells me youre probably a piece of shit who couldnt be trusted to maintain the marriage anyway      if your wife does not provide sex then it is okay for you to look for it elsewhere  absolute fucking bullshit if youre enough of a degenerate to leave without even bothering to talk about it over sex at least have the decency to divorce and support her     she literally said she loves him just that shes not in love which is cryptic at best and not something to melt down about    while regular sex contributes to a healthy marriage throwing a tantrum about not getting it daily on demand doesnt cheating on your wife who still says she loves you wants to make you happy and is even trying to lose weight for you is in no way justified thats almost as far away from justifiable as you can get
  dude no no its not fucking justified and youre honestly a cunt for even considering a date with some other chick    from what your wife said id guess the romance is dead which id guess is as much your fault as hers do the shit that you did before you got married take her out for dates do cheesy stuff she likes that kind of thing shell feel better about it dont taint your relationship like some kind of stupid chad
  and here we have a woke anon
  so she loves you wants to make you happy yall are married and will continue to live together and continue to raise your kids together but she is not in love with you semantics sounds like everything is fine and normal and typical except that your wife is a fucking dumbass    no do not go cheat on your wife because she you seem to be continuing on the normal married path minus the fact that she doesnt know what the fuck she is talking about    better option than cheating is to slap the shit out of her for being playing some stupid ass word games
  you fucked it up on literally the first line she didnt tell op that she doesnt love him fucking read idiot
love but not in love    i have literally no idea what the fuck is wrong with the other anons but this sounds like classic i like you as a person not a partner  since you have kids and a house its worth talking to her and getting her to explain exactly what she means but that before getting laid    i think the other anons are delusional i could only assume this is an end of relationship situation
  end of relationship  except that she loves him wants to live with him remain married and continue raising their kids together under the same roof she is moron and needs some sense slapped into her immature semanticstwisting typical female shittesting brain
  maybe but how about being honest with her like she tried to do and just open the marriage you go fuck and she steps out and both of you babysit while the other gets off do it for the kids thats what your wife is proposing though she doesnt love you anymore
  an open marriage would fuck the kids up way worse than a divorce my god you people are idiots
cool story bro
  every couple fall in and out of love with each other over the years you just hang in there until it somehow comes back
  you be discrete dumbass and the kids will never know boyfriends or girlfriends never come to the house op is looking to retaliate and his wife willing to sacrifice op doesnt really give a shit how she feels but only about getting some pussy my guess hes not a very good husband has a fragile ego constantly punishes her for any slight and why the love is gone
    read up on stuff like child allowance and all legality of divorce  make sure you get enough money and things you value on the side so you can be safe in case of a divorce  try to hide your money in cash where she cant find it and she wont know about it so that it cant be taken from you  next time you talk about love and so on try to record her saying i dont love you anymore if the divorce goes to court you have proof that she had ill intend for a long time
would you fuck  ill get straight to the point and you should know im super serious  i think the statute laws are bullshit if a 13 year old girl (((woman))) looks like pic related who in their right minded wouldnt make the smashes  biologically were programmed to be most attracted to women whove just started their bleedy time it ensures our cummy gets the yummy before anyone elses and thus the propagation of our species and the fulfillment of natural purpose  so wise sages of 4chan if a person had no inclination to save face diogenes what would the best way be to attack the statute laws  brainstorm with me  ill be back once ive jacked to pic related
no i wouldnt fuck the best way to fight the laws is tell everyone you meet irl what you do and your views convert them
  i support your local sheriff in tasering your ass and being placed on a sex offenders list you sick fuck
  who in their right minded wouldnt make the smashes  no one in their right minded would make the smashes
no but i think i understand something op  youre a pedo trying to justify your beliefs  my advice seek therapy you sick fuck
this is bait move on everyone
  damn thats a 13 year old
  laws schmaws thankfully where i live age of consent can be 14 if the older partner isnt taking advantage of the younger one  of course someone over 30 shouldnt go around explicitly seeking out 14 year olds but if she looks and acts adult like getting drunk and making out with strangers having went through puberty and being sexually active imho youre morally in the clear
  biologically    nope our biology is extremely complex its not simple like youngfertilebest     weve evolved both socially and physically over hundreds of thousands of years you cant make a biological claim without understanding anything about biology     so youre attracted to young girls  that sucks wait until the law says they can make a decision 1618 depending on country and then try to have sex with them if you wish     you have a mental disorder deviation from norm if you find 18 year olds old and worn out
this isnt /r9k/  you arent asking for advice   get the fuck out
  there is loads of scientific evidence that the last part of the brain to develop is the part that judges the pros and cons of behavior choices thats why teenagers sometimes do the stupidest things    based on that evidence the law judges that an underage person however mature looking does not have the full capacity to make informed decisions thats why for example they cant sign contracts and thats why even their consent to sexual activity is not deemed legitimate
  biologically were programmed to be most attracted to women whove just started their bleedy time  paedophilia isnt normal its a paraphilia a mental illness you are not like other humans fuck off
even if it was legal i wouldnt tweens are retards
  islam
why are we having this conversation no the fuck i wouldnt fuck a child
ive had serious anxiety related incidents for the last 5 years or so since my grandmother died im 100 sure i have some kind of anxiety disorder my question is can i take xanax or my own or do i really need to see a psychiatrist
hey going to talk to a banker for home loans any /adv/ wife and i have been thinking about buying a house and we just want to know our options and such any questions we should ask the guy in specific
youve given us absolutely nothing to work with    go and talk to the banker
  im asking if there are any good thing to ask ive never bought a house before and going to the banker kind of blind unsure of what types of things i should be on the look out what hidden fees are there if we owe them 250k is our monthly going to be 500 or something   literally anything would be helpful
  ask them    we dont know where you are how much youre borrowing or even if you can afford to buy a house how the fuck are we supposed to give you questions to ask if we know nothing about you and your question is simply what do we ask
  when you didnt know these things and an anon yells at you he has nothing to give  end up thanking him anyways  these are things i should know about i appreciate the time to answering no matter how trivial it seemed   thanks anon
beware usury
  if youre in the us id opt for a 30year loan rather than a 15 people will say that youll pay it off faster with a 15 but its a bit of a false economy what they should say is that for a 15 year you must pay it off faster because of the higher minimum monthly payment    ive read that if you pay off a 30 year in 15 years the interest paid is about the same but with a 30 you have the option of paying less if you get into trouble financially
  interesting   and if we want to move out before either is up we still can and just sell the house right the money owed goes to the new owners yes
  the amount owing is factored into the sale and youll get whats left or youll need to cut a check for whats missing this does happen    remember that the commissions on a home are anywhere from 46 and thats customarily paid by the seller so if you buy a place with 20k down and a mortgage debt of 100k live in it for a year and sell it heres what will happen     your mortgage balance will hardly be affected maybe a couple thousand bucks so you owe only 98k after the sale youll owe 6 on the sale price 12006  7200 and assume the sales price is the same as you paid no increases    seller pays 120 you owe 987200  105200 so you walk away with about 15k which is less than what you put into it    now imagine you bought at the top of the market and housing has tanked you are now trapped unless you have the cash to bail yourself out    now im not saying housing is terrible but be aware of what can happen and how housing/mortgages work    have you considered househacking ie buying a duplex/tri/quad living in one unit and renting out the rest
  actual bank loan officer here  get a fixedrate mortgage adjustable rate mortgages can raise your monthly payments extending such loans to people with bad credit is part of what caused the financial crisis of 200709
  you pay more in interest with a 30year mortgage no matter what but youre right that paying a 30year off in 15 years gives you a lot more financial flexibility its what id do
  to be more specific youll pay more in interest over 30 years of a 30year mortgage than if you take 15 years to pay it off because over 30 years interest has twice as much time to accrue but a 15year mortgage will cost somewhat less than a 30year mortgage paid off in 15 years because 15year mortgages have lower interest rates since the lender is assuming less risk
hey /adv/ i have nobody to turn to about this and i thought i might just spill my theory out here ok so i think my dad has been having an affair with my mom i will greentext the whole situation  be me  still living at my parents   i recently turned 18 and college is near me so its cheaper to stay here  stay up late either shitposting or studying   know the schedules of at what time everyone leaves and everyone comes back  i know its autistic but i just learned it subconsciously getting a bit off topic back to the story  so recently ive noticed how my parents have been more distant   not fighting just speaking to each other less and less  notice how my dad is arriving later and at more erratic hours in the last couple months   ffw a cupple weeks of this  gets me thinking   a childhood friends parents got divorced earlier in the year   his mom and my dad are coworkers and friends at that  notice how they have been growing closer and more often than not when i call for any reason they are together   get to thinking   start to think of ideas of him having an affair   ffw a cupple weeks of keeping my thoughts bottled up  and that leads me to now  am i grasping at straws and just thinking of far fetched ideas or might i be onto something and if i am should i investigate and if i do where should i start pic unrelated
  fuck man that sucks i think he is definitely banging her but dont forget youre a man too so confront him with a simple question if you think he truly is
how can i be more assertive when i am 56
  dont back down to things and learn to say no to people being taller wont solve your problems because you will probably just blame some other physical feature that youre insecure about
  be like putin
is your dick big that usually helps
  55 inches
  strong eye contact  go to the gym  be blindly confident in yourself even if you think you dont deserve it
  my height affected my confidence since my childhood
  no it didnt you just use it as an excuse
  you felt like you couldnt be confident cause your short so you became weak  now youre looking for advice on how to be confident when youre short because youre starting to realise it might actually be possible to be confident at your height  you have to accept that youre not the tallest and you probably never will be but there will always be girls who are either shorter the same height or dont care about it  theyll care more about your confidence because they wont want a depressed wreck of a boy when they want an assertive man  you will not be confident until you accept the hand youre given then you can start to look at yourself better hold yourself in better esteem and treat yourself better and then women will look at you better
  just understand that if anyone ever puts a hand on you sue their ass into the ground when i learned that i didnt give a fuck
  so your dick is exactly 1/12th of your height hows your girth though
  average i guess
if it helps you im not assertive at all
  and im 62 forgot to add
  i really doesnt
  fuck off retard    not him but i was the shortest kid in the class until the end of high school it fucked me up and i can only pray that a car kills you or your family

can you gain weight from only chewing food and then spitting out im not bulimic or anorexic im just fasting but food is tempting me
  why are you fasting hunger strike
  trying to do a body cleanse i eat pretty unhealthy so the plan is to chug water for a week or two to clean out the system and then going on a diet to help lose the weight/shrink stomach
  you gain like 10 of the calories or something if youre fasting for a reason other than an ed then just fast chewing and spitting fucks woth your health something with acid reflux and stomach acid and all this stuff in my hights of my eating disorder i just restricted its less gross
  yeah i dont plan on making it long term just for desperate occasions
how do i forget about having a gf if i know ill never have one
by knowing you chose to never have a gf
  by not having such a pessimistic attitude lighten up op
    i thought i was forever alone at 26 years old until a month ago now im dating a girl i just met randomly at the local library      i had no idea id get a girlfriend like this was a bit unexpected but amazing
  dont be like that there are plenty of little half black jamals and tyrones for you to take care of op i believe that for every single man there is a single mother with a black baby waiting to meet him and love him
  that was just petty dude
  its also true
  the girl in the pic is literally just my ex but hotter in every way
  but im serious i will never have a gf or wife
  i know
  same bro i just live with it
i need help anons im desperate for it  ive been over the last 18 months trying to accomplish an extremely important goal at this point ive put so much pressure on it it doesnt even matter if its effective or not i feel like its my last opportunity to get out of depression  but because of my depression the incompetence of myself and that of others i cant achieve it anymore so im gonna try the last thing i can    because of a government exploit i could make it if i am briefly physically incapacitated i live in europe so healthcare costs wont be a problem  what would be the best method for this i really dont want to fuck up and slit a major artery or something    all im asking is for it to leave no scar and to fully heal reasonably fast looking for any possible advice
  just do something really stupid just so that nobody suspects you    like maybe buy some avocado and accidentaly shove the knife through your hand you wouldnt believe how many retards fucked that up    
become a skateboarder
anything done to your foot is stereotypical and screams fraud
  thats a bit impractical
  id be surprised if anyone cared
  mfw im such a retard i expected 4chan to be useful
  i might as well keep this thread alive for a little longer
at least if i was a full normie id get mocked but im just mediocre enough to where nobody gives a shit
dont do it its not worth it  if you get investigated for fraud then youll really wanna kill yourself
  but im not doing something necessarily illegal the wounds are gonna be physical therell be no doubt about it all id need to do is make up some excuse for the injury which shouldnt be hard
    like at least reply dude
  anon dont do it its an extremely lame thing to do
  i know but i dont know what else i could do
i feel disgusting i want to wither away and die it feels like someone punched a hole through my stomach
now that i think about it it doesnt even have to do that much with actually accomplishing the goal i just want to stay in a hospital for a while i want to just not move for a while
i want to die fuck
can somebody just tell me to go kill myself or go to /r9k/ or something
ah fuck i just realised im an attention whore
  punch the floor as hard as you can   stop and take a deep breath then think about every inch of pain in your fist  punch the floor again  repeat until satisfied
  yeah thats what i do works great except i will punch my legs
    yes you are you fucking nigger even /r9k/ wouldnt stand you shut the fuck up and stop refreshing your thread every 5 seconds and getting mad nothing new was posted
  nice thanks anon
  holy shit how dumb do you have to be to respond to a open attention whore complete mongoloid
be me  20 years old  like girl for almost 3 years now  extremely close with her  invite her over to my place for the afternoon  finally make moves on her after being her close friend for forever  we make out and hook up before she has to leave  i feel almost nothing at all    is something wrong with me i was so nervous and excited about finally manning up and making a move and i got literally nothing from it

  yeah thats exactly how i felt at least its good to know im not the only one thanks for that
give me a fool proof plan to lose my virginity on friday     im 19 years old im a 511 manlet average as average can be muscular but not lean so its a moot point    i need a plan to finally lose my virginity tomorrow so i can finally get over myself and focus on the bigger things in life and stop being so distracted by sex    in this plan i need you to include a time slot for gym from 430/5 to 6pm as well as a 3045 minute time slot for a haircuit albeit im not too fussed about the haircut    i can go to a nightclub but i need a script on what to say because last time i went i went around asking girls if they wanted to dance and the 1 that said yes i didnt know what else to say and walked away once we got to the dance floor    also i dont have nice clothes just some vaguely fashionable black sweatpants a shirt that shows off my arms and traps and dirty trainers ive worn all through high school  so bare that in mind as i dont have the money to get more clothes and pay to go clubbing so you will have to plan for my horrible dress sense
find a pill junkie you went to school with on social media and offer them money
you could always manipulate
  mate id rather spend that money on macdonalds ngl
gonna sleep now     please give thought out responses so i can read them in the morning  i am desperate
meet someone at school work or through a mutual friend thats literally it
literally just talk to women find one that expresses interest in you and ask them out if absolute slobbish manchildren can do it so can you
  one that expresses interest in you  no can do
511 manlet  your issues are in your head
fool proof way go to a prostitute
  this anon  dont over complicate it
  just get a prostitute
  purchase the services of a prostitute my son  this method is 100 foolproof
      prostitution is out of the question thats not part of the fantasy im looking to fulfill plus i literally cannot even afford it what do ever
  waaah give me a foolproof plan  reeee but not that one
  no money  no looks  no charisma  youre not getting laid anytime soon lad
  beggars cant be choosers let me tell you this if you have any sort of morals or interigery you can forget women at least until you are in your late 20s most people your age range are losers no offense
  thats not within my guidelines i laid out       thats why we need a plan muscles are the only thing i have at my disposal and a fairly decent face when clean shaven      i dont care for your bitter rhetoric real life is different to internet memes
why not tinder or are you going to sperg out on that too
  lol funny thing i run a discord group of 1821 kids and they all thought the same thing guess you young kids gotta learn the hard way dont say i didnt warn you just know everyone one of them eventually agree with me ill say it again kids in your age range lack social status only the rich or high class kids get laid in your age ranges
  dude you run a discord group for children no wonder you have skewed world views
  thats not my only group im in i just used that one as a example dude i know you damn kids think you know everything if you dont want to listen at least listen to aaron clarey on youtube we use his videos in the self improvement threads all the time i think a youngsters would benefit it will get all that school brainwashing out your out of your system
  what a retarded comic someone is sour grapes
  you will be even more distracted once you do it you retard
  why not just get money instead of chasing women im gonna tell you right now there is nothing that can fuck a young mans life up than a women im just saying that should be a priority right now
    my hope was ill stop being obsessed over sex if i have it and realise im not missing out  i just want to focus on my career right now but i keep getting distracted by my dick and feelings of having no gf
  why dont you take a seat over there
  would you be willing to spend 58 in a correctional facility
  uh you uh major in sumthin stoopid op thats what oddly specific but uh yeah
  if by 12 tonight im still a virgin sure
  the kids were lonely and had no one to talk to so i sort of became their father replacement they engaged me first if that makes it any better
im still a virgin lads help
  give me a fool proof plan to lose my virginity on friday  unironically hire a prostitute
it usually takes time to get a girl to sleep with you but if you can go to clubs you have a good chance of finding one that is looking for a good time that night and you might be able to pull some
  watch aaron clarey
i had an exam today and couldnt think of anything else i onyl realized it was his birthday when i got home literally everyone had already wished him a happy birthday exept me now he hates me amd thinks im inconsiderate/selfish i feel like shit what do
how do i fix this anyone
  buy him a present make plans on another day bake him a cake do something for him that he will appreciate and youre good
  make him some really good cookies or brownies go see him and suck his dick really really hard
    this go suck his dick thats his present its hard to be mad at someone when theyre deepthroating you
    great ideas the issue is he studies abroad so i wont have him here for at least a couple of weeks if he still lived here there would be no chance for me to forget his birthday i want some advice on what to say rather than how to act which would be much easier for me so yeah i am pretty autistic i made it worse by not knowing how to react to the mess i made he kinda forgave me but i dont feel thats enough
  he sounds like a petulant child buy him a bag of chocolates
  your boyfriend sounds like a faggot im pretty sure i stopped caring about my own birthday when i was like 14 if anything hes the inconsiderate/selfish one for expecting you to give a shit about such a fucking pointless day grow
send him some nudes and try your best with them also come back and post them here
expecting birthday wishes and presents when youre collegeaged  youre dating a manchild op do yourself a favor and runaway before his childishness seriously damages your life
      this thread went from me wanting advice on fixing a mistake i made to me doubting the entire relationship he is pretty alpha but has anger issues sometimes i am his first lover so i usually blame myself when stuff like this happens just because im slightly more experienced but now im starting to see through this
  dump him op mine was even worse he saw an ecard i sent a guy at work for his birthday and i had to put up with his screeching about it for two months and then i forgot his for just a day that did it he was such a baby about the whole thing
    i onyl realized it was his birthday when i got home  did you at least wish it to him after you realized you forgot    and dont listen to anyone who says he is a baby because he cares about his birthday  maybe he values it a lot so what  cant you have something that is important to you  the reason of a birthday is to celebrate the person maybe in some cultures it isnt valued much but in others it is  just because you dont care about your birthday doesnt mean i cant care about mine    im sure if you tell him what you wrote here that you had an important exam and so on he will understand
  he literally just said he gives too much of a shit about me also mentioned that other friends of his i had made fun of had already wished him a happy birthday its ridiculous cause its not like they marked this day on a calendar they just have facebook accounts and recieve notifications about birthdays but he cant see through this i feel like all he cares about are facades instead of actual feelings
  what does it matter that they received a facebook notification what matters is that they actually wished him a happy birthday i guarantee that not everybody whos facebook friends with him actually told him hbd
  i did wish him a happy birthday but really awkwardly because i felt guilty i have 4 exams this week one per day he knows that but doesnt care cause i was awake at 12am and still forgot
i like how this is going from  i forgot about my bfs birthday im such a cunt  to  my boyfriend is giving me shit for forgetting about his birthday hes such a cunt
  tbh people here changed my mind about him i always pay special attention to birthdays look for unique gifts and such the fact that im getting so much shit for a one time thing drives me nuts
  how much shit are you actually getting what did he say/do
  stuff like im an idiot for expecting so much from you and i give too much of a shit about you
  and a shit ton of deleted messages god knows what he had in mind
  damn i thought you might have tricked yourself into believing he cared too much about it because you felt guilty but yeah if he says this kind of shit hes really overreacting and being inconsiderate childish and selfcentered
  you know i dont want to appear like a saint here but i am usually right about stuff when we argue and he cant seem to stand the fact that i am right he believes i am tricking him or something so anything i say to convince him is ignored they just seems like meaningless words to him doesnt even bother to read them   anyway he is a great person and cares a lot about me but i cant stand his outburtsts of anger no matter how rare they are cause he really pushes it i wished he listened to me more often
  i always pay special attention to birthdays look for unique gifts and such    imagine he knows that and thats something he likes about you  think about that sentence you wrote just for a second and think how he might feel
  is there any chance hell ever forgive me i feel so bad i cant even study
i feel bad for you this thread has the worst replies i have seen in a while  if my gf forgets my birthday i would be pissed too he is not being a baby or needy even if he doesnt value his birthday he was expecting the girl that he has feelings for to treat for something  ok you messed up and you feel like shit good you should how do we fix this though well dont send him nudes dont suck his duck unless until you make up again if my gf does this i will feel unwanted and yeah i will think that she doesnt care about me so she would have to prove that she do care nudes dont do that  also apologize tell him being busy is not an excuse to forgetting such an important day what would have been the perfect present ever you can go from there you didnt have to spend a lot of money or put a lot of thought into this but now you do just tell him you love/like him often tell him you miss him often ask him how can you make it up for him
  one more thing youre saying that he is overreacting saying that you dont care just because of one mistake honestly it could have been multiple of things and this was the straw that broke his back youre his first he is expecting a romantic relationship give him one  you know what is the worst feeling for a guy to feel used to feel that he gives so much and gets nothing in return
    very insightful helped me a lot thanks anon
    this guy and your bf are little limp dick bitches no grown man fucking cares about his birthday like that especially to the point of getting upset and throwing a little sissy fit    your bf is a little emotional sensitive sissy boy dump him and get an actual man
  this idea that birthday presents are only for kids always baffles the fuck out of me is this some yankee thing in tennessee birthday wishes and gifts are a lifelong tradition
  yeah he kinda sounds like a bitch but nothing too serious a relationship isnt about fixing each others shitty personalities its about dealing with them now you know that he takes this topic serious tell him youre sorry and thats it if he still cries about it afterwards i wouldnt bother its just childish      are you stupid or smth you got some random guy a card but you forgot the birthday of your own boyfriend he seems to be better off without you
  im a manly man because i dont care about traditions and values god im so manly because i dont want any sign of love by my so fuck yeah manly man
  my bad wrong anon  meant this cunt  
  hes just looking for a reason to butthurt
  it wasnt a random but a guy at work and people give cards all the time like we get a calendar each month that has everybodys birthday on it at work you sound like my ex trying to make it something more than what it was like my ex started showing up at my work unannounced trying to catch me i dont know screwing him at my desk i guess it was kinda funny though cause one time i was at lunch with the guy and he flipped totally out
  he does sound like an idiot not gonna lie but you do too if you really cared about him you would try to understand him but instead you laughed him off ironically you sound like my ex too some people just dont match
  does he make a big deal about your birthday if he doesnt youre even
its all fixed now he apologised for freaking out on me and acknowledges his random outbursts of anger im glad he listened to me i also have to make up for the fact that i forgot his birthday by looking for a special gift during the time hes abroad
  glad to hear it
im fucking useless i camt get through in my life i cant change things for better it seems like my fate is to sit in front of a computer for the rest of my useless life i am afraid of the world out there ive tried so much to become someone better but the only outcome is feeling worse and worse because there is no result whatsoever i am a failure to my friends to my family and to myself i cant become productive and the hardest things i try to do have only mediocre outcomes i am a complete failure and i dont know how to change that all i do is what my body needs i never actually accomplish something of importance and nor i will at this rate so what else is to do
that sux fren tried therapy
your very own best friend is yourself if you think negative your thoughts will manifest eventually think the opposite start forming positive affirmations get off the computer go for a walk and think about your goals in life what truly motivates you once you get home write them down like youve accomplished them im confident i attract wealth i love my job im fit then make conscious efforts to be productive wake up early make your bed etc have a set up routine and youll see changes notice how little things in life can make you happy and appreciate life   stop comparing yourself to other youre not set up for failure   i love you anon you can do this 3

  do you want actual help or do you just want to write a blog post because i can help you
  not op but in the same boat unemployed for 9 months now credit card half maxed out tried going back to work last week with a warehouse gig but i fainted on day one barely an hour in and havent gone back there since started weekly therapy and its going well but im still incapable of getting my shit together   even after removing my biggest forms of procrastinations i just find more ways to kill time because i simply dont know how to fix the underlying problem  so any help is appreciated thanks
should i ask my ex broke up less than a week ago if its ok to already jump into something else i dont want to hurt them by doing this so soon and want them to know i care for them    is a courtesy break really a thing
itll just look like rubbing it in their face but yes that is too soon imo  how long were you dating for
  roughly 3 months how long do you suggest i wait
   i care for them  then dont be involved in each others lives until neither one of you feels anything for the other any more  make sure they cant become aware of your business make sure you cant get into theirs and live your lives    how to pull off the bandaid  quickly and cleanly everyone knows this anything else is an excuse
  no that is just rubbing it in their face and desu what do you expect them to say
  needing your exs permission to have a life
  true
  yikes
  wait a month a bro science calculation is that about 40 of the time you dated for is how long it takes to completely move on if you feel you are over your ex then by all means move on but take a deep look at yourself before deciding on a whim also asking your ex is a shit idea like the other anon said it will just come off as bad even if youre trying to be sincere a courtesy break can be real but thats more of them not knowing so try to keep it that way if you can
i posted about how my sister used to commit sexual violence against me when i was younger off your chest thread a few days ago and an anon suggested i tell someone how do i go about telling someone that my sister molested me when i was younger should i go to my parents or a therapist how do i get a therapist
awh man see a shrink better to not tell your parents at least for now  first talk to a shrink and see what advice hes got for ya
  wasnt in that thread so it depends    trying to gang up on her behind her back without her knowing is shit move unless shes a total psychopath anyways     how bad was the molestation did she beat you until you became submissive or was she just inappropriate there is a major difference in how you treat either scenario if she was violent and she is generally manipulate then you need take it to your parents and a therapist if she wasnt then talk directly to her about it
  before the any of the molestation even started she was violent she used to choke till i almost blacked out and squeezed and kick me in the testicals until they bruised   the molestation started with her touching me then moved onto intercourse for the first couple times she sat on my face till i gasped for air one of the first times she put it in she was on her period  so yes she is a pyschopath
  i go to an outpatient medical center already to adhd medication i could try there but the mental health treatment in the place i live is so bad i am convinced theyll just give me pills and tell me to fuck off should i try that i have a doctors appointment when i get out of college for winter break
  yeah definitely go for the therapist then then tell your parents about after his counsel thats some rough shit man good like i
    i recommend going to your therapist first your parents will most probably not know what to do its the best possible thing you can do in the situation    good luck anon
    sound like a plan thanks guys    i have classes in the morning so good night
if coffee doesnt make me smarted then why i do i feel smart on it
if coffee made people smarter the world wouldnt be full of idiots
  because youre actually trying to use your brain
should i honestly be worried about false sexual harassment charges against me from a crazyactual mentally ill with bipolar and depression girlfriend we were together 2 years ago and i cut communication after she cheated    when i was in college before finals wed hide out in a dorm hall and study all night together wed invite our other friends but they wouldnt come over    boom 12 people know were alone together in a place we arent supposed to be in    same girl recently accused her next boyfriend she cheated on me with him of sexual assault dunno if it happened for real or not     this has been a thought in my head for 2 years now should i honestly be worried how could i even prove my innocence from that shit
lol at the actual state of america
  exactly    like in 15 years she could accuse me and id get completely fucked
you dont prove your innocence she proves your guilt she cant do that tough shit for her
  its 2018 the guy has to prove the innocence    plus it would really fuck over my friendships/family/maybe even expelled from college
  this is why you just dont fuck with roasties   wait until the artificial wombs come
  theres really nothing you can do except hope that you dont get targeted maybe move to another country where people are sane
    what country
  i dont know someplace that isnt the us or canada
  stop believing in incel cult memes a girl cant get someone jailed just by a false accusation out of nowhere
  terrible bait felicia but okay  it has come out that two of judge kavanaghs accusers were admittedly lying he could have easily gotten jail time if found guilty if someone innocent in that high position of power went to jail false accusers could basically get anyone dethroned in the blink of the eye  also a reminder for you goqueenyass1995 single custodial motherhood is a choice
  save up money and if the situation becomes an environmental hazard take a polygraph you should pass no problemo
i need some kind of activity to go socialize more what kind of groups can i find in my town and how do i reach them
  maybe facebook groups
my gf is chinese and i really like her i can see myself marrying her but the thought of having asian children kind of bothers me i have nothing against asians but i myself am not asian i know thats extremely racist but is it normal to want to have kids that are your own race
date your own race and you wont have a problem if you actually loved her you would love the children as well no matter what race
  do you live in america if so eat a soiled sports sock america isnt an ethnostate i bet you arent even of one ethnicity no matter how white you claim to be whats the difference between a germanic and an italic having children and an anglo and a chinese
  you retard op if you ever had children with her they wouldnt be asian theyd be your god damn children thats how sex works half genes from dad and half from mom if what you mean is that theyll have some asian characteristics yet are dating an asian mother then you have nothing to complain about if on the other hand the fact that children will have asian characteristics bothers you despite having asian gf then its time you cut the shit and fight out your inner racism the kind that makes you think your gf is nothing but a sex robot unworthy of human and human traits consideration
  is it normal to want to have kids that are your own race    yes its actually not normal to not want that
  skull shape epicanthal fold potential for wide nose yellow skin etc ffs at least dont be an idiot if you arent going to be racist like a normal person
  i have brown hair guess ill only fuck brunettes blondes are off the table
  please ditch the whole children thing you are clearly not ready to be a father     based
  i know thats extremely racist      yep
  stop being manipulative
at least you admit it unlike most other my gf is asian
stop being so racist and if you cant dump her so she doesnt have to deal with your racist bullshit
  having chink/white mixed kids is normal in canada
  thats your reptilian brains desision and no one can fault you for that
  your kid will be your own race though theyll just be chinese too either way i wouldnt have kids at all if i were you you dont sound ready
  his kids will look more asian ive seen neigbours men blondehaired white chick asian kid blackhaired asian i wouldnt ever want that and i love asian chicks
  you are a retard and you shouldnt have kids
  ive seen neigbours  this is like a child trying to prove something they believe in
  you already look fucking weird with a chinese girlfriend you will look more like a cuck walking around with a child who looks nothing like you hahaha
sup /adv/    i have had the recent fortunate situation of receiving a sizable holiday endofyear bonus from my place of employment 50 employee company i have a lot of respect for the owners of the company and they donate a decent amount to charity    my question is is it possible to donate to a charity on their behalf as a thank you for what theyve given me if so do any of you anons have suggestions/recommendations on charities for context they typically donate to groups which provide for children in need so i would like something along those lines    pic unrelated

start reading lit core books and mediate for 15 minutes every night go longer if you feel like it not bullshitting you
  lit core books  any you recommend or should i just pick something off of their wiki
  meditations by marcus aurelius     good life advice and philosophy
you buff now if so i think you should enter a first responder field paramedic firefighter police officer all are fulfilling and all need more people to apply especially police officers   every department except the really really big ones are understaffed plus theres a lot of jobs in law enforcement that are overlooked and that dont require a college degree take a looksie in a job like that you learn every day

  that pic  me in the middle
  did you fail because you were honestly stupid because you didnt try or because you were depressed three different causes with three different fixes figure out which it is and then go to your school counsellor for help
  depressed
hey /adv/ i need your help    im 18 and i recently changed school here i met this girl i started talking to her and we instantly became friends this was the first time i felt happy after my depression which lasted 2 years i asked her out and she accepts instantly everything goes well and the more im with her the more i start to fall in love and at the end of the day my feelings for her escape and i start to act like a retard after that she started talking to me less and i feel like she hates me now she asked me to help her with homework but after that day she cancelled everything  what do i have to do to solve this before i lose her   i feel really bad and i lost my will to do anything i dont want to have depression again after everything ive done
a friend of mine out in the hell hole known as cali has been getting gang threats from an ex the faggot is associated with a group who has already killed someone in her school so shes taking it pretty seriously i told her to call the cops but she thinks if she calls the cops this guy will know it was her what do
  tell her to fuck him as long as he has a use for her shell stay alive pussies have power and it might be the only weapon she has
ok so please dont make fun of me but could someone tell me if ive done something bad    get taxi   end of ride he pulls up an app and tells me to enter card info  i do it it looks legit  he says thanks and i leave  check card balance nothings been taken out at all    im new to this sort of shit is this normal
where do you live maybe an anon that lives in the same country might tell you if its normal  i know i wouldnt fucking do it sounds shady as all hell but i also kind of doubt a registered cab driver would try to pull that sort of stunt on the clock  actually was he a registered driver did you call an agency or some shit or did you just hail someone on the street  either way regularly check your account twice a day at the absolute minimum and as soon as something seems out of line call up your bank  i dont usually use taxis but when i do i only ever do it through an app payment is much easier and theyre much less likely to pull the typical shady shit cab drivers do like take a longer route add fees for no reason or try to bullshit you on the price
  im in the uk he seemed legitimate had the car the equipment everything was in a line with other drivers    im checking my account and it hasnt registered any purchases at all since yesterday but i did buy a drink earlier and it hasnt registered that either
  its normal for transactions to take up to a few days to show up  i think if he was a legit cab driver youre safe because again no cab driver with more than 20 neurons would risk their job its not like they got it because they were good at anything else to pull off a stunt like that it just wouldnt be worth it  that being said remain vigilant by checking your account generally speaking in this day and age theres no reason you wouldnt check it once a day what with how easy it is to do online and in the future avoid transactions that would require you to enter shit by text into the persons private smartphone  once again apps come to mind im sure there are at least some based in the uk    its weird to me they wouldnt use one of those portable card scanners those use mobile data and generally look a lot better than entering credit card info into another mans smartphone
  thanks thats put me at ease     its more just that it seemed weird entering my security code and expiration date onto this app on this dudes phone i didnt have any other way of paying him though
so yeah    my gums are receding above my canines    i brush and floss    im 22    what the fuck do i do
  go to a dentist brushing doesnt matter if you have an inflammation
fucking same i eat too much candy
  go to a dental hygienist i had the same issue it took about 30 min and was painful as fuck but the issue got fixed immediately no more receding gums no more bleeding
  what did the dentist do
  deep scrape cleaning
i also have the same problem dentist said he doesnt know where my enamel defect come from my teeth and my gums are perfectly fine and wellcared maybe somebody knows anything
my parents dont entrust me with basic tasks because they think ill fuck them up they never encourage me about anything and are basically embarrassed by me they drink every night and are a general shitshow that im holding together out of goodwill whats absolutely messed up is that i have made my own way i have paid my own bills for the last six years i pay my rent my car bill my insurance and all my expenses they pay for my phone i work sometimes incredibly long hours i have worked emt construction food service all manly jobs but to them im just too snowflakey simply because of  i dont even know i am super nice and helpful and even entertaining to all of their friends and all of our family i hid an absolutely nasty drug addiction from them for years  i didnt tell them until i had been clean for almost two years i feel loved but i just think they have absolutely no confidence in what they are doing in life i do not regain myself back from a single interaction with them
i used to be bullied a lot in high school because of how i looked and people would take pictures of me making me feel like shit now im a lot more confident in myself and look a lot better than i did before but everytime someone wants to take a picture or video with me in it i get really bad anxiety how do i overcome this
am i overthinking this yesterday i went to a used bookstore that i always go to i had to shit like i had to shit really bad i go into the bathroom and i hear some really weird noises coming out of the toilet i think okay kind of weird but i gotta shit so i take a shit at first it wont go down but then eventually it does all thats left is the toilet paper so i flush again and then wash my hands and leave     i go to browse the books and come back to that section 20 minutes later i see towels spread everywhere around the toilet and now im feeling so awful and so bad about myself like even though they were having serious plumbing problems i still feel like i caused it     i buy my books and my interaction with the owner is normal enough i dont think he suspects me    i really would love to go back there since i love the store but i dont know when i can show my face again a friend of mine said that he would call the store and say that he caused the problem so thats nice at least    am i overthinking this is this really my fault or were they bound to have a overflow problem eventually
  hahaha poop  you used the device for its intended purpose and it failed you are over thinking if you think anything more
  well my friend called the bookstore and took the blame for it what a true friend at least i can show my face there again
im going to come across like a total cunt here and nobody can actually answer it but i just have to say it somewhere     i have had a few gfs over the years oldfag and they have all fell at my feet and told me they loved me really quick multiple times their friends have told me that the girl worships the ground i walk on i have lots of friends too like when i think of how many other friends people have i know i seem to have more people wanting to do stuff with me    even when i am out in public random people talk to me male and female old and young people ive been with are like why the fuck does everyone keep speaking to you    the thing is i think i am not really a nice person or anything and i suffer with depression i really dont get it at all i know its a stupid thread but atleast i have got it off my chest
weird flex but ok
some people just have that magnetism my best friend had it but unfortunatly it doesnt mean you wont have other problems
  low selfesteem and depression    i have the same thing i have people falling over telling me theyre in love with me that im incredibly attractive that im nice interesting etc i have a big group of friends and people do seem to really like me    despite all of this i continue to believe im a worthless human being that is lower than everyone else i sometimes feel like its all a big joke    other than your depression which obviously affects your view of yourself how was your childhood cliche question but im asking because i myself was an awkward loser with no friends so maybe thats why i find it all pretty unbelievable
  definitely i just wish i knew what it was
  my childhood was fine even in school i was friends with everyone i remember some nerd kid for want if a better term but you get it proclaiming that i was the most popular kid because all the popular kids didnt actually interact with everyone whereas i was freinds with literally everyone
  you probably have high approachability you can try to conceal it by being a grumpass but youll still have no bite    i dont know what to say about those women who just pick a guy out of a deck and then attempt often successfully to fall in love with him usually theyre hoes or daddys girls transitioning into hoedom and their favrotie part of daddy was the emotional comfort and safety he maybe scarcely offered      also this
  also friendsand girlfriends who are actually coolwho love you quickly might just be nice people with open hearts theres no point pondering it from a selfcentered standpoint maybe take an interest in them and why they are openhearted
  you probably deserve being loved anon think of all the people who are depressed and have no friends and enjoy your popularity
theres not really an answer but just to say that human character is infinitely complicated something also worth noting have you ever looked someone in the eyes and felt complete understanding/ attraction/ instant bonding without even saying anything what is that two souls coalesce and feel at ease     people must feel that when they connect with you and thats a great thing embrace it
  checked     no these girls were all pretty regular and normal    i know its a weird flex but theres nothing to gain here but its just something that bugs me i almost feel like its not me that they like hence probably why i end up on 4chan i actually feel i fit in here
  i do feel for them people and have friends who im really their only friend that makes me feel better
i feel stupid for making this thread now and its really not a boast just let it die now
  i think regular and normal society is kind of hoeish and makes girls spring themselves at men love and romance kind of make the ordeal worth it    why do you think they didnt like you for you my exes all gave specific complements and i could tell the ones they were sincere about they didnt do this with you whyd you break up
  nah just chill were only joking
  iits okay anon let me just stay here and pretend i am you
  id break up with them just cause i didnt really feel it anymore never really went bad never got particular compliments or anything apart from the obvious that they found me attractive
    weird boast but alas
  im sorry if it makes you feel any better im not happy or anything
  just left because i didnt feel it anymore  hmm this is very far from me so i cant relate maybe a psychologist would know more    they never complemented me specifically just said i was attractive  huhthats weirdare you sure youre remembering correctly
  how old are you maybe boomers dont compliment each other under any circumstance
oh shit its the protagonist
fuck off bitch some people have real problems you moron
  whats that
  just as i suspected a crying white cat
  i know that and im sorry i have had problems in my life too
hey /adv/    im debating on cutting this person off for good  theres just been so many instances this year where theyve been so inconsiderate if i wasnt into them id be a lot more mad    what should i do
you could try telling them how you feel tell them that you like them and if they care they will treat you differently   or if they already know how you feel you should try setting boundaries so that they know what is and isnt okay give yourself some space even if you like them
  sounds like your problem is all in your head and you know that so you dont want to present the details for scrutiny you have to love yourself before you can love others so do that
  you sound like someone who is distressed behind the scenes cries while their oblivious bf/gf has no idea because you dont speak to them openly and just like right now you go to random people you either hardly know or not at all instead of irl friends or your partner you immaturely cant speak to in fear of them seeing you different get a hold of yourself and be honest with yourself before making a rash or sudden move which you stubbornly feel like is the only solution
  i have anon ill give you an example  we went to a wedding i booked the day off to go with her because she didnt want to feel awkward going by herself she constantly complained the whole time she asked abot my trip this summer and just kept interrupting mewhich i called her out for then near the end she disappeared for an hour then said sorry for abandoning you here and then had the audacity to ask if i was mad which i said i was because not only did i miss a days pay i was left by myself for an hour she only came back because the dance floor was closing which meant the wedding was over i told her why i was that mad then didnt talk to her for the rest of the weekend then things went back to normal but its shit like that     i didnt go into detail because its long but if you want em to tell the story i will i have no issue
  this is a board specifically for long posts if someone doesnt like it ridicule them for their elementary school reading level but what kind of putz misses a days pay to take his girl to a wedding and rather than dancing with her sits and pouts
  i have talked to real friends and i have been open with said person thats why im getting to this point my go to friend told me im in emotional relationship with this person so i should either ask them out or forget about it but im at the point of forget about it because they continuously do very inconsiderate things and when i address it they literally cry for forgiveness and then something similar weeks later im just on the chans   a to vent  b to see if im over reacting  c seeking advice for the situation and myself    i know i can overreact im a male with a female dominated personality typeenfp as well as being raised by women for the most part    im not here to be right or to necessarily have people agree with me i want to get advice from someone who is neutral       were not a couple we just to couple things  she killed my mood i wanted to dance and she was like no thanks but later changed her mind but i wasnt feeling the music and was pretty much drained from her bitching about work and interrupting me when shes the one who wanted to hear the storyi went on a trip abroad
  why would you forgo a days pay for the sake of someone who isnt your girlfriend i dont think youre being honest with yourself you want to ask her out but youre too pussy so are trying to seek a way out of it either shit or get off the pot already until then you have no right to complain
  thanks anon  i was going to ask her out that night but after all that happened i was like forget it i should probably stick to the forget it right     my rl friend said if you got that mad and youre not even together you either should ask her out or just stop talking to her cuz youre only hurting yourself
  no i wont even afford you that you pussy for all we know she deeply cares about you and youre hurting her by being so moody and distant ask her out and let your relationship degrade naturally
  i am neutral the thing is all of the posts on /adv/ are biased debased and one sided so the only answers youll get is either you fucked up or we side with your story for lack of detailed narrative that grants the other persons input being that it is nearly impossible for that reason since you spoke to them constantly and are not in a relationship with them then why bother this person aint your gf and she has brought up red flags to avoid in the first place to be honest
  no i wont even afford you that you pussy   that doesnt make any sense but sure      thanks anon the other anon made me think i was just being a pussyi kind of am being one but you nailed it on the head with  his person aint your gf and she has brought up red flags to avoid    i saw some red flags but wanted to wait it out to see if it was a constant and it was is  can i deal with it to an extent  do i want to deal with it not really i think knowing them for so long clouded my quick nope response and made me ponder if it could work/ should i try to make it work  another example is our birthdays are a week apart and guess who talked to me the day of but forgot my birthday and is crying about messing up i didnt reply because after the wedding i dont see myself getting angry i was expecting the worst  but this goes back to my original question should i cut this person off   were going to this thing tomorrowour group of friends and my work christmas partylast event which is next week
  look i get it emotions run rampant and really screw with our judgment if she meant something to you have a foundation to base off of and are in a relationship id say otherwise to try but if its a friend or someone you are not with in some kind of relationship then i would say keep em at arms length if you want them around at least or cut them off entirely and just do yourself a favor and find new people to socialize with
  if she was so manifestly destructive to you and you harbored no feelings at all towards her you would have broken it off already and wouldnt have needed to consult us jackoffs before you did but since you obviously do care about her in some warped way you might as well fuck her a few times before you give her and her shit friends the old too da loo
think im having a mental breakdown to make it very short im doing a lot of things i know i shouldnt be doing drinking/smoking daily not finishing assignments failing because im lost depressed lazy and unmotivated in my life doesnt help that i cant afford to pay for this shit and ive wasted money because i ruinend my grades when the semester ends im going directly to the doctor to try and sort out my issues    basically i have about a week and a half until i can get out of here for break how do i get through this shit without losing my mind i dont want to just lay in the bed all day but theres nothing else i want to do
hey guys my psychologist wants me to see a psychiatrist because she believes i have depression im a pretty joyful guy but i definitely do get thoughts of suicide every now and then maybe i dont really notice it but im pretty sure its at least once a day recently i went through a very heartbreaking break up and it sent me into a very bad state she recommended that id try st johns wort first because i told her i wasnt too sure about taking antidepressants has anyone tried this what are your thoughts on good anti depressants
  my psychologist wants me to see a psychiatrist  jewish nepotism never ends
  i used to take an ssri antidepressants for over a year i quit and then had some crazy withdrawal symptoms where i would feel electric buzzing and shocks happening in my brain that persisted for months afterwards i literally couldnt drink any caffeine for several months because it would intensify the electric buzzing and electric shocks there are many reasons to avoid antidepressants i dont take them and will not take them but i still get depressed  i take onnits good mood and it helps me but anything with similar ingredients would likely be good
  i think that you know better if you have depression than she does if you dont think you have depression then you shouldnt go
hey guys guy here i want to ask a clarifying question about my gf im really troubled cuz i havent found her g spot yet we have tried oral fingering and sex but in vain she has tried to find her sweet spot herself but to no avail is it possible that she doesnt have one im desperate please help
  are you the first person she had sex with she might be frigid
  op here no im not her first she can cum by her clitoris but not vaginally and she wants to experience that so bad dude
is it possible that she doesnt have one  kinda the g spot is really just stimulating the internal portion of the clitoris so that might just be difficult for her no biggie
its really hard for most women to cum just vaginally but try angling upwards  theres like a roughish patch inside towards the top hard to explain sorry
a lot of women just cant cum from penetration man just how each dick is shaped differently inside each puss is different just the part of the clitoris thats inside the vagina may not be able to be stimulated in full
      op again thanks for answering guys i will try angling upwards and i hope it will work im head over heels for her and i want to make her feel good
you can stimulate it easily in doggy to be honest its nice but its not really mindblowing on its own if thats what youre thinking about i have to be worked up but then it feels nice depending on your length try doggy with short fast strokes actually doggy is your best bet if youre small as well its a few inches in play with her clit at the same time go deeper when shes close and blow her mind
  keep in mind that everybody also has different sensitivities just like sometimes nipples are sensitive and sometimes theyre not gspot sensitivity is going to vary you might not be able to find it because it might not really feel all that different to her    by all means keep trying and looking but its also normal if its not sensitive
  my length is satisfying according to her so i will try that too thanks bro
  oh i hadnt thought it that way useful to know and i hope she will calm down too cuz shes too frustrated and she thinks theres sth wrong with her/
  yeah absolutely not what works for everyone wont necessarily work for her and what works for her wont necessarily work for anyone else bodies and sensitivities and preferences are very different and the range of normal is huge so theres nothing wrong with her at all if thats not her thing its just not her thing and have fun finding what does work
whats happening with me and what i can to do to fix myself  be me  feel always tired  lost interest into almost everything  most of the time the only emotions that i feel are sadness or anger   most of the time im barely capable to find words to talk   not capable to start a conversation or join into one   usually i feel pissed off by everything   sometimes people can barely talk with me if they do i talk with them with no interest and just act like i listen to them and approve them so they can stop  always cold to almost everyone  treat everything with indifference    seems like that going to gymhaving a girlfriend or hanging out a lot doesnt helpi dont know what else i can do
i was like this but worse went to the doctor and they put me on citaplofaram idk how to spell lol and it really helped its depression my dude
  life in 2018 is cold and lonely  the only solution is jesus
talk to your doc op seek a pro of you can or look up online therapy if you check ncbi studies show online therapy is typically as effective as in person do whatever works for you      was it citalopram if so i was on that too helped me get back on track but fucked with my libido and i felt nothing happy or sad but it helped even this out briefly      why are you posting this in each thread i think youll honestly make more people think less of religion with the awkward images youve made
  citaplofaram np got itill try to talk with my doctor about this     everything is just fucked up in 2018even the christian churchim trying to keep my faith but im losing it when i see how incompetent and stupid can be the church and fellow christiansi guess ill give it another try to get more to christianity
  citalopram oops
its called depression    no joke
ive been on a couple dates with this girl but they were both short and though weve been talking awhile i still dont feel were that close    i want to ask her on another date but have no idea where to go she doesnt seem that interested in doing much as she turn down several ideas previously     what do i do to get more comfortable with her i want to just ask her over because i dont want to go on another date that much either but i dont know what wed do here either neither of us like movies what other things would there be to do    anyone have experience dating an extreme introvert
  i did it too dated a girl who claimed to leave the house for leisure once a month super shy as well every time we went out i left feeling bored and like it was the worst date ever and then shed message me saying she had fun     eventually i figured that it wasnt happening for me and i stopped seeing her even when we kissed i felt nothing     sometimes personalities are just not compatible for one or both of you and theres nothing you can do to change that
  while im not positive we will work out i dont think were incompatible i enjoy talking to her and havent felt the dates with her went poorly we had plenty to talk about and there wasnt much lull they just didnt seem to do the job of bringing us closer im also introverted and dont like going out much at all and for the most part the other relationships ive had have driven me insane in a short time do to needing so much attention which is why im hoping this does work out but sense neither of us particularly like going out i dont know how to get the relationship started
    how did you guys find them  i dislike extroverts but i cant find anything else
  a long ass time of sifting through party girls on dating apps in three years of pretty regular use ive talked to about 2 girls i was actually interested in
    goddamit im never going to find a decent one
  yeah it sucks i dont know where to find them since theyre not going to be to approachable when theyre out and theyre not likely to be out much youd think theyd be all of dating sites yet those sites still seem to be full of moderate to extroverted girls maybe there just arent that many of them in my experience there tends to be a decent amount of them hanging around okcupid but there message system sucks so its hard to get a response from people on there
  yeah my girlfriend is an extreme introvert here is my advice if you have already dated her and you saw no spark why are you trying again just drop it
  thats not the problem though i do like talking to her and all that see     i just dont know what to do with her since there doesnt seem to be anything in the area either of us want to do and im worried we havent warmed up to each other enough to ask her over dont see how not being too comfortable with someone after two short dates means theres no spark
what do both of you do normally in your free time maybe you could do one of those things
  do people do stuff in their free time that could be done with someone else we have a few things in common like somewhat similar taste in music and reading a bunch and some other things but those arent exactly group activities as ive said were both quite introverted maybe that means this cant work or maybe thats the only kind of girl i could actually get along with i dont know
cook together
how can i determine if my jbl speaker is real need help cos someone told me it was fake pic related anyone know how to know if its fake
so a month ago i go to a friends house to build her computer we went the night before to buy the parts after i finish building the computer we head upstairs to her room so i can place the computer under her desk we forget the power cable so she leaves me in the room while she goes to grab it while in the room i just look at her various posters and look at my phone and after some time has passed she comes back up and we get everything set up she drives me home and i thought that was the end of that a week later she accuses me of looking through her underwear/lingerie drawer and due to this i am just so deeply hurt i just thought she knew me better because shes literally one of the first people i ever talked to about my problems and i think of her as a sister how do i prove to her that i didnt look through her drawers
why dont you ask her why she thinks you looked through her drawers the accusation didnt just come from nowhere
you cant prove things like this if she doesnt trust you then maybe you could ask her why but 9/10 deny and i guess this friendship is over
finaly lost my virginity to someone who i recently found out was crushing on my for like 5 years she said she had real feelings for me and was exicited when i too a step towards us being together but after we had sex a couple times she just went cold she opened what i thought was her heart and told me things about herself and i thought we were getting close she said she always wanted to date me she just ignores me now how am i supposed to deal with this     i hover around a 4/106/10 depending on my depression cycles and shes easily a consistent 78 to me maybe less to others since she has some masculine features but whatever i let someone into my heart and she fucked it up why would she lie like that would i be wrong to close up shop and get over women  i dont know how to handle this
sometimes its hard to be honest and you know this because you are the same you also know that it can be painful or difficult to own up to past mistakes and lies due to pride and other negative emotions dont assume that others are above your own flaws
  but how could she just all of a sudden go from caring texts and almost codependency to just nothing is this just how women are
  sometimes and not just women people have been through shit you dont know the depths of and it shapes them try to forgive and move on pal
how do i just move on the feelings are still there for me and i cant get her out of my head
short version faith faith in the future that it holds nice things for you faith that time will heal your pain
oh man i really hope i dont go through this
  thats a hard one for me lol i lost that many years ago thanks for the advice tho
  its the worst man she was so cute and cuddly forever thinking back on it i should have picked up on it sooner i really just want to not exist
you assume too much of yourself you build yourself into a cage of i am this i lost that i cant and such faith isnt an object you lose it comes and goes if you let it if you dont let it fine thats on you but if you let it it will come just like the sun after stormy rains    i can say this with confidence because we arent different when we strip down our egos
  personal events in the past ruined faith as a concept for me i can accept that life just kinda happens i cannot however just blindly  believe that everything will work out fine im just here for the ride right now and the only thing that made life worth it for a little while is gone
  sad to hear that something happened that made you look at life that way if you need to feel better about it then look at people who have had it much worse than you and gotten through it just fine
  thats a nice thought but still maybe i have a problem with being cynical but its better than looking forward to brightness that will never come
  i hope the light will shine on you and when it does you see it and smile again
  it makes total sense to close yourself off from that level of attachment until youve had time to heal dont disconnect yourself from women in general though having good female friends and maybe a crush or a fling here or there will help just dont give your heart away for a while even if it seems like a good deal
  i dont think i can have sex without attachment just not that type of guy i dont know how to trust women anymore man i let one person in and she just tears everything up how do i know someone else wont just sneak in and do the same
    you must find the balance of being able to give and receive love yet wary vigilant cautious in waiting for someone who proves to you that they deserve all that you have to offer most importantly you must come to accept yourself with all of positives and negatives which you possess none of this will be instantaneous so take it day by day knowing that these feats are attainable achievable
  but i dont know that they are attainable theres no proof that the it is or that i even should be alive i sure as hell dont want to be how do i accept me as myself when i just dont want to be here
  zasto imas nikolu u imenu ahhahaha debil iz cg
    you must experience the darkness in order to appreciate the light just like with this female you will find a new source of light the difference being that this will be selfgenerated instead of from an external catalyst then youll be able to find another who will inspire for your light to shine brighter than it would alone        its the name of a basketball player i enjoy watching    je to jméno basketbalisty kterého se dívám
i have severe social anxiety and i dont know what to do about it i am not able to approach people who i find interesting i am not able to attend parties or other social events unless i know the people really well     usually my mind just goes blank i cannot really think straight anymore and end up trying to escape any situation like this     i even got therapy for this in the past but it didnt really help since from the outside i have a functional life i do have some friends i have a good career etc i think he kind of didnt understand my problems    anyway i think what might help me is seeing how other people behave at parties eg is it a normal thing to maybe be standing around for a couple of minutes without talking to anyone is it okay to say something embarassing to a person you just started talking with how do other people deal with this    i would die to see some sort of hidden camera footage of a guy at a party just having a good time maybe that would help me overcome my anxiety cause when i am at a party i am not able to analyze anything that is going on because my mind blacks out
hide cameras all around your house and throw a party youll have plenty of footage to look through
i feel like my thirst is preventing me from getting girls     my last relationship was a year ago and ive been single every since ive only ever had luck with sheltered/weird girls being a weirdo myself but its never been this bad porn isnt even doing it for me anymore i really crave love and affection from a girl or at least a ons but despite working out eating right mewing and spending too much time on dating apps ive found nothing    i live in a sleepy suburb where there arent a whole lot of girls my age going to meet girls irl means pretending i still go to the community college and chatting with girls there hitting up the mall or nearby starbucks and hoping whoever im hitting on is ofage or going all the way out to the city and make an expensive day/night of it    i only have two irl friends a lesbian and a hermit so neither are a help     i think im a 5 or 6 out of 10 not super impressive but not bad either yet girls just arent into me im afraid my horniness and general social awkwardness just negatively impacts my interactions with girls so im starting to avoid them now i even hate meeting girls online because i know i wont be able to help wanting them sexually if i find out theyre cute    should i just get it out of my system with hookers strippers should i just accept being alone for a couple more years until my selfimprovement efforts bear significant fruit im getting kind of loopy here
   going to meet girls irl means pretending i still go to the community college and chatting with girls there hitting up the mall or nearby starbucks and hoping whoever im hitting on is ofage or going all the way out to the city and make an expensive day/night of it  do you actually do this would be pretty cool if you did     i think im a 5 or 6 out of 10  for girls looks are still important but less so than for guys though i would say that if you work out eat right have a decent haircut good hygiene and nice clothes you should be able to look pretty good unless you have an ugly as fuck face or something     im afraid my horniness and general social awkwardness just negatively impacts my interactions with girls so im starting to avoid them now  worst thing you can do keep asking girls out and keep going on dates you should get less awkward in the process try having your neediness as a source of enthusiasm and motivation instead of as a source of resentment and desperation you know what you want work at it     i even hate meeting girls online because i know i wont be able to help wanting them sexually if i find out theyre cute  theres nothing wrong with having those feelings    you should reflect on why girls arent into you if its just your social awkwardness then just keep practicing one thing you can also try is to write down how dates went including every detail you can remember and you will probably automatically spot things you can work on
    i do try and go out irl havent done that first one but have been considering it just didnt want to become that weirdo who flirts with girls on campus all day    thanks for the words anon it felt like my post implied i was spazzing out at girls and saying stuff like you have nice boobs or sending dick pics i definitely dont do that i just get nervous and fumble my words or say things things off the top of my head that sounded okay but could be awkward or insulting in other contexts
  stop harassing random women you disgusting incel creep
    ive had four partners not an incel i only go out to places where it would be normal/expected to be hit on i never hit on girls in the gym for example and i never usually say anything more than hey im sorry but i think youre really pretty and wanted to come talk to you     if youre not suppoesed to talk to women how do you gets dates just expect women to flock to you thats the elliot rodger strategy and it didnt work out so well for him
how much fat is too fat can you be fat and still be attractive/okay/not vomit causing how fat is too fat to fuck love date how fat is just normal how fat makes you hate/feel disgusted/sick and i dont mean anything morbidly obese     ive gained a little weight and im trying decide if its no big deal or if i shouldnt go in public because im disgusting im not trying to be attractive to anyone just normal
  30 is a no go for me i would not like to be that size and would feel unhappy with my looks and physically unfit even right after having my babies ive never been that big
  30 is the limit 1525 is the ideal depends on the person and how the proportions work out but 30 is definitely the upper limit no higher
  id say 35 is the max 15 the min for me at least there are people who are more flexible of course
3015 are attractive 35 is tolerable 10 would be ok if i were completely jacked  these numbers are likely not accurate im just using them as labels for the pictures
  your not disgusting at any size just not as healthy as you should want youself to be dont put yourself down or have a pitty party just start working out and watching what you eat losing that extra weight will make you feel good about youself and that you can accomplish goals you set people who stay in good shape have longer healthier lives and can stay active and do more fun things a lot longer into old age
women with better waisthip ratio can get away with higher body fat
35 is probably the max for me seeing attraction but i mean if you wear the weight and look cute its nbd especially if youre older then people look more for companionship so if youre a cute chubby chick vs a hot skinny chick you can still get dick   just keep in mind being fat is associated with being stupid gluttonous and selfish even if you arent those traits also its holiday season so everyones a little heavier now  also final note if you embrace yourself and dont worry about it then other people wont bother you dont act insecure act self aware and its less annoying like dont be  boohoo im fat  say yeah im a little heavier but so what i know my problems
  obesity is disgusting though on a biological level were predisposed to avoid it culture lies downstream from this
  yes i know but calling yourself disgusting because you gained a little extra weight isnt a good mindset to get into and will be counterproductive to getting back into shape they didnt say they were obese just that they gained a little weight
  for me its too much at 30 when you really see the folds    tfw 27 bodyfat male  i guess i shouldnt be talking
  different guys have different preferences i prefer anything from 2035 based on those pictures doesnt mean i would immediately turn down a girl who didnt fit exactly into my preferences especially if they have a cute face
  its not that i want to be sexually attractive to any guy i have a boyfriend who loves me and my body and probably would at any size unless i was seriously unhealthy too big or too small i more have the concern of just the general publics opinion i dont want strangers to think im sexy or beautiful or anything like that i just want to be average i dont want to stand out in a good way or a bad way so i dont want to generally be seen as gross because ive gained a bit of weight
  what do you look like now whitch picture from your op is you and where were you at before
  im 51 my highest weight in high school was 200lbs   i went down to 160 for a few years   starved myself to 120   and i now havent weighed myself in a year but i think ive gained a bit i probably look like uhhhh 35 i definitely have body fat but a small frame so i dunno
  im the same height as you but only like 115 lbs and my biggest i wouldnt try to get back to 120 if you have to starve yourself for it like 140 or 150 would be a good weight to shoot for if you try to eat well like cut out fast food and soda it can help a lot also just stay active which can be hard in the winter when their isnt as much to do outside but its still worth it i hope you get to a weight your comfortable at and feel your best 
  i dont think im over 140 i cant weigh myself but just simply looking back at old weightloss photos from the different weights i dont think im at 140 yet so probably 130 or so some friend said i look like i lost weight i dunno
  fat and obesity is rather disgusting and unhealthy after that person surpass 30 they really need to start looking healthier it goes the same for men too if i ever let myself go like that im opting out of this raw deal
  say yeah im a little heavier but so what i know my problems  thats fine and all but an actual fatty dont even acknowledge the problem they skip that step and think their body positivity is just as on par as a skinny person and the problem lie with people criticizing them you have to skrt your way from even mentioning the problem is them being fat and they need to purge their stomachs for seven days to look like kate moss
  oh no man i hate that shit i know im probably anywhere from 20 to 40 lbs over the perfect mark but personally to me losing the weight isnt worth it as im not hideous my health is fine my boyfriend likes me etc i do get thoughts as i had a pretty bad eating disorder before but i hate that fat pride shit
  that anon meant actual obese fucktards nigga a skinny women eating a cupcake and she saying ive gained a little weight thats fine because it wont fuck them up as they are already health conscious a fatty eating a wedding cake and saying ive gained a little weight is a problem because they arent going to do anything about it  not try to diminish the weight burn off fat nothing they figure since they are already fat they may as well stay complacet to being fat disgusting
  women prefer men with 1216 body fat according to a post my brother saw on reddit that linked to a study its probably true given how women rate like 80 of men on okcupid below average  i am going to eat nothing but 2 eggs per day and starve myself thin starting tomorrow  men prefer any woman who will fuck them i like 2535 for a soft fluffy tummy
i think 35 would be my limit but i dont find 22 and below attractive at all i am a bi woman and i dont find really fit women/men attractive i would take a 40 before a 12 but id try to get them to eat better or do exercise if they were unhealthy
  i would say 325 would be the fattest id go
  im 510 male and 125 pounds you can afford to lose more weight trust me
  for women around 30 is not attractive the pic you posted is using women with perfect proportions most women at 35 will look much worse than that
  soft girls give the best hugs  youre probably fine
  personally im good with girls up to 40
friend and i were talking i wanted to tell him that i was planning on buying a pistol and one bullet as a joke but he took it way to serious that he didnt respond for like 10 minutes he then got really mad at me and told me he hates jokes like that why am i making fun of it and if i think thats funny then we cant be friends  he then logged off ive sent him messages telling him im sorry for the joke and i didnt know this affected him  me and my old friends would always joke like this even when one of us did have someone who took their life  i didnt mean to make him angry or anything i just meant it as a joke  he hasnt responded and i doubt hes going to  am i in the wrong here  how was i supposed to know we always joke to a similar caliber so why didnt he say anything before this
if youve done it before and hes been fine then i dont think youve done anything wrong it sounds something personal on his end maybe give him some time to cool off and see if hes okay
  no hes kinda a new friend so he wasnt part of my old group of friends  but he makes always makes jokes of how people should kill jews and black but he tells me their jokes so i thought he wouldnt be offended by this joke

i am now curious because of the whole southwest abcde thing i want to know what are the worst names yall have ever heard/met please dont list of names from some babies names website
  i had one of the toughest looking motherfuckers in my graduating class named precious valentine guess with a name like that you would have to either be a trap or a tough dude
boy youll love the philippines then   jhon   bhoy   bagong gahasa newly raped   kulangot booger   jabar armpit sweat    and some others i cant remember but theres a whole treasure trove of them
  every time i run into a mark john david etc i cringe biblical names are the worst
  some of the most common names out here are cringy  tips
  except jesus i need more jesuses in my life
i have had an aa ah dash ah in my class before i felt soo bad for the girl because the teacher thought there was an error in the roll call sheet
  me fucking this hot chick  damn i forgot her name whats her name  aaaah aaaah fuck me harder anon aaaah  oh thats right now i remember
    john and mark are ok david adam noah jacob ezekiel isaac and lucas are all terrible names though islamic names are all garbage too    it sucks that in europe most people are giving their kids the english versions of biblical names in other countries they still retain their languages version of biblical names or using names theyve being using for centuries
  i should also mention that plenty of european names suck too like pretty much every irish name
  nowadays john seems abstract the original hebrew meaning is gift from god or some such
im just gonna think of ridiculous names and people    thaddeus turgid self made millionaire industrialist who makes hookers roleplay as his emotionally abusive mother
  islamic names are bad  hebrew names are awesome  literally the same thing just add abdul mohammed and fatima
my nephews name is weedy middle name fire because my sister and her boyfriend like smoking weed
  if i remember correctly the names jeremy and kevin are in france and germany names that will instantly give you the fag status is that anywhere else too
its really just unfortunate but i knew a black kid with the last name slaver
i hate bastardised special snowflake spellings of normal names my mother knows of a girl named kymburlie and i used to work with a girl who named her daughter skylahjayd    also navaeh is fucking awful
  gives a meh vibe tier  justus  jeremy   jerome    weird tier   neo  harold just weird to hear it on a kid   dante   champion    shittier  lloyd   anything with junior  arch
18 and failing semester took college classes in 12th grade and failed some too due to just getting depressed about it i hate school work and have a creative passion that im working on if the creative passion gets kickstarted and patreonage ill be alright otherwise i dont think college is for me yet it seems im fucked without it ive been applying to stores near my house so i can bike since my parents need the other 2 cars i guess i can uber actually    i wouldnt mind a simple shitty job thats boring as long as i can use my phone and screw around a bit like highschool should i just get over myself and carry on with uni i fear ill get depressed again i literally have missed midterms and big tests and felt little to nothing in terms of regret   ive been programming since a kid and have a portfolio anything i can do with that without a degree  what do i feel like i should just kms cuz im not fit for life outside of the creative world
  i hate school work  theres your answer drop out     if you saw something through then youd be super motivated in university like just for example you really badly wanted to be a doctor then college wouldnt feel like a chore it would be a fun adventure to achieving your dreams
  right my parents mainly see the end as me getting a high paying cs job so they can have more money but id honestly be happy wageslaving then coming home to be creative or just do whatever i find fun in the long run i want to have my own little company thing but thats what savings are for  im not just a lazy fuck right its not crazy to want to skip out on this opportunity of college
  bump
  but what about if i try hard and i still failing some subjects but getting give scores in other subjects
how do i say this  i became proto friends with a very small time pornish indie movie creator who just so happens to be more than twice my age hes 45 we occasionally spoke via emails for about a year mostly me sending encouraging messages before he supposedly took his website down turned out it was just under maintenance but in a panic i emailed him and he just so happened to have a discord i sent him a friend request and the month of september was filled with neat conversation real early on in the month he began to start conversations and ask for advice    all was well but then college work started beating my ass and i spent about three weeks unable to talk to friends on discord now in the middle of october i made the mistake of basically saying hey maybe one day i can go from being a fan to a friend and he was like youre on a good path and ever since i feel im straying off that path now once every two weeks or so all i end up doing is wishing him luck with his struggles that he hints at  some questions   1 how do i start conversations that dont involve his work   2 should i ease him into who i am dark/offensive humor and the like or straight up dunk him in   3 are my anxieties involving starting conversations with friends who i havent talked to in a minute retarded how do i get over this   4 any tips for becoming a friend over texts and distance   5 any tips for becoming friends with people older than me   6 my shortterm goal longterm goal is befriending him is to get him to call or accept a call i havent rang his discord yet cuz im not an ass but ive been considering ending the night with a chat with him accidently ringing him the next day hanging up quickly and saying i meant to ring my other friend how bad of an idea is this   theres more about him that makes the situation even weirder but ill elaborate in another post
wtf are you even trying to achieve i dont understand the point of this post at all
  how fucking socially inept can you be holy shit
hello /adv/  so the background is almost the same in every case but ill try build a brief piece of my life here   been sad since 2012 for various reasons family issues poverty realise i dont fave any talent social phobia   never had a relationship because i consider more problems to handle    ive created a bubble as a coping mechanism to deal with ordinary frustrations of life its like a automatic pilot  cliche point bubble poped   while in uni a girl passing in a similar situation bind with me and too much coincidences between our lifes shows up she lives in other city   ldr begins   she drop out and enters in a better uni in a far away city one of those american pie vibe   we reach deep levels of intimacy   while talking about sex she mention her ex they dated about 2 years   she says things like 2 years fucking inumerous positions new sensation tested swallow cum   im not gonna lie got little bit shocked   keeping treating her in the best way possible but im avoiding contact     im a virgin shy guy just have some kisses in life and actually dont care about all these labels it doesnt matter to me thus i believe its not about having a pussyscore but have feelings    now im not mad at her and never could express how much impact she caused it in my life in a brief greentext    i can easily fuck a hooker or find some girls too but its not that meaninful did you get it    today she invites me to see a show this weekend im not gonna make it gone sexual at the end feeling very confused yet what to do
oh my god not this thread again
  dating you sounds like a drag fingers crossed she dumps you and finds someone more stable and with an eager dick
    t triggered roastie
  any relationship of mine last than some months at the end ghost them wish her the best of luck
wake up in middle of night  need to pee  dont want to get up  too cold and too lazy  notice water bottle is empty  piss in it and close it until morning    its only downhill from here isnt it
two years ago 16 f i decided to get over my horrible social anxiety i was a sheltered kid who couldnt talk to waiters look people in the eye and hunched     i forced myself to be more social talk to more people join more clubs and go out of my way to talk extra with staff at the shops i thought i was over my social anxiety    i was stuck in an intense studying phase for 2 years yea im asian and today when i went out to a convention i realised the improvement was faked and undone i made no progress also alot of stuff dawned on me that people might have hated me for being weird and awkward what the heck do i do now
  what the heck do i do now  go back to studying lol    but yeah i dont know as a guy with severe social anxiety i also tried to get out and socialise more but it never changed things i never learned to enjoy being around other people all i can say is they probably didnt hate you at all even if you were a bit weird people are more tolerant of that than 4chan would let you believe
  im a an introvert though not really socially anxious or anything i had a depressed phase where i stopped socialising and i discovered the same thibgg as you when i got back into it     being social is a perishable skill it doesnt mean your self improvement was fake or impossible to sustain it just means you need to get back into the habit
do people really fall for the cbt meme these days
  what makes it a meme
  1the belief you can hack into deeply ingrained neurological reactions after 6 months of behavioral modification  2 the logic is retarded we dont work from the outside in any change achieved that way is short lived and dishonest your self knows that
  ive never had a therapist before and what makes it a meme       i kind of envy you i am an extrovert and almost went crazy went i had to sit at home for one whole month to study i agree that being social is a skillset but why does it completely vanish for me when i dont use it     for example a skill like drawing would become worse when not practised but not completely gone but thats not the case for social skills         same my dude i wont stop going out but dont you feel like sometimes there is zero improvement i fucking hate playing socialskills catchup with everyone
try getting a job like at a grocery storeit helped me
  two years ago  hehe whoops man reporting your report is against the rules though      i wont stop going out but dont you feel like sometimes there is zero improvement i fucking hate playing socialskills catchup with everyone  i pretty much always feel like theres zero improvement i have become somewhat better at faking it when i have the energy but im no closer to enjoying socialising on any level it must suck if youre a heavy extrovert though
  reporting your report is against the rules though    who said i reported anything i just posted a pic your get that if you werent an angsty socially awkward underage autist
  i date a girl like you like 10 years ago  she was nice and fun to be with until she met new people then she shut like clam  i managed to date her because we knew each other for a while when we were together shed latch onto me like a buoy in the ocean     basically you never had anxiety you were just shy and now that youre not used to being social youre shy again it was never anxiety and still isnt    its hard to talk to strangers we all know this everyone feels thing  but go on and try go make mistakes get messy do kids still watch magic school bus
  today when i went out to a convention i realised the improvement was faked and undon  what makes you think that
  alright yep im trying to find a job that requires social interaction such as a sales position or in service industry to train myself in this aspect      i have become somewhat better at faking it when i have the energy but im no closer to enjoying socialising on any level  you hit the nail on the head do you enjoy small talk in interactions ive always felt they are real tense for me      oh man i wish i was shy but i do have social anxiety i used to be so afraid that i would start sweating like crazy out in the public and my heart would race really fast
how can i stop thinking everyone dislikes me and when they actually choose to interact with me only do so out of pity
make people depend on you
  be sure to tell me when you find out
  came here to post this  then i realised they almost never initiate interaction
  but then they would just be interacting with me because they have to
  bump for advice
gain self esteem and learn to like yourself you are essentially just projecting how you judge yourself on to others
  learn  you cant learn something like that
  wheres the selfesteem store  can i order it online
  you do has a lot to do with mental development and introspection
  mental development and introspection  what exactly do you mean by that care to elaborate
  in relation to ops problem you should be aware that people usually project their own believes about themselves on to others when they try to assess what they might be thinking about them in the end you dont know what others are really thinking and you should remain aware of the fact you are just interpreting something through your own possibly warped lense its safe to say that the worse you treat and judge yourself the more likely you are to assume that others dont like you in situations when you dont know what they really think about you    mental development means growing to become more secure stable and healthy on a psychological level introspection means looking inward and figuring out why we feel a certain way negative thought patterns that make us spiral down to even worse thoughts and emotions and how to fix that you are essentially trying to be really meta and aware of your thought thats not easy of course it requires a lot of honesty and self consciousness the less you have of the two the less productive introspection can be in fact you could spend years being introspective trying to fix yourself and only move in circles if you possess a decent amount of both you can experience some significant growth    in the end i dont know what causes op to feel this way but its something along the lines of him not thinking that hes very valuable or that hes adding to the lives of others perhaps engage in a productive hobby that means not video games to make you feel like you are capable and skilled to raise the image of yourself and place more value on you additionally you can try to make your friends happy by making them laugh talk about what interests them or just give out small compliments if you are giving out positivity here and there anyone spending time with you is clearly gaining something
whats the actual point of being alive when youre so ugly that not even plastic surgery can fix you    i cant say i look deformed as much as id like to but im quite close to it my eyes are so close together they make my face look like a potato     anyway thats not even the biggest of my issues i cant fucking focus on anything else but constantly think about how fucking poor i am to even attempt the only thing that might improve my looks even if its just for a little bit which is surgery    im 22 and im spending most of my free time being depressed and researching plastic surgery options online i cant fucking focus on school since whenever i take up a book to study a though pops up in my mind saying why the fuck would you even study and spend another 45 years in uni when by the time you finish it and get money for surgeries youll be like 28 and that doesnt even guarantee youll be happy after then i just go back to being an unproductive depressed piece of shit    i wish i fucking wish this was bdd i mean it is but the difference is that im ugly the difference is even if i snap out of it ill remain ugly while true bdd suffers are good looking folks whove been deluded into thinking they look like shit i am fucking disproportionate disharmonious face i constantly get put down because of my looks even by my little sister i wanna fucking kill that bitch she lucked out on looks shes gorgeous i didnt fucking choose to look like this so why treat me this way
why obsess over being born ugly you can accomplish incredible things in life if you dont let depression take over youre fretting over a really empty frivolous thing maybe see a doctor so that he can help you get over it and then enjoy life    look up michel petrucciani
  i used to think that but it was just ocd or something im about as ugly as any other person who is fit and in his prime age
  yeah im sure you are going through something similar to elliot rodgers hmm i wonder what was it that made him really really happy for those last few minutes damn i dont remember what it was but if i was him id do it because god damn i bet he had a lot of fun
    zuckerberg looks like a friggen alien he married an ugly asian woman despite being able to marry hotties across the world ask him if he gives a fuck    the way youre talking the problem doesnt seem to be a rational one and you seem to acknowledge this believe me im not ugly but ive often felt extremely bitter like you have girls have ghosted me for not being 6ft most dates ive been on have ended in failure while the girls proceed to make up some bs excuse for not wanting me before turning around and fucking some turbochad    love relationships and looks are an absolute joke anon plastic surgery wont make you happy and i cant recommend it but i can tell you that continuing in this miserable state is going to yield the same results you either have to learn to love and accept yourself dont be a sadkunt you can be a sikkunt if you wanna be or you can get plastic surgery mew workout and perhaps roid
  i dont know why i used to be fine until like the second grade of highschool and then a girl i liked told me my haircut was shit after i sent her a pic then the realization hit me it wasnt a shit haircut because my friend had the same one and he advised me to get a new haircut but he looked good with it i looked like shit then i realized holy fuck im ugly    ever since then for the past 45 years its been a wild ride of coping having periods of being happy thinking ill fix it and periods of being suicidal thinking this face cant possibly be fixed i dont know i want to escape       its funny you mention that i had a bad case of ocd and im quite a perfectionist i guess this has something to do with it       look not everyone with a mental illness is guaranteed to shoot up a fucking school i dont blame anyone for not liking the way i look its no ones fault and its purely nature at play i cant make someone be attracted to me shit doesnt work this way
  zucc as rolemodel  have you always craved power
  the goal of ocd is to gradually ruin everything until you just dont like existence its based in anxiety which is arguably the worst feeling possible because its like being deathly scared of something inevitable and probably not even threatening
  look not everyone with a mental illness is guaranteed to shoot up a fucking school i dont blame anyone for not liking the way i look its no ones fault and its purely nature at play i cant make someone be attracted to me shit doesnt work this way    eh you are weak suit yourself
  my girl said you sound like a sad potato
  work online dont have a plethoras of mirrors in your home
  i cant say i look deformed as much as id like to  we all know incels want an irrefutable reason theyre huge fucking losers but this is the first time ive seen one actually admit it
  eh you are weak  this from the loser trying to shoot up schools vicariously
  i am not trying to shoot up any school i have just accepted that not all lives are worth living and sometimes the only good advice is to just kill yourself of course if you decide to do anything extra thats on you

do real life sawakos exist and if so where do you find them
  whats a sawako for a nonweeb
  complete social outcast shy introverted dense
  yes they exist but theyre horrible relationship material
  excuse me but sawako gets the boy in the end
  why so      it was beautiful
  it is and it ultimately trumps what youre looking for in a girl she ends up with friends and even a rival and manages to break out of her reclusive streak overall    but if your wish is to find someone to break into well idk
  because they usually burden you with problems and cant do their part in a relationship
  where do you find those
  unless the problems are severe i dont mind
bump
bumping once more
yeah but theyre usually hideous average to pretty girls usually arent total social outcasts
  step 1 dont be fat    my standards arent high
  bad news op i think a lot of them are usually kinda fat also have some standards dont sell yourself short if you dont have to
  well not wanting to be with generic bitchy girls is kinda a standard already
  sawako is just tamer and less fucked up tomoko
    not wanting a messedup gf to love and support
    tomoko is a cute can confirm im op
    
well this thread didnt really work out
last bump
  thats a pretty high standard that eliminates like 60 of nonasian women
  its a fucking manga its not real and you probably wouldnt date them just go bacl to masturbating to stacy
  theyre everywhere but bear in mind that people thought she was that character from the ring movie and if not for that poetic chance encounter she would not have escaped the nickname do you claim to be a virtuous person enough to know that kind of person and see through her mask and the one underneath it
  because if theyre bad at interacting with people and forming relationships how are they going to be able to be in a healthy one with you    the problem is youre not looking for a relationship youre looking for a living doll you can have sex with that people wont think youre a creep for having    a relationship with the girl youre describing would consist of you always being in the position of power how would she communicate any misgivings she might have if she has trouble talking to people how would she have a healthy level of attachment to you if she doesnt have any social connections outside of you    look for someone who is a person not your perfect waifu from a manga
  no faggot i want someone who can actually relate to my feelings someone wholl match my own wavelength     this power shit you spout is just your play at keeping lonely souls apart
  dude im trying to give you straight advice so take it or dont     but socially undeveloped people arent good at relationships they either dont know how to match their partners feelings or they try too hard and make the other person feel smothered    you can always find someone who can empathize with you build from there
    op here im not  but i agree all tho i wouldnt have put it like that
do i really need to rinse in water for fifteen minutes if i get this shit on my skin
  nah i spill bleach on my skin cleaning things every day and i dont even bother washing it off anymore
nah but you should but some of that works in a bottle with aluminum foil shake then throw it all it does is explode i use to do it at school best times ever
  definitely not i pulled a car battery yesterday and got a lil acid on my hands bit o water and soap and good to go
my boyfriend really enjoys lesbian porn and wants to see me play with another woman     i love him and want this relationship to last on paper im fine with the idea as long as we still to the boundaries but in reality its not that easy   my biggest fear is that if we do it once hell want that more i dont want to do it more than once     is this a recipe for disaster
  probably but if its actually a long term respectful relationship he should be able to deal with only doing it once     my wife allowed anal when we first got together and doesnt anymore for any reason sure i miss it and its one of the things im into but our relationship is more important than that one sexual drive     but thats with a solid and put together kind of person who makes long term goals and sticks to the bigger picture within the confines of the relationship     just evaluate what kind of person he is and if hes going to respect your decision to only do it once make it clear thats the expectation and the reality he is heading towards
  thank you for the helpful reply    hes the type of person who would respect it as a one time thing but im also his first full sexual partner im not sure of it will change his view on sex
wanting to cuck yourself  tell your boyfriend that most fetishes shouldnt be enacted in real life this kind of shit wont lead to anything good at most hell get a good nut out of it thats it at worst it will be a terrible experience for one or both of you and will put a big strain on the relationship people really dont understand that bringing a third wheel in a relationship sexually can mess up its dynamics pretty badly even if it only happens once some people will have no issues with it others will but the risk is not worth it
  only do it if youre into it as well
  hell want that more  hell yes its a recipe for disaster and you should be pissed he suggested this proof his penis and fantasy means more to him than the relationships survival he wont stop i guarantee it
  this was closer to my opinion  thank you
why dont you want to do it more than once maybe it will be cool make sure you pick the girl or use a prostitute if your boyf already has a girl lined up ready to go i would not do it for the reasons anons posted above
  why would i be mad most guys are interested in this i told him no initially and he hasnt pressed on it since ive just been thinking about it on my own recently       like i said on paper it sounds fun but id rather us have a long and healthy relationship than have fun
  because i dont im not into polyamory at all and id only do this for hours enjoyment     i believe in monogamy and i like the idea of having one romantic partner
  most guys are interested in this  most guys fantasize about it but smart enough and respectful enough to shut the fuck up about it    its your life and just my hard earned opinion
  i believe in monogamy and i like the idea of having one romantic partner  fucking other people is not monogamy
  most guys are interested in this  actually no jacking it to lesbians in a porno isnt the same as having your girlfriend play around with another girl i would be mad as fuck
most women are into double penetration and they have to shut up about it we are all thots arent we men can fantasize about two women sucking their dick or whatever and we have to be okay with it id say do it only if you are bisexual or whatever or you wont enjoy it also choose the girl dont let him choose or itll mess up with your head in the future sometimes its better to not act on a fetish or youll lose the intimacy in your relationship like its not just you two alone
  i dont want to fuck other people i love him and want to make him happy i dont want to make a habit out of it   can you not process complex concepts not everything is black and white   am i a vegetarian because i eat one meal without meat no      you sound like a tumblr thot      i can agree to this thank you for the input
  he will probably make you a cuck as well i know it because i wanted my girlfriend to bring one of her friends over so i can just fuck her in front of her
  yeah i want to see you play with another woman is exactly how id trick my girlfriend into having a threesome
  he told me to pick the girl but i already said no and that he wouldnt ask again    and then we had sex before he left for work so im feeling alright  saged since i already got the /adv/ice i need
  my hard earned opinion  respectful enough to shut the fuck up about it  and then she says   i told him no initially and he hasnt pressed on it since    i dont think your opinion was earned if youre too retarded to read who youre replying to
its sad that men have to trick women into doing whatever you want id kill to have a threesome but id never force it into my bf you guys are horrible sometimes you can just fucking be honest about your fetishes
you need to tackle the core issue with this before it consumes the relationship and the issue at the centre of this is your boyfriends porn abuse its highly likely he watches it because of this fantasy and stopping porn will make this urge go away
        op here  its not a trick he told me itd be a threesome but one guided by me  as said before he already said he doesnt care and is happy with whatever i choose    this thread is over and i got my answer so this will be my last post
spouse kia is found alive ive remarried what would you do in this scenario
  context
have them fight to the death with you as the reward
  soldiers getting married  jesus christ how horrifying
  watch cast away with tom hanks   it contains your answer

im losing control of my life  i need help   i know this is the wrong place to ask but    come to think of it i smoked a cigarette today and now im having a bad high this doesnt happen when i dont use cigarettes i should never smoke those either oh mannnnn    i posted this picture of lain because i liked that anime even though it was kinda bad
im not gonna try to tackle any big topics in my mind because i cannot think straight at all how do i get someone to talk to right now its early in the morning and everyone else is asleep
  im tired but maybe ill talk to you i need someone to talk to too
this is not good my lungs are killing me should i call the ambulance  its so cold in this room
  should i call the ambulance  probably not youre probably just feeling paranoid try drinking water    its so cold in this room  turn up the heat or put on more clothes or a coat or even a blanket
drink water listen to music or watch something and remember this is only temporary
drink lots of water    also dont try to make vape hits stronger thats how you get paranoia highs weeds equivalent of an overdose and how you scorch your lungs
i might want a job as someone who makes sure dangerous chemicals arent getting into our bodies     im making up consiracy theories in my head at rapid speed it must be the drugs damnnnnnnnnn i need to never do drugs of any kind   like caffeine nicotene alcohol marijuana idk about other drugs that i might be exposed to like otc drugs those might be ok because theyre supposed to treat something rather than just being used for fun maybe i should stop selfmedicating and talk to a doctor
  is this evidence that weed causes schizophrenia paranoia highs  if i stop smoking weed maybe i wouldnt be so crazy maybe im in that small percentage of people that get mental issues from weed thats a scary thought
is watching weird shows like serial experiments lain and listening to really trippy music also making me go nuts
my chest hurts now i dont wanna die from a heart attack like my grandfather
  you alive
  eat some black pepper corns it will help you come down go just stand outside in the cold
im alive lol im a lightweight why am i so pathetic in real life i would get made fun of for being so weak
holy shit guys i just texted my friend i think hes cute i dont know why i texted that to him im not gay but i always saw him as attractive
  gay
my boyfriend never buys or gifts me anything which didnt matter to me at first i am not a materialistic person but i noticed were going on 3 years and not a single gift he also never has went out of way to surprise me with a spontaneous gesture just to be nice like a date or a view of the moon since were getting close to christmas helping him pick out gifts for his mom is kind of getting to me im starting to feel like he never thinks of me at all as much as he does others he goes out of his way to appreciate others but never me when were with other couples and i see the other girls rings their boyfriend got for them or when their boyfriends wins them bears from a claw machine and yes this has happened when were with our friends i envy it so much im begining to feel unloved even a cheap 10 walmart bracelet or something would move me to tears not to mention every valentines  birthday i get nothing its hard to watch all my friends get things bears chocolate cards  dates all those sweet things it makes me sad and i cant help it i feel like a hopeless romantic with this guy  it sucks i really love him but now im starting to question why i dont deserve anything like other girls do other girls have to ask for these things i dont really want to as it takes away from him being thoughtful on his own rather then doing something for me because i told him to i talked to him about this before when i was feeling this way and he still never did anything sweet his exact words were i compare myself to others to much which may be true but if he loved me why wouldnt he want to just make me feel loved with such a easy fix rather than ignoring me knowing im envying other girl because how they get treated
maybe your fat gut doesnt deserve presents like cake or chocolates
  oh for fucks sake     men arent mind readers on average we are less materialistic and less romantic than women this means that a guy who isnt a romantic himself and isnt looking for opportunities to be romantic probably doesnt even realise that you feel like this    you will need to be the one who bends her pride if theres some miscommunication between the two of you
its kinda of weird that he didnt get you anything for your birthday did he take you out somewhere
  tldr  im not materialistic but im materialistic why isnt he spending more money on me
  posting in a bait thread    made the thread deleted it immediately then remade it with the details changed
3 years and not a single gift  you made a big mistake op
  but she loves him right
  no     its not about the money though it could be 1  i would be so happy its the fact he buys gifts for eveyone else he cares about that is hurtful to me when ive not received a single kind gesture suprise or gift im sure anyone would be hurt too over this you missed the point       did i forget to mention i talked to him about it       ooo that maybe wouldve hurt me if i actually was fat thanks for the attempt though x
  there could be something here you need to ask him
  money isnt the only way to be materialistic for all you know his mom busts his balls if he doesnt buy gifts for her and at any rate why would you compare yourself to his own mother the bottom line is from what youve written here that you dont care if he appreciates you or not you just care that he isnt doing it in a specific way that you can then compare to your circle of friends    there are plenty of reasons why he might not be getting gifts for you specifically he might not know what to get for example he might hate the idea of getting something he sees as unoriginal or canned he could be trying to save moneyand at the risk of further inflaming your delusions there are instances where guys will go extremely lean to build up to something like splurging on a proposal however ive seen none of that here all youve done is complain that you arent getting the same treatment as others you know despite the fact hes dating you and not them
  thats understandable but i still cant help but be sad ya know i been through such a bad year ive even had a miscarriage with this guy i was in bed for over 2 weeks crying depressed and top that off with crippling anxiety he did nothing to make me feel better not even a simple gesture that wouldve made me feel better even something not involving money would be okay it just sucks i hope you understand where im coming from
  like for fuck sakes i met up with this guy long distance after 2 years of talking online i bought my own ticket flew out to see him he didnt even take me out on a date or anything
  you said you talked to him but did you truly sit his ass down and talk to him
  kid out of wedlock  and it gets even better i think i do understand where youre coming from but not in the sense of sympathy my guess is that youre going to stay with him for years firmly in the delusion that hell change because you love him before maybe getting fed up and leaving after youve squandered your youth and your dignity on a dead end    started as a long distance relationship  putting in all the effort and surprised it isnt being reciprocated  good god is there anything you didnt make a mistake in     back this up why exactly do you love him
  ya i talk a lot when im upset i have to loll
have you ever gotten him anything before if yes and its a one way street then ditch the guy love shouldnt trap you in a relationship youre not happy with
  what did he answer when you asked why he didnt buy you gifts for birthdays and such
i was a shitty bf to my ex and i still got her gifts especially on bday or valentine day ur bf is a faggot
why are americans so horrible ppl you deserve to be vomited on new age jews
  you are overthinking this way too much      this    basically just tell him how you feel and that you would appreciate a little gift here or there maybe emphasize that the gifts dont need to be elaborate or anything as you say a 10 walmart thing would be enough of a gesture tell him how you feel instead of hoping he will figure it out which he wont because he isnt thinking about it
  so break up
he sounds autistic materialistic meme aside you should show your appreciation for your partner by at least getting them something for their birthday and it doesnt even have to be expensive i dont think you should treat your girfriend like a spoiled child by buying her shit constantly but this guy doesnt even do the minimum as a man you are a expected to spoil your girfriend from time to time especially if shes a good loyal woman dont listen to feminist propaganda about how gender roles need to be destroyed this is just basic shit that any guy in a relationship should do
  good idea dont talk to him about it instead post a rant in a taiwanesechickencare forum  you have the emotional intelligence of a child
  if that is actually true and not just some female sob story made up to gage how wed react if he was fictionalized worse than reality    then this guy is simply an asshole and doesnt actually care about you im saying this ignoring the im not materialistic but muh materialism op completely    i do give gifts to my thots but not on fucking days the calendar tells me to do it on that shit feels like the worst part of capitalism and fake forced to buy  gifts because theyre expecting on calendar date here shop at jc pennies goy
honey have you ever heard closed mouths dont get fed     well now you have open ya mouth and demand for that boy to start acting right or get left my man pays for all the dates food places we go on top of that i tell him things i want and ask him to buy them for me he does most of the time and when he says no i give him a blowie and turn that no into a yes youre a woman and we have all the power to get what we want when we want it get over yourself and ask for the things you want if he goes through with it then he obviously cares and that will show it hes a man they dont normally think with the correct head if ya know what i mean c
  guess why you stayed with him for 3 years bet your beta male friends get beta buck milked and cucked be happy you got a man a real man a mans man soooo manly too much manlyness for a pussy only a man can handle so much man a mans man for a man
  a honest woman cant be larp
  something even not involving money    got it you want beta male gibs just like a nigger
  why do women assume theyre worthy of materialistic goods from their partner   the price of the product doesnt matter the idea that you long for this crap tells you a lot about someone  women are so insecure about themselves that they need materialism in order to get by in life  speaking of non essentials ofc  funny seeing all these heartwarming verbal words and cuddling  love  boiling away as its all just a womans mood boost
tough shit
    i am a boyfriend who absolutely hates gifting people not out of the badness of my heart but because figuring out a gift and gifting gives me tremendous social stress people expect gift that are expensive enough but not too expensive personal and thoughtful but not already owned to a perfectionnist its a true nightmare    for this reason and being a consistent person i also dislike people gift me knowing it is hard to return the favor and i dont want to feel guilt of being selfish whenever possible i try to land a deal with people we dont gift each other even for bday or xmas    if your boyfriend is perfectionnist he probably know and cant help about difficultiies to surprise and gift people rather than assuming he isnt sweet enough you could probably empathise more with his disability and help him get on the way to gift people giving your own tips to find thoughtful gifts accompany him to gift other people and who knows he may eventually get over it and manage to make you a thoughtful gift that will be worth a thousand meaningless others even i grew up enough to offer a trip to greece last year
roastie sad her emotional crutch hasnt handed his wallet to her as well yet
  the problem is if she does tell him that shed appreciate little gifts then any future gifts hed give her would be driven by obligation rather than desire  itd be less im giving you this gift because i genuinely love you and enjoy having you in my life and more im giving you this gift because you told me i should give it to you and youll probably nag me if i dont
  its easy as fuck just watch random stuff on ali if heap enough buy several things so you have gifts for everyone and can get them a seperate final one i usually like to gift stuff when its not for a birthday or holiday though because it wont look forced
i hope your boyfriend never buys you shit
  this
fuck all these assholes twisting your words    so how does he show his love for you what does he do for you if you feel like he loves you he must do something have you done any such gestures for him if you have how did he react     just asking to see if your love is onesided
what makes you think you are so special    princesses are the daughters of psychopathic assholes you re better off being a good housewife than another spoiled whore
  wtf she never said that relationships are supposed to be about showing you care about the other person a minimum degree of effort is not a lot to ask for
  have gf  do nothing  this is proper  
  have you ever given him a gift
    if you offered me this all you would have from me is my best actor performance not to make you feel shit
  i know this was ages ago but in my opinion even though i am young 20   when i love someone alot or care for them especially in the beginning   ill do small gestures like flowers chocolates and other stuff nothing expensive ill do like  50   i only do it to people i truly am like head over heels for and who hold a big meaning if its just desu any other girl and i just dont see it going anywhere i wont do the above     also if you already do wifey things like clean for him and bend over far for him   as guys we go as far as you let us go and if you already do what we would want why try if i already have everything
  hes no man   hes what we call bitchboi  get outta here with that materialist thot mindset   some hoe dating a replacement dad gg
look ma  im baiting /adv/ again  its not that we thought you couldnt its that we assumed you wouldnt
    replace him with a generous boyfriend 3 years wasted are enough dont you think    next
3 years  not a single penny spent on you  youre fucking retarded and im pressed to say you deserve it break up with him dumbshit
people legit asserting that relationships should require no effort or input from the dude at all essentially just a chick throwing herself at a mannequin that plays civ  oof
  does he appreciates you in any other way     
  lol wooooow youre triggered arent ya my bf works hard and makes a lot of  he can spend it however he wants because he has that luxury theres nothing wrong with spoiling your girlfriend if shes also giving you whatever you want and being good to you in every way possible its mutualistic ive bought him many things as well apple watch dyson fan air pods etc we enjoy the finer things in life just because you cant afford to maintain that type of relationship or maybe dont even have one doesnt mean you should be so bitter lol how you gon hate from outside the club you cant even get in
  he goes out of his way to appreciate others but never me    thats a serious piece of cake of a case he takes you for granted flirt with other guys and then see what happens
  its not materialism if we both do it
  did i forget to mention i talked to him about it  yes you did honestly if i had to give you any advice it would be either get over it now or break it off i know what you are thinking thats harsh but either you get over it and deal with not getting anything or find someone who does because if he isnt gonna change in 3 years and if you brought it up so he is aware then he will never change but hey thats just my insight you can ignore it if you wish
  i usually disagree with this guy but hes spot on here way too many women expect men to read their minds and then get mad when the lack of communication makes itself evident and they dont get what they want furthermore if youre getting upset with someone for not getting material things for you youre the one whos doing something wrong
  i dont really want to as it takes away from him being thoughtful on his own rather then doing something for me because i told him to  i talked to him about this before when i was feeling this way and he still never did anything sweet  you answered your own question here he likely felt that if he did something like that you would feel as if he only did it because you asked him to not because he genuinely want trying to be sweet whats he supposed to do in this situation
  either this is an incel larping or a woke woman i dont know which
      answer the question op
  there cant be a relationship without men throwing  at women  pathetic materialistic insect mentality
  yes
  yes everyone asking ive given him gifts i made him a website full of our memories i made him a box decorated with old memories of things ive kept for us like plane tickets and stuff i buy him weed occasionally when hes sad or stressed  ive made him a deck of cards with our photos several more also i didnt think this post would still be active so sorry for taking so long to get back to you guys x
  weed   unsurprising fact 9
  how does he treat you in general
  yes but how many blowjobs have you given him
make a long running joke about it and make it confident banter in 20 years itl be a running joke and hel proba buy you holidays to fiji insteed
i like this girl in my class but im too afraid to talk to her we walk a little when i sit next to her but thats it i feel if i try to do anything ill be humiliated in front of everyone what do
  discretely ask her to meet you outside of class where there arent so many people and then throw your spaghetti at her
how are you going to be humiliated by talking to her
i need an advice from anyone   the thing is that because some things that have happened people started to call me out and its not stoppingsometies just random people who have no connection with me whatsoever do animal chants outside my house thinking that im not hearing them its like the entire city turned itself on me i cant move out anyway and this is a small city in which everyone know everyone im losing my life in front of my own eyes and i cant do nothing
  this is going for a while now and every time i move out to a different area within the city the same shit happens im being hunted while im not affraid of these people i cant just attack random people on the street just because they shout
how are we supposed to give advice if we dont know any details youre obviously doing something to make people do that whatever it is stop it thats all i can say with that information
  i beat 3 guys which were talking shit while my door were still open thiking that i wont give a shit but i didbecause i quit the job the very same day so i fought with 3 of them did pretty good damage i pick up my bag along with my belongings on my way out of city and i was going to bus station my m8 callss me and tells me that there are 20 guys waiting for me at the buss station with equiepment  so i took a cab from city to city and when i came back home th word spread that i was a pussy for not engaging with 20 people with knifes and so on 
  now even random people when i walk down the street scream like fucking animals and then run away im aware that they are trying to bait me to engage with them but im not taking it
  this sounds like paranoid schizophrenia or psychosis  youve got to get help i dont know of any situation someone could be in that the citys residents would stand outside their house making animal noises
   i wish i was insane i wishbut even when im walking down the street people that i know who are friends of the guys who i fought with so these things i cant elaborate it better than that im being hunted
  if you have a gang of people trying to kill you go to the police if you just think you have a gang of people trying to kill you go to a therapist
  police wont do anything no evidence and so on i will end up killing myself because there is no other way
i am sick of trying to use tinder and apps like it all the girls act and look the exact same refer to the meme of thots wanting to eat pizza and have their butts touched ect ect where can i go to interact with women of a higher caliber specifically i like girls with long blonde hair and who are taller than me and im 5 9 pic somewhat related
  in your dreams if you cant handle women then maybe you should just go gay
  no i can handle women i just dont like tinder
  tinder is and always will be full of a bunch of dumb blond thots going to state university
  okay are there better places to find dates can i have some examples
yes most women on tinder are low quality but in order to find treasure you have to dig through mountains of dirt if it makes you feel any better imagine what the guys on tinder must be like theyre probably all frat bros and fuckboys
  i found my girlfriend in a psychiatric facility
  active or abandoned
  fair enough
  were still together 
  i meant the facility congrats btw 
  idk wondering the same thing all the places i think of like concerts and uhhhhhhhhhhbh  are just tinderslut lite
  i am sick of trying to use tinder and apps like it  your pics and/or profile are shit chances are you cant make conversation either when you do match if you want to meet women go to places that women go to do things with them and make conversation  that said if you cant even market yourself you probably lack the social skills to talk to women
  market  everything truly is corrupted by capital even love
  everything truly is corrupted by capital even love  what word would you use then  face it youre trying to sell yourself to women hoping one finds you attractive/interesting over the numerous guys that are also swiping right on her
  sell yourself to tindersluts  gonna be a yikes the quality of women on tinder is trash most are walking talking asterisks i could become chad himself it would only lower my opinion of these people  if you ask me the tinder boat has sailed respectable men and women avoid the stigma for a reason these days
what makes you think you can get the high caliber blonde if you cant even handle a basic tinder girl  so clueless
  okay that settles it then im going to uninstall it
i like this skirt but how would i even be able to wear this out im honestly just looking for a excuse to buy it i thought it was more of in the bedroom type of skirt but all the reviews  comments are like great for hot summer days much cooler than wearing shorts or pants must have for the wardrobe very nice skirt  i get plenty of attention from the men when i wear it  lol btw i just copy  pasted a few anyways im a bit confused on this id love to wear this out but  like could i get away with that like wtf
literally looks like cheap granny underwear why do you like it
that is not a fucking skirt wearing something like that outdoors is just asking for something bad to happen some creep is gonna like follow you home or something
 youd be able to wear this wherever you feel like wearing it    youre your own person and as long as youre not beyond revealing this is a good way to cool yourself during summer    use it in the summer use it in the bedroom its up to what you want to do during that day    and i think youd want to look for something a bit more unique similar in style but like more patterns unique things are always a great taste personally find it a bit bland but not bad
  its basic i could pair it with literally anything i have some black shorts i like to wear in the summer that are tight spandex anyways this looks like the skirt version of those
    its an underskirt to be worn under another slightly longer skirt to prevent the potential sweating and rolling up that cheap fake materials sometimes cause do not wear it as a main garment unless you are a trashy ghetto whore
honestly it looks like something a hooker would wear
thats a belt not a skirt    do you want to be taken seriously if so dont wear that skirt
medfags psychfags anyone is welcome ill try to keep it short     i got prescribed and been taking since 5 days ago topiramate for mood swings and impulses/crisis that i have   ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but its still unsure whether i have borderline personality disorder bipolar disorder or other whatever shit or none     previously i got respiridone but i reacted very badly to it as well no matter how slow i took it to the point i had a severe relapse and attempted suicide     now with topiramate doc said to start with 15mg but pharmas only have 25mg capsules currently unable to split apart so lets stick with that   however since the first night i take it at dinner ive been having real awful headaches     since then its been worsening they really hurt feels like migraine almost   other symptoms  nausea  hunger but loss of appetite at same time  thirsty  loss of thought/absence seizures  really sleepy lethargic  occasionally weird feeling in hands  other meds im on  sertraline 150mg  diazepam 25mg or 5mg for fibromyalgia  tramadol 75mg for fibromyalgia   xanax 025mg or 05mg for crisis    i wouldnt say its as bad as respiridones side effects but    is it really worth it for me to keep holding on and pushing through and waiting to see if this works     whats worse is the wikipedia page says it hasnt proven effective for the problem at hand so id be suffering for nothing     i talked to my doc and she urged me to hold on    do i hold on do i let go     thanks anons
  if you are experiencing this kind of side effects you should immediately see your doctor and get off those specific meds
  i saw her and told her she told me to wait a little longer and persist
  if the symptoms persist i would honestly seek another doctor the general practice is to suspend the medication if a serious side effect occurs
  that medication list looks familiar  i have been on something almost exactly the same for a period of time i also did not react well to the respiridone i havent taken any of those meds for nearly 6 years  the biggest improvements for me were removing myself from the stressful environment and start approaching the problem as a brain inflammation/health and mindset problem  this means the basic components which you have likely heard before  exercise  get sunlight  dont eat sugar/carbs keto diet  do intermittent fasting  get good sleep  try taking antiinflammation supplements fish oil and turmeric   try taking supplements to support your brains ability to create serotonin  like onnits good mood    the last thing is make a solid commitment/promise with yourself that you dont actually want to commit suicide if you ever get suicidal ideation  realize those are lies/tricks or deceptions from your illness and will always be wrong dont ever act on them and know no matter how convincing or persuasive the argument for suicide seems  its just the dumb mental illness trying to trick you remember back to when you were logical sane and rational and predicted the mental illness try to convince you to commit suicide is a lie its still true  its not the correct answer    in terms of your anxiety  do an experiment for me go wear womens underwear one day  or anything that you would be embarrassed to have anyone know you have on your person such as furry porn in your wallet i dont know man go out side with that secret item and go about your day if you feel your anxiety freaking out about people laughing at you for wearing womens undear or other crazy axious feelings of people know  realize they dont your pants are opaque and no one can see it your other illness is making up shit and stressing you out after experiencing this  you can go check in the mirror if you want that its impossible to see that you are womens underwear and its lieing too
what happens if you just get off all the drugs and check into inpatient mental health clinic and dont leave until you are confident you can handle your life this is probably a much more effective solution and will be much healthier long term
  quitting the drugs cold turkey is a terrible idea
  eat healthy exercise quit meds etc  god i know you mean well but im so tired of hearing this shit over and over especially when its pushed onto me   how can i exercise when im in crippling pain 24/7  i do exercise however to the extent i can and i do eat well and i get plenty of sunlight but that doesnt mean i can just quit my meds   if anything one or two of my meds is what saved my life and pushed me to have energy and start being able to exercise and cope with the pain     im sorry anon i know you mean well but ive heard people spewing bullshit at me so much i fucking sperg out     go wear womens underwear  hey man ive been doing so pretty much all my life mens underwear more comfy tho do have to admit and been using it more   i dont think theres anything much anymore i can feel embarrassed over because i hate myself so much if someone makes fun of me for something i either laugh along with them or am just whatever about it maybe a tad pissed off like wow im a degenerate piece of shit big news         ive quit cold turkey and have tried to quit gradually and supervised   both went awfully wrong but cold turkey went the most wrong  seriously dont do it   it just doesnt work for me say all you want it doesnt right now at this stage of my life i cant pull through without it in the future in different circumstances maybe   now no ive been switching to healthier/less harmful alternatives ive reduced dosages and number of meds over the years but i cant just quit all my meds especially when one of them introduced to me this year has absolutely changed my life
so im last year in school i dont know what career path to take i would want a job that would involve travelling around the world and also a decent pay
  by school do you mean hs or college    cant help much but this is very important
  hs or as we say here secondary school
  start with some very broad questions    do you see yourself working in a suit and tie overalls uniform what    do you want to work in an office factory outside other    do you imagine yourself marrying young staying single for a while never marrying that will have some effect on your independence and responsibilities    there are lots more questions of that sort but even those three will narrow down and focus your thinking
become a traveling salesman
  grease up your boyhole and become a flight attendant
  become a pilot desu travel everywhere for free and some pilots are making over a million a year right now after you get a degree its about 1 more year of flight school before you start to work and about 5 years before youll have a job with the big guys if youre motivated
  got to quit smoking the weedz though
  smoking weed and playing vidya  if you want a decent paying job that involves travelling a lot you arent going to have this option my advice is to stop spending money on weed tobacco and alcohol and focus solely on your career there are a lot of options for you if you want a kind of job that allows you travel but if you want to travel and have a high paying job at the same time youre going to need to be very strict about yourself

  its not even that we hate mixed race couples its that the white race is in decline in the west amd race mixing is part of the reason theres no hate just a wish to preserve our race with regards to ops bent dick problem if it bends downward doggy style should be good for her experiment with positions and youll find that sweet spot that utilises your curvature best your body image issues can be solved by starting a dedicated training program at a gym your problem is low self esteem so set out to achieve things so you can be proud of yourself after that everything will fall into place good luck
    you guys are probably talented and/or attractive 7 inches isnt 8 inches 510 isnt 6 ft besides body measurements dont mean much when you cant be a master at your passion i just wanna be talented at drawing and wow /ic/ and win an oscar and/or tony as an actor    true but id just be a pagliacci
  anon several people describe me as the funniest person they know and i hate being alive but it would be even worse if people didnt think i was funny
  talented or attractive   i dont have a job and never went to school  but i do plan on starting something soon  never held a girls hand or even had my first kiss   im 20 so yes i do have time but understand that doesnt take away from my situation
  why do you hate being alive    are you good at things
  why are people born naturally better than others     there is no logical or fair explanation the only way to live with it is to accept that there is a higher power that decides what fair and what is not and we just cant comprehend it with our imperfect bodies and minds so the reason you are born shit and others are born perfect is because it has to be that way and its fait just believe in it you are not going to find a justification with logic just believe that its all happening the way it should maybe you fucked a dozen of cats in your past life who knows
  fuck people who are born better you either accept theyre better than you or you make yourself better than them im 22 and im just finish my associates since i spent so much time in community college without know what i wanted to do while people i graduated with are about to get their bachelors    i was always that weird kid and i had no friends until 8th grade and i didnt even know how to talk with people because i couldnt talk with anyone i said fuck that ill learn how to talk to people it was hard but i learned how to do it     i bsd my way through high school and carried that into college i didnt hit me until i started failing tests seeing that really stung and it made me realize that im not happy with my place in life so i decided to try and fix it im taking organic chemistry now with one of the highest grades in class    if you want to be something if you want something you have to find that drive to make you want it you need to find that reason to show everyone that was born better than you that you can contend with them too you can do it bro put in that effort find that goal and be the best man you can be
    thanks m8s im gonna keep practicing drawing my loomis and start jogging again
  next time pick your greatgrandparents more carefully
bullied and beaten through grade school because i was always sick  started hating school bad grades in highschool flunked a year  always been that weird kid nobody was friends with  diagnosed with crohns disease at 17  could only ever get relationships with crazy girls over the internet who always left me in the end  started university but when my gf left me i ended up dropping out because of depression  couldnt land a job because no qualifications  every single event in my past has been a failure and an embarrassment  tried to draw comics and start a patreon but i was always shit and never improved enough to gain an audience  been a neet for at least 6 years  considering to an hero so i can stop being a burden on my family
  5 10 isnt a bad height just lose weight  womemes who care about that shit are either actually tall or actually retarded
  why are people born naturally better than others  because it be like that sometimes
  so basically coping and lots of it  nice shit life
  just kill yourself you insufferable little bitch
  prove me wrong if you can  but i dont think you can
  if you have to cope with those facts thats says more about you than me
  i think you mightve misunderstood me i was not implying that your life is shit i was just referring to life in general    also i dont really see how else you would define it aside from coping
grow some balls and take control of your life nigga whining about incel shit is for white people and asians youre not a baby
  self awareness is for white people and asians   hes not wrong
sup /adv/    i moved into an apartment obviously there is plenty of garbage filling my mailbox from previous tenants and just overall garbage    i took it to the post office and told them i want to refuse it the black woman working at the desk said oh honay no no no thats junk mail we aint gonna take that    okay so any tips on not getting this garbage    you will have to write them and ask them to remove them from the list    tldr the courier one delivering the mail doesnt take my refused mail the postal worker at the post office refused to take the mail that i was refusing cant find any information online about this but they cannot deny refused mail/parcels right
  forgot to say i am an amerifat
  ask to see her supervisor they hire those baboons to ward off the putzes so that the managers can deal with the real customers then again this is the government so ymmv
  i will next time but if i had some kind of statement from usps saying they have to accept it somewhere that would be helpful      that time i was in there i didnt have time to escalate but am willing next time
just found there is a corporate number/email ill escalate there
well i sent an email to their support says 1 day response we will go from there
    how fucking underage are you people i had this same exact issue so i called and asked the reason the us post office as any other mail deliviring service is required to deliver parcels which have been paid for this means someone is paying for them to deliver the junk and its their job to do so if they dont they are legally liable and will be sued clear now    so rather than pretend like you everyone is an idiot except your little snowflake you get a paper shredder find some corporate numbers and unsubscribe dealing with the trash that gets payed to be delivered at your mail box is your job not the post office
  just chuck it into the trash like everyone else  youre jewish arent you
  call all the senders tell them that the individual passed away not even the sleaziest scamscum will bother to solicit to a corpse
  it is not the post offices job to decide which mail to deliver and which to throw away in fact the law specifically forbids that    google blocking junk mail you can put yourself on a nojunk list that mailers have to follow
if it is junk toss it in the trash and never look back    if you dont spend money with whomever is sending it they will stop wasting their money sending it to you    if it is not junk circle the name i use red pen write no longer at this address on the envelope and drop it in a mail box at the post office they will return it to whomever sent it
kill the postpeople
okay /adv i need some help developing a social life     i just got out of a six month depressive slump where i actively considered suicide and ate nothing but junk food i have since managed to shift a considerable amount of weight and i feel better about myself but i realised that i dont really have any friends at least not irl     i think its probably cos i dont go out a lot which id like to change is there any easy ways to make friends that anyone here can recommend ive tried stuff like choir and tabletop groups but the latters almost always full and the former is kinda nonsocial is there something else i should be doing     pic unrelated its the first thing that came up in my downloads
what you should be doing is anything that you legitimately enjoy and just find a way to make it social you wont be able to keep it up if you do a thing purely for the social aspect so find a way to make your hobbies and interests involve others things like streaming cons clubs etc
  well thats kind of the problem i somewhat drew into a sort of antisocial cocoon where all of my hobbies were online  anime podcasts tabletops vidja shit like that     in online circles i have plenty of friends ive even had offers to go out for drinks with them although considering they live in london and i live in the north of england thats kind of a oneoff for the christmas season im looking for something more permanent irl if ya get me
  chances are youre going to have to be the driving force behind the socialization of your interests i understand where youre coming from my preferred hobbies are isolating by nature as well but you can still make it happen start online and keel pushing try joining discors servers start streaming tabletop and vidya and watch others as well dm some tabletop and advertise in your area    it takes work trial and error and a lot of trying with people and not having it go anywhere but if youre creative and persistent you can figure it out
  ah fuck sleep meds made me miss the part about you having online friends    focus on digging into your specific area google is gonna be your friend look for events meet people arrange and invite them to stuff if that isnt working build something yourself such as a horror movie night in your backyard or whatever and advertise around your neighborhood and in popular places like coffee shops you will likely have to play host to meet people without going through another friend first
try finding other hobbies too i picked up mountain biking and got obsessed after finding out how big the scene is in my area lots of bars do run clubs too which draws a lot of fit people of all demographics    if you want to stick to gaming go to local board game shops and talk to the staff they probably host pickup game nights
i can never think of things to talk about with people because i have social anxiety  when im not anxious things just come to me more naturally  what do
my solar plexus feels so weak when i talk
your age/gender  can you smoke weed and/or drink
  19 male  can do both but i dont want to become an addict or reliant on such substances all the time
n
bump
  well whatever you do dont do what i do and just start talking endlessly until the social encounter is over  this is especially bad during dates
i fucking hate myself     so i broke up with my gf like 6 months ago we kept something going but 3 months ago i found this beautiful girl funny awesome great mature cute girl and now we are together   i still kept contact with my ex as friends it was alright but 1 month in i noticed she started getting jealous and annoying so i cut contact with her     cut to 1 week ago where i hear from friends that shes feeling really fucking bad gaining weight not going out and she always mentions me and goes through pics of us shes still obsessed with me   sooo i get the stupid idea of contacting her ask her hows shes doing hows dating etc     cut to now where we are sexting on discord not over whatapp where my gf can see me online    fuck me why am i like this i did the same with my ex where i sexted other girls while we were together my gf is even better in bed actually does work and likes it kinky and hard but there is something thats pulling me back to my ex   idk the familiarity 2years   the forbidden nature    my current gf loves me over everything and so does my ex     wtf is wring with me why cant i just be happy im so competitive with everything   gotta be the best in video games  gotta be the best at work  gotta be the best bf  gotta be the best in bed  gotta be the manliest man and fuck the most chicks those are my only 2 anyway     ahhh    i told my gf that i dreamed of my ex it was actually a conscious fantasy of fucking my ex     the right thing to do would be to block my ex and tell my gf everything and move on   fuck me it was all good a week ago   ahhhh
  sorry for the rant   need to get some of this shit out  friends are saying pretty much whati should do       op
  wahhhh i have two girls who love me and want to fuck me woe is me    fuck off
    go to /pol before you post that shit pls thanks      op
  yep tell your girlfriend everything if she decides you are worth her time then lucky you but expect to be untrusting of her from now on you ruined the relationship in any case blocking fatso is the base case anyway
ride the wave brother
    if i tell her shes gonna leave me immediately   she has trust issues from her previous relationships   and the stuff her sister has also gotten into  and the fact that i acted like a fuckboi when i first met her     she going through a hard time with herself and family i dont want to add to it    i care about her too much too leave her yet here i am emotionally cheating on her     its all fucked up    feelschromosomemanpng      op
  sexting goes beyond emotional cheating imo
  yeah i know     call me jake paul or something fml
  youre dumb and immature and so is your ex she wants you because youre with another girl and you keep contact with her because it validates you so good job you should feel validated enough right now so cut it and tell your ex youre done with this kind of thing if not out of basic human decency do it before your gf finds out by accident or even more probable before your petty ex make her know you stupid moron    other than that why are you signing your replies on an anonymous forum your posts are so dumb that you dont need to sign them to make you recognizable i assure you
  the fuck does /pol/ have to do with it hes right youre being a whiny bitch and your thread is shit
  so you come to a board of teenage dweebs who have never even spoken to a real live girl to complain about your problems juggling two women what kind of sadist are you
everyone at work hates me these days i deserve it didnt pull my weight they havent fired me yet since its probably a long process and im searching for a new job but whats the best way to deal with everyones ire in the meanwhile besides staying quiet and doing my assignments
how many people exactly hate you     just work hard from now on and if possible do small favors for people could be helping them in their work buying them coffee sharing some food or treats with everyone chat with them if you have decent social skills and ask about their hobbies weekend or life    keep looking for another job for now just in case they fire you and/or you find something simply better
  what kind of limp dick moron manages to not put any effort into the occupation that is paying their bills im the most egotistical uncoworkable jackass out there and i kick ass at my job they pretend to get along with you if youre an asset to the company
  i did okay on previous projects so they gave me a good amount of responsibility but i honestly just shat the bed this time around so no one really trusts me anymore i agree though being a dumbass requires facing the music
  no need to kick someone while theyre down
ive started working at a charity and i met one of my colleagues whom ive fallen in love with shes a lot of fun and shes pretty much the reason why i look forward to go to work the problem is that im married and my wife is great i hate feeling like this but i cannot help it how do i deal with this
fellas how do i prevent unwanted boners
  cut your dick off
    be thankful you have boners because later youll find it really hard to get hard

  not your personal army you young black male
posted this up yesterday and forgot about it lets get this out the way im a fucking retard    im still head over heels for my ex im never going to do anything sexual with him again but im still stupid enough to interact with him when hes so willing and eager to shit all over my feelings whenever he gets the slightest bit upset or like hes lost something in the situation like im talking down to him instead of talking it out he just flips out and says horrible hurtful shit just to break me down when hes called out on it he denies or doubles down only to come back and give some bollocks apology later ie im sorry you were stressing me out it legitimately makes me suicidal but no matter what im too fucking stupid to stay away when hes nice its literally the best interaction ive ever had with someone    i feel like a broken housewife i feel useless and weak i dont know how to stop going back and honestly roping is starting to seem like an easier option any advice would be extremely appreciated    last thread my only advice was cut contact  yes ive tried that thanks ive no willpower and go crawling back to him
  then youre fucking stupid as fuck op   because cutting contact is literally the advice that you needed throw your phone or some shit are you a fucking womenchild
  then youre fucking stupid as fuck op   lets get this out the way im a fucking retard    cant cut contact entirely with him he owes me like a grand and has to communicate when hes able to repay we have mutual friend which means even if we dont text / call ill still see him a couple times a week combo that with the fact the usually texts me about our shared interests and im just fucking useless
  just tell him to pay in bank deposits or electronic banking and stop talking to him just message him when he doesnt pay up ghost him when he starts talking to you of another thing seriously op im not gonna call you stupid again because ive been there dont make yourself emotionally stunted no willpower bs keep trying
  he gets paid different amounts payday to payday so thats why we usually discuss im trying my best to ignore his random texts atm but its so hard especially since we have mutual friends and sometimes the shit he sends is relevant to them and requires answering you can call me stupid again it wouldnt be false
an entire 24 hours have passed after he last lashed out so that of course means im now worthy of talking to instead of referencing anything that happened yesterday or even apologizing ive recieved a text asking if i have an expansion for one of my games these are painful to ignore but require no willpower but i dont know how to ignore things about other people that he needs an answer to
  cant you just ignore those too probably your friends know that you broke up   but op this we cant help you with unless youre willing to give up the money which would probably happen if you really ignore him
  i just feel like im hanging him out to dry if i know shit that is relevant and helpful but refuse to share it     ah i know people cant help im just hoping people can point out for that im incapable of seeing at the moment pretty muchhoping someones been through this and found a way to break themselves back into place
  you will break out when you get tired of his insults and when you get emotionally stunted coincidentally my first love has been in your situation didnt work out for them both in the end boyfriend was making bad jokes and apologizing when the damage has been done she was depressed for almost a year then she found a new boyfriend and shes quite happy now youll get over it op when you really get really really tired also you play vidya right go find some gaming community or something to get your mind off it maybe you just dont have that much friends to talk to that your life revolves on him thats why you feel like that  mfw get called a underage after this reply
  tired of his insults  im already tired i just forget after about 3 hours how bad it hurt me im used to this kind of thing and its very hard to make my angry feelings permanent in these situations i know that once we get over each other and find a new love well both be so much happier its just getting over him thats killing me    my pc is broke atm but i will just play shed loads of vidya when its back up it all reminds me of him but the only way to stop that is to play it without him i know that much i have lots of friends but i dont whine or bitch to them when my lifes shit so he was my only outlet for feeling better in shitty times i hang out with other people now in hopes that itll keep my mind off everything
  your only problem here is that he might prolong his debt op if you dont mind you can join our discord group if you want to vent out getting connection errors in my pc  
  theres literally nothing you can do actually if youre that weak willed and cant control yourself to not giving a fuck the truth is you make these excuses in order to talk to him and have contact with him when you know very well it wouldnt be too hard to avoid him or have minimal dry boring contact in terms of getting your money you dont need to reply when its about your friends he can ask someone else the same questions lets be honest youre extremely codependent on him emotionally and you have no one else to be codependent with so you stick to him like glue heres a few things that could happen     1 you keep dealing with this shit and making excuses until you yourself get so stepped on and hurt that you literally stop caring you stop caring to reply and every time you talk it will be a fight and ignoring each other until it just stops   2 you keep taking his shit over and over until he moves on with someone else stops caring about you and blocks you from everything  3 you meet someone else to be codependent on and hopefully he/she is better to you so you wont have to repeat this process
secretly bi  gfs laptop broke  give her my ipad to use until she gets a new one  forget to erase browser history  safari is literally full of gay porn sites i visit as its my gay tablet  95 chance my gf sees it through history or autocomplete    i literally dont know what to do its 6am i havent been able to sleep all night im gonna get it back tomorrow and delete the history but itll probably be too late

  accept that its over i guess prepare for the beautiful shitstorm tomorrow
  i dont think most girls mind having a bi boyfriend
  oh you naive man
  even if it did i wouldnt have used it i literally used it for a big screen to look at gay porn    i dont want to give up so easily i love here im thinking of blaming it on a friend who i also let borrow it but the problem is we have a mutual friend group    shes lowkey homophobic
  even if it did i wouldnt have used it  theres literally no difference with incognito mode expect it doesnt save your history
  literally just say you searched it up as a prank laugh about it to be convincing
  is we have a mutual friend group  had    youre gonna be the closet gay pervert of the group now
  not wanting to remember your favorite videos    prank  literally entire history is random gay porn    i dont think shed embarrass me like that at least not to anyone but 2 of the girls in it
  at least not to anyone but 2 of the girls in it  oh no no no
  im not worried about them just her
maybe your gf will start pegging you and it will be a winwin op
  uses apple products  doesnt think everyone knows you are a flaming faggot
  i am a femanon and i dont mind    ah that changes things
yknow 1023 pm 12/3  5 hours of sleep over 3 days not really ate  just existing  i have nobody to talk to about any of this  or i dont think so at least i geuss  shit got me thinking     lifes just been a sinking ship for the past 5 years filled with substance abuse and it just keeps getting worse   each year  every day literally drags by  half the time im just sitting and literally existing   got told i was quiet/boring/had no presence so often in high school well drugs helped solve that   but people only like you for a minute after that   then they start seeing you deteriorate and dont really wanna fw you   so you think what you did wrong and you cant come to a conclusion the solution in my head is to do more i was enjoyable to be around when fucked up right  so why not get more fucked up itll make me an enjoyable person again i wont be the quiet depressing guy people didnt want to be around  but its like a double edged sword   i start to realize it after people say shit to me they dont really mean it in a harmful way theyre just surprised at how low another human could have fallen and arent filtering their speech its like they care somewhat but only because they havent seen me since i started abusing drugs  whats wrong with your teeth you look like shit lol how tired are you
what are those marks on your arms what are those cuts from why do you never feel good etc  its always a jolting wake up call   sometimes it does actually make me stop for a minute but then i stop and im not as loud or energetic not as uplifting of a person not who people thought i had changed into i can only keep up a facade for so long its extremely taxing   but it was just all the drugs     hell only gets sweeter  drugs bring you friends a plethora of them people who only really want to fuck with you because you can get something they want and thats the only time you will ever hear from them when they need something from you thats the only time you will ever see them when you have drugs to do its the only way you interact  being fucked up   abusers abusing abusers    ive never actually done any sort of thing like this i dont open up to people often i dont want to burden them its easier to help others than help yourself its also mildly wounding when i do provide a ton of support and get none i know a closed mouth doesnt get fed but it takes a toll   i havent felt such a lowness in a really long time   rereading this i feel stupid for writing it   substance abuse isnt the answer i have no shortterm memory almost now i hardly remember beginning this im missing chunks out of each day that i live im not as intelligent as i used to be my teeth are beyond fucked god knows what the fuck is wrong with me internally theres plenty of bad signs ive been ignoring its easier to ignore something and hope it will disappear on its own but it gradually gets worse but you stop noticing as often because you adapt and get used to it
kinda wanna fuck around and take the rest of this molly what more damage can i do to my brain or myself    i fucking hate this i dont know how or why i became this way i know my dad was diagnosed with cancer in 2013 and thats when i started fucking up worse and worse brian im sorry for being your only son and this much of a failure im sorry i dont know what else to type besides im sorry ive fucked up     1058 end of writing  1105 end of posting    im sorry for taking up space

i hate my gf should i leave her
introduce self to girl after class  shes pretty cool  have lunch with her  hang out a bit  find out she has a bf  say fuck it and give up  next day  see her talking to some dude  never seen him around here probably the bf  at the end of the day see her alone with her best friend male  she looks completely miserable  ask whats wrong  dude shakes his head she says nothing and storms out  dude chases after    yeah theres no way that was nothing now how should i go about this should i ask her friend what happened i have him on fb i mean objectively this possibly means shes now available but going about this wrong is fucked up stupid and can ruin everything
  yes
do men like it when a woman knows how to cook and clean and take care of a household is that outdated and unimportant now
every time i ask a girl out i get rejected and i cant figure out why for one girl we were hanging out once or twice a week for 3 weeks we went to movies or cafes or had lunch together and then i ask her if she wants to go on a date but she says she is still stuck on her exboyfriend and then completely stopped talking to me another girl i met at a friends party we slept together three times over two weeks and then i ask if she wants to try dating but she says she just wants to be friends i push her a bit harder and then she stops talking to me another girl we met at a bar talked for a few hours and had dinner together i got her number and ive asked her if she wants to get drinks or something but apparently she works 50 hour weeks and never has time for friends  when are you suppose to be able to get closer to someone i feel completely alone and unloved i can get girls to hang out with me with pretty good consistency almost any night i can go out and meet someone and get a coffee or dinner date with them but then it just fizzles out i invite them out a second time but they say they are busy and then we never talk again how are you actually suppose to start a relationship when everyone keeps you at arms length over the past 2 months ive been rejected by like 10 different girls my friends say i should stop trying to escalate things and let them develop normally but if i never take action and try to invite them somewhere they never ask me to go anywhere i just want to talk to someone is it weird for you to just ring someone and ask them if they want to hang out soon im getting tired of chasing girls everywhere i just want someone who i can chill out with and watch a movie how many times do you have to go out with someone before it becomes appropriate to invite them back to your place to chill  rant over no concrete questions but any advice would be appreciated
  i think you are on to something thanks
  no its always nice to have a partner who knows how to be an adult
  i would assume all men would appreciate you having the skill however there are some who foolishly in my opinion would get pissed if you didnt have an actual job personally i think its a major quality in your favor and the more conservative the man in question the likelier they are to see it in a good light as well    outdated and unimportant  absolutely not for those who are familyoriented youre showing your worth and ability to contribute whereas for the determined individualists you have an edge when it comes to selfsufficiency
what are some things i can do to bluntly speaking make my cooch more desirable for eating clothes body attitude diet anything i already have an innie which seems to be most popular good hygiene taste fairly neutral just a little salty and musky and im a virgin currently volcel but will be looking for a longterm partner starting a few months from now thanks
  personally yes i would like it very much it sadly has become a rare trait among young women i am rather conservative have a good education in a promising field snd want my future wife to be able to take care of our kids
  im a virgin currently volcel but will be looking for a longterm partner starting a few months from now  just keep it that way until you get married and at that point just work it out with your husband hes ultimately the only one who will know for sure what he likes
  all the other girls i know are slobs and cant even boil water still live with parents in their 20s somehow they think they are super catches and that any guy they date should wait on them hand and foot and worship them to me it seems like they arent bringing anything to the table i dont understand how they are always attracting guys to them
  yes
  as little hair on it as youre comfortable with
  anyone i see her tomorrow
  anyone who cant or wont cook or clean should be shot theyre life skills    that said having those skills isnt directly appealing its just something i expect people to have or else be willing and capable of learning
  are they hot if not then its just because they put out easy and guys have lower standards than women dont worry about it
why do girls on tinder always agree to coffee dates then when i text them the night before they pretend like they forgot do they just want attention or to mess with me or something
  rant not over  at what point can you just stop having to put in a tonne of effort in to attracting someone and just be able to cruise and let it develop ive only ever once been able to get to a point where if i want to talk to her i dont feel weird just calling her to have a talk i didnt have to worry about trying to find something exciting to do about planning some reason to see her but now that girl broke up with me and im desperate to get another relationship like that but so far i dont feel like ive even gotten close and ive been going out almost every day trying to meet new people  my ex told me that im putting too much pressure on them and that oneonone hanging out wont help me get a girlfriend she told me to try hanging out in groups so the girl feels more comfortable  but it isnt weird to introduce a girl who you dont know each other that well to your friends and i dont have many friends to start with and i tend to hang out with them oneonone anyway because they dont have anything in common with each other ive recently met this new girl at a bar we went rock climbing together and had a nice day on the weekend we made plans to go karaoke together next weekend i dont know what to do after that because generally after the second or third time hanging out with someone i run out of ideas of things we can do so i just ask if they want to go on a date and get dinner or something and then stop talking to me how do i proceed this time to avoid this situation
  thank you i still work too i dont expect a man to have to support me i just really dont understand the other girls i know they get guys all the time but they dont seem to bring anything to the relationship at least to my eyes they dont know how to cook or clean or even provide for themselves and even more then that they expect soooo much from the guy i just dont get why guys are going after them and cant get a bf im not ugly or anything
basically ive been having this urge lately to try and reach out to my not ex basically were in an unofficial relationship     she ghosted me in may and really ive been fine since no real thoughts but for some reason i had them pop up like 23 weeks ago    i dont know maybe i should try cant hurt but probably wont do a thing       fwiw she was the one who asked me out originally and made advances but i never responded so thats why i feel she jumped ship
whats a preferrable personality either gender idc    a childish loudmouthed puntier jokes self deprecating speaks their mind without much hesitation gets overly excited about seemingly nothing and at random doesnt care if theyre being offensive  or  b mostly silent private replies when crucial and after thinking/looking up facts down to earth    i am a but i want to change into b i hate myself but i guess im desperate to be lazy and stick to a by asking for reinforcement here
to girls    do you like it if a dude finds your feet to be attractive
  im fairly pretty 5 100 lbs blond hair blue eyes nice face my boobs are really small and my teeth are kind of uneven but im not ugly i am not easy ive only been with one guy and i felt like it was stupid
to the girls    is there a reason that some of you are so cunty to people in public who are trying to avoid interacting with you past a hello or a nod i seem to get fucked with and laughed at a lot and was wondering about this
  i would say degenerates like you belong on a cross but that would release you from your pitiful foot fetishising existence then again not even disgusting footfags deserve to be condemned to live a horrible life as a being so pathetic that its literally aroused at the thought of liking someones heels
  can you post your feet pls
  didnt you post last night  she ghosted you because she wants nothing to do with you sadly   move on
  thank you i still work too i dont expect a man to have to support me  im just saying it broadly since many dont think like me its not wrong to expect a man to have his finances in order for you to want a relationship so long as you dont want him because of his money     they get guys all the time but they dont seem to bring anything to the relationship  dont compare yourself to othersits going to be a frivolity at best and when youre surrounded by toxic or selfdestructive people youre only doing yourself a disservice as a rule use your past self as a basis of comparison to see if youve improved yourself id also be willing to bet that the guys who chase these kinds of girls arent any more capable themselves so they wouldnt recognize your abilities in comparison     you sound excellent by comparison and im certain there is a guy near you who would think the same       selfdeprecation is something that works to get a laugh but the word is that its a red zone with women
  theres definitely quite a few guys that would be into you just pick one you like and ask him out or dont if you dont want to
for both     opinion on dating a single mom/dad     this girl im crushing on has two kids and i cant help it
  opinion on dating a single mom/dad  dont
  ive seen this before and i think i know exactly whats going on she was talking to that guy about nunya nunya fucking business  holy shit dude you are a creepy one
anyone else kinda hate sex even though theyre not asexual like i jerk off im attracted to girls romantically and physically but the actual reality of sex is just gross   no i dont watch porn maybe thats the problem
  this board will shit on you fir doing that but if you like her and you understand that someday youll have to raise those kids as your own do it but know that youre jumping into a lot of responsibility especially with 2 kids
my partner has been wanting some space lately weve been talking but not calling or seeing each other just texting mostly shes still upset with me over something i did but were talking everyday im just waiting for her to say when she feels up to calling and seeing me shes been depressed lately and not feeling it    to that end we havent had sex in 3 weeks and im really feeling that would it be wrong to request some nsfw content from her i worry it might piss her off
  you will never ever be the most important person in her life really truely ask yourself are you ok with that
  my first reply and its a useless post from a retard who filled in the gaps with his own retarded conclusions me and her guy friend walked in at the same time for clarity reread the post i did nothing creepy or wrong
  male here  i am b  this is not a preferable personality for a guy at all i am extremely lonely
am i fucked in terms of attraction if i have a young sounding voice its not comically high pitched its more like a 16 year old shonen protagonist type voice
  i dont know what that chinese cartoon word means and it depends on how many x chromosomes you have
  not true my cousin hates his kid and wishes it didnt exist he would chose his wife over the kid im sure of it his kid is 14 and a complete shit just like its junky mother he has told me having it was the biggest mistake of his life wasnt like that when the kid was little obviously but at this point the kid has been such a nightmare for him i can see why hed feel the way he does
  okay lets break it down   hang out with girl  find out she has a boyfriend  see her upset about something which could be a whole range of things all of which are none of your business  ask her friends if this means shes single  dude i dont know what to tell you either english isnt your first language and that entire situation went differently than you typed it out or youre just some creepy dude following some girl on the sidelines to see of shed be down to fuck
  bump
  no thats not what happened maybe i typed it out poorly in haste lets start over  introduce self to girl  hang out with her and get lunch  find out from another friend shes got a bf  damn oh well guess that doors closed  two days later heading to lunch  see her talking with some dude  never seen him in my life probably the bf  leave them alone and go eat  later see her looking completely miserable  me and her best guy friend are leaving at the same time so walk up to her at the same time  shes always happy as fuck so i see her like this and ask whats wrong  she says nothing gathers her things and leaves  guy friend chases after her  piece together a sudden 180 in demeanor coupled with the appearance of someone ive never seen here before must be related    is this better explained ill probably see her tomorrow and im wondering what i should do
due to unfortunate circumstances i am sexually stunted ans therefore behind on the learning curve with girlies despite being desirable to them how do i learn what i need to trying to just flail around on my own only results in me repeating the same mistakes over and over again and gets me nowhere
women of the online dating world    should i put that im looking for a serious relationship on my online dating profiles or is it tacky for a man to do so its the truth i wouldnt be lying and using it to get matches
how long until i should start worrying about being ghosted
  stay away from salty and fatty foods and dairy drink fruit juice and eat apples and pineapple as snacks
  have you ever fucked someone youre truly attracted to and/or have feelings for sex is pretty fucking gross when you break it down but corny as it is its great when its with someone special
  if you come out the gate asking for nudes its basically saying hey your emotional need for space is really blueing my balls put your feelings aside for a minute and unblue them priorities babe  tell her you miss her first and see how she responds if its safe to proceed work up to it tell her you miss waking up together feeling her warm body around you etc make her feel wanted and turn it into a mutual act of affection rather than a help a guy out wouldya  that said i dont like your odds if shes depressed and not feeling it she probably doesnt feel very sexy and sending pics is a pretty selfconscious endeavour
  its more like a 16 year old shonen protagonist type voice  well would a 16 year old shonen protagonist type give up when the chips are down no hed grit his teeth and go beyond pluuuuus ultra
  how long have you been together
do guys have fatherly instincts like women have motherly instincts like if they see themselves in someone younger even if they dont have kids themselves and dont want kids could that possibly cause them to want to take care of and look out for that younger person     so context behind this one of my superiors a super cool guy whos like 15 years older and in a long term relationship of like 2 years tends to treat me like a daughter hes always making sure i get home safely that im fed and sharing his interests and hobbies with me its like hes taken me under his wing and the one time i was feeling really down and out of character he seemed seriously concerned about me kept making jokes to cheer me up etc   ive come to the conclusion that he probably sees me like a daughter based on the way he treats me but hes expressed 0 desire to ever have kids or get married do guys like this still get that parentalish instinct when they bond with someone younger
why are men so threatened about women being their equal they fight it tooth and nail do guys know deep down women are superior because we have more control we arent ruled by sex but love and love is definitely a high more noble pursuit
  dont just leave me here to rot now
what do you think of guys with voices like this     
  who have you come across in real life that isnt old three days older than fire that actually says shit like psshh women ha so inferior to men in every possible way because ive met none
  you cant even open a jar lol
    oh fuck she literally says nothing not said nothing
  yeah we use our brains saving energy and run it under hot water or indent it not difficult dumdum
  sorry but your grammar is horrendous i cant even make out what youre attempting to convey
  what did the kid do dads is probably just a fucking shit parent
  in real life have you ever met a man who has proclaimed that women are inferior to men in every way i know i havent no man that ive ever talked to face to face has told me that me and every other woman on the planet are completely inferior to men     is that better princess
male  straight  have more female friends than male friends   have disdain for most males in general  why am i like this i feel like this is a red flag for something but i cant figure out what
  grow up with a lot of sisters or something
  no sisters 2 brothers raised by a single father
good icebreakers for a man approaching a woman
  men are too cowardly to proclaim they think women are inferior but they show it in their approach to life and their responses to women     examples donald trump julian assange vladimir putin
  yes not wanting kids has nothing to do with natural protective instincts that might cause you to look after someone less experienced or say save some random child from wandering into traffic
  sweet so that explains his behavior towards me thank you
  its not so much they are afraid of women being there equal its more that they are afraid of being not suitable enough for the women because deep down a woman will generally always expect to date up    eg   an executive man will have no issues dating a female receptionist but a female executive would most likely never consider dating the male receptionist     or a male doctor will have no issues dating and marrying a female doctor but a female doctor would most likely never even give a male nurse the time of day     or a salary man with a stay at home wife is fine but a salary woman with a stay at home husband is seen as a deadbeat who they should leave cos they can do better    kind of get my drift women kind of want to have it all without trading anything off if women want higher positions in life they should be open to taking what comes along with it ie long work hours and missing out on family and being open to dating down since the position the modern day woman is in are the same ones that once were mens    reality is female doctors would prefer to date other male doctors or more senior doctors and female executives would prefer to dated other executives of higher positions this leaving a lot of dudes out of the loop or clawing for positions which have now become even more scarce and hard to reach just to get those life milestones that are expected    ive even seen it in my office where when we needed a new receptionist a lot of my female coworkers were talking about how weird it would be if the receptionist was male so even then women pretty much have a monopoly on office admin entry level jobs
  women are inferior at almost all of the things that matter to men
  men are inferior at almost all of the things that matter to women
  such as im not that guy and im not arguing im legitimately curious
  im gonna give you a noogie and theres nothing you can do about it
  how do you cope with the lack of funny in your life if you only hang out with girls
whats less attractive a woman who seems smart but plays dumb or one that seems to act smarter than she actually is
  i dont mean to make this sound like a boast but im nearly universally the funniest one in the group some of them are actually funnier than women get credit for though i think a lot of the time men and women interpret each others humor in different ways ive noticed men tend to be better at telling jokes in the traditional sense and women tend to be better at observational comedy i also enjoy gossiping i feel like many men also do but lie about it    smart girl playing dumb girl trying to be smart
      whatever time for bed thanks /adv/
  definitely the latter nothing personally pisses me off more than condescension
ex bf will contact me through random accounts online  but if i send him a text it will go unread for a couple months then he will read it and not reply  i think he wants to talk to me or see how i am doing discreetly but is afraid to admit to it    how should i manage  i am tempted to confront him but i feel he wont reply and nothing will be answered but i also dont like him doing this without being honest about it because it confuses me and i also dont want to accuse or attack him either i just want transparency
  a lot of girls say humorous things that i think are clever or make me go hah  but all in all i have 1/4th of the fun i have when im around my female friends as opposed to male friends only really talk to them when my niggas arent around    its also in the delivery too sometimes a friend can say something that wouldnt be funny if anyone else said it but because its that dude saying it it is
  both would piss me off
  of course but since were less agreeable we just really dont care about the things you value
    so a smart woman acting dumb around you would be a positive thing or would it just be the less annoying thing
  less annoying neither is positive
girl uses tinder  take her out to eat pay for her food  we have a good time   text her the day after about doing it again and saying i liked getting to know her   she says dont get the wrong idea im just here for friends i have a bf    do girls normally pull this she had to have been aware of what she was doing right
  couple of possibilities come to mind in order of most to least likely    1 shes just rejecting you went out with you and decided shes not interested used the bf excuse because theres no getting around it even for pushy types of guys  2 shes doing it for free food   3 shes telling the truth just wants to meet friends
  i only have 2 male friends that i would consider close friends one of them is pretty quiet in person and sends me memes like pic related pretty regularly the other friend is pretty close to what people imagine when they see an npc meme he plays fortnite watches twitch uses edgy unfunny memes and listens to radio pop exclusively i always feel on edge around him like were going to argue about some dumb shit i never get stressed like that around female friends and i feel like the humor is more natural with them note that i realise that these examples arent representative of any bigger trends in the way men or women act but are my personal experiences that are likely different from others what i dont understand is why i inherently dislike most other men in general
  forgot pic friend one sent this earlier he also sent some good videos of arabs having accidents while firing aks into the sky
my gfs mom inviting me to christmas dinner what to get as a gift her family doesnt drink
  what to get as a gift her family doesnt drink  a carton of cigarettes
  alright would a woman being unabashedly smarter than you be a positive then
  not him but no i want a woman on my level or slightly more stupid
  what makes smarter women threatening
  imagine telling lies on the internet  i am exceedingly smart and i can honestly say ive never met a woman in my own age range who could better me but it also doesnt bother me insofar as ive never really found much to be out of my grasp for understanding so if you were really more intelligent than me that would just mean there was plenty to learn     my last gf was in my ballpark for intelligence and we clicked fantastically
  well im insecure so i dont like people being better than me at things
  can you cook you could offer to bring a dish
  women in general want to date up if youre not better than her then she is liable to look elsewhere for someone who is its not always the case of course but its obvious why people would feel uncomfortable with itand this goes for women as well as men
  i am exceedingly smart and i can honestly say ive never met a woman in my own age range who could better me  what field are you in i feel that should be very unlikely unless you limit the people you meet to generally lesserdeveloped areas of study  good to know it doesnt bother everyone at least      but being smarter doesnt make anyone better and there are lots of ways to measure it im worried that my new coworker that im interested in thinks this way and would be intimidated by my degree/experience how can i downplay the difference if playing dumb would be a negative
found out my boyfriend has been going out on dinner dates with another girl regularly i confronted him and he claims shes just a friend and that she always pays for him so its not a date but if thats true why was he keeping all the time theyve been spending together a secret from me
  i work in advertising/marketing statistically speaking its a field where the upper levels are populated by hugely intelligent creative types but that doesnt really apply unless you work at a firm in internal marketing teams your average office worker thing applies  theyre usually a little above average but not significantly intelligent
  i dont mean better in the sense of worth i only mean better in terms of intelligence   i believe youve already asked about this a while back and if so the answer hasnt changedfaking who you are is going to make yourself miserable and do him a disservice yielding the same result that would have happened otherwise except with more anguish and wasted time   you cant downplay a core aspect of yourself
  because he knew youd blow up about it and create a relationship problem by trying to stop him from seeing his friend who he wants to see without having to fight you over it
  i feel that should be very unlikely  i should clarify too that they tested my iq when i was 17 and i got 143 i am 98th percentile so strictly speaking meeting someone on my level would literally be highly unlikely    hurr durr iq
  this best sex i ever had girl wasnt even that beautiful i mean she was to me but her body wasnt the best she has fat rolls and stretch marks and areas that were sagging but i fucking loved her and had for years and the connection between us was intense it was miles better than all the times ive fucked some thot with a good body
  the mutual friend who told me about it said that shes also seen them holding hands and saw her leaving his apartment once but i dont really want to believe that
  great idea anon thank you
  thats interesting ive never met someone who was a part of that sort of work but it certainly sounds like it requires a lot of thought    i feel there are many types of intelligence for example my social intelligence is awful the idea is that i dont want my title and diploma to dissuade him we have a bit in common otherwise and i want to make that the focus and i had thought that downplaying our differences would help with that  i havent asked this before but the thought that im not alone in worrying about it is nice to hear
  honestly anon the more you worry about it the more it will bother him smart as i am and for all the fact that im only attracted to smart women if youre smarter than me and i catch you worrying about it too much its going to read on my end like you have a problem with me being less intelligent in which case what hitler said above applies where id feel like you were going to ditch me at your first chance to date up in intelligence
  143  98th percentile  more than that youre firmly within the 99th in almost any western country      many types of intelligence  this is what people tell themselves to take the edge off of pronouncing one person better than another in something you can play around with definitions all you want and of course say a physicist will be less likely to know how to replace a carburetor than the backwoods mechanic but the capacity to absorb and manipulate information is something separate    the only thing you can do is avoid flaunting your intellect while still being open about who you are no matter how hard you try to conceal things hell find out eventually and at that point its really just a question of how he takes itif he is one to take it poorly there isnt anything you can do so spare yourself the trouble and talk to him
should i spend 20k getting a tummy tuck and arm lift i lost over 100lbs but now i have folds of loose skin and sometimes i think it looks worse than when i was a landwhale
  worrying is my default reaction to everything nowadays so what should i do just act aloof about everything and hope    this is what people tell themselves to take the edge off of pronouncing one person better than another in something  true hes proficient with his work but id be lying if i said he was one of our brightest i might be biased but i think he has room to improve though  the only thing you can do is avoid flaunting your intellect  right now he has to go through me to do anything at work i have no idea if he would take it as flaunting or not but i cant help but feel like correcting him often is not improving my chances of getting closer to him for now ive been trying to downplay any mistakes by saying things like even i still have trouble catching that
  do guys have fatherly instincts like women have motherly instincts    yes you can get a certain amount of protectiveness towards certain individuals especially if theyre significant age or maturity gap i definitely have a few female friends where i just see them like cute fluffy kittens i just want to hug and take care of    that begins said that is not always mutually exclusive with sexual attraction im not saying that its guaranteed dirty thoughts are involved whatsoever it thats just kind of the nature of cross gendered relationships sometimes passing thoughts occur to varying degrees are more or less natural    whats less attractive a woman who seems smart but plays dumb or one that seems to act smarter than she actually is    thats a bit loaded in the phrasing pretentiousness is basically never attractive but being too low key also makes you hard to be noticed i would rather have a frank and confidently spoken individual who is honest about both what they are informed about and what they are ignorant about than either of those bonus points if they are open minded about learning beyond that      found out my boyfriend has been going out on dinner dates with another girl regularly    as a dude who has several female friends including a female best friend if hes keeping you in the dark about this shit thats probably a serious red fucking flag     i mean i dont clue in my girlfriend to most of the things i do when im not around her ie hanging out with friends female or not but i also definitely dont go out of my way to avoid mentioning them    thats kinda sketch as fuck
  well worrying about it isnt solving anything if hes really that far below you then all you can do is lean on charm to make yourself interesting to him and hope that he doesnt have a problem with the disparity
  she used to look like a bird
  thats kinda sketch as fuck    yeah and he wasnt just avoiding telling me but actively lying about where he was when he was actually with her
  youre overthinking thisif anything your job is actually much easier now that youve told me this since he already knows about your position and ability you dont have to tiptoe around it anymore you can get straight to asking him out or advancing things some other way hes pretty much made up his mind on how he sees you already all you have to do is find out what that is    i also understand the instinct to downplay the correction it seems like common sense for any kind of management position
ill try my best to stop worrying as much    lean on charm to make yourself interesting to him  ive been trying but im awful at that sort of thing    hes pretty much made up his mind on how he sees you already  its only been a couple weeks do you really think so  all you have to do is find out what that is  easier said than done
    online dating  serious relationship    choose one    cases where this applies are way fucking rare at my age 20
  anyone
girls    there is a girl whos sat next to me in class for the past few months we would sometimes briefly chat about class well the other day i was walking to my car and i noticed she was right next to me so i started to just chat with her like normal but she totally dropped her spaghetti and i have no idea why i wasnt flirting
  having a conversation out of my element is uncomfortable i assume its the same for everyone
do girls find it hot if a guy can suck his own dickif so how do i bring it up in casual conversation
  she was the one walking right next to me tho i didnt go out of my way to talk to her
girls    is being a train conductor the guy who drives a train a sexy job
everyone    do you like being the gender you are male/female dont reply if youre a nut kthxs or would you prefer to be the other what are some things that appeal to you about the other and what about things that appeal to yours based off any dimension might be physical social cultural or whatever
23m here with a question for femanons   a girl 19f has left me telling she respects my character traits and got together with me because she thought she could develop feelings for me literally said i would be a perfect partner as time went on but it hasnt happened and she was afraid of hurting me if she stayed with me she reassured me that i could easily find a better partner than her but im hella in love with her and not very social otherwise so itd be a long struggle  she has a bit of a troubled psyche and some complexes over her being relatively uncultured i come from a background of and my social circles are full of creative writerdirectoractor type people while she comes form a small town in the middle of nowhere compared to me but is otherwise a very sweet girl shes kind at heart and has really helped me out of a yearslong rut emotionally while we were together about 2 months i love her and even though i respect her choice to leave me and havent bothered her since the breakup i cant help but feel that she was too hasty in her decision its very disrespectful of me and i realize it will probably pass if i give it more time but i want her back  one of the things she said expressly is that we shouldnt meet anymore she hasnt texted me since and neither have i i havent been stalking her on social networks or talking to her friends at all so i dont know whats going on in her life at the moment  in about a weeks time theres an event coming up to which i have 2 vip frontrow tickets and im debating inviting her out with me im going to the event regardless of the answer and i a friend of mine i could invite instead the idea that im mulling over right now is to use it as a bit of a test of her feelings so to speak  if she was confident in her decision she would reject the invitation and i would then know for sure that i need to move on and if she didnt  then i could try getting together with her again    cont
  didnt say she didnt want to talk to you just that maybe its not easy for her to talk outside of a place youre forced to interact with people like a classroom
  i suppose it was really uncomfortable the way she acted
  no its gross      not really
  cont    the breakup was very abrupt and i had no chance to talk to her about it at all when she delivered the news i was dumbfounded and she left very quickly not giving me a chance to discuss it or get any closure for myself so its left me with a hell of a lot more questions than answers  ive been mentally preparing myself to simply let go of her and let her find her own happiness ever since the breakup and i really wish the best for her but this uncertainty of what the hell is actually going on is eating at me and i want to be 100 sure even though the signs kinda point that i should be sure that the breakup is final already     the question is  would that be an appropriate way to go about this
  im fine with my gender i wouldnt mind being a guy for a day just for the sake of experiencing something new though
  women just think sucking your own dick is gross because if we could all do it no one would put up with their bullshit anymore
    i love trains   so sexy  im not normal though
  not really   why how is a pilot and a train conductor that different    what type of trains
i cant take this life of loneliness anymore but i have no idea how to change it    25  never had a gf  only 511  glasses  pale  receding hairline  fucked teeth  skinnyfat  no jaw or chin to speak of  dont earn much money    theres nothing i want more in the world than a relationship but its looking less and less likely i get no matches on tinder nobody ever replies on other stuff    ill just never be good enough for a woman
  i used to be really curious about being a guy on a physical level desu i thought i was trans for a while turns out i just really wanted the d now i have the d and zero interest in knowing what its like to be male im content to just straddle my guy and use his d as a joystick i love exploring my feminine side and embracing his masculinity my thoughts on gender roles are turning right around now that ive found i can have male energy around me without having to be the source of it indeed it seems no man or woman is an island
  bro stay away from tinder that will only make things worse tinder is honestly terrible for mens mental health     you should focus on rebuilding yourself for the next 2 years start exercising regularly start working your way up in your career when youre 27 youll be in a much better place to meet women
    im a guy but i suppose i do wonder sometimes what the female orgasm feels like my gf will orgasm many times when we have sex and they are so strong her entire body will tremble and spasm ive never ever had anything even close to that
    second this do not use tinder unless you are chad/woman how do i know if i am chad/woman  if you have to ask you are not    also dont bother with gym its a meme just focus on money thats what girls care about
  as a bit of a followup my intent is to extend this invitation informally over text without implying getting back together   if she agrees to go i plan to flirt a bit in the little ways we used to before the breakup to probe if she is still interested im also pretty sure i wont be able to hold back the dumb idiot smile that i have involuntarily gotten every time i saw her beforehand so im confident shed get the idea of what i want and be able to signal whether shed be okay with it or not and if so ill ask her about it outright after the event
  just to chime in its great you can do those things i am just crashing and burning out of a long relationship because she did not do any of those things or have much of a job i loved her but it was not sustainable for one person me to do everything so yeah those others will explode youll have staying power
is it good idea to meet my female friends friends on a party she may introduce me to one of her pretty friends who is slightly older than me i am kv and awkward when meeting few new people at the same time
  the idea of only having one kind of orgasm on top having to wait between them blows
  a i had an a in my life and that personality is great as long as you can match it with your excitement childishness etc
  gym is a meme  no its not retard the gym would be for him not for girls if he is healthier he will feel better about himself which will make him feel more secure and confident in his life
    a train is a train  i mean the guy has to be good looking and have a good personality but its just a bonus especially if i could ride up front once or twice despite that being illegal i guess
  are you a girl explain what your orgasms feels like    make orgasms suck the feeling from the orgasm itself lasts like 1 2 3 done then i just feel really tired sex almost doesnt seem worth it the work required is not worth the reward i really only have sex because it makes my gf happy
  but why are pilots considered the sexiest profession how are train conductors different
    clitorial orgasms are like that because the penis is a male clitorus a vaginal orgasm is a whole body experience if you have one you cannot not make any noise
    its so weird that men are culturally painted as being the sexobsessed ones when women are the ones who actually have the greatest potential for sexual pleasure so sad for the women of the past who didnt know sex could be anything but something you need to put up with in order to pop out babies
  gym is a meme in all regards
      i am starting to get convinced that tinder is pointless unless youre a megachad i might chadfish and waste some womens time sending them on fake dates desu
  why cant you make noise    the reason its like that is its a biological instinct for men to want to procreate with as many women as possible but the male orgasm itself is way overhyped the orgasm really only lasts like 3 seconds and then its just done over condoms make it even worse sometimes ill have sex with my gf shell cum like 4 times all really intense orgasm and im not even able to cum at all because of them condom and now my entire body is exhausted and i didnt even orgasm
  thats what people say when they feel defeated if you ever put effort into lighting some weight gaining confidence while improving your health you would understand that the mental benefits alone are worth the effort mind and body connection is important you sound like a quitter type personality never to late to change
  had this conversation with an ex and from what we figured out it seems like pretty much the same feeling at least when it comes to clitoral orgams its a huge buildup to an even bigger release that kind of ebbs away pretty quick really easy to get to solo like  says  vaginal orgams are completely different and its hard to describe the only way i can put it is like deep pressure being worked out almost painfully good like if my whole pelvis was like a bruise and someone was massaging it from the inside out i cant have them alone though so it might be more than physical for me
  that sounds fun desu chadfish the sluttiest of sluts    but yes for normal guys tinder is terrible it will mess you up i highly recommend you avoid it
  true that exercise really really helps to improve your mood and confidence for me personally it even helped clean up my mental prowess as well  i felt a lot sharper and more dextrous with my thought processes if that makes any sense things just came to mind faster and more naturally after exercise
  i recommend making a fake account with a regular girl 46 range just use some random girl off facebook select 3/4 photos that look appropriate for tinder but dont bother with a bio or feel free to do the usual girl bio of love wine travel dogs banter etc dont swipe everyone or youll tip the algo but observe just how many fucking messages you get as a plain jane now thinking about how on earth you as the looksmatch average joe are going to get anywhere in that sea of noise    optionally make a chad account and see how easy it is to get responses but i think the girl account demonstrates all you need to know    do not use tinder unless you are chad/woman
    its double negative im my experience i could not suppress any noise having one so cannot not make noise meaning youre gonna make some noise because its such a sensation
  ive had 3 runs at the gym each more successful than the last in terms of gains and about a year and a half long each with year breaks in between it doesnt make you feel better just tired muh eat more i did 5000 calories nigger no change in my personality or how other people most pertinently women treated me    why would picking up bits of metal make you more confident not that that word means anything concrete anyway why bother revolving your whole schedule around eating resting lifting and then going through the misery of the actual activity for no benefit at all    you want mind and body connection go and follow the middle way or some other ascetic mysticism gym is a meme
  oh ok interesting
  agreed that is the benefit of exercise you have to put the effort out to understand the benefits a gym isnt even needed anyone can hang a 50lb punching bag at the house or outside go 3 rounds 5 mins a round most wont be able to keep the pace at first with a bit of determination and sweat i can guarantee it can be done its a mental and physical challenge when conquered gives confidence that will spill into all positive effects of your life you get what you give  if people would just give in to the possibility of it there would be a few more happy people i would bet on that
  first off im not one that would advocate a diet or weight loss bs i look at it this way you have to change your lifestyle people are willing to do that what they are not willing to do is exactly what you wrote you were defeated before you even started your problem is you bro your attitude is all fucked up tell me im wrong
  defeated before i even started rofl care to elaborate i told you i got the physical improvements but it doesnt change your mindset like meditation does maybe if youre a cavemen you get a constant rod from big muscles guess thats what you mean  tell me im wrong
  both are a hard pass for me
      anyone frankly i figure that its probably the most harmless way i could go about the matter but id still like some input on whether there is a way to do it better or if i should simply drop it and move on
  reiterating from this thread     i know /adv/ is sfw board but today its sunday so the offices are closed    i am having difficulty penetrating my girlfriend we are having this trouble since last few weeks i am a virgin and she has supposedly had sex once with a midget which she describes as very painful and wasnt a good experience     so my question is is it possible that her hymen is still intact after that one incident that it is not letting me go inside   i have a weird condition of tight foreskin that it goes down only like 1/3rd of the head so sex without a condom feels painful  i have tried pushing it hard inside getting her really really wet and adding more lube but girth of my penis already seems to big to go inside her vagina  what do any anons with experience here   also am i still a virgin even after the above described sexual experience
  explain what your orgasms feels like  the image that always comes to my mind is a water balloon being fulled up until it ruptures   or for a more descriptive if violent analogy its like sitting a the bottom of a deep pool contentedly holding your breath like when youre a kid trying to see how hardcore you are but then the pressure builds you keep holding on maybe letting a little air out to release some pressure a little more a little more eventually theres nothing left to let out but the pressure keeps building you still hold on until the very last minute until you cant take one second longer you need air right now and start to swim up but then you realise just how deep down you are you rise and rise and wonder if youre ever going to reach the top if you left it too late then suddenly you burst through the waters surface and without you having any say in it your bodys immediately taking in long loud ragged breaths slowly you calm down and lie back equal parts relieved and exhausted   unless you get multiples which is like reaching the top only to be dunked over and over holding you in that hyperventilative state for longer than you thought possible but eventually youre going to get weaker and youll either stop drowning or stop breathing    just swap out the pain of your lungs caving in on themselves with immense pleasure and replace dying with losing the spot thats getting you there or becoming completely spent from too many multiples psa drowning is not fun even if youre a girl i am not liable for any drowned girlfriends that result as a consequence of this post
  i know /adv/ is sfw board but today its sunday so the offices are closed  that only applies to images post all the filthy text you like
  ok youre wrong you cant see what im saying because you dont want to plain and simple you get defensive when im telling you the truth if you go to work out and say and think its useless then it will be fuckin useless because you decided before you even started that it was sorry you seem to think you know it all figured out guy good for you enjoy your would of ignorance
  its like sitting a the bottom of a deep pool contentedly holding your breath like when youre a kid trying to see how hardcore you are but then the pressure builds you keep holding on maybe letting a little air out to release some pressure a little more a little more eventually theres nothing left to let out but the pressure keeps building you still hold on until the very last minute until you cant take one second longer you need air right now and start to swim up but then you realise just how deep down you are you rise and rise and wonder if youre ever going to reach the top if you left it too late then suddenly you burst through the waters surface and without you having any say in it your bodys immediately taking in long loud ragged breaths slowly you calm down and lie back equal parts relieved and exhausted   unless you get multiples which is like reaching the top only to be dunked over and over holding you in that hyperventilative state for longer than you thought possible but eventually youre going to get weaker and youll either stop drowning or stop breathing  just swap out the pain of your lungs caving in on themselves with immense pleasure and replace dying with losing the spot thats getting you there or becoming completely spent from too many multiples    wwew
   do x and y will happen   i did x and y didnt happen   you must have done x wrong   can you explain   uhh you arent listening to me so no i wont    retard spend some more time in the library and less in the gym maybe
  why do you feel so  youre not a cringy manchild with no self control like me      youd date a 10 year old in a 25 year olds body
  lrn2read brainlet its right there in the fucking post ye  if you go to work out and say and think its useless then it will be fuckin useless because you decided before you even started that it was
  youd date a 10 year old in a 25 year olds body  as long as they are not 10 all day every day ie can go to work handle life etc     we played on swings at the park before taking a walk and talking about life went to the arcade and played those silly games got silly plastic crap prizes but it was absolutely the best times of my life
  a sounds like youre describing my boyfriend almost exactly so
  youd date a 10 year old in a 25 year olds body    oh and we were both 30 doing those childish things fucking amazing
  why do you feel so  being quiet with too much self control is not a good thing i barely talk about myself at all with family members and close friends and i feel like nobody knows me it puts a lot of distance between yourself and everyone else and is very isolating
since were on the topic of vivid descriptions of sex what does the full feeling feel like  and before anyone yells at me i know this has little to nothing to do with dick size im legit just wondering
so this is a bit of a weird one but bear with me    match with girl on tinder  her bio says that she needs a partner for her cam show in all caps  says to dm her im interested on insta  look her up she is a legit camwhore smoking hot  say fuck it wont happen anyway and dm her  she actually writes back inquiring where i am situated    what should i do i wanna bang a hot camwhore but i am not quite sure what i am getting myself into here
  go do it man and post link before it starts
i asked girl out we know each other for a couple of years via facebook and she replied i dont know     does that means  no 
  duh    people who want to do things actively try to make them happen
  i love being a male we get all of the upsides with little to no downsides  things that appeal to you about the other  well i guess beauty  i feel confident in my skin and can look a little handsome if i put in the effort but feminine beauty is different i guess it must feel really nice to have that graceful beauty i wouldnt trade being a man off for that though  also like the other anon said female genitalia is really intrguing other than orgasms i especially wonder whether id feel air or water in there if i instantly became a woman from what i gathered women dont feel it but i wonder if it could be like our eyes not seeing our nose because the body is so used to the stimuli
  the vag doesnt hang open its just soft enough to conform to whatevers put inside it like close your mouth lips then stick your tongue out thats basically what sex is the dick isnt going into a dickshaped hole its pushing apart the walls of a closedup hole and when your lips are closed without your tongue sticking out you dont feel air or anything because theyre pressed together and protecting your mouth from the elements
im clingy and its an issue im into this girl and im going to ask her out shes really busy this weekend and im telling myself not to text her because i just dont need to if i had the opportunity id text her all day obviously not everyone goes for that     i cant really get her off my mind im not even super into her i know i need to be careful because ive scared girls in the past away
i think i have made a mistake and come on too strongly with a coworker and ruined everything  i really like her and since im planning on leaving our job in two weeks i planned on asking her out on a date on my final day however several friends of mine made me think i accidentally did this earlier than i wanted to since i texted her asking if shed like to go to an art exhibit together in a week or so ive done stuff like this in a platonic way before so i didnt see it like that at all but talking to my friends made me very paranoid/anxious and then later ecstatic when she responded with yes a bit later in our conversation she also said something to the effect of i dont know what were going to do when you leave sad emoji and i took this to be an amazing sign since i was still looking at things from the perspective of her thinking i had asked her on a date so in my response i included well just because im leaving doesnt mean we have to stop seeing each other haha and got no response  i blew it my friends were wrong she didnt see it as a date request at all and using the phrase seeing each other instead of hanging out or w/e was way too forward wasnt it is there anyway to salvage this seeing her tomorrow is going to be so awkward why didnt i just wait 2 more weeks ughhh
why cant i make friends online   i mean i can start conversations and find people just fine  but ill talk to a person for a day and then just stop   its not even that they were uninteresting or anything i just stop interacting with anyone online for no reason   in a way i kind of forget they are there sort of like in person i have this being that i can make sense of but online feels different
  sounds like a nice opportunity desu  worst thing that can happen is she realises youre a little bit of a lovestriken fool cant fault you for that desu
  i am now realizing that seeing each other sounds like i think we are already dating oh my god why didnt i say literally anything else
  i cant really get her off my mind im not even super into her  i know this feel really well right now  just gotta occupy yourself the moment you relapse relapse in this case being not doing something productive your mind will wander and you will become sad or anxious    one thing that helps me especially is loud music so loud i cant think i just listen and dont have the space in my mind to worry about her
    whatever you do dont backtrack  just ignore it and go on the date and move on
  yeah ive been fighting the urge to send some pathetic text where i walk back my words all weekend i dont know why i even feel like that would make things better to begin with
  oh shes smart she definitely knows that already its just the fact that shes already broken it off once and well im feeling uneasy going against that decision of hers guess i cant be blamed for that either though  thanks for your input regardless cheers
  wants to meet friends that will pay for her dinner jesus christ men are pathetic
  because its natural to want to fix something you messed up  women are the only situation where fixing something you messed up is wrong  maybe someone else itt can help explain how to get out of the friendzone i am probably ending up in a similar spot a coworker except she started coming onto me and now were pretty close wants to hang out this afternoon at the work christmas party great except she has a ldr boyfriend    i dont think the friendzone if thats where you and i are going to end up is the end my thought process is that if you are to be compatible long term you need to be friends in the first place and over time feelings can deepen but maybe im wrong hopefully someone can explain
  seeing each other means dating  the absolute state of the english language im so glad i dont have to deal with that bullcrap
  name a better language ill wait
  russian
  nope english is better
  no its not
  yes it is tho
  spoilerfrench/spoiler
  안국어

  nah mayne english aint shit compared to russian
  nuh uhh
  u wanna say that to my face huh
  do you like being the gender you are  yee  or would you prefer to be the other   not really boobs might be fun for a while but i imagine the novelty would wear off pretty quick  what are some things that appeal to you about the other  girl soft and squishy also look pretty grug like looking at squishy pretty people  on a more serious note im really jealous that girls are allowed to like kids it really sucks the way everything you do around children is scrutinized way more as a dude im also not a fan of how im pretty much assumed to have bad intentions in every interaction with a woman until i convince her im not a rapist  itd also be nice to not have to always be the one that has to do the asking out im not a mind reader  actually im just gonna go full incel here and say that in terms of cultural stuff girls have the advantage on all fronts in the sense that its unacceptable to discriminate against women but not men   and what about things that appeal to yours  i assume you mean what things appeal to me about being a guy its kinda hard to separate that from what i like about being me in general but ill give it a shot  10 bonus strength  advantage on intimidation rolls  dont get a monthly debuff to my emotional stability  piss standing up  cumming takes like 10 minutes and no effort  hygiene is generally easier
  so little update this shit seems to be going down people  i will get a hundred bucks to anonymously fuck some camwhore  should i go through with this  any tips
there is a girl in a workgroup im in that i like quite a bit but we barely talk to eachother and see eachother only one hour a week she always seems busy and never stays around once the class is done   some tips on how to get her attention 
  wear a condom and have fun
  just be yourselfwoman there is nothing wrong with being brilliant
  please
any advice talking about depression with gf been relatively open but its hard to describe/articulate things at times i havent let it get in the way of anything as far as im aware i still make an effort to go out be social and active etc i just want to be transparent but find it difficult to be concise explaining it
  bump
how do you tell a girl that her make up makes her look like a little whoreish  relation to said girl shes my gf
  if you dont know how to talk to your gf i dont think i can help you
  seeing each other instead of hanging out or w/e was way too forward wasnt it is there anyway to salvage this seeing her tomorrow is going to be so awkward why didnt i just wait 2 more weeks ughhh    jesus dude calm the fuck down youre spazzing out literally over minor wording and inflections    odds are she glanced at that text and paid it even less mind than you initially did    the only way you blow it is if you continue to spaz like you currently are and then knee jerk try to cover up accordingly    relax just go enjoy the day
  dolphin
  yeah that 2nd friend sounds pretty gay
so i was out with some people yesterday on a bar and there was this girl i kinda likeshe probably knows and were friends she has a thing going with some other guywho wasnt there but they arent boyfriend and girlfriend anyway i caught her staring at me a bunch of times and i want to know if im overthinking it too much or if that could mean something
  and by staring i mean i was talking to other people and i would look at her and she would be looking at me  i mean our eyes met a bunch of times
girls   how can i make a girl who doesnt give a shit about me getting attracted to me  we have some courses together at college for info
a cautionary tale old friend showed interest shes lovely but i shied away i flipped between being interested and closing up insecurity and lack of confidence killed me     she put up with this for a while last week she started to pull away last night she texts me in the middle of the night after im asleep she told me about a really great guy she met and its funny because she had a crush on me forever which i figured she went on to say that about two weeks ago she realized i wasnt going to see her her as more than a friend and she is accepting of that     why did she tell me this idk i lost i lose i hesitated and i pay the price     sorry for rambling incoherence im fucked up rn      so guys and girls if you like someone tell them
  your mindset is amazingly opposite to mine  i detest every time i uncontrollably reveal something about myself any form of information because it can and will inevitably be used against me  i admit things that noone has a reason to know  i share my opinion and get it used against me  i flaunt my goofiness and only later realize how disgusting and cringy i am    i deeply desire to isolate myself but i can not out of habit i am extremely social and i apparently cant quit  i admire people like yourself the best humans are those that dont annoy anyone else
i cant create a new thread being a phone poster so here i am    ill keep this short and sweet    im interested in going into a field that is dominated by women 75 female    i like the work and i generally like working with females especially in a professional setting    my question is this when women dominate a field are they open and helpful to males that want to join them or are they obstinate and protective of their stronghold    i grew up an only child which left me socially blind so any help would be appreciated
  i have good friends that are like you and i can see what you mean ive been privy to many shit talks behind their backs about their behaviour  i think something we both have in common is that we arent comfortable with the way we act and dont know what to do about it
  depends what field we talking here
  psychology
  i cant create a new thread being a phone poster  u dumb you can start threads no problem on mobile
  in what capacity psyche is used for nursing emergency medical therapy and a lot of other jobs if your afraid of going into academia to study some psyche then i wouldnt worry too much unless youre going for a major in it in which case you either have to be an insanely sensitive and passive person or youre seen as jbp essentially
  well thats my assumption regardless of why i get the message that my ip range has been banned
  anybody pls help haha
  when women dominate a field are they open and helpful to males that want to join them or are they obstinate and protective of their stronghold  in my field the former dunno about in general
tldr keep getting the i just want to be friends talk from girls before they ghost should i just go hermit mode    meet girl go on friend dates together for 6 months  tell her i like her she doesnt feel the same but still wants to be friends  stops messaging me and hasnt replied to any of my messages for 2 weeks    match with girl on tinder both into history and nerdy  go on 4 dates to museums and talks  tells me shes met someone else but still wants to be friends  fine by me didnt reply to my message for 3 weeks even though shes online every day    take friend with me to party dont like her romantically but still want to bang her  tells me that she isnt attracted to me watch her go home with another guy    match with another girl on tinder end up having sex on the first date  seems to really enjoy and i try to move things along  i was only interested in the one bag sorry    im tall but fat should i just give up on trying to find love until ive hit my goal body according to my calorie tracker that probably wont be until march next year
  it means that shes curious if you asked her out she would most likely say yes
  fascinating right now i feel pretty set on pursuing a bachelors in psychology but im concerned with being accepted at the masters and doctorate levels
  thank you
    seems like you just have terrible taste in women youre either not committing to forming a romantic relationship or youre banging tinder thots     forhet about the last few chicks a partner is more than a friend with similar hobbies or some girl you just want to bang my man ask yourself seriously what youre even looking for and why then just be romantic youre not just taking her to nerd out about star wars and paleontology you love her there is a major difference
  so you think there was some interest there
  well its purely anecdotal i know but in my experience women who try to major in psyche tend to be extremely sensitive women even if they dont openly shown it compassion is sort of necessary to do well in that field it youre afraid of youre image i would suggest of logos ethos and pathos to go with ethos based rhetorical appeals in order to win favor in such an audience of coeds keep things professional be very aware of their feelings and talk about emotional health a lot and it might even get you laid if you play your cards right     otherwise there isnt much to worry about
  yes your job is to ask her out or forever be regreful
  thank you i appreciate your time
so the girl ive been seeing for the past 2 months just texted me i love you  i like her and im in this for the long term but i dont feel that way yet mostly due to us not spending that much time together yet also didnt have sex so far whats a good response to this without coming off cold or something
  i did like half a year ago and she kinda stopped talking to me
  thats your answer then shes not interested
  either say it back and possibly get laid or just be like hey girl i appreciate you too
is it a good or a bad idea to ask someone im obsessively in love with to tell me they arent interested in me so i can move on with my life
  you ever seen the empire strikes back
  bad idea terrible idea you do not want to know because its who you are
  depends on the scenario but usually id say its a bad idea cut her out of your life take some time to be alone and do some soul searching m8 travel for awhile  think of it as a pilgrimage to find yourself again codependency can be unhealthy at that level who exactly is she to you
  1 youre not in love  2 if you ask politely and dont get upset then its fine
  you do not want to know because its who you are  what do you mean      cant cut her out of my life its a coworker      youre not in love  how so
  well who is this coworker to you what has she done that you find so irresistible to be around
  obsessively  theyre not interested  you are infatuated you cant love someone you barely know
  yes how is this related    i dont like to lie about this seems like a bad way to start a relationship guess ill just say that i like her too
  cant cut her out of my life its a coworker   ive been here   it sucks because you see her almost all the time in my situation she kinda got the hint but none of us ever really said anything other than me trying to be flirty sometimes it hurt when i noticed her actively avoiding me at some points i got sour and would be a bit of an asshole and she would be with me too sometimes i might have been bothering her or something it was always awkward     one of you has to leave or its always going to be weird in my case i ended up leaving that job for unrelated reasons but i dont think about her anymore
  what has she done that you find so irresistible to be around  all the usual boring stuff that doesnt really need explaining her interests her appearance the way she talks her personality etc      you cant love someone you barely know  i dont get it
  whats not to get is english not your first language or something
  feels like there is though
  looks like its a codependency issue then id challenge you to respect her peace and learn your own then if you feel like you need her then you have issues that you need to face instead of run away from into someones arms as a mode of escapism    its unhealthy behavior and its how a lot of abusive relationships start
  ive never met a smart woman bitches who get good grades yeah but that isnt a sign of intelligence
  kek forgot about that im not alpha or autistic enough to pull that off
i need some relationship opinions/advice im a 24yo male in a 6 month relationship with a girl of the same age and im quite inexperienced in relationships this is my 2nd ltr  1st of all is there such a thing as spending too much time together in the beginning of our relationship we would spend 23 nights a week together but at this point we spend almost every night together unless one of us has something else scheduled well either go out for a drink or stay inside and netflix and chill we are having a great time im just weary that we might grow tired of one another at some point and so on is there a guideline for that  2nd and this might sound stupid but who and when should say i love you first is there another guideline for that
  what field are you in from my experience there isnt much disparity between men and women when it comes to success and intelligence associated with most areas of higher education and their workplaces
  yeah i guess just found it a bit weird how she was looking at me a bunch
  we are having a great time im just weary that we might grow tired of one another at some point and so on  thats normal anxiety desu if youre afraid of her feeling burned out of you then tell her that you love her the next time you kiss her that should get her fluttering    the burn out feeling doesnt usually come until youve grown old  as long as you both have that youthful passion there is an entire list of romantic things you can do
how do i get a smart gf
  not him but in my experience its a bit different women who do well in their fields do so because they have a strong study/ work ethic  but in terms of truly brilliant people ive only met a few and theyve all been men
a close friend of mine is showing interest but there are some issues  is going to dye her hair pink  shes kissed one person once  has never been in a relationship  shes a close friend  is really boring over text  shes hot and cold with me  shes probably a bit depressed atm  only has one close female friend and i hate her  doesnt get along with most girls  likely is bisexual
  being smart yourself is the most obvious way or just get a wellpaying job of high standing eg a lawyer or a doctor thats where youll find them most easily but keep in mind that a trait like high creativity is also an example of a sign of intelligence so you shouldnt necessarily only aim for career women
  go drinking at a gig  know girl im friends with   we both had a thing for each other but it never came to fruition cause she kinda friendzoned me and shit  was like we were slowly going towards a relationship but then she goes after like 9 months of being close here i dont feel attracted to you youre not loving  realise im not really much of a flirter to her  nor am i comfortable around her  im not really myself around her i tiptoe around her  im decent looking not an autist  been hanging around with my other female friend and i really like hanging with them cause shes super chill  at the gig other friend and i somehow get flirty towards each other  get these texts before i get home  im the bad guy when shes literally told me time and time again to not bother with her with this relationship and that im just a friend she doesnt feel anything that way for me shes asexual she tried that once and now shes fucking mad and im the fucking idiot    like i get it i shouldnt have done it but idk she never gave me much positive signals and outstraight told me not to bother and i bothered for a year i had been barking up that tree for a year and 2 months and now im bolting
  forgot to leave the question  why the fuck would she be mad  was she into me  who the fuck cares  im trying not to  its working kinda alright  my head will be less melted
  what if i want to be a jet pilot instead of that boring stuff
  i mean those are just the first points that came into my mind and that was only one of them you can still find a smart gf while being a jet pilot
  whats your question to know whether or not youre the idiot dude shes just going tsdere on you
  but will hardworking artistically inclined gals go for the jet jockey
i asked an older woman i work with out for coffee and instead of saying yes she invited me to have dinner at her house on tuesday night what should i expect does she just want company or is there something else im not seeing
  every girl is her own case but i refer you to the phrase opposites attract
  hahahhahhaah fucking savage
  you sound young most of your issues are just basic things that apply to most young women if you like her go for it
  why is my gf so self conscious about how she looks she hates me seeing her naked or in her underwear but ive told her multiple times i love how she looks ive never once even remotely said i dont like how she looks shes always saying she doesnt think shes attractive but to me shes the prettiest girl ive ever seen in my life
  im 19 yea im just hesitant i guess because in my only real relationship i overlooked serious red flags and i got burned in the end
girls do you like getting your bhole licked
why do women always try to fight logic and reason with emotions and feelings
  sort of theres this girl i work with who i treat like my sister sometimes ill get her food from outside or talk to her about shit or be sort of protective its kind of nice being able to watch over someone even though they definitely can handle their own shit for the most part shes attractive too but i doubt thats the reason why i do it most of the time i see her more as a relative than a girl to ogle
  were not threatened by actual equals were annoyed by women who assume theyre equals furthermore equal doesnt mean equal to them it means theyre superior if i met a woman who was better than me at things of course id respect her and possibly even look up to her the problem is not many women like that exist there are women who are way too sure of themselves but are shit at what they do they think being bossy and rude is giving men a taste of their own medicine where its really just being an annoying brat learn the difference between bossiness and being stern
  literally low selfconfidence in her case itll most likely get better with time talking about it also helps
meet girl  get along fine and have similar interests  tell her about fun bar event im going to with friends  she says if shes free shed go  hit her up the day of and invite her  sorry had a friend come home from college so im spending time with her or something similar  actual what happens since she post a pic of her friend and her at dinner that night  ff a month  talk to her more at work   invite her out to same event yesterday its a monthly thing  opens message but doesnt respond  i sent hey some friends and i are going to event you should come if your free  1130 that night  sends me message back saying she is sorry  sorry i went to visit my friend in x state with other friends as a last min road trip i promise ill go out with you next time the event happens  send a simple all good to her  so is it worth inviting her again or is she just not interested in going get along with her fine and really enjoy talking to her  pic unrelated
  two strike rule she knows its a monthly event now and that you go regularly and thats all the information she needs to invite herself along     chances that she likes you are verrrry slim because if she did shed be all about finding something else you two could do together on a night when shes free and not making promises about something thats still a month away
im going to stop going to some group because some girl there that showed interest in me rejected me when i asked her out and now keeps hanging out with some guy thats probably her boyfriend now if she asks me why i stopped going i shouldnt tell her the truth right
  shes not gonna ask because she already knows
  she wants anal sex
  sounds like shes trying to get laid im jelly anon dont screw it up
  how old are you two
  really    shes been flirty with me before which is why i asked her but could she actually want me like that    im 22 and i thinks shes 58 or 59 maybe 60
  and now i just realized how bad it must look for me to keep trying to get her to go to one specific thing is there any way to salvage and invite her out to do something
  literal granny  godspeed anon
  shes still quite attractive
  shes been flirty with me before  very good chance that she wants some loving be gentle op and let her set the pace enjoy that grammy strange
  that wasnt a criticism whatever floats your boat mate i do hope you smash though
i started messaging this girl on tinder a week ago we messaged back and forth for about an hour and it was nice she was sending me really long replies and seemed like she genuinely wanted to talk to me then the next night i randomly asked if she wanted to meet for coffee on the weekend we worked out the details and she seemed enthusiastic said it sounded fun etcetera i didnt message her at all the next 5 days because i wanted to save all the conversation for when i met her in person then the night before the date i messaged her and said cya tomorrow to which she instantly replied that she forgot she has to work on this school project or some shit and apologized twice i tried to play it off like i didnt care didnt even ask her if she wanted to reschedule because at the moment i thought she was just trying to blow me off politely i guess its impossible to know the real reason she cancelled but i wanted another girls input    should i have been messaging her leading up to the date should i try starting up another conversation in a couple days
  like sex or just someone to cuddle with
  maybe but in person if she brings up an event she wants to go to or something i would wait for a hint from her
  shes not interested dude the place doesnt matter
  start praying that she shaves her box
i know girls give hints when they are ready for their first kiss not first kiss ever first kiss with a new partner but do they continue to do that after
  i would actually like it if she was hairy i prefer it
so i recently got a new gril friend after stealing her from her boyfriend of 2 years     now i jsut cant trust her hanging out with other men alone and she says im treatig her like she is a whore and like i dont trust her     i care about her alot now i dunno how to fix this what can i do
  yes
  if she left her partner of 2 years that easily whats keeping her from leaving the guy that came afterwards
  the rule of thumb for relationships is theyll only love you until someone better comes along
      this other girl with a bf invited me out for dinner should i live la bida loca and just game multiple girls till i get that 18 year old virgin i want
i dont have too much trouble getting dates my main issue is finding girls who have similar personalities / interests that i like every girl i talk to from spoilerhigh school/spoiler seems to be normalfag of the normalfags to the point where i find it genuinely hard to talk and relate to them    where the hell do i find girls who are ok with my kind of weird sense of humour and are at least willing to try entry level shit like watching obscure films or popular anime
do girls feel sensitive in the nipples  i was told that my gf seems not to feel anything  or it depends on the girl
  if you wouldnt tell her for that long when she was blatantly and continually showing interest maybe you just arent ready for a relationship it might not be too late you might just want it to be too late so you dont have to do anything  ive been in the same position of closing up on someone who was interested in me ive done it my whole life any excuse to avoid being vulnerable whether it was romantic or otherwise but then it happened with the guy who spoilers is now my boyfriend when i felt him pulling away that familiar regret just felt so much worse than the fear of taking the leap and i realised it was the same leap he took initially  id stupidly rejected him when he put himself out there so why should i be above putting myself in a risky position it was fucking scary id never done anything like that before but i just couldnt let it go and now that im here i cant fucking imagine what my life would be like right now if id missed out on this    even if its too late for you to make anything happen which it might not be you can still admit to her how you feel maybe youll be rejected but youve been rejecting her all this time shell either return your feelings which will be positive reinforcement for the next time you need to be open with someone or she wont which will also be a good lesson in empathising with someone whos trying to connect with you and what it feels like to be rejected so you stop doing that to people you actually like
  shes a crazy brat dont worry about it
  always  do you have the statistics to back this up
girls if im showing that i am interested in you with compliments and things and youre taking them well how do i go about showing im interested in you sexually how do i shift to that kind of interest
so i met a girl on the old internet a week ago and we went out to see a movie on tues and then went to a diner for a few hours after had a really good time with them and shared a lot of interests from what i could tell they had a great time time too during the film they wanted my arm around them and i obliged it was great in the car we kissed a bit dropping them off they said they definitely wanted to see me in a few days and kissed goodnight    now its well not tuesday and we havent made more plans they take a while to return texts now and weve only had like 15 since    so what am i doing wrong am i doing something wrong i really want to see this person again they said they were busy today going to practice music at a friends should i suggest plans for a day or two or wait i dont know also if this matters the person is trans and im a cis male hopefully they arent reading this or be understanding if they are 
  how do i get over the anxiety and stress i have about my partner putting other things in her vagina instead of my dick i have to ignore the thought of all the previous people shes been with but even dildos and fingers trigger me does it actually make that much of a difference to women or am i just crazy
hello /adv/ theres this dilemma that myself and a group of friend are having    we have this friend that in all retrospect is not trying to do anything with his life to paint a rough picture on things all of us are now fresh graduates / entry level employee who are now in what could be called the starting phase of our career some of us are getting married climbing out of internship etc basically were all moving somewhere in our lives    then theres this guy i dont mean to talk bad about him but he has a sort of attitude problem that we all think is destructive for himself in the long run and lately is showing signs of progressively being a depressed shutin to give an example  does not actively look for jobs even when i accompanied him to career fairs and such he only browsed through the whole thing and maybe take one1 pamphlet he might be interested in after that went on saying that career fairs are bullshits and whatnot  applied for like one job every 3 months and then gave excuses when advised to followup on his application not even wanting to send out an email to the hr  decided to give up on career field engineering because not getting any job and wanted to be gym trainer whereby he suddenly shifts his tone and mocks engineering in general for being a shitty field when he hasnt even tasted it yet  when his parents wanted to send him to foreign countries to further his study he wanted to just go local and suddenly wanted to take back engineering because hes suddenly interested again    it also doesnt help that he   acts like a sheltered rich kid whereby his parents will always be there to bail / support him whenever hes even a little bit out of his comfort zone  has anger management issue  avoidant on conversation that involves career future prospects etc even raised his voice on one of our friends when he tried to advise him on things  lacks social skills all of us are nerds but hes that guy tier    contd
contd    has unrealistic expectation in many things like work he expects to get a work near home in a field he likes not doing too much work starting salary of 30003500 local currency when average here is 20002500  not very independent cant even be asked to go somewhere using gps direction always wants a friend to accompany him order for him fastfood because hes not comfortable there was one time we change our place of meeting and he came in and gave one of our friend the middle finger for changing to another restaurant it was 500m from our planned place  makes fun of people who work in his pov shitty jobs like sales retailers or whatever most of us are not that well off so we do at least respect people who earn  spend their own money rather than daddys     were all quite worried because it feels like hes being left out not intentionally of course but were all going in different direction in life and we all think he needs to walk by himself too problem is now hes like not even interested in doing anything we just imagine that whenever we meet up next time in the near future how awkward it will be to ask him whats up because we all know the answer if it does happen we really wont talk to him because a hes avoidant on such topic b we have no idea what to say after all our attempts    ps in this past 12 years getting job hasnt been easy in my country no thanks to the 2016 oil crisis its been a shitshow of poor economies and oversaturated employee market but tough luck my friends and i all struggle through it and make an effort to dig ourselves out of it not all of us managed to work in the field that we wanted but hey its something sorry if your eyes bleed english is not my first language    tldr friend not making any effort in life what do/say
  its his life not yours why do you think you know what is the purpouse of life    pro tip  if your question cant fit into single post it isnt worth responding to
  a persons worth is not based on his or her productivity youd do well to remember that
    of course were not concerned with him whether hes being a productive member of society or not     our main concern is that hes slowly showing signs of going into depression from the inactivity he cant seem to stick with one thing long enough and now its like hes opting to not even bother
all you can really do for him is be there for him to an extent and not nurture his shitty habits what i mean by to an extent is that you cant let him drag you down with him so tread carefully and know when to bail you can throw the ladder down the well but its still up to him to want to climb out of it
is it normal that i dont want to talk to people sometimes it has come to the point that i think its affectin my relationship with my friends also do people like it when they get chat often
not everyone wants to talk all the time pretty much everyone has moments or days where theyre not up for chatting it depends on the person how much they like to talk
am i good looking enough to be a model i need honest opinion   my lip ring and hair color are things that can be changed tho   im 100 asian 
  dunno about being a model cause i dont follow the scene but youre attractive take a better photo from a distance that doesnt warp your features and wear some light makeup
  you look half asian it more depends on your height and body type desu
  boy or girl
you face doesnt matter that much its about selling clothes so its your body thats going to be put on display but if you assume that you have a good enough body to be a model and youre only worried about your face youll be fine you look fine
  op could be a tranny
thanks for your advices  im a girl 50kg/165cm  heres another photo of me from distance
  165cm  yikes usually modelling agencies look for taller gals except if youre looking to get into instagram modelling in which case youll be good
  theres definitely enough information in your pic to dox you  i recommend deleting that pic
  yeah i tend look like tomboy/unisex/boyish
  depends what kind of modeling you mean you could maybe model for hot topic or something but high fashion not a chance in hell especially at that height
  change your hair i personally dont like it at all
  are you wearing circle lenses
  dunno how to delete it but i cant recognize a word on the map so its fine
yes im wearing lenses
    thats not true the market in asia is completely open commercial modeling is also always open if they can look commercial in asia most models do both at that height as long as they have a unique look and looking mixed is actually really trendy    so op try japan and as a second choice hong kong or china
  yeah i tend look like tomboy/unisex/boyish  that uncertainty isnt good the piercing doesnt add anything good too  good luck
  cringe  sorry to shatter your expectations but you arent even close to model looks
  what are you being serious if anything that uncertainty is good have you ever seen a fashion show 
  honestly imo you dont look striking enough to be an eye candy model like vs girls and not weird/ugly enough to be a high fashion model but give it a try anyway because who knows
  looking mixed is trendy but japan still wants their models to look cute and feminine for the most part not boyish
  she has to get into professional plastic surgery she needs to get her eye bags done she needs another haircut and haircolor she needs slight lip fillers thats everything
  her lips are full you retard unless she wants to be a porno model there is not need for fillers
  this is shit advice
    thats not true theres always room for a niche model ive seen it in their idol groups and magazines she can be cute boyish and as a model you dont get to control anything anyway so if op cares about their image that is the wrong job they could model on insta like someone else said or create a band to control their image
  okay so lets see i have a lot of knowledge in the fashion industry  50kg  honey ohhh no no no no for the model industry thats not low enough whats your fitness do you workout if no do it your weight needs to drop i am not saying you have to look sick just really slim     165cm  thats not high enough sorry at least 175cm the higher the better    haircut  jeeeeeeesus christ get rid of that haircut looks cheap and awful you need to look classy if you want to make it somewhere    face  your symmetry is a huge plus but lenses are a nono if your natural eye color is light then good for you this will be also a huge plus if not  uuuuhhh you better focus on something else that stands out
  well those lips are not full sorry they are indeed well proportioned and slim but nothing compared to fullness
  its professional i have been casting alot of models she wanted honest advice  there you go look up aya shalkar she is a model btw and has everything she should work up to
  yes but niches are very rare and hard to find you have to have some connections to fit into those niches otherwise you are not going to get in at all
    op asked for potential  theres tons of girls who could nake ot but jever do because its really competitive and oversaturated but that doesnt mean there isnt a chance at least they could go there and try their luck and if not they have a vacation out of it     in addition models get oaid very little and the higj paid ones are also tv personalities like the one you posted rola theres plenty other models barely making money but still working especially in china its not impossible to model at all i got offered so many modeling opportunities in asia and im the same heigh as op theres even shorter girls and they wear high heels for runway anyway
  no youre not stop lying on the internet to justify your retarded advice
great to hear diverse opinions hah i hate my hair too i dyed it myself much regret  i do work out my body fat is 22 its okay to be feminie when the fashion industry wants me to
  no chance manface 22 fat short no unique features    face reality in the modeling business you are not seen as a person but as an asset and you aint no premium high class product
  i do work out i want to be a model  my body fat is 22
   im asking my potential my body fat and hairstyle can be changed but my face cant
  just find yourself a nice boyfriend youre cute modeling is a shit industry
wait is 22 really bad
  this
  yes thats fucking disgusting i wouldnt fuck a chubby girl like that and good luck modeling at 22 not skinny enough to fit into normal modeling and not fat enough to be the i dont need no man overweight all sizes are beautiful fat liberal plus size modeling
  yes thats fucking disgusting i wouldnt fuck a chubby girl like that  t incel
  t incel     oh good one non argument
  you dont really have a pretty face i dont see how modeling will be an option for you  maybe you can work out more and get better at putting on makeup but from those pictures you posted it doesnt seem like an easy way to make a living
  youre fucking mentally deranged if you think 22 is chubby and you sound like pic related  youre right about modeling though you need to be skinny for that
  model on instagram being a real model isnt any more real just more consistent once you get in your height will pretty much exclude you from the industry until rih comes out with some shit for you
  but op doesnt look mixed in her second pic she looks like a eurasian is the first pic but maybe it is just the angle
    you are pretty cute anon i dont know anything about modelling though
can i see a headshot with your hair pulled back no makeup no piercing
  this is 23 body fat so yeah 22 is definitely not chubby
youre really pretty  i dont know anything about professional modeling but id definitely follow you on instagral
  you could do porn thats still modeling     i dont think you could make it as a model most get scouted around 14 and have careers by your age you look too tomboyish and just not pretty enough
  youre going to have to sleep with powerful people in the industry to get anywhere no one will force anything on you but most models at the top sought out those people and sleep with them
  whats her name i fucking was thinking about her yesterday but coule not remember it
  i know someone who looks like you shes a model go ahead
  take out you lip pierce and dress in brighter colors you need to accept the trend to truly be a model you need to adapt first before you command
be me  16 y/o male  makes a complete change in the way i see things  everything looks bright  happy times  fast forward a few months  find love  her legal guardian does not like me  tries to separate us  fuck  blame myself for everything that was is and will be  she says she still loves me  months go by and she still loves me  aquire what feels like depression  train less game more stop going out  feels like shit  start to think of suicide  one friday night attempt to kill myself  fail miserably no one notices  i tell her about it  she says she loves me and to never do it again  few days pass  try again  fail once again  think of a better way to end myself  plans on bleeding out  mfw ill break a promise to not kill myself to my bff  mfw i plan to do it sometime soon  dont follow my footsteps anons just dont    goodbye anons
your going to be fine go for a walk long walk in a quiet place free from noise listen to your surroundings the birds clear your head dont think just listen thinking is what got you in this place to begine with now go home and relax read a book no social network shit then next time you see her walk by her look straght ahead dont glance at her dont say hi if she says something to you ignore it this will drive her or any bitch women up the damn wall then do the same thing the next week by the end of the week you wont give a shit about her and you will of hoofully of come back gull circle then put on some pennywise nofx or other good punk band and welcome your no fucks givin additude or dont i dont care what you do
  so youd rather kill yourself then try to run off with a girl who loves you sad many such cases
  ow the fuck you fail a suicide attempt  step up nigga     ahh those good ol days where i met my first love and them felt like shit when it was over       move on kids shes not the last
  if you actually want to feel better and have a good life which i know seems really far off in the throes of depression and sometimes unknowable or even not worth pursuing the process is simple but hard work     ill say that rationally not existing vs having a meaningful and good life is not even a question since we only know we get this one but i have been in a similar suicidal position before and i know how hard it is to think rationally     process if youre interested    seek help first talk therapy the money doesnt matter if youre planning on dying soon anyway    take meds if you need to at first if your society offers you a gift that helps you take it damn your preconceptions if you have any you can reevaluate medication later    start accepting small amounts of responsibility and seek pursuing a goal the smallest tolerable one to start    this goal pursuit will feed into feeling as if you are able to pursue bigger goals   figure out your emotional/psychological needs through therapy and inner thought    pursue meeting those emotional psychological needs   through the above you will begin becoming braver in the face of an infinite possible future   this gets stronger over time and you find yourself functioning first pretending and then feeling functional later feeling  sometimes it takes action prior to belief that the action will work  this is normal     over the course of months for many people with dedication towards living a better life you will be in a position to feel like you have a life you actually want to live and then you can reevaluate medication if you have been taking some     and then the rest goes upwards and outwards     its a long path and one where you have to be patient with yourself and it may not seem worth it now but it is  and you dont have much to lose if youre planning on dying soon why not set a year time limit work on the above and then reevaluate how you feel in one year
  the same way he managed to post this thread  the need for attention  trust me underage nerd soon youll find something to live for first you need to stop being so gay thinking about girls and shit
what exactly is cognitive behavioral therapy has anyone here done it
  its sold to you as retraining your brain to break cyclical thoughts but i was recently informed by mental health professionals that the goal of cbt is to ascertain a diagnosis that can be treated long term with medication or by secondary care
  can it help
  honestly once you find out what it is and realize how it works you would regret not doing it any sooner you dont need to go to a doctor for that you can do it yourself try learning how by reading a book in my opinion everyone should know about it regardless if they suffer from anything it just equips your mind with the right tools and thought processes and mindset to deal with anything in general and apply it everywhere    i truly believe that cbt is very underrated
  all i did in cbt was talk about what was going wrong with me and the psychologist telling me the past didnt matter and that i needed to move on and start changing my life i did several sessions like this and the psychologist more or less told me i would never change because i was stubborn i simply said what was wrong with how i felt and how i could hardly accomplish anything due to depression in the end she told me pretty explicitly that she saw no reason to keep going with me so i quit
  wow thats fucked up
  what book do you recommend reading  i have several issues ocd anxiety short temper impatience  im walking neurotic mess
  sounds like a shitty therapist
  cbt as i said can help with anything in general but yes its quite effective with the issues you mentioned    if youre going to read about it get some official factual books that are well popular and respected in the medical community
  well popular and respected in the medical community  like
my psychology teacher recommend it to me because she said something like you have a lot of personality but you seem very inhibited and cynical     i dont think she was wrong desu
  its sold to you as retraining your brain to break cyclical thoughts  it does exactly that its called neuroplasticity your interjection will change the neuro chemistry in your brain the neurons being used to strengthen anxiety can be retrained to not follow the same path leading to their decreased usage and the emotional affect on the person itself      the goal of cbt is to ascertain a diagnosis  thats any goal of a therapy and most neurological conditionals are long term relations your brain made up and will take time to adjust if they can at all    its a tiny bit more complex than you put it
    work on one thing at a time  start with short temper  when you feel upset about a situation count to 10 in your head just stop and count to 10 you have to teach yourself to think before reacting    impatience can be learned by working towards something that takes time try to become flexible youll have to stick to it to see results or learn an instrument or a language    the others i would recommend keeping a journal and making daily goals monthly goals and yearly goals
  count to 10  i tried that it only made me more upset
    cbt is a good technique but its very limited in its scope since its mainly for treatment of obsessive or impulsive behaviour like addictions there are plenty of psychological disorders that are ingrained in a way that cbt cannot fix yours is probably like that so youd need a different approach regardless your therapist is indeed a shitter        i dont think cbt is going to help with those    t a psych student
  your feelings are irrelevant the point is to build up mental discipline you do it anyway
i feel like my bitch of a mom made me into a freak of nature  she would always blame me for her problems even her divorce and told me that no one would ever love me    im afraid of getting into relationships because i feel like im going to screw it up and im going to be the reason why it wont work out    ive considered getting my dick chopped off to please the chads but then realized it doesnt matter what gender i call myself no one is going to love me    ive considered suicide but i feel like thats going to make my mom happy and i dont want to give her the satisfaction    i dropped out of college 2 years in for failing classes and i feel like a failure    i dont know what to do if i continue living i feel like a waste of space and if i game end myself thatll make the fucking cunt of my mother get away with ruining me    what do adv
  dont chop off your dick just cuz your gay anon just fuck who you want to fuck who cares
  seek counseling
hello background    let me start off by saying that i didnt have a social net growing up my parents choose religion over me that really hurt i was being abused and bullied by those kids and the adults  being slapped by them being told no one would ever like me telling to die etc and i would cry but my parents turned a blind eye    my only family was my moms side and they despised me i remember crying every family gathering i was never excited on christmas eve or new years one time my aunt actually grabbed me by my wrist and threw me on the floor so her daughter my cousin could sit there so no support there    being poor made me a target at school someone caught my mom and i shopping at a thrift store i was bullied for buying worn shoes and just for being different so no friends    today i left home and the town i grew up in i cut off my family first blocked all my school mates and never returned to the organized religion i go to therapy go to university  even have a sponsorship working on a scholarship live on my own rent bills paid work and maintain financial literacy    things are good and im grateful i didnt think id make it this far    but im lonely i dont know how to make friends and im scared ill always be alone sure i can spend most of my time painting studying learning japanese etc    but i struggle in making friends and im still trying to figure who i am which makes it hard i would join a club but there are no painting or art clubs on campus nor are their clubs that interest me    how do i get involved in my community how do i integrate myself to society i dont know what to do im tired of feeling not good enough    what if they were right what if i do deserve to die and will spend the rest of my days alone do people really value beauty over kindness and what if i do become beautiful would people actually love me or my looks
  how do i get involved in my community  you already have looked at options for what interests you if you want you can always look up and go to events but if youre naturally introverted you dont have to force yourself  how do i integrate myself to society  society put bluntly doesnt care as long as you pay taxes a few people within it might care but thats something which will happen organically over time    what if they were right what if i do deserve to die and will spend the rest of my days alone  i hardly think thats the case yours sounds like a simple case of abuse and while any underlying problems from that are best fixed by a therapist rather than the autists here you dont deserve to be punished for it in any sense    do people really value beauty over kindness  if they dont have to interact with you yes the thing is kindness isnt going to be a negativejust dont confuse kindness with allowing yourself to be used    would people actually love me or my looks  both ideally and there are ways to help make sure
op  first of all show your kindness by doing social work as a volunteer  godspeed
  what if i do deserve to die and will spend the rest of my days alone  you have life so by default you have purpose you dont deserve death nobody does the world is a large place so im sure there are at the very least a few thousand people in the same boat as you dont give up on finding others who will appreciate you ever if you dont ever find them there are always those who care for their fellow man unconditionally even if they will never meet search for interests and enjoy your life the best you can at the very least you can always say you did youre best and had fun doing it    do people really value beauty over kindness   depends on individual preferences beauty is an initial attraction if youre 100 beauty and 0 kindness you are gonna be unliked no amount of beauty makes up for a rotten personality kindness is expressed after appearance and takes more time and effort to display people who are 0 beauty and 100 kindness will have a hard time with initial interactions and will barely get the chance to show how good they truly are    what if i do become beautiful would people actually love me or my looks  considering youre past you may be more attractive than you think you are due to self esteem issues an individuals outer appearance is apart of them just as much as the personality history interests etc improving youre looks is like improving any aspect of yourself what you are asking for is unconditional love which you can give to yourself and can come from others under the right conditions type of person time spent with you etc
ive been going to the gym 56 days a week for well over a year now and for the past 6 or so months theres been this 20 year old girl working there ive had plenty of small talk with her but i dont really know her very well sometimes she walks up to me to talk to me sometimes she completely ignores me i also notice shell glance at me while i squat every now and then but it could just be coincidence shes also very talkative in general with many other people in the gym which also makes me confused whether or not shes just friendly or could be interested in me anyway i really would like to get to know this girl better but im pretty socially autistic and dont know how to start up a lasting conversation also im 25 should i not even bother pursuing a girl whos five years younger than me anyones input on the matter would be appreciated
  she is a worker and trying to be friendly nothing more
its her job to make you like the gym dumbfuck
  this anon nailed im a hotel receptionist and have to always act chatty friendly and nice all workers have to we are even instructed to mildly reciprocate if customers are flirting or complimenting us admittedly it gets some people confused
im always stressed for barely any reason literally with any verbal interaction or recording a message for friends my heart rate goes to 140 theres 0 reason for the stress and whatever i try i still have it  any adv
how the fuck do you keep your gums from receding while you are smoking weed i found out a week ago just how bad my gums have receded after binging for an entire month to drown my sorrows its not bad but it scared the shit out of me enough to quit smoking altogether i used to have perfect teeth i have two more grams of weed that i havent finished yet and thought that will be my last one since im not going to just waste it     just smoked a little bit of it and im not sure if im paranoid but i think it receded a little again just now how the fuck do some people smoke it with their teeth being fine my construction worker friend smokes it every fucking day and he doesnt have any teeth falling out
  drink enough water and brush your teeth and gums and also floss idk i smoked everyday for 5 years and although my gums were receding even before i smoked i had gingivitis as a kid they didnt get any worse while i smoked and are in fact better now i dont think weed affects that very much
  do you smoke right before bed if so stop doing that     i dont think weed affects that very much  it can dry mouth is terrible for oral health
  100 year old vaudeville joke    patient moving arm or something doctor it hurts when i do this  doctor so stop doing that      you smoking weed makes my gums recede  doctor
    dont smoke right before bed or right after waking up until you are well hydrated smoking when your mouth is already dry will damage your gums more    brush twice a day and pick up some dental floss or floss picks    try rinsing your mouth out after smoking or at least swish water around your mouth for a bit before swallowing it to clear some of the smoke gunk away from your gums    weed isnt nearly as bad for your gums as cigarettes are but you are still getting a mouth full of smoke and burnt plant matter     the biggest threat to the health of your gums and jaw is sugar    try to cut down on sugar bacteria loves sugar and that bacteria will reproduce and get under your gums and break down the bone your teeth and gums attach to    the gums are receding because the bacteria is eating the bone away from your jaw you cannot reverse this but you can stop it from getting worse by maintaining better oral health keeping hydrated and cutting sugar     your construction worker buddies probably drink a ton of water and consume very little sugar all the construction guys i know only drink coffee and water only and only get sugar from fruits and vegetables     protip if you are getting cotton mouth from smoking you need to drink more water
i dont get what im doing wrong    at my college the resource centers they have for women and lgbt folk somehow managed to make it mandatory for people to attend social cues and body language seminars as part of their antisexual harassment thing but every time i try to behave in the ways they teach you ive been getting slapped with one sexual harassment complaint after another    im not kidding i have 12 complaints lobbied against me right now ive already had 2 title ix hearings and i have a scheduled meeting with the dean over a possible expulsion usually they just made me retake the seminars when i fucked up but ive gone to them 6 times now and always walked away thinking i got it but every time i tried to practice what they teach i kept getting more and more complaints    i dont understand what the fuck i keep doing wrong its actually gotten to the point i dont even understand what im doing at all anymore and theyre always classified as sexual misconduct even though none of them had any sexual intentions behind it nor were any of them physical    and the weird part is i never had this problem before up until now talking to another human being was a rarity but now after trying to practice the stuff they teach in the seminars i keep having this bullshit pressed against me and im fucking losing it
tldr
  try not speaking to people it works for me i have no charges
imagine if this was unironic and op was genuinely autistic enough to not realise hes being a rapist
i want to hear op describe the specific situational complaints
    you have to remember that the people who wrote these social cues and body language seminars are dysfunctional rejects who do not know how to relate to other people    if you try to use that information to interact with normal well adjusted people theyre going to think youre a social retard too as youve experienced    try doing the opposite of whatever youve been taught and it will probably work much better
if you actually rape women you will not have this problem    rapist
  also accurate      also op the only thing you should be doing is lawyering up    as always remember this    admit nothing  deny everything  make counter accusations
  this lol  body languages classes may be dumb but at the same time no normal folk get slapped with 12 harassment complaints and 2 title 9 hearings kek
  yeah op is doing something here 1 or 2 accusations from people who are friends with each other and dont like you is one thing ops situation is something very unusual
  unfortunately its probably because youre ugly sorry op    girls want guys to sexually harass them but only if theyre hot
  gunna need examples dog
  youre either ugly or actually a creep or both
if op is not trolling how is this right  what is this man doing wrong  do we really live in a world where a young inexperienced man can get his life ruined by young inexperienced women over interactions that werent even physical  sexual misconduct that isnt physical then what is it
  kik me portal666
how do you sway a text conversation from simple talk about something you / she needs from school into more casual stuff  ive done something i thought i couldnt i asked on social media a cute girl i see at school with who i had literally no interactions before  not even knowing names  about some stuff about an upcoming exam their class had but ours didnt yet we talked a bit about that and at the end she asked me to remember the questions on the exam we have before them on wednesday now i took this as a positive sign she wants to talk again     my question is how do i gently sway conversations from the school stuff to something more casual and get to know her  i went from her not even knowing my name to her asking me to remember something for her how do i advance is it creepy if i smile at her at school now asking her out out of the blue is not possible     i know this sounds retarded but i dont care im changing my life one step at the time
bumping

hey guys     i am a guy who is too feminine if i let myself be my true self it would be a cringy feminine trannytype guy in fact ive wanted to be a girl forever to wear the clothes and look nice and do what i like which is doing chores around the house and cooking no one knows this part of me but i let it slip sometimes and i know people suspect because they always wonder if im gay i hate this part of myself because i need to grow up to be a man with testosterone and with masculine traits so to do this i kind of dont have a plan besides to try to raise my testosterone using food nutritional supplements and exercise     i just feel alone and am too ashamed to tell or ask anyone irl about this but is there any other advice you guys can give me on this
you can either be yourself and tolerate the shittalking and disapproval from family and rejection and shaming until you find that person who understands and appreciates the real you or fake it till you make it and run the risk of ending up in a life that you find completely unsatisfactory and a sham and a deadend and find so mentally burdening on a daily basis that you find you have to resort to some destructive forms of escapism just to make it through the days
the thing is if i accept the first one i would have to deal with such embarrassment i would probably commit suicide     for the second option i would take that rather its already how ive been living in order to truly be myself i have to be by myself behind closed doors
become a drag queen this way you get to act out all your girly fantasies and potentially be paid for it
  are you gay or just feminine become a gay trans girl or straight drag queen and get some librul pussy
nigga youre chill no matter what   do you
  i dont know to be honest i think im straight ive been watching straight porn my whole life but if im honest id say i might be bissexual
you sound like my ideal bf and im a girl be yourself but also be considerate of how your actions affect those around you
  same    there are lots of girls who love feminine guys
you sound ideal op   its a shame im also a guy and i feel the same way im a little feminine but have to act all dominant and masculine because its whats expected of me    but i want to be the little girl so bad but my gf wont ever let me even though she likes the whole fuccboi thing she wants a dominant guy so i try to be for her but inside i want to have another femboi with me so we can do cute stuff together and maybe even share my gf as long as youre cute
l o n d o n  o  n  d  o  n
  imo people are way to quick to go full tranny if thats you man  im almost in the exact same boat and what i do is tackle both take care of your self make yourself presentable and open work out and such but be more honest when it comes down to getting personal with people let people know that youre both someone thats capable of being both dependable and sensitive/caring i think most people would find that attractive   just try not to look into the extremes of either side both extremes are unhealthy its better to have a balance  for me its comforting to think about being a cute soft feminine guy that gets anxious easily and cant take care of himself but i think thats the problem its like a headspace that lets you accept the way you are now rather than improving yourself  go after what you want but dont be satisfied with what you already have or going even deeper into a hole   hope the best for you anon and that you can be proud of yourself
  wants to be a cute girl  too embarrassed  acts overly manly to compensate  typical mtf brain behavior youre an obvious tranny
degenerates
how do i steal liquor from my parents without them noticing they have some moonshine that i wanna get drunk off of but i dont want them to notice im 19

  not op but isnt 21 the drinking age in the us
  they will notice how they will react i dont know
  haha probably i forgot about that fucking hell that must suck haha    tfw 18y/o britbong who can buy my own beer
communication advice please towards girlfriend    rung the girlfriend this morning and it didnt go so well as i imagined it ended up she being annoyed and that alone may have ruined her day today as she was planning to finish off some school work    the day before she had been stressing out to be at a modeling shoot aswell as dealing with some drop off/pick up issues with her friends so all and all pretty hectic day ive had been working that whole day otherwise id have help out so later that day we spoke to each other and she was super tired i was still at work and i mention that we speak later that night   we catch up over the phone again and i was trying to be as supportive as i can be over the phone tell her to get some sleep and we can 5alk in the morning    its like 8pm and she is still awake posting things on insta and its things like hectic weekend and i have studies to do rip me which are cute and funny but what ever keeps posting stories now i dont really care about that so much so that adter all that my dms to her were being read but no replies now im usually okay with that but after addressing something like that on the internet like trying to get attention and not replying to me i was getting annoyed    hence the phone call this morning now i was pretty moody and she was her playful self over the phone but i was curious why i was ignored while you were putting story upon stories up on her insta   she got pissed on the phone about it and didnt want ti deal with this right now its been like 3 hours and i sent her a message apologizing    im just wondering how do i address this what can i say   has anyone had similar issues
i have an opportunity to become a cop actually im almost certain if i want i can become a cop should i use this opportunity i mean i dont know whats awaits me do we have a police officer here i have couple questions
im not a cop but you should give it a shot worst thing happens it doesnt work out but you know you tried if you dont take this opportunity you will forever wonder what might have happened if you had
  its what white people do instead of joining gangs
  pretty much this
  i mean it seems to pay well you get a pension and a license to power trip on top of people sucking your dick even though youre well compensated already and its not even in the top ten most dangerous jobs    so sure why not i hate driving though so i wouldnt consider it
  the answer is bodily fluids not your own are you that almost certain op
  what flavor of cop do you plan to be any specialization this in itself should be in the plus column for the decision the ability to branch out and career opportunities as a whole that being said cops like any civil servant is a necessary evil not producing anything not enriching humanity make sure this will not affect your thinking too much
  i dont answer questions
go for a ridealong
become a corrupt southern sheriff just like in the movies and hassle bigcity folks passing through your town
  dont become a cop  i almost became a cop when i was thinking of dropping out of college  join the military  even if its to become military police mp  just go join military military will open more opportunities for you than becoming a cop will ever do for you
  this is 100 correct i cant believe so many police officers cant see the similarities     this even people who hate cops tend to be okay with veterans
how do i make peace with the fact that im going to die alone
realize that when youre dead you wont be conscious enough to care anyway
  everyone does really thats probably a side effect of death
why dont all the lonely men in the world just go gay and love each other    i dont get it
its way less stressful desu consider yourself lucky
  do something heroic like going into space and fighting alongside a guy who looks just like you but is better and then sacrificing yourself to save the world from a malevolent egg shaped evil doctor armed with a space cannon and a lizard monster
i want to die alone because its the right thing to do and doesnt scare me     ive cared for the dying my parents and wife included you learn things beyond what words can say i not only dont need company i dont want to inflict bereavement on anyone else i dont need to see anyone shed a tear im ready but theres nothing to be ready for other than some of the dying process    you dont miss what you were before conception because there was no you when you die there is no brain to think or feel you cease we only fear death because evolution selects for survival we should know why we think and feel what we think and feel thats a road to enlightenment
  think about it until youre so frustrated and backed into a corner and have absolutely no other option     then peace finds you and you find peace its really the same thing     accepting difficult and uncomfortable truth just takes a lot of time with it
we all die alone anon we are individuals dont forget that
im a 28 year old virgin is there even any point trying to pursue any kind of relationship with a woman because i have no sexual experience and that will just show clearly
id like to know the reasons that made you hate your significant other its funny to see how we love them so much but then we slowly start hating everything about them they irritate us and it eventually you realize that theyre treating you like shit they take you for granted i am currently in a lovehate relationship and its mentally exhausting i do love him so much i hate him as much when divorce is not an option and you have tried talking about it but youre always the one to blame what do you do everything is always my fault the way he reacts to whatever is my fault his unhealthy coping mechanisms are my fault it is my fault that he also doesnt want to communicate with me i just have to solve everything on my own so i would like to know if theres anything i could do to hate him less ive been trying so hard for so long and it just doesnt go away
i cant honestly say i hate anything about my partner i mean some things she does irritate me sometimes but i couldnt hate her for that its easy to get caught up in the minutia of your own personal life but i find love springs from the well of understanding about our shared human condition that both she and i are doomed and what time we have is short we have both suffered and i want to use my time to bring joy into her life love is wanting to give you have a choice to either give to and nurture each other or you can call it wasted time and cut your losses now it takes a lot of effort and patience to cultivate a healthy relationship and if you are unwilling to the task then i suggest the latter option but if you are willing to salvage what love you had then the only way to do that is to let him know thats how you feel and ask for his help in it as well be conscientious and vigilant about what you say to each other how the other feels before you think about how you yourselves feel in the end its a simple choice of wanting that life together or not and letting all subsequent actions being driven by that reasoning
what are some of the things that each of you complain to each other about
because you pathetic humans are dumb lower animals who will remain forever secluded from wishes of the unconscious processes that drive your conscious self to make decisions in life
  implying youre other than human  youre sailing this shitboat too
sometimes im really fucking pissed about my husband but i couldnt say i actually hate him or things he does   maybe its time to consider separate ways if hate finds its way into your relationship
i dont hate anything about my fiance sure he annoys me with certain quirks of his but i pick my battles wisely let me tell you this its not normal to hate your partner and if you do you should go your separate ways
  of course    i too am    he he he
i feel like because im attached to them i cant kill myself and im forced to get my life together even though i dont really want to
the big one for me is realizing they havent been completely honest cant stand that even if theyre only doing it to not hurt my feelings i have little tolerance for dishonesty     other times its been insecurity in their behavior like a girl who hangs with guys too much i dont like iteven if i can trust her
second part of the original post no i have no way to break up with him and again i still love him enough to not want to do it secondly he is not honest with me in any way and i just cant bring myself to trust his words if i say something about it hell say its my fault he has to lie and hide things anyway he says i am too sensitive but he cant imagine how careful i have to be with what i say he gets upset or frustrated way too easily even when its not even my fault makes himself feel better by being cold rude or distant with me and its draining there was a time when i really believed i deserved to be treated like this by him not anymore
hello anons my dad recently left my mom with three mouths to feed and no support whatsoever she has started drinking heavily and im worried shell become an alcoholic i want to help her im m/16 what can i do
number one dont ever blame your self
  general affection ie hugging saying i love you etc goes a long way if you can maybe try to find a part time job so you can take the load of your mom a bit    sorry youre in that situation anon
  i know i was thinking of getting a job to help with bills but that would mean leaving my younger brother alone and taking my focus off school debating whether its worth it
she has started drinking heavily and im worried shell become an alcoholic  why do you think your dad left anon this wasnt something that just started
id also recommend not getting into fucking vore shit
  sound advice if you want to bang your mom
  youre 16 and youve got sans vore on your drive    youre way too young to be such a degenerate wean yourself off that shit or youll never get laid
  bang your mom    probably not a bad idea now that i think about it a man is exactly what she needs after all    he might as well make himself the real man of the house
i asked a girl for her phone number last night and got it i texted her hey this is anon hows work eight hours ago and still havent gotten a response was that a bad choice of words i wasnt optimistic going into this and now im just about ready to cut my losses
i have found that small talk doesnt work early on     text for date meet at date talk for date    no more
  i was planning on inviting her to a party
  should have said in the initial text no worries mate maybe shell respond but at this point youve played your hand
  well like i said i didnt have high hopes to begin with my luck it was a fake number or somebody elses if i see her again and i still havent gotten a response im just going to ignore her
i usually call and organise a date if a get a girls number its easier to gauge how theyre reacting and how to take it from their     anyway just chill mate she either replies or doesnt
girl on tinder gave me her number and said she wasnt free that night and i texted my name then the next day i said lets arrange something and she never responded  i assume i should not go back to tinder and say you get my messages  i mean i would have at least acknowledged i received the initial contact
  i usually call and organise a date if a get a girls number its easier to gauge how theyre reacting and how to take it from their  hmm i rarely call people unless were texting to make plans friends and just decide to call halfway through cause its easier   do you do that or ask if they can talk first or just call whenever
  she wasnt interested she gave you her number rather than risk a possible confrontation by turning you down on the spot
femanon ive been working with this girl for a long time now we didnt get along at first but we became very close i told her things that i never told anyone else because she is really emotionally available and understanding she can tell when i feel sad and shell hug me tight without me asking for it i love working with her and being around her she makes me feel calm the problem is she has a bf i am married i am not sexually attracted to her either and i dont see a future for us even if we tried i just happen to feel this way its sad that i can talk to her better than i can with my man i can assure you that ive tried hard to communicate with him but i dont feel understood at all maybe i just crave that comforting feeling but not her as a person ive dreamt about her and i do feel weird when she gets too close to me i dont know what to do
  swinger party post results
she is not my husbands type at all and her bf is not my type either pretty ugly if anything i dont even know if she likes women and would like to try anything with me
the problem is she has a bf i am married i am not sexually attracted to her either and i dont see a future for us even if we tried    so you dont like her in a romantic way not sure what else to tell you there is really no point in even trying to persue it in my opinion it sounds like you just have a very close friend that you can be extremely open with  it seems to me at least whats bothering you is that you feel you can open up to her more than your husband which is making you question some things i just think youre questioning the wrong things    first just know that men and women are different there are things about you that she is just going to understand and empathize with easier than he will based solely on this alone its not a good or bad thing necessarily sometimes guys can get it easier than others but not all if you think he should maybe its a communication issue you two have that you need to work on  to be honest with you i think the problem isnt a romantic or sexual attraction to her just a misunderstanding of why you feel strange about the situation  just my two cents
    what this anon said          youre married too you need to stick with the one you love if you like those qualities see if you can talk with whom your married with about those things and see if they will become more supportive
  i have a really close friend and she is a girl too    weird flex but ok
  so you have a good female friend whats the problem
i know she is not just a friend because i have another girl i can talk to like that and i feel nothing towards her or around her i can be close to her face and ill be fine with this girl is different my chest does get a little tight and i feel nervous the only reason why i wouldnt try dating her is because i dont think our life styles would match its more of a practical reason its not the type of person id like to share my life with its not the first time i feel like this but i dont want to date them because it wont work so it doesnt surprise me its the first time since i got married though
  the only reason why i wouldnt try dating her is because i dont think our life styles would match  also youre married    i knew all girls were bisexual dudes have to compete with every guy and girl now thats a 100 increase in difficulty rating
so i have a big problem i think     i know i have a personality problem i know theres something wrong with me because i cant make a bond with someone never been able to but because past experiences all psychologist have let me down or done anything for me most of the time i feel like i hate them    i dont know what to do with this seems like i would end up being broken forever   what should i do
if you dont like or trust a psychologist at this level i think you might be a lost case
  you sound really important youre like a special case all broken inside nobody can fix you you should hate those psychologists im sure they deserve it trying to make you feel like youre less important than them or something     man i wish i was as special and unique as you
if you hate psychologists i dont think youre going to like any of us any better      fuck off you disgusting tripfag nobody cares who you are
may i ask why you hate psychologist
  i used to go to them but all of them have been assholes at some point    first one wall all in your face i told you suck it oh look what i do in this college as a professor until i noticed all she did mas making me mad and nothing else    then 2nd to 4th where just listening me and not giving me any advice 5th i went to 3 sessions and never called me back to the next one     and last but not least an idiot college psychologist acted all offended and made me got suspended because i said an offensive joke to jews in a session     we to go idiots you only get people money and fuck them even more you are the scum of this earth
  to be honest anon idk what to say or do in your position if thats true
  stop posting on /adv/ patrick
  sounds to me like you are simply just a little shit to be quite frank
  why do you think that about me can you read my mind of something      not that person
  why a jew joke
  she asked me to tell her a dark humor joke
so i dont really know how to put this when i think about girls or kiss one i just feel insanely weird and guilty i feel like they shouldnt be attracted to me or belong with someone else im not an ugly dude or anything its just this feeling that its wrong but i dont know where it comes from it just feels so wrong i cant explain it     has anyone else dealt with this how do i move past this
  i take it that your mother was overbearing growing up and your father emotionally if not physically absent
  nope ive always been really close with my dad my mom could get to be a little much but nothing crazy
  well there goes the freudian plot twist unless you are understating the a little much
  i dont know if im stating the obvious or not helping at all but maybe its that you think they want something that you think youre not/dont want to be like if you dream of having a relationship where you meet 3 times of the week max only sleep together on sundays and mondays and dont ever watch movies together then itd make sense that you think theyre all wrong for you if you think they all want something more/something else which by all means makes sense to assume but you may be wrong nonetheless
 its hard to answer this anon because most people dont actually suffer this way at least i dont think so    anyway maybe youre feeling this way because you dont deserve it in your mind    women would kiss you because of some reason whether it is affection love happiness or a variety of other reasons or emotions    so why is it they did it do you know if so you should understand they did it out of their own decision and that maybe you should think higher of yourself    hope this helps somehow anon
  maybe this im naturally submissive especially sexually but girls expect me to be dominate because im a dude and im like 62 and muscular albeit pretty lean i think feeling that pressure to fill that role for them when im not that way messes with me       they kiss me because they have crushes on me girls have always had crushes on me not trying to inflate my ego just the truth ever since i was little i had girls asking me out and when i was really little they would pretend to marry me i always felt insanely uncomfortable with it i just felt like i couldnt return their feelings but they were so nice i felt bad declining them so as to why they did it because they liked the way i looked i still dont feel right about it though i feel like theyre not getting it that im not right for them i feel like they want me to be this ideal boyfriend that i will never be because i dont know how to love them i had a girlfriend and i literally could not be physically inimate with her its not that i dont value myself i really dont know what the problem is at this point another girl likes me and shes so incredibly cute but its like seeing an adorable dog i have no real yearning or physical desire for her its so weird i dont get it
 then maybe if you feel this way you should avoid relationships for now    focus on your life work money saving up maybe you just dont want a relationship yet which is totally okay anon    but it will come a time a relationship will need to come and you will have to overcome those feelings    a woman should not love you for how you look but they should love you for your personality how they deeply connect to you in emotion and care    you maybe would fit better if you had a deep passionate connection with the girl and thats when your true love will start and not with someone who you may of not known that long who kisses you because you look better then others
  maybe you wouldnt feel like you were wrong for a girl if   you got to know her and   know that shes interested in being the sexually dominant one and   she didnt show interest so youd have to make a move  and then you could impress her with exactly what you want to which may be nicer for you than a girl who just seems to appreciate random things about you that you yourself dont care about    because thatd be legitimate
  its groucho marx syndrome    groucho once joked i wouldnt join any club that would have someone like me for a member    you think so little of yourself that any woman attracted to you must have lousy taste why not try offering them the courtesy of believing they might know what theyre doing
how do i stop believing that people are constantly telling me lies is this what paranoia is i dont feel like anyone is trying to harm me or any thing like that but when people talk to me about their day job life i always feel like i am being lied to even if i have no reason to think that way
  they are lying to you its all filtered and sugar coated
  do you yourself have a tendency to lie  or has someone lied to you in your past     not everyone does this thankfully
okay this might seem a little weird but i think this is the only place i can turn do in those kind of fucked up scenarios     quick rundown first  met this girl things started out fine things got weird now i want nothing to do with her  issue is im a pretty weak man and shes infatuated with attention so shell probably come back once she notices im done talking to her and i dont want that because even if right now i feel like im done ill become retarded once she tries to get me back i cant block her on facebook because shes one of my best friends sister want if i blocked her out of the blue all hell would break lose but i dont want to see her online all the time so i use inspect element in my navigator to delete her contact box and essentially make her disappear     what i would like to know is if theres a way to set up something that would do this automatically find and delete the element from my facebook page everytime 
  yeah use a loaded gun to kill either yourself or the computer problem solved

any tips to stop fapping
cut your dick off  smash your balls with a hammer  worship your own dick and cum as if they are gods
  just stop you need self control
if you need to fap just fap to instagrqm pics fapping to porn is the bad thing
  start doing sex so you dont really have to fap 
i study computer science and math i interned at a bank last summer and didnt really like it too much red tape cant get anything done i want to work somewhere where i use math and problemsolving skills on a daily basis and further my knowledge where do i do this
  academia
  i fucked up my first year and now my gpas probably too low
  i interned at a bank last summer and didnt really like it too much red tape cant get anything done  what does this mean  i want to work somewhere where i use math and problemsolving skills on a daily basis and further my knowledge where do i do this  math and problemsolving comes up in all software development if you want more math then lookup software development jobs that apply higherlevel math and require you to always be learning new material
  get into cyber intelligence doesnt necessarily have to be cryptography or datascience the adversary is dynamic and the technology is always changing  new stuff to learn and solve on a constant basis that requires computer skills math skills be applied how you want in the field to solve these problems
  working as an analyst and software developer and yea i guess there are probably places that would use higher level sort of stuff
where to have sex    i know you hate us but help a sandnigger out bros    i have a gf and were both muslim and were both not allowed to have relationships were going to introduce us to our parents once were ready to marry but thats going to take a while because were both in uni right now    but my issue is that while we have to keep dating a secret its hard to be sexually active we often meet at parking lots and make out but as youd guess sex isnt really possible there my mom and hers as well are housewifes so our homes are always occupied and i dont want to book a hotel because it would make things too obvious we never had sex together and i want it to come naturally and be romantic and shit what options am i left with
    hey bro im a fellow sandnigger im also in the process of seeing someone however i am refusing to have sex    you have to decide what it more important the relationship or your religion ive made my personal decision but you must decide what is more important to you and act accordingly    if you want to have sex then do it go to a party or something and sneak into a bedroom    if you want to stick to your religion nothing wrong with making out and shit and being together while crossing that line    thats my two cents
  honestly im not religious but i still have my own moral obligation when it comes to this i wont just fuck around thats not the point but we love each other and i want to live that love going to random parties is no place to be intimate if you dont want to be interrupted or anyone seeing you
  just get a hotel man maybe the next town over or something if you are worried about somebody seeing you
  and i dont want to book a hotel because it would make things too obvious we never had sex together and i want it to come naturally and be romantic and shit  who fucking cares do you want to have sex or not    you have talked to your girlfriend about sex havent you
omg actually nice people who want to offer help rather than bitter assholes trying to drag another down just wanted to commend that hope it works out for all of you
    as i said i didnt want to make it obvious that i want sex no i didnt actually shes a virgin and shes shy when it comes to being intimate so i wanted to go from making out to slowly proceeding to sex instead of going like i booked a hotel so i could tap that you know but i guess i just have to be open about it since there doesnt seem to be a way around
  what options am i left with  actually marrying her you dumb shit
  too early for that to happen
  what you need is to overthrow your oppressive government and establish a free democracy we have given you the solution stop whining and trying to have it both ways if you do not fix your shithole totalitarian country then you have to accept and embrace it you can not pick and choose freedoms either you have it you do not
  borrow friends room  back seat of car  hotel  deserted campus building my gf and i used to do it in the chapel  go camping  on the ground in park
  the hotel is a good idea and if you dont want to make it that obvious plan a trop in an other city go over there for the weekend visit sex should not be the main goal it will be implied yes but it will not appears as the main goal
  let the tension build up taking virginity is more of a process than youd think not something to do in a car or off a hiking trail i would tell you two to elope and then seal the deal after that its much less scandalous to get married and do things the right way than to get caught fooling around or getting her pregnant that would destroy her honor and both of your reputations
how do i get over some girl i dont want to have feelings for anymore    things ive already tried but dont work    put space between her   makes me want her more desu  hang out with friends  masturbate and get over it  drink yourself to sleep  tell her how you feel and let her stomp on your heart  talk with other women  theyre not the same i want her even more when i compare the two    lets just say i have really particular taste in women and ive been waiting for like years to cross paths with someone like her      shes not interested in me which is fine i can live with but i just want to drop whatever feelings i have for her and move on
  have you tried  waiting  
  listen to layla by derek and the dominos while you lay on your bed in pain that you cant be with her
how do you know shes not interested
  get your mind off of her  whatever way you can    shes not interested move on make up goals that you wanna do in life and start making plans on perusing them
  i talk to her but i always have to initiate the conversation if not she wont say a word    when we do talk though shes really sweet and soothsaying and smiles at me    with that said  she never asks me my opinion or my input on things shes always glued to her phone she never accepted any of ky invites to hang out outside of class and she loves bringing up her other friends that she hangs out with instead of me
  feelsbad anon honestly all you can do is wait even then the feelings will be there but theyll be way less intense and youll be able to move on with your life give it 3 months or so
i want her even more when i compare the two    constantly talks about other friends and never accepts invites    you should first realize that you have pretty awful standards if you want a girl who doesnt want anything to do with you you dont want a girl who doesnt want you around bro
  yeah yeah i already know how fucked up my standards are    hence why i want to stop having feelings for her
  she could still like you but shes too nice to tell you
how do i relax for a moment  everything is building up im procrastinating things tense stressed pale in the face and unhappy in general life is moving fast as fuck yet it feels like its moving too slow somehow i cant stop living in my head when im socializing for too long i want to crawl back into my head my room is cluttered to hell and i dont like the formation of my furniture anymore its old i need a manual reset or something i need something instant what will it take to slow down
  just get things straight one thing at a time and pray that one of them will actually make it feel like youre on top again it can be hard to know which things matter before youve taken care of them i think your room sounds like a good place to start tho
  idk man maybe lay on your bed and follow along with a guided meditation on youtube or something a hot bath helps me relax
anon dont worry shit goes on this happens to me all the time try meditation its something thats helped me sort a moment it takes at most 10 min but try it if not take a second to look at the sky and just empty your mind
so my best friend and his wife are on the verge of divorce after i made a silly joke saying my best friend smacked my ass and in front of a girl i was smashing at the time and how she got jealous because she didnt want him to smack my ass so his wife took it as she got jealous my friend didnt smack her ass and now my friend is putting all the blame on me
  whatd you want advice on
  1was it really my fault    2if so how do i fix this
should i leave 4chan for good     i mainly browse fit but there are other nice boards too recently got into lit and actually liked that a alot but nonetheless 4chan is extremely toxic the first few years it didnt affect me really much i knew most of it was just meme bullshit but it has gotten worse from time to time i have developed issues with my height with my girlfriend with my overall wellbeing just because of the negativity of this board   i know i sound like a child that cant manage his feelings but it just happens should i actually leave any other options are there more comfy boards let me hear your opinions
  otten worse from time to time i have developed issues with my height with my girlfriend with my overall wellbeing just because of the negativity of this board  is that the secret is that it is that it do i just leave 4chan an watch my problemsm melt away how had i never known the solution was so simple it has been under my nose all along thank you op thank you
    yesyou should you sound like an annoying faggot that blames his problems on something else this site didnt affect your life consider rethinking your life
  why did you link me you dumb bitch
  i thought you and op were the same and i only read  is that the secret is that it is that it  part of your post
  should i leave 4chan for good    didnt even read the rest of your post but yes for sure absolutely    this place is full of angry underage autistic shitposting retards almost everytime i come on this website i end up in a bad mood ive been here for nearly 12 years its also amazing how much better my life was before 4chan and as soon as i started posting it all went downhill almost immediately    like if you were able to see the faces of everyone you post to and post with and see how young and retardedlooking they were and everything theres no way in hell youd want to hang out with them and talk to them in real life so why do it through a computer    that said blue boards that are hobbyspecific arent that bad splitting 4channel into two sites was the best idea ever i also obviously the freedom of anonymity and dont have to worry about yearsold posts coming back to bite me in the ass like they do people on twitter or whatever or have to apologize and lose my job because i said that a song was retarded or whatever
  bahahahaha this is cute id say yes if youre a transsemidwarffatblackjewishsjwautist its just too uphill you know but if youre not then consider that everyone who exposes themselves here get under some kind of lowly attack then again some people who expose themselves here also get some love to go with the h8 and that exact argument could be used to conclude that everyone should get off 4chan   idk me i sorta react to the hatred with spite or keep doing the same things but ironically or whatever   doesnt sound like a bad idea to leave though not because youre a pussy but because everyone with a piece of mind should
  what is this drivel
  actually yeah its a major step in teh right direction because 90 of all content on 2018 4chan is incels spreading shit around being too short and bad boys stealing the nice girls because good guys are manipulated by roasties and most people who read that are young and dumb enough to believe it because its marketed as red pill and theres no way youd want to be one of those blue pill soibeans no sir cause being blue pilled means youre wrong and ignorant while red pill mean youre smart and enlightened 100 of the time    theres also a whole culture of deflecting ones flaws and telling yourself that your life isnt so bad because at least youre not chris chan or something so then you dont feel the need to improve your own life
  honestly theres no reason not to leave 4chan its a shitty emotionallyunderdeveloped selfloathing hugbox echo chamber
  definitely leave /fit/
  this can be applied to any internet community not just 4chan
  its not you fucking brainlet did i ever say that its not that my problems are caused because of 4chan i started seeing things as problems that arent because of 4chan       it actually got better with that 4 channel shit but its still bad imo      well thats what i thought
  look at yourself youre asking 4chan if you should leave or not think about it do you want to leave or not if you do then leave if not then dont but asking 4chan children the answer wont help you
whenever i try to study i get depressed because i realise i am too stupid for this whenever i work in a job that doesnt require an education i get depressed because i realise this is all ill ever amount to in life     i know that nothing that is a job you get paid for is truly worthless and the world still needs mcdonalds workers and warehouse stockers but it is still far far too crushing to know that this is the best i can do and my fate in life     i know not everybody is going to be a doctor or an author or do something great not everyone gets to be a winner and someone has to be the one to get the shit end of the stick but i cant fathom any way to gather the will to live if i know ill always be nothing     this is a predicament i dont know what to do with    studying to become a nurse didnt work out either i couldnt finish my first year because it was its own kind of nightmare wanting to help people is one thing but spending 8 hours a day keeping alive people who would be better off dead simply is not something i can do either    killing myself would entirely destroy my family which is already fragile from mental illness and deaths relating to it and i cant do that to them
skilled trades manual labor etc work with your body not your mind either that or find a workplace that you like just because you are not good at studying doesnt mean you cant be taught how to do a nob very well if its labor ease into it and youe body will adjust plus not all labor jobs are being filled because its not a respectable profession like a lawyer or doctor jobs need to be filled and frankly if you get the right one they dont pay to bad either hours might not be great body might hurt but you get used to it hope this helpsanon
  trades police depends on country fire army are all important to keep society running police/fire service/army especially are respected    if by important you mean any of well paying/prestigious/high status the answer is unfortunately no from everyone i know
  ive done a physical job before i dont mind it being physical it was the worthlesness that was killing me i had the ambulance called to me twice from work within a year for being suicidal and those were only the two times i was caught      i cant be a cop ive got a criminal record i tried to become a nurse to become a paramedic but simple basic nursing was too unendurable my country has a madnatory military service but i got excused by a doctor because of my mental health issues and history of selfdestructive behaviour    i just want a job that i can be proud of something that makes the world a better place
  there are in fact very few professions that absolutely require a degree you could in theory walk into a job in business banking sales etc but youd have to impress them with your personality energy and ambition and a history of dropping out of schools is not likely to do that    meanwhile the world will always need plumbers also electricians truck drivers bus drivers postmen cops firemen barbers salesmen auto mechanics etc etc etc    all honorable and wellpaying professions
  get some kind of technician job like electrician the training for it is technical but not really to the point that a dumb person wont be able to do it im not in that field but i think it is a very respectful field that can command amazing salaries
  i cannot name a profession that wouldnt require an education    which one of those jobs makes a difference in the world does a plumber lay on hos deathbed thinking i am so glad i devoted my life to fixing shitters      i already failed school to become an electrician i really was too stupid for that
  i already failed school to become an electrician i really was too stupid for that  god damn man well here is my tip that i only give people who literally cannot produce anything of value work for the government    seriously just google what the most accessible government jobs are what their requirements are and go get one you will have to do stuff but trust me it is nothing of value you will not have to produce anything which is why jobs are difficult the more wealth your labor is supposed to produce the harder it is but in the government you have to produce no wealth you just have to be there
you have deep rooted selfloathing that will most likely not be fixed from having a useful job that need to be fixed beforehand
  i already said i have a criminal record and i cant stand being worthless    i cant even have kids and have a purpose through them
mmm did a series on some jobs that dont require a degree heres the links hth        
whats the point of living if ill never be happy
despair is worth experiencing too
  but this much of it
none  the sentiment of the life you lived will keep you here though those small moments in the face of the sheer bullshit that reminded you humanity can be a good thing itll keep you here even when your life becomes saturated with that thing that makes living hell and that good stuff decreases to where all instances you observe it seem a part of your imagination  welp back to living for you i suppose have fun
  just to see what will happen
  so im supposed to live for a sentiment seems like bullshit    nothing good i promise you
  good thingsbad thingssuicide    op btfo get off my board nigger ebin banana man lmao ddd
  but like i implied in the op there are more bad things in my life than good especially in the future
  why you got something better going on back to work
you are somehow implying that you know that you will never be happy give some of us that magical futureseeingthing you have please
  apparently youre supposed to put maximum effort in as many things as possible no matter how bad you might be feeling and hope that something worthwhile somehow shows up as a consequence
because death is scary and because theres always a chance that maybe your life might just turn around some day  i personally hate living but im terrified as fuck of death i keep thinking that if life on earth is so cruel then why wouldnt the afterlife be cruel as well i know that there may or may not be an afterlife but the possibility scares the shit out of me
  itll get better some years after this you will feeling different than you do now hold on to that thought
  making other people happy
op try buying stuff like food and water for homeless people it might give you a sense of well being even if it is tiny
  whats the point of living if ill never be happy  to make others feel just as bad as you feel
whats the point of dying if youll never experience shit again  suicide is silly most of the time
  you want the meaning of life ill tell you what it is    to carry your burdens and strive for larger shoulders to carry them even farther
  fuck off die and then fuck off again
  this one op ignore the rest  live for spite if people say you should live and not kill yourself then make it so that the world was worse off with you in it youll show them
make fun of people it im in the same boat im never happy indulge in you hobbies or something you like
  youll be happy bro just trust
being happy is a meme you imagine it as some holy land in the future where your life is going smoothly and everything is as youve always dreamt it but thats wrong happiness is fleeting and short it happens often but people dont give it any credit because theyre busy waiting for the day they can finally be happy when i got fit/have a better job/a nicer car/ a bigger house/ a cuter gf/better grades/yadda yadda you will never be happy as in be and stay happy but you experiwnce happiness in small doses along the way thats all you get better make the best of it by seeking out those moments and actually enjoy them and dont forget to be grateful when you realize you had a happy moment today over time youll start to feel like the happy moments have become more and better and itll make you feel like youre life has gotten more enjoyable in general and especially in hindsight youll remember the happy moments more if you emphasize them also aidin in giving you the feeling of being happy and having a good life
  ill never be  how about someone else someone you care about would there be a point in seeing to their happiness
  well said
last night i had a really bad depressive episode i woke up in the middle of the night in tears and my girlfriend asked me what was wrong this is the first time anything like this has ever happened in the four years weve been dating but ive told her i have problems with depression i tell her whats wrong and she listens for the most part    im disappointed that all she seemed to be worried about was herself and our relationship she said stuff like how can you be happy in our relationship if youre depressed and other stuff like that im not upset with her and i know that nobody really knows how to handle someone with depression im just surprised all of the questions she asked were about herself
  looks like she doesnt understand how depression works get her a book or show her a video well if she doesnt try to understand herself that would be a bit disappointing
  if you woke up crying thats hormones mold/toxic environment or drugs not depression
  or alcohol
dude its been a rule since the dawn of time that you shouldnt cry in front of your girlfriend she wants to feel safe around you and how is she supposed to do that if she sees you crying
most people dont know what the fuck to say when theyre with a depressed person whos crying in front of them
how did you figure out what you want to do with your life    i dont have a thing that i like to do despite dabbling in many hobbies     friends urge me to do unrealistic shit streaming acting music when im not even that good at any     trying to get out of this low paying 9 to 5 but cant visualize a next step
  im sorry but this is the answer you are going to get from everyone life just threw me in a certain direction and i did not resist seriously most people just get into what is around them so what is around you what have you done before    also if you are not an antisemite then you may enjoy this video i like its message of never follow your passion but always bring it with you perhaps the best career advice someone has ever given  
  that was an interesting watch im about to watch again just to get the gist down better     i feel foolish in not knowing the opportunities around me even though that question may be rhetorical my short answer would show you the number of positions ive applied for yet havent even received a follow up from i dont think this new context provides that     ill take a better look around me to see where opportunity lies thanks anon
there is this girl 7/10 really cute smile and i adore her attitude     we talk a lot and shes very shy like a fucking lot but i cracked her by being funny and souave and it worked out well     whenever i talk to her she has this big beautiful smile on her face she doesnt do this with other guys btw    i didnt think a lot about it at the begining just wanted to know what kind of person she is without wanting to date her or anything     but as months pass i cant go a day without her damned smile when we talk i just melt inside and implode slowly copy from my last thread    so i asked her out a few weeks ago but we were ultimately tired the both of us as we had a hard day     thus bringing us to this thread    i then moved the date to next sunday opera bought the two tickets surprised her she liked it and went for it i felt really good as she gave me one of her heartmelting smiles shit i am weak bois    anyway she texted me a few hours ago and asked me if her bff a she can come with us do note that her bff is a friend of mine too and that we already did go out the three of us bars museums etc also note that from the beginning i was specific that i wanted to go to the opera only with her     this is very weird for me it doesnt make sense is this the stage before i get cucked/friendzoned should i just be frank and tell her i bought these tickets for the two of us so we can have a nice evening together if you dont want to come just be frank with me    shit
go out with her this time but if this scenario repeats youre clearly being friendzoned
  you cant get cucked if she is your girlfriend she friend zoned you if you made it clear that it was for the two of you ie a date and she says no she is clearly setting up that boundary for you
  the day i kissed my current gf i asked her out for a date and her later asked me if it was ok to bring a girl friend of hers as well i was pretty bummed about it but i faked it and said ok no problem   in the end her friend didnt come i kissed her and she confessed that she expected that she wanted that but somehow she was too shy to make it happens weve been happily togeter for three years since  so go for it act like you dont care maybe try to take her home and if it feels like kiss her i think she likes you
  if youd prefer to do something just with her then you should probably just tell her that
  i can feel the passion and love that comes out those words mustve been a beautiful day for you bro good job     ill do that then i said that her friend will have a hard time looking for a free seat but if she does find one shes welcome it will be swell i can tell     thanks senpai
  it doesnt make sense is this the stage before i get cucked/friendzoned  this is the friendzoning stage she knows its supposed to be a date but shes not interested so shes bringing her bff along to turn it into a nonromantic outing with three friends its a girls way of saying i like hanging out with you but only as a friend   you might as well be frank to her about your intentions before you orbit her even more than you do now
  sure it was goodspeed anon
    these two if you make it out to be a huge issue that your mutual friend is going thats going to be a turn off theres a good chance the friend will leave you two alone eventually read the mood and see if it seems she is enjoying having you there next time you make plans insist on being alone
yesterday was a school dance my friend wanted to dance with this girl he had fallen for he had nightmares of her becoming lesbo she grabbed his hand and began to dance my autist friend yanks his hand from her then runs to the opposite side of the gym she wanted to dance with him her best friend told him she had feelings for him yet he couldnt fucking do it this is not the first time this has happened to him    why give him advice please  pic unrelated
  he is too scared of rejection i cant give any advice as im in the same boat so i just avoid situations like this completely
autist  if he really is its no wonder that he reacted with the threat response to someone who was not a threat thats a combination of autism and learned behavior from most people in life out to do you harm because you dont fit in the best thing you can do is literally talk him through interacting with girls step by step especially the nonverbal communication which he needs to learn
  ouch 4chan my soul you guys always say shit i know is true but has not been consciously acknowledged in this case its the threat response thing
  people probably pretended to like him to make fun of him before and he knows it will happen again in high school i was a balding autist retard and hot girls would constantly fuck with me one girl would send me notes about wanting to date me and it was obviously her or dudes she talked to in class fucking with me  first time i got close to forming a relationship id hear the girl made out with a guy at a party the night before and she was just using me emotionally or rebounding  another girl would start conversations in text but in real life would treat me like a loser  after a while you realize you arent actually wanted and its better to keep your dignity than give in and let people make you feel like shit in a vulnerable position then when you find people that do like you its hard to keep it going because youre still trained to avoid being vulnerable for survival
sounds like really bad anxiety probably just didnt want to dance in front of everyone  i was somewhat similar i used to avoid going to school dances with this girl because i didnt want to fucking dance but girls love dancing so it was hard to say so i just preferred more private things because it made me more comfortable    that autist behavior is unacceptable though if youre already at the dance and someone picks you then youve got no choice but to go along with it bucko running away from her on the dance floor is the worst form of rejection your friend is a dick
im probably gonna get rejected anyway so im just gonna be lonely until i cant stand it anymore
  my friend  dude youre on an anonymous forum stop with that pathetic shit we know youre the one with the problem
      its ok to admit it op we are anonymous here
  sounds like you had a panic attack at the most inopportune time you could ever have one  has this happened before
  basically this why even go through the trouble
  watch videos of ugly people picking up girls if they can do it you can do it
  no this did in fact happened to my friend i was there trying to encourage him
  no hes not actually autistic if he was then this thread would not be here
  we live in a very specialsnowflake part of canada so this doesnt happen here
51  45 erect penis    would it be all that bad to convince myself that im gay or at the very least bi so that i dont have to be lonely
  what race are you anon
  white
i dont know who told you there were more gay guys ok with babydicked midgets than there were women but they were lying
  oh
  ive been called cute by several anons on lgbt but obviously im taking them on their word alone
  oh what give me some actual advice
  1 if youre fat lose weight and measure again   2 convincing yourself that youre gay or bi works as well as a pray the gay away religious camp
  oh nothing you are fucked  short asians are excusable but a white guy who has kids height is done for you can probably hope for pedos or midget fetishists but i dont think these people would make fine partners you know
  thanks for nothing guess ill work up the courage to off myself eventually
so i am going to die alone then i realize that all the other posts are from one poster who probably is a troll but its just s possibly that what he says is true i am not going to live the rest of my life in this loneliness i cant keep going on like this i want to be happy but every way i turn there is an endless void staring back laughing at my face
  just go full monk mode op im in the same boat as you the difference being that im a spic might as well either live your life in peace or dedicated to some higher purpose ie god maybe try some hobbies travel read etc theres plenty more in life than getting your dick wet m8
my gf always pisses when she cums is that normal she cant make herself cum and no other guy has ever made her cum before me every time we have sex she cums 4 to 11 times but 2 or 3 of the times she squirts piss or something that smells of urea i think it comes from her urethra anyway i always have to shower after sex now is that normal
i wish i was you
  she cant make herself cum and no other guy has ever made her cum before me  gullible
shes a squirter and ya its piss    andshes probably lying that youre the only being on the planet including herself that can make her cum
  nice digits chekd     she didnt know what it felt like to cum when i met her and when i tried explaining it to her she didnt understand because you cant explain the feeling to someone whos never came before weve been together for 4 years and the first few times she didnt believe she was cumming just thought it felt really good
  ive literally never seen her make herself cum in 4 years we live together and i commonly ask her to touch herself during sex she cant
yes its normal
my condolences
how do i make sure my little brother and possible future sons are tough without abusing them    for context when i was younger my family was a disaster and it made me physically and mentally tougher than most of my peers and that led to confidence and strength as an adult yeah i was an edgy violent twat when i was a teenager but i got myself sorted out and was all the stronger for it the problem and yes i realize this is prime 1st world problem is that my parents got sorted out too my little brother grew up well fed with an ipad on his person 24/7 and because of that hes a cowardly little bitch not even by my standards by fucking anyones hes afraid to hold the leash of a well trained old dog that weighs 15 pounds he always wears all pads when on a skateboard or bike and never jumps or tries tricks he doesnt climb trees he doesnt play with dogs he doesnt wrestle with other boys hes obviously interested in doing that stuff but refuses to try out of fear of failure problem is almost all the mentally tough dudes i know got that way because they grew up hard and i dont want that for him he shouldnt have to worry about his family attacking him or whether or not he gets fed today but to me it seems like leisure has made him both physically mentally and spiritually weak i dont want him to be one of those dudes i see at uni where you can just fucking shut them down with a glance     i havent been pushing him about it much just offering to take him out to do stuff when i visit my parents but i feel like i have to get after it soon because my neutered father and coddling step mother sure arent gonna help him
  spiritually weak    mewonders if you actually even know what spirituality entails
    are you a sister or a brother    toughness is not willingness to do any of the cliche things you seem to think are worthwhile things    do they hurt no are they toxic masculinity also no that shit is stupid    but theres no rulebook that says he needs to be a bmxer dog lover likes physical roughhousing etc etc even if he is interested in these things the activities themselves arent the point and are a minor note    you make a boy/man tough by holding him accountable and giving him responsibility to manage as often as possible as often as you judge that he can reasonably handle at his development level    because who gives a fuck at age 30 if he climbed a tree as a little boy its far more important that he keeps his promises does right by people doesnt run from responsibilities or make excuses when he fucks up    good for you for taking the responsibility about this since your parents might not be pulling their weight
  very good post  i would add that this is actually a human responsibility not just male
  to clarify  physically  general health and strength    mentally  focus intelligence and mental endurance    spiritually   personal confidence moral integrity and not letting your mental or physical weaknesses dictate what you are         brother    rulebook that says he needs to be a bmxer dog lover likes physical roughhousing etc etc  yeah maybe i explained that wrong but my issue isnt his choices of activities its that hes a coward he obviously wants to do that stuff since half the youtube videos he watches are just young dudes fuckin around he just refuses to try anything difficult because he fears failing even on video games he plays on easy never tries new foods never takes a different path to school ruled by his fear of failure     and even though we like to think this isnt true yeah being a weak timid male will negatively impact your life in the long run     to be clear the same is true of girls and if my little sister was the same way id be worried about her too but shes a little hellraiser so shes alright i just think it applies slightly more to boys since on average they put more social status on that kind of thing and one of the biggest happiness indicators in humans is how well your peer group accepts you       see above
how old is he at this point      yeah maybe i explained that wrong but my issue isnt his choices of activities its that hes a coward    okay well it is actually important to separate those things or else he might become fixated on superficial ideas about masculinity very easily kids are impressionable little shits like that    so basically youre going to have to flex your brain because you know him and know what his tastes and proclivities are that you have to negotiate    he cant associate his ability to do those superficial things with manliness because the moment he cant do them his image of the proper man is shattered and hell be damaged at his falling short    so its on you to figure out how to pivot his focus instead to the reasons why you would do these things and how they might make you a better person what does he place his highest value most of his energy on these days
  age   hes 9    what does he place his highest value most of his energy on these days  his entire goddam life is as follows    1 up at 7am get dressed play on ipad until bus shows up     2 school he does well way better than i ever did academically which makes me proud but he seems to completely lack creativity or artistic talent which i speculate might again be that fear of trying anything new     3 gets home does homework plays on electronics for the rest of the day     a lot of what he does on the ipad is watch youtube and most of what he watches is videos of groups of kids or kids and their dads roughhousing playing with toys camping etc thats what really fucks me up he obviously wants to do this stuff so bad but hes just fucking afraid ive tried to take him camping to go fuck around at the park to go fishing but hed always rather just watch i was scared of shit as a kid too but i could summon enough passion to push through it i dunno with him    he was super excited when i signed him up for wrestling camp but as soon as he started losing he lost the heart for it
  have you thought about not pushing your fucking antiquated ideals of masculinity on him so what if he doesnt want to deal with your manly bullshit its his life he gets to choose how it goes this is a you problem not a him problem
  read the thread
  9 might be a bit early anon let those chicken hormones kick in a bit more  his behavior may be strongly reinforced at school have you asked his teachers what he is like there
  the kid is going to end up here in six years if op doesnt unfuck him and make him a normie
  go do fun stuff with him and give him the encouragement guidance and reinforcement he needs say go for a walk to the park and throw a football around
no creativity  he spends all day watching youtube he should be reading books or playing outside my parents always made me do a chore if i wanted to use the computer each chore was 30 minutes of pc time if i didnt like it i could buy my own computeri eventually did it built discipline   no confidence   maybe you should show him how to wrestle so he can actually win and feel good about it arnt you his older brother its your job to guide him maybe start working out with your brother get into lifting weightlifting builds confidence fast it feels really good when your numbers increase and you can see your improvement keep a lifting journal
   he watches videos   he obviously wants to do this stuff so bad but hes just fucking afraid    this sounds so fucking autistic watching something doesnt mean you want to do it yourself sperg are you sure you are not just proyecting your own ideas on your little brother like every other failure of a parent
  just because he spends all his time watching videos on this one topic doesnt mean hes interested in it
  guy who was abused as a kid wants to abuse his little brother   hmmm
  so your theory is what hes some kind of autistic antisocial type but is super into highly social activities like playing dont misunderstand youre wrong i dont expect your answer to make sense im just curious how it fits together in your head
  i wont want to do the thing its evil and he shouldnt experience that  look anon wants to do the thing
  yeah rough him up a bit beat him up with your pals im sure he will appreciate it
      are you guys retarded or what
  9 might be a bit early anon  honestly i feel like i should have paid attention sooner      we do that a bit he always comes with when i visit my parents house to walk my old dog but keeping to his patterns he only plays on easy mode so to speak     go long  uh no thats okay      he should be reading books or playing outside  i agree completely     maybe you should show him how to wrestle  bitch i tried hell just the other day when i dropped by he was setting up this nerf hammer thing and kicking it over telling me he was practicing kickboxing when i asked him if he wanted me to teach him how to really kick he said yeah but as soon as it came time for him to try fucking   uh no thats okay    maybe start working out with your brother  i also tried this a while back he was chilling at my place and he was watching me work out and wanted to learn but he didnt have the focus and determination to get out 1 good pushup it wasnt a strength thing he was obviously strong enough he just didnt want to put any discipline or focus into cleaning up his form he just gives up as soon as any effort is required            read the thread       im gonna assume this is shitposting if not just read the op again i guess
  i know exactly what you mean homes my little brother had the same problem till he got a bully like a perfect bully not the smashinyourteeth type but the takeyourmoney throwawayhomework type just enough to give him some anger so he has fire to work with    guessing your bro goes to a pretty nice school tho huh
  he sounds sorta like he needs to be convinced he actually wants to have fun i cant think up a better solution at the moment than to keep trying to encourage him
op you sound like a stand up guy people who think youre trying to force masculinity on your brother or abuse him clearly arent reading the thread     it sounds like you have already made some good attempts all i can suggest is to take it slower and make the activities less intimidating  not a whole wrestling camp but maybe a move or 2 maybe using youtube to learn together if he likes it so much and rather than fully camping maybe a day in the woods together climbing and getting dirty or a make a bon fire together and burn or cook some stuff introduce him to less intimidating and less time consuming activities and maybe hell start to feel more confident to try the bigger ones
have him learn to ride a bike and take him fishing they both build patience and persistence you usually get hurt a bit trying to ride a bike i scraped all of the skin on the medial side of my arm off and my stepdad poured hydrogen peroxide over it it sucked but i toughed it out  you can get him into some kind of selfdefense training  playing cards and games with dice can teach probability and chance teaching him to make informed decisions can help teach him how to cross streets  you could get him a tiny animal with a short life span like a fish that you can both take care of among other things it can give him an introduction in how to deal with loss when it dies  teach him how to deal with bullies in school teach him diplomacy and negotiation tactics and when its appropriate to just ignore them each parents approach to this seems to vary imo beating the snot out of the bully off of school grounds should be an option but only as a last resort kids will sometimes back off to some degree if your kid repeatedly calls them out because it makes the other one look like a wimp in front of the other kids   what you teach him in regards to bullying will influence how he deals with bullying in the adult world so be careful
  i think your persistence will pay off but it might be okay for you to talk to him about why hes not trying these things it sounds like you got a good grasp on his personality but have you spoken to him about this yet
  i think your brother is actually a girl trapped in a boys body she likes watching hunky men wrestle around and be manly but she would rather look watch and take a more supportive role like cooking and cleaning
  maybe using youtube to learn together if he likes it so much  oh this is a good fucking idea i should try this if he digs that kinda stuff we could make videos about learning shit then i could teach him video editing too      he needs a bully   honestly its kinda fucked up but ive thought this too a lot of my biggest growth moments in life having been dealing with an adversary strength confidence the capacity to harm others the harmful effects of that violence on yourself and others all that came from bullies of one type or another     guessing your bro goes to a pretty nice school tho  fuck yeah son all the kids have school issued phones and tablets high speed wifi everywhere zero tollerance violence policy one of my bros friends got suspended for making finger guns and shouting bang      have him learn to ride a bike and take him fishing  he rides his bike with full pads never tries anything interesting took him fishing once and he cried because we had hurt the fish that doesnt actually bother me much his interests lie outside of outdoorsy shit which is fine    you can get him into some kind of selfdefense training  ive been in kickboxing taekwondo and jiu jitsu for my entire life and he thinks its the coolest thing ever but he just goods around in class and shuts down when it comes time to buckle down and learn    teach him how to deal with bullies in school  discussed above but they dont really have those in rich white people schools     i appreciate the insight though      have you spoken to him about this yet  a bit but he isnt a very introspective person which frustrates me and i know that frustration cause me to start taking shots at him when he avoids answering     and i dont want that i want to show him cool shit and take him out to have fun since my parents dont give him the time of day      if thats how it is fine but i want my sisters to be able to exert their wills too
    take your ideological echochamber somewhere else      he was super excited when i signed him up for wrestling camp but as soon as he started losing he lost the heart for it    if hes obviously open to this stuff then thats actually half the battle     but the reality is the challenge steepness may be too much for him at this age and you need to break down the increment of whatever hes doing even further nothing wrong with that    he may need help facing his personal intimidation but at 9 hes not going to know how to articulate things    it sounds like he has no structure given to him by your parents if he has the freedom to fuck around on the ipad if hes breezing through homework and schoolwork then hes just not given enough to do by volume and difficulty    i think hell be fine because youre paying attention honestly and he seems to like you so hell pay attention to you you need to keep setting a good example    if you are a functioning and independent adult you might want to take your concerns to your parents finally get across to them that hes different than you and your siblings and they need to adjust their fucking parenting game
  op when i first saw this thread red flags and alarms started appearing everywhere but after reading through it i think youre gonna be a great dad some day
you stupid fuck you just show him each time how you are so much better then him and push him and tell him how he does it wrong and should be stronger more disciplined etc when he is older he will put kiddie porn on yourpc and will have you arrested you breath that you feel better then him probably he just doesnt want you to always look down on him     just do what normal brothers do fight/wrestle as a way to cuddle and show affection so he will link strength with positive emotions but you will probably need to show you are more then him by going too far you will turn into some shitty teacher he is smarter then you the problem is you dont show him real respect be a friend not a superior in everything fake dad he should not hang out with you you turn every nice moment into a  i am superior  and will show that in a teaching moment
        you watch bear grylls that means you want to go and try to survive in the middle of the jungle no two ways about it    kids noaways watch people playing videogames that they themselves never actually play you guys are being out of touch boomers
did you also really didnt give up and kept on learning the things he does likes or do you just go muh thats stupid  talk about the weeks and weeks you put in learning to appreciate what he likes in his ipad stuff im listening
  hi i dont really want to post a wall of text i toughened up in life because of a death in the immediate family    im thinking just maybe youre overreacting to what is just a meek boy stand by him and hold him to his accounts but man fuck right off with this he gerrta get in the truuuuuuck and lathe woooood to be a reeeeal man just fuck right off with that elementary school bullshit    hes allowed to be who he is what isnt okay is not having the faculties needed to tackle life and that youre getting more than an address on here    just remember it takes all types
  abuse doesnt make you tough it just shows you what you already are
  1 dont baby them  2 teach them skills they can use like raft building and woodworking if a man can make something with his hands that is something nobody can take from him  3 be physically fit yourself and have them play sports at any level  4 talk to them about their history no matter what it can be art music war technology etc  5 listen to them  there is no way they will tell you anything if you try and force them and there is definitely no way they will listen to you if you dont even know who they are    my experience is that nobody listens nor appreciates you for you    so give them selfconfidence by letting them become selfreliant by for instance building shit and fucking it up and doing it with them like campfires   teach them to not fuck about with the basics though   my gramps taught me to be aware of where the barrel is pointed at and to check if the gun is loaded etc  even shit like peeling potatos and making dinner is useful  most shit i learned i got form scouts and my gramps
  have you tried asking him why hes so afraid of things i dont mean corner him and dig it out of him meet on civil ground and ask him to be honest im not going to roleplay as a mental health professional but that type of behavior might best be evaluated and treated by a professional theres quite obviously something going on since that type of apprehension is more than just abnormal     inb4 forced medication  do not force or even give him the idea to take any sort of psychiatric medication at his age       he just gives up as soon as any effort is required    theres always the possibility that he keeps giving up is not due to a lack of effort but due to a lack of interest there are other things that build discipline that dont involve strenuous physical activity such as learning to play a guitar    even then if youre this concerned about your little brother i would recommend reading on how to raise children outside of an imageboard books by respected child psychologists is a good start for anyone
  you cannot control how your brother grows up and you can only control how your kids grow up until they start to actually grow up you need to reconcile with that instead of trying to force others into activities and such that you personally value and believe teach good morals try and interact and understand why they value the activities they choose to do
  you just show him each time how you are so much better then him and push him and tell him how he does it wrong  im not gonna give this a long reply since im pretty sure you didnt read the thread but i will say that a lot of the shit i try with him is stuff im not good at either i got the idea that he might just be intimidated by comparing himself to my skill level in certain things so i tried stuff neither of us knew and it wasnt any better      took me a minute to figure out what you were saying here but yeah kinda ive tried talking to him about the games he plays but the only thought he articulates is because its fun which i believe but doesnt give me much to work with       fuck right off with this  ive said in the thread already that its not his choice of activities that bothers me if he wants to just game or surf or cook or whatever the fuck happens to interest him throughout his life fine what bothers me is his total unwillingness to put in any effort towards achieving his goals he wants to learn how to wrestle a lot once hes actually there uh no thanks    he wants to be on the leaderboard for some game he plays but when we pull up strategies to maximize scores uh no thanks     rinse and repeat he doesnt want anything bad enough to work and get it or hes so afraid of failing he wont try at all this isnt about being a reahl mayun this is about developing your will enough to achieve your goals       workin at it brother      forced medication  this is exactly what im afraid of my parents are both doped up on prescriptions 24 hours a day and they will just drug him if thats the easiest way out they tried it with me when i was a kid and it is not happening to him    due to a lack of interest  like i said ive been trying to diversify but as of yet he seems mostly interested in youtube and games although interest might be a strong word becaue he never seems to go deep
  recommend reading on how to raise children outside of an imageboard  yeah i probably should and i have a bit but my issue is that a majority of the literature in that genre seems more about how to make your kid succeed at school how to make them behave how to make them polite i never see how to make them creative or mentally tough or morally resolute a lot of them will say theyll help your kid be happy but when you look a little closer they seem more focused on keeping mom and dad happy i dont want my siblings/kids to be polite orderly little office workers unless thats what they actually want for themselves not because their parents or a teacher said they should and a lot of those books lean that way maybe i just have to look harder       you can only control how your kids grow up until they start to actually grow up  what did she mean by this
  mostly interested in youtube and games  have you tried gaming with him some of my best memories with my family are of game nights either board/card games or ye olde ps2
my brothers and i would beat the piss out of each other nearly every other day our dad would beat us when we were loud at dinner my mom would pop us lul whenever we disrespected her we all turned out pretty god damn good straight good wives good jobs happy and good bonds with one another whip the fuck out of him whenever there is a behavior you disagree with /thread
  from your post its evident you didnt turn out so good  advocating conditioning by violence is nothing less than stupid thankfully op isnt
  this you can try teaching him to git gud at vidya
  hey chris chan ive watched you for years now how are you doing
  name him sue
  the electronic devices are the problem
  this sounds like that jordan peterson fella
  one of my brothers was a lot like yours when he was 3 or 4 he ended up more like you after finding a bit of confidence and just snowballed    i was similar except my brothers out so much hopelessly overwhelming violence on me that i learned to live life as minimize frequency and severity of attacks minimize fault minimize openings and dont give them anything to twist into an excuse   i ended up really fucked up not even fearful just hopeless and unwilling to put myself out there eventually the brother i mentioned decided he wanted to fix it and help me heal  what worked was a nurturing guiding touch asking me about myself and taking my feelings into consideration he worked to identify why i would resist or avoid things not force me and then help me build confidence he gave me something to model myself after and grow into that i could reach just by putting in effort    i knew from experience that some fights are unwinnable but for a long time it was all of them he helped me win some of the battles he thought i needed to by guiding me to and through smaller ones that i could handle and saw a point to doing
i have a theory that men inherently know a baby is more important to women than they are this sets of a sort of jealousy in fathers as they are no longer the center of attention in a womans life do you think this is accurate fathers be honest
  yes this is why single mothers are trash as far as partners    i want an equal not another child to have to provide for    fuck you and your dirty little flesh balls op
with twins too    you dont love anything like you love your kids
  no you want a girl to submit to your every whim because you are a baby yourself not a real man
  yeah 3    you know true love
being a man is lonely
  that is a choice dear
  it is true kind of my husband was so shocked when i told him my children were the most important part of my life even more so then him he said his partner is more important because you can make more children and you chose your partner you dont choose your kids i said no that my children were more important because i made them they grew inside me and will always be a part of my in a way no one else ever can be that there are lots of things a partner can do to stop you loving them but amount nothing my child could do to make me stop loving them honestly i think it was a mistake telling him that and that it kind of changed our marriage in some indefinable way
    its okay they already know in some insintual way that we love children more and they also know that we are right in that deep down they know their selfish horny instincts try to tell them differently but the good ones know we are built for survival god wants us to bring children into the world and be attentive to them
  instinctual     my god    i just figured out 4chan menthey want submissive women with no kids because they are selfish af    wow     revelation
  its a sad truth that every man has to accept sooner or later you become a provider of income and security and nothing else until the day you die    thats the way of a man
  but as a woman i love that feeling that a man is bring home the bacon and i feel he loves the feeling too bringing home food to mom and baby dependent on him if you are a good dad your kids love you are much as the women who ruined their bodies over them
  my god  i just figured out 4chan menthey want submissive women with no kids because they are selfish af  wow  revelation  look at this retard who ever said i wanted a submissive woman
as long as you still have plenty of sex and make him feel like a man i dont see the issue
  fuck off ill be childfree forever even if it costs me being alone  i have crotch goblins
hate
  t single mother that cant find a date because no one wants to take care of another mans shit kid
  interesting as a dude both my wife and i have discussed how we both love the kids more and its sort of the reverse of what your husband said your children dont get to choose their parents but you chose to bring them into this world so you should care for them and love them dearly the other thing is that i see little bits of myself in them and empathise with them especially over things that i remember struggling with as a kid as well and feeling my own little triumph when they overcome it i actually find it strange that your husband doesnt feel the same
for most of human history humans didnt know how children were made    you might think its stupid but its only recently been understood that a man and a woman having sex would lead to a baby    think about it seriously for most of human history weve been without the nuclear family concept monogamy wasnt a thing people would have sex in all manner of situations    babies just happened sex wasnt monogamous early humans did not understand why the babies occurred they had sex and enjoyed it women occasionally gave birth those things were not connected until recent human history    the idea of having an instinct and knowing which child is yours isnt real its just something which feels right    before humans worked out that a man and a woman had a child theyd just raise humans in groups
  he said his partner is more important because you can make more children and you chose your partner you dont choose your kids  this is pretty fucking horrifying desu then again maybe i just think that because im a woman
  yeah thats true my mom was the sun in the sky when i was a kid but as i grew into a man i learned how much my father sacrificed for me in a different way family can be really great and i want one of my own
  i dont understand how people can view kids like they are commodities thats a fucking human being even if it wasnt your kid saying something like durr who cares if it dies you can always have more what the fuck people really out here being sociopaths
    i think he thinks differently about it because his first child that he had young was by a really shitty person she dosent care about her kids much at all had 4 by 4 men in 4 years my husbands daughter was the first she gave up custody and has not contacted her in 6 years one of her other children died as a baby from her neglecting it i think it had worped his prospective on how women think of their children also i think he was trying to in his own way comfort me and show how deeply he still loves me i had just had a miscarriage and tho it was not the right thing to say i think he ment it out of love and wanting to reassure me he dose love his kids hes a good father and is very carring to them im not sure he has the same deep overwhelming kind of love that i have for them but what he has is still enough he would die for them kill for them works hard to help keep them provided for and spends time with them he would never abandon them or me so im not going to say hes a bad father or anything
  i think he was trying to in his own way comfort me and show how deeply he still loves me i had just had a miscarriage    well thats a pretty big and important part of the story to leave out     why are women like this
  this both mom and dad have different roles it needs to be that way imo thats what helps most to have some kind of preparation for being an adult
  he sees them as the result of their bond not as commodities for him that bond is the most important thing because its the very thing that lead to the creation of their family without that bond there is no family it isnt wrong or sociopathic to view it like that
  he didnt say he would care or that it would not be heartbreaking to loss a child only that he could keep going even with that grief but that if he lost me it would destroy him ie i miscarriage and had almost bleed to death he was sad we lost a baby but he would not want to live anymore if i had died too also if you look at history what he said is actually a common outlook and not in the ment to be comforting way he ment it people used to have like 10 kids because so many died and did not make it to adulthood its very sad but thats how it was before modern medicine
    my coworker literally said as much to her husbands face when they were having a rough time i dont care if you leave i have the children to care for now he stayed afterwards lmao
  i wasnt sure if i wanted to get into all that because its not the most pleasant thing to discuss but i saw people were not understanding what my husband really ment so i thought further explanation was needed
  exactly you understand what he was trying to say
  i dont want to get into my personal issues  but ill totally paint my husband as an asshole to random strangers     lmao why are women like this
  thats not true at all only your perception i didnt paint him as anything other then a man who loves his wife above anything else your the one who either has a low opinion of men or is a man and wants to play victim by making assumptions
  its an attempt to empathize rather then making baseless accusations
  definitely guaranteed to be that latter hes probably bitter cuz theres no one wholl defend him like youre defending youre husband and wants to lash out to make you feel shitty instead
  they are selfish af  everyones selfish and anyone who professes otherwise is doing so for some kind of gain   thats not to say you shouldnt ever do anything charitable thats saying however that you have to be very dim to build your life around your charity why shouldnt your partner be someone you want to be with     frankly i think theres a sort of nobility to being able to admit that youre not a saint rather than doing what a lot of desperate fuckers do marry a single mother and then compete with/abuse the fucking kids children are 30 times more likely to receive physical abuse from a step parent than they are from their biological parents
  thats what i thought too you grasped what his meaning was and did not just assume the worst     maybe even when i said i regret telling him that is because i know it hurt him to see that he is 100 for me and that im not 100 for him only for my children i wish i had not put it so bluntly to him even if it is true i could go on living if i lost him and still had my kids i would kill myself if i lost my children he would be devastated if he lost our kids but if he still had me he could go on that doesnt make him bad i think it hurt him that im his number one but that hes not mine my babies are i didnt mean it to be hurtful but i can see why it was especially because i know he was only trying to comfort me from our loss i was very upset tho and just wanted him to understand how deep the loss was to me i wish i had explained it differently so i didnt hurt him
im a bit tired and thats some very loaded context but ill throw in my two cents    it is generally more pertinent to care for the human that cannot care for itself rather than the one that can yes i feel that saying important sort of objectifies the two things and tries to quantify them and present them in a way that doesnt really make sense your so should be important to you your baby should be important to you to say one is more important diminishes the significance of the other the reason im really sticking to the contextualization is because both things require attention and care    the thing i find with women is that once they have a baby it becomes the entirety of their focus its not our baby its my baby i feel that is really a flawed mentality thats often confused with care when it reality its obsession women tend to develop such a strong emotional bond and investment with their baby during pregnancy that it becomes their life i dont really see anything too wrong with that but its everything after the support groups the friends the family society we enable it we dont tell you that youre neglecting your partner or that youve lost your own independence being obsessed over your child is something that we put in a positive light because its easier to do than explain the nuances of the situation because enabling obsession at least ensures attention and care    so yes im going to be a bit hurt if the person ive emotionally invested myself in for the past however many years married and had children with tells me that our child is more important than me i will not go along with an insult while shes taking care of the baby im taking care of her if that isnt something that she can appreciate then child support it is i will invest my time but i will not throw it away you can call that whatever you will
  you perfectly described why no man will date a single mom they dont to come second in the relationship to chads offspring however when it is a mans own child it is a different story believe it or not men can love their kids too and understand why the mom their gf or wife puts their child first
  why do men not care about babies no wonder there are so many broken homes
  women without kids arent all submissive  it makes sense to never associate with single moms they have already failed a relationship in a big way it makes sense they will fail the next one in a way they are viewed the same way women view men  if you are thinking this is mean then maybe you should stop being so mean to everyone around you
  men care they just dont obsess    i also believe that its somewhat naive to believe that one party and specifically the male party could be implied to be solely responsible for the emotional and physical separations within households     men may be more inclined to act first but that doesnt mean that theyre just leaving because they dont care about the child in many cases it can be the contrary if the household is going to be a dysfunctional one sometimes its better to not give the child time to emotionally bond to you rather than leave its life when it can actually understand whats happening    all in all thats a fairly complicated subject certainly not one that can be summarized with such a simplistic and biased quip
not a father but if you buy into the whole oedipus/electra shit it definitely makes sense
    and who the fuck are you exactly looks like i hit the truth every guy on here is into anime and subs
  dubs  subs
  im not even a single mom you guys are absolutely retarded   
  hi there just dropping by to submissive women are awesome fuck anime though    and i guess to be more on topic i think that the love for children is different than the love for a romantic partner a kid is partly oneself and has ones blood running through its veins a woman might cheat on me or fall out of love with me a lot of things can change between adults but i would love my kid forever even if it grew up to become a heroin addict  i would never say shit like this out loud to my old lady though  what the fuck is wrong with you people  dont even think about who you love more than who thats weird love isnt some commodity that can be split and measured like money and fucking beans youre all bitches and assholes for thinking like that just love each other and be with your families
  i think that theory has a name actually there is certainly one for the child even a baby seeing the father as a competitor for the mothers attention i remember learning about it also its normal for the mother to prioritise the baby    my own hierarchy list on who is most important to me is  1 god  2 best friend  3 wife  4 other friends    a solid and true friendship between two men whove been though shit has a much deeper and more honest type of love than romantic and sexual love between man and wife
  single mom hate is some /r9k/ and /pol/ hybrid meme
  haha thats funny glad he stayed though
  its really odd single moms are amazing and deserve a damn medal most are single moms because of deadbeat dads why arent the deadbeat dads hated
  you must not be married
  yeah i agree about love there is more than enough to go around no need to compare     as far as sub women it all comes down to selfishness guys wanting a girl to boss around and do everything for them
  im not a single mom and if i were 4chan would be the very last place id go to look for a dad for my kid
  you need to get over yourself
  as far as sub women it all comes down to selfishness guys wanting a girl to boss around and do everything for them    everybody is selfish to a degree we all have needs and fantasies and want to fulfill them  my girl loves to put on a french maid outfit and do chores around the house bending over in front of me to dust the counters etc it warms my heart after a long day of work to take a shower relax put my robe on sit in my favorite easy chair and call her over to demand a blowjob its fun and she enjoys getting bossed around too it turns her on if everybody is happy then whats the problem  if she is stressed out and or sick or tired then i am more than happy to let her have a day off from the sub routine and rub her feet or eat her pussy for forty five minutes before i fix her a steak and we cuddle on the couch and watch movies people should learn to give as well as take
  im right arent i     people marry their best friends
  some are more selfish than others she does it and pretends to like it because she knows you want it women are less selfish than men all goes back to the babies
  she does it and pretends to like it because she knows you want it    hahahaha okay honey   beg your pardon but we are talking about a girl who asks permission to wear the collar i got her to work so that everybody can see that she is owned every time we have sex she always says thank you afterwards a lot of the domsub shit that we do is her idea not man    but okay keep making assumptions about people that you dont know and assuming that everyone must think exactly as you do    women are less selfish than men  yikes im not even touching this one
  a lot of the domsub shit that we do is her idea    because she knows you like it
  suit yourself sweetie
  healthy marriages are about the partner of course you love your kids like nothing else but your partner is number 1 and that love and devotion should be mutual spoiling kids leads them to be immature unhealthy adults
  4chan would probably be the last place where youd find a guy willing to deal with it  im not sure what youre implying with this post if you think men are somehow missing an opportunity by a single mother not looking their way you have a thoroughly inflated sense of selfworth i can literally think of exactly woman in my life that id be willing to do that for      the balance is supposed to come with time   theres a point where the mother is supposed to stop doting on them and start grabbing the little shits by their scruffs whenever they get out of hand theres a point where theyre too rowdy for a womans touch and she hands them off to her husband hes still warm with them but more in a get the hell on with it kind of way than a hand holding sort of way  that point of transition is usually when a woman starts thinking more about her relationship with her husband again
  exactly one
  saying dear unironically
  god youre really dense
well of course shell love the kids she feels connected to them on a whole nother level a relationship between a man and a woman is worth as much as fuckall nowadays    still whats the point of kids its just you acknowledging youre finite in your time like youve already given up and started to live for your kids instead seems kinda stupid if you ask me what if world war 3 arrives even if it doesnt take a good fucking look at the world and at what its becoming you dun goofed your children you made a selfish decission because you didnt even take that into account
  i just hate the droning noise their faces make when the parents ignore them and just sort of shove an ipad or cell phone at them to no avail
  they world is a safer more civilized place now then it has ever been through out history before life expectancy is longer then it has ever been as long as you do your best by your child and try to give them a good start in life your not being selfish children are amazing and seeing them grow and learn is a hugely rewarding part of life
  that article is still placing all the importance on children though ensure you dont put your kids first for your kids benefit hes just trying too hard to find a clever way to tell parents to stop spoiling the shit out of their little brats
  thought a kid would keep him around eh no amount of attachment could keep a man around your level of nagging and mental instability    be gone hoe
    this is actually just a womans argument because it goes along with the one thing they value the most attention the man is not pissed off about not being the centre of attention anymore he is probably pissed off that the woman starts doing a bunch of bullshit once they have a kid like withholding sex because looking after the kid was too tiring or a whole slew of other reasons related then they probably have to listen to a bunch of bullshit whining from the woman as well about the kid and probably get a lecture of how they dont know what it is like etc this is multiplied by 10 if the woman does not work and the man is the income of the household absolutely embarrassing argument made by a woman or a totally feminized man
move somewhere else  i know nobody  0 friends to hang out with  what do meeting people was easier when i was going to school
  meetupcom
  go to pub drink few pints approach someone
find a hobbies group with the same interest as you something that happens once or twice a week keep at it eventually they tend to move youw into their social circle  going to pubs or bars are a good shot also
  presumably you have a job talk to coworkers develop onthejob acquaintances eventually someone maybe you will suggest a group go for a drink after work or some such    say hello to your neighbors    look around for clubs teams volunteer work
what should i do is there a chance    meet cutie at uni takes the same classes as me  start talking often and online  play games together have streaks with her on snapchat  few months pass and ive been too pussy to ask her out  shes surrounded by orbiters  at an end of trimester party we get along really well and were touching each other  next morning she tells me she wants us to be friends  blurt out like an idiot that i like her  2 months since then and im still into her and nothing seems to have changed  been starting to minimise contact
  doesnt sound like it dude give it some time and youll get over her coming from somebody who literally cant stop developing feelings for people i find that if theyre not reciprocating i just have to let it go and let those feelings develop and die in due time good luck
  any tips on how i can do this or should i just cutting contact/avoiding
hey /b/ros im thinkinking about joining the us air forcei read that that they do fbi background checks if i failed a drug test once almost a year ago can i still get in since the failure i have quit weed and drugs altogether and have been making great decisions will they maybe consider it a young dumb mistake
just tell them you only tried it once if it ever comes up i fucked up and said yes i had smoked before when i joined the army and the guy at meps said as long as you only tried it 3 times youre ok just dont say shit and youll be good airforce is a good choice especially for money for school and the war deployments are short as hell
  besides the worst that will happen is youll always be randomly selected to piss test no big deal
i live in constant fear that i will lose my friends  idk how common this type of fear is throughout my life i met a lot of people whom i made friends with 90 of those people betrayed me and i ended up being really sad about losing them because i get attached to my friends now keep in mind that i am 18so a lot of these things happened when i was a child so they had a big impact on me  even nowadays i fear that some of my close friends will leave me when i expect it the least even though i may not have a reason for that everytime i see a friend talking to someone else i get anxiety and immediately start thinking how much it would suck if that person replaced me this is one of the reasons why i cant be happy anymore and i dont know what to do about it and it also sucks because i hate seeing myself as a jealous person because i know thats not who i am   i know that friends come and go and that i shouldnt get too attached but that is something i cant really help because i like to value my close friendships
  heres the redpill there will be friends that come into your life and youll have a very close bond and eventually youll lose touch with these people itll hurt so just treasure the times you have with them and with each parting reflect on the fact that you may never see them again itll make you appreciate the time more    its the best you can do im sorry that life is like this anon you sound like a good guy

common interests you have to always target that when coming up with subjects for convo starters    eg theres this girl from my old high school that i want to take on a date i have never talked to her in my life but i saw a few months back that she went on vacation to italy or some shit plan hit her up and say that me and my mates are planning a visit to italy and i want her input on it take it from there    its not 100 guaranteed but talking about something she cares about does a lot for you if you see she likes squash tell her you have always considered playing squash i mean who hasnt really smashing a ball against a wall is top tier entertainment she likes hiking tell her about some hiking trips youve done and ask her about hers etc etc     dont tell her anything that isnt easily falsifiable and keep lies very simple and innocent    pic unrelated but you should give it a listen as its a great album
  those are great ideas for topics thank you   how do i start the conversation itself though just say hi    also will check out the album the cover looks cool
start it off with nigger
  yeah a simple hi hows it going should be enough to get you started just make sure you know where youre going from there and youre golden    i even started convo with this qt314 from work by sending her an article about people who brought lunch from home because she did seriously dude just put yourself out there and experiment especially in early stages its all about her if you play your cards right shell fall for you and more than half of the work is done also dont forget that theres more fish in the sea
be me  locked doors to room because brothers are annoying  watching amazing spiderman cause im bored  mom on phone  starts banging on my door  anon open your door now  whatdididojpg  shits pants  opens door  mom bursts in and yells at me for locking door  mom looks at tv then at me  what are you watching this is for boys  shitherewegoagainjpg  mom beats me for watching spiderman while calling me a lesbian  mom then unplugs tv wires and cables  tv falls and breaks  tv is thrown at me  mom leaves room  mfw i was called a lesbian for watching spiderman  mfw mom was on phone w/ dad while this happened  mfw dad thinks i was watching porn  mfw my leg is bruised and bleeding from tv
this wasnt very good bait but i chuckled so have a bump
  looks like hell good luck in life op
  you really should try nofap it works
  i literally have no concept of knowing how to fap
this is what happens when you watch tas instead of the holy trinity
    you sound filipino are you
at a meet up in a bar  37v  get there 30 minutes early  full intentions of just watching and providing the odd commentary  stunning 8/10 sits in front of me  have a pretty good conversation  meetup starts she has to leave early  gives me her number message her to make sure its not fake its real  pic related over past few days    what am i getting myself into literally asked her to hang out expecting a hard no
  another convo screenshot  another retarded writing style 
how could you not have seen this shes an older single mother not exactly the most desirable partner in the world even if she is hot just do whatever im sure shed be willing to overlook any spaghetti you drop
  im literally retarded but thanks for pointing that out    so youre saying i dont have a chance im confused
  no what im saying is that shell try her hardest to overlook any autism just ask her out of course you have a chance just be warned dating single mothers is not the best experience in the world
  dating single mother  y i k e s
    is dating a single mother a bad thing ive never been in this situation before and dont know what im doing
    i know this should be on r9k but i do feel theyre too blinded to propaganda and cant rationally think    i dont hate women nor i think all are sluts  however i feel physically disgust over discovering a girl has lots of sexual partners and i stop seeing her as potential marriage partner and just see her as cheap dump and pump material    is this normal  ive tried to rationalize that being cucked is not the end of the world and even while i still try to rationalize my feelings i cant stop but feel disgust  ive come to the conclusion this is biological and comes from evolutive reasons being cucked means your genes dont survive    however i cant stop but feeling happyness over the slut misery after she cant find a nice bad boy that is 6 tall and is a millionaire and she has clearly hitted the wall    i know all these r9k pua redpill shit but however i cant stop feeling like a bit of revenge over sluts    however is more about women not being aware of their sexual market value and wasting their youth rather than proper hate    i know this is r9k material but i see those guys suffer from cognitive bias and cherrypick their stuff
  ive met many many many women who are nothing like what is being advertized by those self manipulating weirdos of incel redpill whatever    so on the basis of mine and many others experiences i can say that you are being deceived either actively or unknowingly
  i know by basics of logic and knowing a fell logical fallacies you find out their bs is just bs    it comes down to cherrypicking examples of ninfomanous women on social media and cognitive bias    it seems not all women are whores and some even hate sluts conservative women
is this normal    i feel physically disgust over discovering a girl has lots of sexual partners and i stop seeing her as potential marriage partner   normal    just see her as cheap dump and pump material   not normal because this way you become one of those sexual partners silly frogposter
  i think most guys feel the same way we all have expectations and wants from our partners women typically dont want to date a guy who is unemployed is a manlet or cant take care of themselves just as men typically dont want to date a whore or a fat girl its just how we work and theres nothing wrong with that
  you should have standards its right that you find sexual promiscuity wrong nor it is mysogynism you can still appreciate women and avoid stds op
is it a problem if my liver starts to hurt i have this feeling like theres pins being pushed into it and i think it might be bad
are you sure its your liver
probably pissed off a haitian
      so youre having a sharp pain in the upper right quadrant of your torso is it below the ribs    are you having any other symptoms do you have any other conditions how old are you
can someone try to explain to me why im obsessed with validating everything i think or do through strangers on the internet  i can go months being unable to decidd on a thing all the while asking around on multiple places here other boards other sites to make sure over and over that i am making the good decision  it cripples me like right now i cant decide what to pick in a thing so ive been obsessively researching and begging for validation just to know that im not picking wrong  these things i need validation on are just about every step of everything i do recent examples a main to play on smash 5 a new online name a hobby what my favorite color is what my playstyle in games centers around what is best out of the rpg terms strength/dexterity/intelligence etc  all these things are of utmost importance to me i can not go on with living until ive decided which means im spending all freetime and even getting distracted at my job trying to figure out a decision  and of course when i do decide ill have another decision to start making just days later  i also go back on many decisions restarting the process entirely
4chan has eroded your sense of self worth and thus you seek validation for every action you take  congrats you fucking loser
  elaborate without being unnecessarily rude
    not only 4chan but all of social media that is basically designed specifically to have this effect on people like op
  im guessing you dont have many friends humans are traditionally influenced by friends and relatives and use them as sounding boards for new ideas if you have no friends or are not close with your family then youll either become completely unhinged and eccentric or use the next best thing to a friend which is an online community
  i honestly believe i have 0 friends yeah  i have people on friends lists but they add me out of nowhere or are friends of my sibling  the one person i still talk to who frequently described me as their best friend barely even chats with me anymore ive mentioned that ive been about to remove them and they add a bullshit excuse along with youre my dearest friend or similar i can no longer even see this person as a friend  a friend stays in touch daily unless impossible a friend is actively up for doing things together a friend is ready on a minutes notice to talk about problems a friend is usually open about their life in general what they do away from their computer family stuff etc  this person used to be that friend now theyve even admitted to being a new person except they consider themselves to have improved while in actuality they singlehandedly went out of their way to kill this relationship
how do you fuck around im tired of not getting laid theres a girl i know i can get with but im not extremely into how long should i date and how should i break up with her and whats the best strategy to have sex with girls knowing you are going to break up with them
i told a good friend to meet in a cafe since we didnt see us 6 months turns out he brings some of his other friends i refuse to go there if he brings other friends  so he is probably now in the cafe and will call me what should i say
  tell him u have explosive diarrhea
  why wont you go
tell him you are sorry but you forgot that you had already scheduled a blowbang bukkake at your house and probably wont make it
as the title says im a relatively young man whos never kissed a girl much less had a girlfriend    i have a career and im not bad looking in the face but i grew up with an alcoholic father is it because i grew up in a dysfunctional family the root cause of me being fucked up and never finding a girl    i know the typical stereotype of the virgin guy but if you knew me youd think i have been with at least 3 girls girls have told me this then they get really surprised when i tell the truth    and the thing is i feel weird like if something inside me was broke i dont know how to explain it i feel wrong inside my head    how common is my situation and do you feel like i do is it really something i should worry at all
dont worry too much
if youre feeling broken then thats a problem with your selfesteem blowing your load isnt going to fix that go see a therapist
  this graph makes me sick  how come 90 of people manage to have sex between 1520 wtf
  keep hope bruh   im a 26 year old virgin and its a blessin o be pure only a few rare people find love at early age  youre a true rulebreaker sex is for slaves  be different be defiant  break the rules and do it your way   btw i have had a kiss it was cool i went to a party and she laid a kiss on me and 2 of my friends it was a pec on the lips tho and my friends were tryna get slob lol   this other time at my friends house this girl kept rubbin my dick behind his couch we were standing and she got flirty and i took her in m car and she flipt the script completely when i asked her for slob   kicked the bih out and i aint even take her number down   this other time i got jukes from a slutty pretty bih at a party i was so into it i grabbed her thigh and she took my hand off n kep jukin then i went to her x bfs house and he was stuntin we blowed weed in his basement  damn lifes good now i just make money   have fun dude youll get whatchu want eventually  
  im almost in the same shoes i think our situation has something to do with notaskinggirlsout maybe we should ask every single girl out until one says yes
  what do you mean  people are stupid and horny when they are young
  whats up with that random spike around age 45
  so i guess me and the other it nerds makes up for the remaining ten percent nice
  i grew up in a normal family my younger brother is turbonormie but im still 26 khv i guess im a schizoid or mentally ill person because ive never had a desire to chase girls or be in a relationship i just dont think with a dick
      im 27 in a few days almost exactly the same as op except my father isnt alco my older brother is pretty normal except he married the first girlfriend he ever had and has 2 kids now also not technically a virgin ive hired an escort twice this year dont regret it but thats another story    i know its mainly my fault partly an undiagnosed mental issue and partly the kind of company i keep and hobbies i have i dont see an end to it its not like a random girl is going to stop me in the street and ask me out or knock on my door or message me randomly online im definitely not putting any effort in so in short it will never happen
bump for interest
30 year old kissless virgin    i tried during my mid twenties but late twenties i kinda gave up too busy hanging with friends working and play games    im not a partier i dont drink smoke or do drugs i dont want sex i want a relationship i honestly if my partner was perfect in every other way i would be fine    im not ugly or have any mental or physical issues im not poor but im not rich enough to buy and fully support a stay at home wife im just average    but im still hopeful to find the one im not embarrassed about being a virgin im more bothered by the fear that im slowly becoming undateable by any moderatly attractive woman younger then 25
              how many girls have you asked on date / for their phone number this year  inb4  dont bother replying you will just keep inventing excuses go to dancing lessons also badoo is a thing
am 27 a kv with physical mental social and financial issues  you good op
27 year old not kisses but virgin reporting in    i already gave up
i still dont know how people manage to be virgins after 25 even a hikineet like me lost it once and i have dysthymia autism and didnt even finish hs
  oh shut up thats so tasteless  gee i dont get how africans are so poor even my autistic ass can get money
its over for you youre probably too ugly/autistic/both
hello ive just noticed today ive lost quite a bit of my hairline after washing it today  i havent seen it before it just happened to me so suddenly  am i fucked it that typical v shape ill have to add though i went through a lot of stress in the past 3 years and more my forehead is constantly feeling pressure and its really bothering me  could this be the cause will it regrow  ive read some articles and shit obviously but i dont know how much of it is a scam  should i bother to try and save it or just go and shave it  im
its okay your hair wouldnt have been enough to redeem you anyways everybody has hair anon well everybody except you i guess
  happens to plenty of people  have fun being bald
  basically happens to everyone you can either go donaldtrump and surgically glue your hair back or just forget about it plenty of successful business people are balding in their 20s and 30s some choose to shave it off if you dont have a gf then rip
try to massage your scalp to increase blood flow
  if you dont have gf then rip  lmao just because having hair is your only saving grace doesnt mean its the same for everyone some men look better bald than with hair youre also implying that having hair is the only thing women go for which tells me that youre an incel that clings to lookism beliefs enjoy your hair while you have it because it may start to fall out soon
man i havent seen this many posts about receding hairlines in all my time here till this weekend i just made one the other day and people told me to fuck off and see a shrink because i didnt want to lose my hair so i couldnt expect much real advice op was gonna repost it today to see if i could get some actual advice but seems the only people who want to help on this matter are up in the late hours  though do you have a picture of your hairline you can crop out your face and such just curious how bad it is for you    mine is really minimal friends and family have not noticed yet but i have and its causing me insane stress and social anxiety im going to ask a family member who is a hairdresser today if theres anything i can do to fix or stop it while its still early on i will not shave it unless im going full bald im a short skinny guy who cant pull the bald look off      ive heard this helps    also just based on some things ive read the past few days  try looking into shampoos and conditioners that reduce hair loss or have dht blockers  also eat foods like eggs and broccoli that are high in biotin iron and vitamin c  brush/comb your hair gently as well dont be rough with it something ive also been bad about personally   sorry youre having this happen op especially at a younger age than i am i noticed mine on the right side of the image a few weeks ago not visible to most people i agree but when its your head you really do notice it much more
      op here i am 193cm tall and have good facial  features i dont mind but my family would and id look like one of those gopniks/chavs thats what i fear the most  i dont live in america its pretty rare to see bald people a lot of ppl with receding hairline tho i think it looks awful
  left side is minimal but right side looks like i burned my scalp there a little just that typical v pattern  i noticed it after washing my hair today i lost quite a bit during that  but i gotta admit i used a really shitty shampoo for a very long time baby shampoo yeah so that might explain it  also no conditioner any chance it would regrow as i said i was under a lot of stress and stuff my dad doesnt have such thing yet and hes nearing his 50s
get a good shampoo and conditioner  rinse hair with cold water after showering i noticed a lot of hair loss bc of stress and that helped
  any chance it would regrow as i said i was under a lot of stress and stuff my dad doesnt have such thing yet and hes nearing his 50s    i honestly do not know i know theres medications and treatments that can force it to regrow but i dont know enough to say if it will regrow without them and just by using healthier alternatives    my family has good hair genes for the most part my grandpa is the only person i know who went completely bald and he went by 20 everyone else my uncle my father etc all have full heads of hair my uncle is thinning hard only in his late 60s now and my dad also only recently nearing his 60s as well i love my hair and even just this small noticeable only to me little circle on the left side of my head is driving me up the damn wall      193cm  youre more blessed than i am in that regard im about 173cm / 56 so the bald would look especially weird on a guy my height      i might give that a shot myself
my life is easy i live in a first world country parents dont throw me out im very tall healthy not a full blown robot but more like a cyborg im a virgin but not kissless  i have massive problem with stress so much that i started to get receding hairline and wrinkles at age of 21  i just cant my forehead is constantly stressed even when i play games i cant just fkin chill  i used to play league of legends got chall there for months this exhausted me so much i stopped playing it all together but still my competetive drive is always fucking me up in video games i cant relax for shit how do you guys even manage this  i stress when i drive i stress during exercise i stress during family and social events i stress constantly theres always pressure inside my forehead and im sick of this  do i need to lobotomize my brain with meds or what
if in the end nothing works accept it and own it you dont necesarily have to shave but buzz it the closest you can and move on
tips on helping a girlfriend who came out of an abusive relationship with a pedophile years ago he was recently reported to the higher authorities and there is an investigation we are both of legal age me and her and the abuse with him and her happened a couple years before she does self harm from time to time occasionally  i think in general i am a good boyfriend for supporting her in her inner battles if anyone here has been through something similar what are some tips that helped you with a girlfriend with abusive issues from a previous partner thanks
op forgot to add the abuse was not in person it was all long distance via calls/social media he was a type of person who manipulated with suicidal pity and used tactics as such to get her into him
  honestly i was in a similar situation and just walked away im not about to deal with that level of broken id rather be single than go down that road
  she will dump you when she feels better op  and all your efforts will have been for nothing    in any case if you can and still have the will to go through that id recommend to stick around a suicide prevention program or a psychologist actually a psychologist might be of great help than any kind of advice youll receive because this professional will be taking care of her as much as she opens herself  she probably has anxiety already maybe even some sort of depression
  dunno if theres anything that supports her dumping me or not bit of a claim  and she is in a victims therapy program that is kind of helping her op
my bf was beaten up by an abusive ex the ex prostituted himself in his back and tricked my bf to debt     the few times i got angry at my bf he became excessively scared and shocked for several days it made me feel awfully bad even though ive never been violent to him this is the only stigma i can think of on average we have very good times at times he thanked me for respecting him which i find weird but i guess that makes sense based on his past    thinking about it now its impressive how well he recovered from all this
    so yea my advice is stay yourself be cool and nonviolent to people with broken past just a bit of care is more than enough to settle
hello there im applying to university but i just got rejected from oxford without interview i got into durham and st andrews though is it worth reapplying next year after i finish my alevels i really want to go to oxford
  you answered your own question now go study
you are probably less likely to get in next year also you need to have a coherent plan for that year doing fuck all isnt going to help at all    honestly you already have places at two of the best universities here life is hard and we dont all get to live our dreams very few of us do youve been lucky enough to get into a top university but not the one you wanted its a shame but there are huge numbers of people that would love to be in your position
fellow ladies do you like it when a guy reveals his vulnerable side even if its a flaw does just understanding it have this humanizing and honest quality to it for you    my boyfriend recently finally opened up to me and it made me really happy and it made me think of how even with fictional characters female readers/viewers love that kinda thing eg the kylo ren fandom yea i know pls stay with me here jean kirstein from aot prolly better examples but maybe this gives the idea    im just curious to know how universal this is
  first off the better and more relateable examples youll want are things like zuko todoroki and maybe someone like vegeta since youre on 4chan driver and his fucking satellite ears arent gonna pick up as much recognition then again /adv/ is normie as hell so maybe it will    people like when people they trust and appreciate open up nobody likes when the casual acquaintance starts playing emotional vomitosis    moderation sonny
  todorokis fuckin cold as ice
i definitely like it and contrary to what most guys on here believe id say that most women like it 90 of my female friends do    as long as him showing his vulnerable side isnt him spilling his guts out about how he loves you and fantasizes about you every night while masturbating when youve barely had two sentences worth of conversation thats just unnerving
  but so hot like fire  the trick is his emotions are rooted in something like when tenya takes his internship like when bakugo challenges deku    the thing about that kind of exposure we like is that its not the norm but its still unmistakably them
  the only thing that gets him going is his dad other than that hes just a stone cold killer
  its fine but context and timing are important this is something you dont want to happen too soon or too late personally i have found that its a bad sign if a guy never opens up that kind of thing will doom a relationship   also that bunny is so cute
  as a guy its a very dangerous move to open up to a girl no matter what they say to you like its cute they care for you a d shit like that they always use it against you in an argument fight sooner or later    no exceptions
  definitely agree with that in my specific case him opening up also included understanding why he even likes me i was worried i was interchangeable with anyone but he noticed things in me that i valued and was proud of but thought he didnt value or care about because he didnt express it or reacted badly to because of insecurity
  can definitely relate before he did this our relationship was pretty much doomed but this is still very fresh so i still have to see what happens
  id say that applies to anyone towards their love interests can a relationship even work without doing that though honest question i dont want to claim to be certain to me it seems like a necesary step regardless of the risk part of the screening process when ready of course to see of it will work
  also i can see how it can be used against you in a manipulative way but what if they bring it up to challenge you to be better or move past it    for example if one of your issues was preventing you from treating your partner fairly wouldnt it be valid to identify it in the situation
  this also youd appear as sexually less appealing less masculine etc theyll be more prone to cheating and finding other men turning them on
  girls cant get turned on bro
  yea those are good examples was lazy to think of them because i just wanted to get my post up kylo i feel is a piognant example because hes unlikable to so many but he has an equally passionate fanbase despite that because of his woobie quality skewed perception from it notwithstanding     and yea a lot of people find that kind of unloading alarming from a stranger or casual acquaintence some people might be sympathetic or equiped to deal with it but it shouldnt be assumed as a rule
  less macho maybe but thats a good thing less macho doesnt mean less masculine it just means less dudebro
  depends on the girl and their preferences so not claiming to speak for all of them also the specifics of the issue theyre opening up about to me its just human the honesty itself and the ability to identify it and most importantly the want to move past it is beautiful
  but its not sexual its emasculating and desexualizing and its a threat not for you but for us once youre done with beautiful youd seek for sexy again from another man its so easy being a woman you can just be yourself and not having self esteem issues
ill just say it i dont have anything to open up about to with the girl im dating    and i dont mean that in an autist/edgelord i dont feel feelings kind of way i mean it as ive got myself very well figured out and am 100 emotionally selfsufficient i know how to work through my own problems how to spot bad moods how to shake myself out of things how to problem solve there is nothing that i get from externalising my feelings to another person for me if anything talking to someone else about the way i feel is a hassle of having to explain it to them because they want to know what im thinking    i dont think that all wimenrevil or anything like that i love women i just have nothing to share with them if you want to bounce your shit off my thats fine i dont mind listening here and there and maybe offering help if thats what you want but there is nothing you can get out of me willingly in terms of emotional vulnerability and none of this means that i dont love you or that im not vulnerable with you or that im afraid of you/afraid of sharing with you it just means that i dont need your help and for as long as you want that to change youre going to be asking me to change something that is at the very core of my personality and im both unable and unwilling to alter myself on such a base level jus because it makes you feel warm and fuzzy to feel like i need you
  op if you take one piece of advice from this board hear this despite what girls tell you do not show your vulnerable side do not do you hear me dont do it
  why the fuck did you ask the question if youre going to argue for one side of the answer fucking retard yeah keep taking advice from girls on how to get girls because we all know that works out well right fucking beta cucked loser
  and there it is  i want my man to be vulnerable and emotional about the right issues under the right circumstances
guy here was in an amazing 1 year long relationship with a girl i totally fell in love with we had so much closeness intimacy and love she pushed me hard to open up for months i finally did after my dad died and became emotionally vulnerable to her after about 45 months of being vulnerable and open about my depression she dropped me    males reading this thread make no mistake emotional vulnerability will destroy your relationship it doesnt matter how much you think shes different or how hard she prods for you to be do not do it women say they want this but they will lose all respect for you never forget this save yourself the pain
  this every time with a girl im in a relationship with the more vulnerable i am the worse she treats me the less vulnerable i am the better she treats me it really is that black and white
  thats great its not about generating artificial vulnerabilities if there are none but if he cant spot his own problems and acts out and i dont understand the reason its harder to deal with
  i know it sucks having to face rejection and think men are the only ones that go through it because you are one but please know plenty of women face the same thing any gender can have traits that put off a partner
love it when he opens up or sometimes cries it makes me feel like he trust me and isnt afraid that ill judge him  if i open up and cry around him why shouldnt he
what a bunch of virgin bullshit and female lies yeah sure open up   whoooops suddenly my man isnt mysterious and strong just a weak human like everyone else now im bored i want a real man neeeeext dick pls    do you ask a fish how to catch it a wild horse how to tame it a criminal how to judge him get real
  jeebus man did you even read the original post my question was directed at women and this is a discussion not a onesided info dictation if someone not even rudely offers a counter and it makes no sense to you explain why or if youre so triggered leave
  depends on the girl i personally woundnt see a great relationship with a guy that felt like he couldnt open up to me i and many others dont want mysterious and masculine guy but rather one that cared for me and someone i can talk to and he can in turn talk to me you dont have to be tough all the time wat hell  if a girl dumps you for showing emotion youre really better off without her
  i wont deny its still interesting to hear peoples different experiences even the ones from guys where it ended my question was abound how universal this is and how other women react so i will add that to my perspective     id still like to add because it seems to get misconstrued this way by people    im not claiming this is instantly gonna guarantee you get the girl and you have happy endings no one should expect any one thing to give you that expecting that only leads to bitterness and disappointment everyone should understand not everyone is going to like what they find or respond well even if what youre doing is being true to yourself and yes some people are going to be callous and selfish in their rejection including men i also want to ask though is the relationship even gonna work if youre not going to be yourself if it ends at least you find out it wasnt meant to be or has someone managed to make it work while hiding who you are
  his entire point was that you shouldnt believe women about what they say they want in a partner what are you even doing replying to him with what you want in a partner     im astounded
what a joke  never show any weakness to a roastie never
  well what i look for in a guy really is true happily in a relationship for 7 months now and dont want none of that im so tough thing its actually a huge turn off for me
  you see always the same meme replies dodged a bullet she wasnt worth it anyway blablabla women dont know what they really want several close female friends admitted that social structure and biological needs are too far apart and make it even harder for women the social self wants a human partner your uterus wants a killer stoneman protective unbreakable with a food/ resource dispenser for you and a baby and man want a healthy baby maker nothing else that means young and healthy aka pretty    why do people deny their basic biological self so much
  some do some dont
  7 months fuck off i can slit my throat and say look i didnt die not deadly to slit your throat and then bleed out a few seconds later thats how usefull you argument is delusional i was in love too once makes you dumb as fuck but at some point you will be back to rational thinking we all do
  what are you refering to was a small wall of text after all
  ok then so you havent exactly made it in the same way youre asking of anon either so have you had a successful relationship by not being yourself
  made what i was mysterious and strong with my gf by instinct i guess didnt put conscious effort into it thats hiwbi got her to chase me for months we were kind of friends for some time i liked her as a person woman and friend you can imagine how hard i fell in love with her i was so happy with her opened up was soft now my ex got replaced
  what the fuck are you even saying in this post youre just throwing together a word soup that makes no sense you literally type like an idiot its obvious youre not here for discussion youre here for an echo chamber and youre mad you havent found it       based redpilled and high iq like many other posts here men stop taking advice from women on what women want especially op who cant make up her fucking mind
    hijacking as a dude to say no with qualifications i back up  because its the truth women want you to open up in a way that allows them to fulfill their motherly urges or they want to tame the beast its all about that caring closeness wherein they can be saints or angels soothing peoples pain and bringing calm to an aching heart but actually flip the script on women  that is become so vulnerable that now they have to do the mans job of caring and catering to the man  and they will drop you they see it as weakness the two girlfriends i did that to even after they asked the moment i did i could see the change in their eyes and i knew it was over maybe not then but in a few months done you can definitely open up to women and they will treat you warmly but dont do it so much that you flip the script which is bullshit because thats how far you need to go sometimes to really let it all out women can do this to men men cant to women get a therapist instead seriously if you can afford it i recommend every man get a therapist to go full vulnerable because theres nowhere else to do it as a guy youll just end up getting dropped
  sorry that happened to you that sucks   made it as in had a long stable emotionally fulfilling relationship    cant expect to be an authority if you havent exactly figured it out either of course even if you had it still would apply to your specific circumstances but atleast its something not saying what you may have learnt doesnt mean anything but were all still limited to our own experiences opening up may not have worked for you and i feel for you that must have hurt but how can you say with absolute certainly it applies to every relationship    which is why i asked have you had a relationship where not showing your true self worked it might im genuinely curious
  thats interesting thank you for explaining and not acting like a bitter asshole i want different perspectives but i also want to know theyre not from a person who is too angry to see past their bias and hurt     that sounds like it rings true in my specific case i want him to open up because before he was acting out and i didnt understand i will say with certainly it was killing the relationship     that said i still expect him to want to work past it and get better call it maning up i dont think anyone wants to just have their issue offloaded on them but with no effort into doing something about it
  even female friends with no romantic interest withdraw the instant i or other guys talk even a little bit about our emotions     authority makes no sense i dont have to be pythagoras or redo his work to claim that a2b2c2 are you an elecrtitian or medical staff no ok i wont believe you sticking my finger in an electrical outet is bad you have no authority
if your married sure if not naah
  that look in her eyes now that you mentioned it at a specific situation the adoring glance she had died and got replaced by this bored slightly condescening stare that was even earlier than i thought she fell out of love
  my bf had a pretty tragic thing happen in his family when we were only like 6 months together he broke down crying in my lap and i held him for what felt like an eternity    even though i initially fell for him bc he seemed reckless and the kind of guy who knows exactly how risky to be to get what he wants this completely opposite side of him surprised me and i loved him even more for it  humans arent onedimensional almost everyone has feelings i assume sometimes they overwhelm you and your partner is or should be the number 1 person to talk about them and let them out    but of course this also goes the other way a onedimensional guy that is emotional and litterally nothing else is boring and honestly exhausting i dont think any girl would like to deal with this  moderation is key as always my bf is usually very confident and only sometimes vulnerable when he is alone with me which adds a certain flavour to our relationship  the ratio of acting strong to showing weakness should never be 100 to 0 in any given relationship imo but the ideal differes from person to person somewhere in between
  compensation by honeymoon phase funny isnt it would you not have mentioned how young the relationship is i may have been pushed to question my observations so far
  what difference does it make it doesnt change the person or my views of him
  im curious did he show weakness again after that incident that had no negative effect due to honeymoon phase
  i think at this point in the discussion weve firmly established that you shouldnt just do this to anyone it should be at a point in a relationship where you intimately trust them or if not if you know that person is equiped to handle it were talking longterm serious romantic relationships here
  not really but i know what youre trying to get at and youre wrong  if he broke down crying right tonight for example i would comfort and soothe him because i love him and want him to feel well  it wouldnt affect my feelings for him or my admiration for him as a person in any way emotions are part of every human you cannot block them out
  i see pretty good combination of your 2 personalities that made it work out       interesting train of thought
  it always happens like this so keep your goddamn mouth shut if women know you bleed and hurt or damaged in any way you are a limp dick to them
  why do so many mention long term guess what hook ups disgust me i only ever have sex with a serious gf of several months at least of course long term just having to mention that makes me believe im dealing with people who see short term flings as good no judgement here really im just very strict and rather not fun in a way
  i see no counter arguments just proclmations and empty promises you should go into politics oh god are you a politician
  why do you tell that to me i learnd my fucking lesson real painfull and gooood
  what if i am  doesnt change the fact that i love my bf with all his flaws whether you can imagine this or not
  i only mentioned romantic longterm relationships because you mentioned nonromantic female friends and of course the relationship being long term matters to this discussion so its relevant and will be brought up
  i believe you until he shows weakness i do not say your emotions are lies or fake do you understand now i say your very true and real emotions for him will change once he shows weakness did you get that finally either you are too dense or i suck balls at expressing myself if the latter than i apologize if not i hope i made myself clear
  if a friend gets repulsed by being like that what do you think happens to somone who is supposed to bebattracted to you
  no need to be condescending  it seems like your worldview is already made up  but thanks for predicting how i a random stranger on the internet will feel at a very specific point in the future must be nice to be a psychic
  i think youre pretty lucky and a lot of people here are bitter and hurt     i think my takeaway from your story and my own feelings which havent been field tested like yours is that you still have to have something about your partner that you really admire inspite of their vulnerabilities i think if what you love about them is strong enough and is proven true despite what they struggle with it makes you love them more    not everyone will find this not everyone will have this for their partner which is why there are so many heartbroken people    i will say this again opening up and or showing your damage is not meant as a guarantee to you getting the girl people are complex and have things they look for in a partner rejection sucks and people can be callous and selfish about it but it just means it wasnt mean to be and we all have to accept it expecting anything to be a secret insta win only leads to bitterness and disappointment
  self improvement i guess you know that common advice of working on yourself and all that before finding love
  logical conclusions seem like psychic to people who wont or cant follow a train of thought im not condescening i said i apologize if you dont understand because of my bad writing style or whatever it might be    my world view is not made up believe it or not i hate my current viewpoint it is sad lonley and harsh im trying to see the opposite but i get constant confirmation for it where is the good stuff the love every time i thought i found it it turns out to be a lie or broken im talking everything not just my life friends family mere acquaintances all a bunch of sad betrayals and break ups or in the best case indifference
itt lying roasties and retards humoring them
  we are talking about present relationships not getting a gf or bf as usually pls dont digress or we might end up with specific terms and insulting im afraid to metion
  god dammit im one of them arent i fuck took the bait so deep it went straight throu me outta my ass
  grill here to me the key is contrast i am okay with guys being emotional or making decisions under emotions however it is offputting when they never exercise any assertiveness / logic     same thing goes for girls girls who act cutesy and girly and very emotionally make me feel disgusted inside i have a esfj friend who is this exact way and i secretly view her as inferior tbh my father who was depressed for fucking decades cant stop moaning about his depression every single day stfu because it is tiring and draining to deal with someones negative emotions be it male or female no one likes that shit     tldr people like balance and contrast if the girls you are with hates even your slightest emotional side think about how it will be long term perhaps the type of girls you are attracting are the super feminine type who adheres strictly to societys norms if thats the type of girl you want to attract then you have to remain the type that they like simple
  well you say you are looking for the love yet you try so hard to convince me that my love for my bf is conditional on some very specific thing  there is love in this world and maybe it would help you to just accept it without trying to find ways to conditionalize it maybe this would soften you  i honestly wish for you that you find one day what you are looking for
  learn to read incelcuck
  i dont like what he said therefore hes an incel  spotted the roastie that cucked her good guy bf with chad when he opened up to her
  everthing is conditionalized every thing there cant be something from nothing     but i will try i must get softer for the plain reason that i might die from a stroke or heart attack im literally tense and crampy also grumpy
  no you fuck head great here we go incel and thot shitwar fuck you dude
serious question  why so many incels on /adv/
  clearly you are a rational being and arent in any way affected by a mentality built on hurt and selfdestructive nihilism
  where else
  because /adv/ is a 4chan board
  pls do not escalate avoid those words with r i t
    i know but on /v/ most are poltards on /mu/ never seen one but when i open /adv/ i always end up seeing the word roastie everywjere and those 2 christian girls
  because hurt people come here for solace/advice some of those people are in no state to do that and instead want to drag others down or find a target for their anger which is the whole incel philosophy
  and we all know what 4chan is lets call it a not so good place like at all
  its not all bad it just has a mix of different people and some of those people are just toxic af
  i like poltards
  this
  where is it not bad where gif news  even fucking ck is trash
  did i strike a nerve there my little roastie  call me an incel all you want but you know whats what    4chan is a great place even if the retarded gook thats running it is trying his best to ruin it
  dude stop using this word fml
  same they are so stupid anyone with a brain ends on the left thanks them
  ok where is this greatness hidden pony wtf i legit never dare to click that abomination
  why does the truth hurt you so much roastie
  ok no political debatte pls adv is a fucking mine field not a board
  everywhere  anonymity in itself is greatness
  you retarded fuckhead im the jaded redpill asshole i just had it with roastie vs incel shit flinging contests
  right   sorry i got carried away
  humm you got me kudos
  thank you kind sir but the thread derailed anyway anything on topic im kinda burned out
  then youre at the wrong place  incel vs roastie endless shitflining will keep going with new buzzwords perhaps as long as women keep being roasties
  the roastie hating cuck made be kek i got real roastbeef btw     that bunny is indeed freaking cute
  i meant incel ffs but the rhyme was neat
  personally i understood vomiting your emotional problems on someone makes you very dependant and that may scare people away but still its so hard to find balance when to say stuff how its really hard
  the last good on topic posts are these        i think an important thing people forget is they still need to work on themselves its expected not everyone is gonna like what they find sometimes its because it was a bad match anyway or the person needs to get better if they arent lucky to find someone who likes them as they are
  yeah agreed cant deny that risk this stuff cant be expected of anyone i think if you find the balance between yourself and another its really special     also what this person said 
  i guess i should agree      see im trying somehow
  as a guy i agree with this and your character flaws will become public information to her friends later on  a thing ive learned a while back what do women know nothing
  ok so the thread conclusions are balance   thats it   have a nice day folks or anyone got some more stories to share
      was very interesting never thought about contrast
women are your enemy  sure you can have a good time with them but in the end of the day all they want is your emotional support and your wallet  would you show your vulnerable side to an enemy
  jaded dude here no fuck off be rational
  im proud of you   keep it up
  any vulnerabilities will be used against you at some point  its like clockwork even my mom did it to me  i learned to never show weakness and keep all my stuff close to an area they cant be fucked with  roasties should never be trusted or relied on
never become vulnerable with women  get a therapist instead  t a guy who got dropped 4 fucking times sharing stuff ranging from i only have energy to listen to music today like once or depression or a close family member dying  women want someone they can empathize with and also someone whos strong these things come into conflict more often than not
honestly it saddens me how many guys here dont trust women  i dont know what happened to you but from the bottom of my heart i wish you find a girl one day whom you can trust and open up to  and i hope for your sake that by that point you will be able to cherish it and arent too bitter and sealed off yet
lots of guys in this thread forget that the best a leader uses his feelings the better he is as a leader period masculinity goes with feelings not against them prove youre a male open up
  the best leader does utilize his feelings yes but he doesnt feed input into a machine that cant process them  yes acknowledgement of feelings is important and beneficial but thats why you get a therapist or a friend and why you dont talk to your so
    op is the girl thats why i said that he should learn to read     good job in confirming that you two are not only illiterate but also triggered permavirgins
  and then that sweet girl reveals her true side but youve already married her so now you gotta pay alimony and your lifes over  i hate posts like yours so much so naive and oh look at me arent i such a kind and optimistic person attentionwhoring  literally kys yourself
  after 7 years my ex left me in the same time a family member was diagnosed with terminal illness one year after that i found out she cheated for the last 2 years of our relationship i was actually too good to her but im thankful to her because i have learned that you shouldnt trust girls and never get emotionally attached to them live your life and treat them like objects
  the moment someone tried to say the truth and the word roastie was uttered all you other roasties and whiteknights came out of the woodwork to cry that things arent like that and score brownie points with how positive and antiincel yall are  i think you fags are the triggered ones desu
  someone wishes you that something good happens to you  you tell them to kill themselves  maybe thats your problem right there      thats horrible and i cant begin to imagine how it must have made you feel i can totally understand that this traumatized you but even though i realized it sounds like a cliche not all are like this there are good people out there really
  someone virtue signals for attention  call them out on their bs  somehow a problem  no its your problem that you need to show how kind and compassionate you are propably because you know all thats been said about you roasties itt is true and you feel bad
  youre the naive retard who thinks all women are such excellent actors that they can fake a nice girl act in a relationship for years a cure a marriage then divorce and run with the money with cold calculating precision  to me it sounds like youre a braindead retard who wouldnt know what his gf is thinking even after she screamed at him that shes leaving because he plays vidya all day
  i actually dont believe in that anymore like i dont believe in love anymore
  my mom did it  the mothers of many acquantances did it  the internet is full of stories like that that i wouldnt believe if i hadnt seen it so often irl  roasties are trash and you just dont want to admit it  call me a sad virgin incel shutin all you want but it doesnt change the facts
seems like the roasties stopped replying and trying to defend themselves  good
  nice revisionist history the actual order of events is that you two got triggered by me saying incelcuck and started to say roastie everyother sentence its obvious it hit a nerve  keep crying fag
  keep whiteknighting for dumb roasties in hopes that one of them will pityfuck you one day you c uck
  crying whiteknightings nonstop everytime you get triggered by being a retard doesnt help your case fag go back to your hugbox
  cause i too learned my fucking lesson real painful and goooood most guys havent or dont learn
  lol who is feeling bad now
  sorry to tell you youre not a very likable person i cannot blame whoever for not being into you and fueling your bitterness
never reveal your vulnerable side  never open up emotionally  in every argument she will use it against you   she will think less of you  she will leave you over it
  fuck off and die
  after you my dear friend
  then its obviously not meant to be wouldnt you rather it end then to keep being with someone who treats you like that what do you even like in a person like that besides physical beauty maybe unless a superficial relationship was working out for you somehow then ok people find contentment in different ways
how can i honestly stop hating women for good   i know for a fact this is holding me back in more ways than one     i can safely say i have no real interest in meeting women i think their obsession with male status is wrong and reprehensible     however i would like to develop a kind of indifference towards them as it is really hindering my career prospects overall
how can i honestly stop hating women for good  just stop being a faggot
  theyre just human beings and just as flawed as males stop going on 4chan or at least distance yourself from the angry incel representatives
interact with them on a daily basis
  i think their obsession with male status is wrong and reprehensible    well at least youre aware that your own obsessions with female status is also and reprehensible and you want to change it    whatever shit you read on the internet and whatever you personally went through it doesnt reflect on like 4 billion people and half the planet all women past present and future dont all act the same or think the same way or anything same with men people are people and should be judged individually
  dont do this it will make you hate them even more
  weird i interact with women all day everyday and im not a salty faggot about it
  you could start by realizing that women are people and thus have many different traits not just those you think they have but we both know that you wont do it
  learn to mature and get your asperger treated by professionals
live in the real world not 4chan
  i think their obsession with male status is wrong and reprehensible  this is only true in their selection of mates and wont impact 95 of interactions you have in day to day life the fact that your hatred of women as a whole is based entirely around their mate selection practices tells me this isnt true hate its frustration that you arent being chosen     its important to be honest with yourself
first all kudos for wanting to better yourself  second realize that you will always see the bad side of every one regardless of race or gender think vocal minority the majority has nothing to complain about thus you wont hear from them  try to think from the perspective of a woman what would she think of men if all she saw was negative  lastly realize that undesirable traits arent related to gender see a woman thats superficial and narcissistic you hate superficial and narcissistic people not women in general
  kudos for wanting to better yourself  he doesnt want to better himself he wants to better his career
i can safely say i have no real interest in meeting women i think their obsession with male status is wrong and reprehensible    t man obsessed with women and their inner workings
  this
why do you hate women
  whatever shit you read on the internet and whatever you personally went through it doesnt reflect on like 4 billion people and half the planet all women past present and future dont all act the same or think the same way or anything same with men people are people and should be judged individually  this
  in other words  raise your status to get women
hi /adv/ heres the thing     i was in a 10 year relationship a girl we lived together for 3 years and i broke up because she was ultra focused on her career and wouldnt give me attention id be without having sex for more than 6 months like it was the most normal thing in the world either way right after leaving her i started dating a colleague from work which was obviously interested in me     which brings us to today 5 months in and things have gotten serious thing is im not sure i want to stay with her for much longer and she obviously does     i like her shes nice and great in bed but i dont want to settle now before leaving my gf i just assumed well these are what relationships are and stuck with it despite being miserable however what i feel like doing now is pursuing other women im good looking and it gives me a lot of pleasure to go on the hunt    which brings me to my question how normal are these types of feelings am i being a terrible person and leading on a girl in whom im not sure i have interest in again i like her but maybe i dont want to settle i dont know my dudes just give me your advice     i dont want to feel responsible for this girls well being and dont want to hurt her either fuck i feel like a fucking idiot will gladly answer any questions to allow you to help me in a more effective way    pic obviously unrelated
also it might be important for you to know that whenever i start dating someone ill have to marry them or else im being dishonest i started dating her and now that things have gotten serious i feel the only right thing to do is to marry her and that makes me kinda anxious    im so fucking stupid i have the most privileged life imaginable and always find a way to feel responsible about everything bad that happens to anyone
  feel like i have to marry them
self bump  you really have nothing
  their relationship is built on dishonesty and is doomed to fail
  anything else besides intentionally ignoring my post for the maymays
i feel you man ive had a lot of similar problems being with someone and having a good time starts being really problematic once theyre more in love than you are at some point you have to decide what to do     im gonna assume you see being with her as better than being completely single or you should just break up    you can go on as if nothing is wrong which probably will lead to her feeling deceived and fucked over in the long run on the other hand for a while things might be good if you do this you might be a dick    you can break up now because you obviously dont see her as the one anyway this could lead to either happy single times or sad single times who knows     or you can do what i usually do and try to tell her how you feel and end up being on the same page if shes happy with casual sex even some intimacy or a casual open relationship thats probably your best outcome on the other hand since you waited five months its gonna be a tough conversation to start     either way if you dont want to be a dick you pretty much have to talk to her sucks because something good might disappear but such is life if youre goodlooking and charismatic you can usually find someone else after a few months of sadness at most
  thanks for the advice mate im just really confused because shes a great girl and i just dont know what love is anymore maybe shes the one and im a talking myself out of it maybe im just a cunt who knows
how many women have you slept with   pussy is extremely overrated and i wish i knew that when my gf broke up with me i wouldnt have let her go  yeah i fucked like 3 girls since last year but im more miserable than ive ever been    if shes a keeper even if you have less feelings than her dont be an idiot and stay with her
  my rule of thumb is that if im wondering it probably aint it    lots of girls are great girls love is something else something rare ive experienced it once maybe twice and each time well i didnt start wondering about what love is five months into it     youre talking about staying with her as if its a compromise dont compromise do better even if not for your own sake then for hers lasting relationships need to be equal for both parts    disclaimer everyone wonders sometimes if this is a oneday thing take some time and think about it if its been like this for a while my advice above is much more relevant
also just for the record its a damn shame that so many relationships are good but not great what the hell world leaving something good to search for someone great always feels like such a shitty and selfish thing to do
  my gf was such a bitch like why wouldnt she fuck me god its like all she cares about is herself  anyways im leading on my new gf who wants to settle down with me and i want to break up with her because like shes too much effort for me   you absolute devil you
  0 i had like 20 offers and shot most of them down because they wouldnt work out in the long term probably for the best imo the amount of bitching and idiocy that goes on in people who have casual relationships is ridiculous  like how many of you niggers are going to keep crying on my shoulder because of problems that seem completely obvious to me from the beginning anyways    ii just couldnt believe she would move on so easily   shes fucked like 20 guys before you the fuck were you expecting   why is he so much different from when i first met  because youre too impressionable  why does every relationship i have fail  because you dont really want to commit and just keep fucking whoever is closest to you     etc
  2 atm  if shes a keeper even if you have less feelings than her dont be an idiot and stay with her  thats the sort of thing im actually afraid of      thanks for the advice theres another girl that i for some unexplained reason cannot get out of my head a few months ago i would even dream about her consistently your disclaimer really hit it where it hurts you might be right      checked       first part is a bit off she was obviously not into me the same way i was into her which im fine with its not like i pity myself because im such a nice guy that i deserve pussy just wanted to have realised that sooner      not me but ok thanks for your pov
how can you seem less cocky/needy to people    hey everyone in need of some social advice    in college doing very well very happy have a great close group of boys however it has come to my attention recently that some people think im a cocky/arrogant fuck been trying to fix that though by even avoiding the word i making sure im talking more about them then me complimenting etc bc i genuinely am not trying to be arrogant at all this however has backfired some people now think i am being fake and simply trying to appease them and trying to be a people pleaser    beyond this some people think i only hit them up when i want something basically saying im a user/needy etc i genuinely never try to be like this and just upset at the fact that some people think this about me even though i shouldnt care at all     i just want to know how i should go about this how to fix this i dont want to seem like a needy person or cocky person any advice
  stop hanging around scrubs that judge your every action  you should like do something comepletely insane just to fuck with them

  sometimes
what does it mean when someone who is genuinely sweet and caring and thoughtful doesnt reply for days   like we will have a long conversation but once it ends they wont reply for days   halp
do they have a vibrant social life or is worse now around christmas than before
  when we first met we talked a lot but i was on vacation so i could stay up to talk to him  now i started work and school again so i have limited time and so does he he goes to uni and works two different jobs the time zone difference isnt in our favor either  he could still at least text me once a day right
how do you do it weve been together for two years and i moved away to live with her now after a month of living with her ive realized this relationship has no future and shes kind of abusive i love her to death but dont know what do do i signed on for next year because she had a reduced rent offer and was asking me like why wont you sign it itll make my rent lower
  have you tried working on the problems the two of you have
  talk to the apartment managers ask how much it would cost to break the lease pay the entire fee give girly a months notice and get the fuck out
  why would you give an abusive person notice you show up with movers when shes not home and a bodyguard just in case totally ghost her
  heres how my ex did it to me she told me let me cry myself to sleep tried to comfort me and let me stay until i found another apartment only when she saw i was trying to just ride it out and stay she began pushing and telling me i had to move while the end result sucked im thankful she was there for me and didnt just toss my stuff in the street
  it would be the whole rent through july so i cant do that i have to sublet and find a roommate for her
not sure if this is the right board but im a college freshman getting into my unis geography program long story to what led me to choose geography im really indifferent about the subject dont love it nor hate it but it wasnt my first choice anyway was choosing a geography major the right choice from a career perspective im not looking to be filthy rich or anything but i just want your a job to live off of with enough disposable income for my hobbies  it doesnt even need to be directly related to my major i read an article that said geography majors are one of the least likely to be unemployed anybody here have a geography degree
geography you for real nigga the earth has already been mapped you missed your degree relevance by two hundred years you might as well write a book on flat earth theres enough retards who eat that shit up you might be able to eke out a living for a year or two
idk how it works over there but in my country theres an option to specialize in either meteorology or town planning after a geography major and that gives you some options
  not bad at all not as many options as some but its not a meme degree the best career out there is probably a surveyor which will take a degree in geo or gis  post school certification exams of which there are a few levels depending on your state high paying outdoor work i strongly considered a gis degree to go that route myself
  isanely idiotic
  modern geography is not about maps it covers macroeconomics geology politics environment etc you could get a job with a government or a multinational corporation for example or just use the skills you develop analysis research writing etc to sell yourself as a generalist
looking to try something like this with the wife really just want to lube ourselves up and slide all over was wondering if anyone has ever tried anything like this and if so how did it go what kind of lube/oil did you use
    plain regular baby oil    microwave for 20 seconds    it functions great as lube too at least for anal dunno if compatibale with pussy
    also it was pretty fucking hot and was just on a rubber mat put over a doublebed that thing in your pic looks smart as fuck but doing it on the floor might be a little too hard for comfort
is this like a sex thing i thought nuru was just an oil massage
  yea was gonna get an inflatable air mattress anda plastic drop cloth      looking for it to be both
same me and my wifes bull wanna try something new
anyone make their own lube
definitely want to try this
any social advice basically retarded in group chat and somehow more autistic 1 on 1 i literally have no friends except a few which i feel comfortable around even being quiet around i come off as rude and brief and i would like to make more connections with more people but already considered the next school shooter kek cause of death metal a girl i liked thinks im some bisexual pedo because of my level of paranoia refused to be posted on snap/another story couldnt hold a girlfriend for a long time cause of my boringness and retardedness literally never approached an individual unless they have something i need or i need of some service flip tf out in the bathrooms cause of my social ineptitability  what do i do
oh and have mild aspergers so am i fucked
read litcore books and meditate 15 minutes every night
  managed to get a gf  look on the bright side op
  bro im an aspie and i have a smoking hot gf the nice thing about aspergers is that you can actually mitigate it if you actually try to learn about how human interaction and relationships work    honestly your biggest problem is just how little confidence you seem to have if you start liking yourself other people will like you too  youll probably grow out of it
  seriously dont be afraid to fail i had literally everyone except s few close friends thinking i was the new adolf hitler at one point and im doing just great now    learn from your fuckups and try being more confident and open
does it even matter if i go back to social media if i have no friends in real life i think i feel the same even when i quit social media as before when i had it

please help me translate this to spanish /b/ i need to pass this class if i dont i will get kicked out     this is a classroom where there are groups of people having conversations  the people in the doorway are planning a vacation to italy they are talking about what flight to take and how much hotels will cost they are also discussing what is important to take like medicine and clothes  near the chalk board the professor is giving a talk about history the female student is amazed listening to the professor  there are two girls sitting on a desk talking about what they did last night they are good friends and so they are enjoying catching up  the three male friends in the front of the room are talking about football they are laughing because they are sharing stories from the past about football
aqui se encuentra una clase en la cual grupos de personas están teniendo conversaciones por la entrada de encuentran dos personas hablando sobre los precios de los hoteles y los tipos de vueles que ellos pedan tomar también están discutiendo sobre cosas importantes para llevar junto al viaje como ropa y medicina cerca de la pizarra la profesora da una lectura sobre la historia al escuchar a la professora la alumna de queda asombrada dos alumnas se sientan arriba del escritorio son buenas amigas y se pasan el tiempo ablando sobre lo que hicieron anoche los tres hombres al frente de la clase conversan sobre el fútbol se rien sobre historias del pasasdo
  on the word vueles i meant to put  vuelos sorry  its late
  the word pedan in the same sentence is actually puedan look for  la alumna de queda  de should be se
my neighbors retarded baby keeps screaming 24/7 and when i play music to get rid off the noise they call the neighborhood police what the fuck do i do preferably legal but will consider illegal things where i wont get caught
  house or apartment
  apartment of course theyd have to fucking torture the child for the screams to be heard from house to house
  make a complaint to the manager  tell them that the child isnt letting you live/sleep the babys mother refuses to quiet down her baby and she immediately calls the cops on you when you play music  shell either be told to quiet down and/or risk getting kicked out if you continue to complain about her
ill try to sum it up the best i can im a student and im facing some romantic prospect issues my girlfriend is cute kind and innocent maybe too innocent and i dont like it that much not for casual college dating anyway on a side note she also has a nice ass on another side note i dont know if im the best fit for her idea of a relationship and ive been having some mixed feelings likely about ours  recently i met a girl that well call nf through a friend of shes slimmer not much tits and her butt though quite nice is smaller than my gfs but i like thin girls anyway so no problem shes kinda cute as well and honestly i feel that were more on the same wavelength plus she seems more outgoing she also dresses well and this plays hugely in her favor    the three of us hung out earlier to study and chat of kept jokingly hinting at us being a good match that wed make a good couple and we both went along with it for the sake of banter and good fun however experience tells me that girls often try to set up their friends this way especially when said friends tell them that they find the guy cute or something later on nf snapped a few pics of me and of and said that i looked handsome honestly this has lead me to think that i have some chances with her    what should i do work on nf hoping that im not misled in the prospect of leaving my gf for her or making her a side chick or sticking to my gf    also am i allowed to post pics of them
  post em i guess no one else will help you but im here
im at my ropes anons im so goddamn tired of no one caring about me and everyone pushing me into someone else and being their problem im tired of struggling alone in the dark im tired of fake friends who pretend to like me im tired of being so damn lonely is everyone else truly like this i really want to jump off a local bridge or od on some pills i have im tired of crying everyday in this darkness tired of being ignored by every person give me one reason i shouldnt end it all right now no one cares about me and everyone will just laugh and say i want attention im tired of this all im sorry for the jumbled writing i dont post much no one is coming to save me
  noone has the answer friend thats why its so scary we just dont know   a lot of people seem to think life is better than death though   suicide is also not always the answer
do you think volunteering in a suicide prevention charity would give you some purpose talk with other like minded people and you will be surprised at how much you can help them
  ive been like this for so long its not getting better im a ghost      while that sounds interesting i wouldnt know where to start with that and i feel like some peoples stories would guilt trip me right back into those hopeless feelings
    i care about you i truly do even if i have never met you and probably never will i want you to be happy but i dont know how to help you even if i knew its still you who needs to take the steps you ask for a reason to not end it all there are many reasons one of them is that life can be very beautiful for some it is beautiful straight out of the box others have to work hard for it but i want to let you know that it is worth the effort    find yourself some new friends people who care about you if you find that difficult join a club with people that have the same interest love yourself too give yourself a future plant the seeds for the future you want to have and nurture those seeds i care about you and i want you to have a future one where you are happy
how do i exploit and make my chad friend get me a girl or at least introduce me to some without literally telling him to
  why dont you just ask instead of exploiting your friend sounds like a shitty thing to do just because you cant handle asking he might be glad to help
  without literally telling him to  why just ask him
  he would make fun of me hes not the ideal friend but its the only thing i have
  hes not that great of a friend i would just be made fun of he often excludes me from things and fucks me over but i dont have anyone else
does anyone else remember that episode of happy days where fonzie helps richie get a girl by giving him one of the numbers from his book    op you should be friends with fonzie
  where do i sign up
  what makes you think any girl that knows both of you would prefer you over him
  no idea im smarter
  are you  then why are you a lonely guy that cant get laid with 1 friend that treats him like shit  and theres alsothe girl herself no girl will give you the time of day when theres a more attractive male in the vicinity
  then why are you a lonely guy  weaker shorter skinnier worse hair not as social
  and what makes you think any girl will take a guy like that when the chad friend exists  shed rather be chad friends 3rd or 4th than be with you
   love this wholesome meme
exploit  asking isnt exploiting
  i cant change most of the things i listed what am i supposed to do the chance is better with a friend than lonely no matter who the friend is
  asking is not an option maybe hinting at it subtly
  chad friend  just ask him to be your wingman dont exploit a good friend
      weaker  work out gym    shorter  not much you can do there ill give you that    skinnier  eat more just keep it healthyish as you should be exercising at the same time     worse hair  good shampoo and a face scrub do wonders    not as social  you are not going to improve that by getting someone to socialize for you the only way to improve this one is to join groups clubs or any other gathering for that matter    ps been there before anon youll make it too consistency is key though so if you are going to try any of them it will take months to see results/changes
  god guys a chad loves to help a semi bro get laid you must realize that chad has lots of pussy offers and they have standards so there are many rejected outright and most are discarded afterwards so a chad is a beehive of pussy
  he doesnt consider me a good friend hes just a friend       no money for gym and i dont want to go alone  physically can not gain much weight i can a bit and im working on it but not much  my hair is curly/wavy and gets dirty a lot i have to wash it every 2 day or it looks like trash  id say social is more in the psyche than that but i get your point
  i thought this too but i think its kind of demeaning to ask help from friend plus most of the time it will result in you not being yourself when you meet with them by yourself ive had friends help me text and give me advice on what to do but i could never do anything with it
  i dont want to have to ask for it
  even if you need help its better than nothing right
  thats straight up bullshit man a lot of lasses are definitely like that but no where near all  all basic bitches maybe but not all women    unless something is very wrong with op
  you should be showering every day
  i dont think anything is that fucked up with me im 56 though      washing you hair everyday is not healthy
  washing you hair everyday is not healthy  depends on your shampoo       the only woman that pretends to like smart men is a liberal and generally shes lying to herself and would prefer the chad over the beta nerd that obsesses over technical knowledge       if hes the type that would ridicule you for asking to get hooked up with a woman i suggest striking a deal with him if you have money offer him some to get the ball rolling if you have some other kind of incentive offer him that find something that he wants and offer it to him     practically speaking hes the one exploiting you if you want to turn the tables you have to use your head
ok this a bit of whine but i need someone to talk to basically 29 years old never had a gf 100 percent guraunteed to never have one went to my brother wedding reminded by him and other couples i will never have a gf heavily considering kill myself after they get back from the honey moon its so the honeymoon isnt ruined for them its never going to get better for me isnt it
nooooo dude dont ruin their marriage with your death fuck itll be the first month of their marriage and theyll be having all kinds of problems cause your dumb ass decided to kick the bucket thats selfish
what is your job what do you do etc school do you work out are you improving your life and your social situation at all
  i hate people like you
  29 is not too late
  are you overweight
  same hes a pathetic bitch that lives his life in hopes of gaining the approval of others to justify his own life he is an internal failure
  internation level athlete so nope
  there wont be a note it wont happen in first month theyll be fine
  thank you for being considerate if you do something like six months down the road in a tragic kayaking accident it wont be as bad for everyone involved
  oh i 100 percent will be dangling from some rope
you tried like tinder or something im younger but i feel you just hard to find any motivation or courage to talk to the xx just thinking about approaching a girl makes me feel like im a creep and im a decent looking pretty normal guy i just feel weird about it if thats you then i mean i just gotta say you gotta just strike up conversations about anything notice something about someone and comment on it and see where it leads you compliment people shit like that dont worry though man my pops didnt date much at all and ended up getting married like late 30s your chillin
  studying absolutely hate the area of work and i know it make me miserable
  100 guaranteed to never have one    why
  im 163cm tall mate and i live in a country in which hypergamy is off its leech
  but im short    every fucking time   anon im not gonna lie and tell you that it doesnt matter because it certainly does but still you cant think that you cant have a gf based on you height alone one of my closest friend is one of the shortests guy i know but he still fucked way more girls than i could in three lifetimes i know at least another two who are not that successful but still managed to get in stable relationships and i live in fucking italy so dont talk to me about hypergamy let alone male competition
  have you thought about pursuing other goals in live relationship isnt for everyone
  youre best is going to a wooded area like some shithole in canada and oding in the woods    this way your body is never found no funeral no drama people will assume a hobo stabbed you
  hey dude im not going to lie to him either  it doesnt fucking matter it all comes down to fucking taste i work as a psychiatrist for young adults so i know my shit better than all of those mtgow retards as a rule of thumb height is important for slutty girls who want someone better than their weak dad which i agree is pretty often these days but fucking hell there are a lot of fucking girls that dont give a single flying fuck about height stop making excuses      also most permavirgins i knew started getting into the dating scene around 30 know why  because being old is an attractive trait to some young women thats it so they can say they go out with someone older than them basically
  he probably has many other problems than height as is usually the case    personally ive accepted my eventual suicide
  and every guy i know is like op and they are good men
  
  im 61 bald and fat im gonna start working out
  i think he meant short
  why are you basing your worth on some hypothetical girl have you tried lowering your standards or just learning to be alone and liking it
  humans are a social species
  because being old is an attractive trait to some young women  isnt this because the women want someone more experienced than them does this mean life experience or sexual experience this is me and i have some girl im talking to 5 years younger than me but i dread if we fool around and its obvious she has way more experience than me
  whats your point
  op i have attempt suicidevduringva mugging by antonising him pretty sure i broke the fuckers nose when he came at me with a knife
  i have attempt suicide when a guy attempted to mug me im pretty sure i broke fuckers nose when he pulled the knife
  better late than never
  this op is fucked
  generic too late to get basic social skills and talk to women pity party  its not too late im going to assume you dont have a job or friends  get a customer facing job in retail it will rot your soul but it will prepare you for talking to people  when you can talk to people sign up to meetup the majority of people using it are foreign social butterflies or social retards you can do anything you like and find people who enjoy that too    talk to people get the hang of greetings and what is acceptable protip when people ask how things are they dont want to hear anything longer than a sentence or negative discuss factual things with people you dont know once you can manage that go on to talk about your ideas and judgements then once that works out you can talk about your feelings and emotions regarding things at this point you will be able to befriend people  now you can talk to women after starting out talking to them make your intentions known and take it from there women are half sharp so you need to communicate    youre welcome op
  if it makes u feel any better op im tall 63 and cant get a girl

so ive known my girl friend for many many years now i never had a crush on her never even thought of her romantically or anything like that she is strictly my friend and she is my best friend    well we got together this weekdifferent states so long distance friendship and had a ton of fun like we always do but i found myself actually falling for her i have no idea why and i do not want to fall for her i know what i am thinking is wrong because she is a really good friend but at the same time i can not get rid of this feeling of crushing on her    what should i honestly do i think if i can just suppress those emotions long enough it will go away and i can be normal but at the same time i cant stop ignoring this feeling
the feelings will subside you might have just been lonely and it so happens she made you feel less lonely take it more of a sign that you should find a girlfriend not necessarily this friend of yours dont panic because what youre experiencing is normal

has anyone here had any luck with switching careers in their late 20s  if so please tell me what you did and how you did it     background ive been a graphic designer first mistake lol since i was 18 always found steady work with it been in and out of college due to work getting hectic at times my last job paid very well but in october it went out of business since then ive been trying to find work but no luck     ive been thinking that it was a mistake to get into that career
  swap me im in media/marketing and while it pays well theres not a piece of it that isnt constantly stressful and it isnt creative id suck a dick to be in graphic design which i should have done all along you can contract out your work all the time for a very solid hourly rate    but i can commiserate with changing careers at the end of the day i dont know many people who have succeeded in majorly changing their career at our age unless they were going from a service job to finally having their degree     there are some things you could try while struggling with finding work like learning a trade programming or something like that the certifications at that point are whats needed to move forward
  i wouldnt recommend the switch the graphic design market is heavily saturated the best job i had was my last one and i was getting paid 17 and hour
im not seeking advice on how to approach girls im not intimidated by them at all i can go and chat and all that stuff thats why i get surprised when i see threads here or in other subs saying i finally did it she accepted to have a date with me that for me is usual i mean i have zero problems in selfesteem or confidence    this is true i know some girls are attracted to me right now how how they talk to me how they despite me not approaching them remember this part they still want to connect with me or go out for simplicity lets say 3 girls are attracted to me are gf material and nothing ever happens    what i mean with this 3 girls ive had chances to hug kiss sex one of them is more promiscuous other more emotive but whats driving me nuts now is that nothing happens and of course probably thats my fault    one of the reasons i dont get into that phase of the relationship is that i tend to overthink what i mean is that if she doesnt talks to me first is because shes fucking with another guy then im the toy sounds quite absurd right thats my problem maybe shes indeed fucking with other guy but why not me as i told above i dont approach them lately ive got the maybe bad habit of not talking to anyone except my family and bestfriend tell me im fucking stupid for not starting conversations with those girls i want to move further i acquired that habit because all my life women were the ones that started to push things further in other words ive been a pussy and expecting girls to tell me they want to fuck with me    tldr   me overthinking stops me to move into the sex phase or into the gf phase overthinking that i may be a toy im too proud probably    what does a woman really expects from a guy once both of us feel comfortable with each other i mean should i insinuate moving forward  do really all women expect the man to insinuate sex or start a romantic relationship
thanks for nothing fags
anytime bro
i think you sound insecure      we all have different expectations   
what considerations do i have to take when moving into a new shared house from one that suffers from a mild infestation of bed bugs   do i tell the landlord who is also a roommate and my age and freshly out of college how do i do that  i assume that i can seal my mattress up in one of these fuckers and it will be alright but what about all my other shit do i let off some foggers immediately stick everything in boxes and hope none of the buggers sneak in from other rooms and recontaminate everything or do i move everything in and hope that they dont contaminate the rest of the place before setting off foggers in the new room or do i move everything in and hire an exterminator to fumigate the whole place at the inconvenience of the other roommates   i cant call an exterminator here because i live with an insane woman who fears that the exterminator will judge her for having bed bugs fuck i need to get out of here
you throw everything away or be fine with spreading bedbugs
  surely thats an exaggeration how can they attach themselves to a rare cd i imported from japan that i cant get again if i tried or a computer and a guitar and an amplifier and a set of headphones that i cant afford to rebuy on top of the expense of buying all of these boxes let alone furnishing an unfurnished room
  bugs love to hide in electronics youre fucked    slap your dumb bitch roommate and call the exterminators yourself  definitely tell your new landlord about it not doing so would be shady
  rip the cd dumbshit
how do you control your emotions or become emotionless its not acceptable for an adult male to have the emotional maturity of a hysterical middle school girl  i even have a pathetic meme reddit disorder anxiety cbt is a joke along with ssris and benzos are dangerously addictive temporary and tolerance building
  emotional control regulation starts with recognising what your emotions are simple identification once you know what it is you can after some practice and thought handle it effectively essentially dont let your emotions control you but still have them because theyre important to you
    ssris and benzos are dangerously addictive  ssris  addictive    i dont know where youve gotten your information from or maybe youre living under a rock either way ive yet to hear of any addict abusing prozac your body does become dependent on it but you dont jones for it the same someone would with heroin     i think it might be best to give psychiatric care and counseling another round since you dont seem to know alot about it thats something you would really benefit from if you gave it a chance and had decent professionals working with you
have any of you ever done something wrong that you feel immense guilt for and dont know how to handle    please feel free to vent or discuss the mistakes you have made in the past and how you feel about them now
  everyones dealt with that you heal or accept it over time i beat my puppy broke her nose it made me feel powerful eventually i got help and now i cherish her more than any other animal ive had  someone else touches her theyre dead i hate myself for how i was but i acknowledge the issues i had that lead me to doing it     best thing my therapist told me  you are not your actions create that distinction fix yourself and amend the situation if thats possible and then give it time accept it
  didnt give money to a street kid on christmas in negros island in the philippines  i should have
also didnt step up when i heard a guy scold and possibly beat  i will never know was 2 much of a pussy to check his gf just outside my door
  yeah im not going to talk about what i did but basically i just spent time with my friends and listened to allegri miserere i dont think ill ever do something so terrible again
  forgive yourself  some ppl throw dogs into rivers and others throw the off roofs  really unstable people id wanna take a stab at u kno
  ironically that was probably going to be her fate she was the runt of an unwanted pregnancy and the mothers owner was a gigantic douche he apparently would shoot peoples cats with a bb gun and then prop them up in alleyways he got a laugh out of imagining the owners finding them thinking theyre alive and then realizing they were just in rigor mortis after someone stood them up with pvc pipe or whatever if i see him again im probably going to jail
what am i supposed to do on the weekend when im alone im laying across my desk ready to neck myself i wouldnt have an issue he just sitting there and writing but im every one else is out doing something i feel like i should too b
you could always take an evening class  less people and less informal structure than partying and bar hopping with normie youth
there are some things you just shouldnt say by some conditioning or influence youve been told that you should hold your tounge in certain situations you may wish to save someone from embarrassment or with old information that could incriminate you  why does it feel so damn good to tell the truth being brutally honest even if it causes harm  why is this so hard to do   why cant i just hurt peoples feelings in the name of honesty help me out here anons
  how the fuck should we know come back when youre suicidal so i can encourage you
  noted
how do you keep conversations going i always just say whats on my mind/opinion and shut up afterwards and theres always an awkward silence which causes the conversation to die out i feel like i can never come up with something to keep the convo going     i just want to connect with people
ask questions be an active listener
  be an active listener    what does this mean
  depends on who youre dealing with    men like to be ranted and raved with telling them shit like how you went to the bar last night or how their clothes look off is something they like to hear and will actively push you for more info on that    women like to just be listened to and dont like conflict when listened to unless they specifically ask what you think sometimes they close up super hard though and theres not really anything you can do about that except realizing that they are and going ahead to do your own thing
  here this picture gives you the main ideas research for more got taught this by a hostage negotiator
  listen to yourself sometime some people have a way of expressing their opinions that might as well end with and there is nothing more to be said about that subject
be me  thursday or friday  at high school  sitting in 3rd pd bio  decide to fuck around  go to my school email  composerar  send a message saying ur daddy lesbian  dont wanna say her name so lets call her jannet  i change my signature to say the name of another freshman  sendwav  she checks her email  fuckmp3  she comes over to say i did it  good autismwav  i say it was not me over and over  for a good couple of minutes they buy it  they say i did it  i swear i did not do it  buy it  next day  i get pulled out  fuckfuckfuckrar  pretty cool guy  i say i was out of it buys it  he asks if i did it  say no  mp5  he says it probably was a glitch or bug  lets me off  any of you anons slightly devilish today
ive never masturbated before ive tried it but it made me feel nothing i felt it physically but didnt get any satisfaction from it i never watched porn unironically throughout my teenageyears either even though sex scenes or making out scenes in movies can make me feel turned on sometimes when it seems genuine im in a relationship but i do feel sexually attracted to them i never felt sexually attracted to someone else strongly before either
jesus fuck get your testosterone levels checked
young wageslave here i work at this trendy boba shop and ive been trying to get more hours my boss always keeps me at around 8 to 13 hours a week when i said that i would like to have 20 i dont see the situation improving anytime soon and theres another location of the same chain near my school the owners probably know each other but im fully trained to take on the other job tldr should i apply for another job at the same chain in order to make more 
work near home not school
  fulltime students should not work more than 15 hours tops
would like  thats the problem youre being too passive next time you speak to your boss say you want 1520 hours and tell him/her that you got shit to pay for and 8 hours simply isnt enough
i know the best way to get back at people you hate is to live your life and live it happily but is there other things to do in the mean time while youre improving and want to make the people who hurt you suffer how do you ruin someones reputation
  shoot them lol
  tell people what they did but without making it seem like a deliberate attempt to smear their image just be subtle about it

  i avoid social interaction because its stressful and i have a hard time connecting with people when i do interact i applied to jobs here and and got nothing no employer was interested and it took me 6 years to finish because i only took the bare minimum full time units
  i avoid social interaction because its stressful and i have a hard time connecting with people when i do interact  yeah that also applies to me and im sure i have it worse than you and yet that did not stop me from networking with professors     and it took me 6 years to finish because i only took the bare minimum fulltime units  unless you had a fulltime job while going to university this was a huge mistake now every time you get a job interview you are guaranteed to be asked why you did not finish your degree in time and if you did not also have a job you will be asked why is there a 6year long hole in your history fuck man you are fucked big f fucked     the only thing that you got going for you is that at least you got the degree thats good i advise you to bite the bullet statistics say that only 50 of people with stem degrees get jobs in stem you will have to be part of the other 50 go get some normal job man the expectations for stem are much higher
  i never bothered with office hours because the subject matter was never that difficult that i was worried about failing thats why i never got to know any professors    ive been looking into nonstem jobs but even they wont take me most would rather hire a high school graduate

  google skillsbased resumes there are ways you can present your credentials even if you didnt get paid for them
  dont have a choice in that matter buddy since youve never held a job before and because of        gotta work from the very bottom and panhandle from your friends/family because you fucked up but its not too late however
whats up gamers so i feel like shit just had a debate with my friend and im not sure if hes a sociopath or im at the wrong  what we were arguing about is something that happened years ago we were hanging out with some gal and the said gal was starting to give me some minor shit so i ignored her not wanting to make a scene  then she told me that i have no real friends to which he got really mad even if i said i have my friend here beside me but the things this girl said werent affecting me nor did i care what she had to say  so he started ass blasting her and got really mad  so we parted ways from the girl and the friend told me that i was a pussy for not defending myself and told me he lost respect for me   and told my friends how much of i pussy i was and they pretty much ostracized me for some time  now my argument was that if i was in the wrong here that his approach was too rough and that there is power dynamics at play because at that time i was too scared to say anything to him  to which he told me that now he has even less respect because i lied to him  now the way he validates his stand is that everybody he told that i was a pussy agreed with him but this guy is scary and yes men orbit him nobody confronts him  so i told him that people are scared to say no to him to avoid conflict  needles to say he disagrees and that i base my arguments on an emotional level and i hyperbolize things even though he blew this acting like a pussy thing way out of proportion in my opinion   i end up apologizing for lying and saying that i now understand his point of view  which i kind of do but in my opinion its a view of an emotionless prick  i think there is power dynamics at play here but i need a third opinion am i being too emotional
  i end up apologizing  why would you apologize when you later claim he has the view of an emotionless prick  your friend sounds like a fucking asshole  personally id take the angle of calling him a mangina/fairy/woman for gossiping and getting mad at some dumb broad  unfortunately it all happened years ago so its just water under the bridge at this point dont be afraid to stand your ground against people like him hes not going to kill you or harm you i doubt he wants the cops snooping around him
  get some new friends man
  orbits him  hes just another sad boy followed by other sad boys its just hes the one who projects it into anger  dont worry the whole lot of them are pathetic from first to last
  the problem is that my other friend i know longer and i care about so i dont want to abandon them btw few of my former friends left the circle of friends because of this guy
  it depends on how he told you that he lost respect for you was it in a fatherly way if it was in a narcissitic way like you should really give a shit what he thinks thats a glaring red flag    this guy is scary  get a life so you can get positive friends    i end up apologizing for lying  see a counselor or a mentor regularly you have some kind of dependent personality this isnt a diagnosis just a figure of speech
  also this    maybe the chick was right and she doesnt know of a real friend you have try to stay out if fights with people and to hang out with people who dont put you down
  would it hurt you to use a fucking period at the emd of a sentence

how long/how much pain should i be in before i go to the hospital/er/call an ambulance im very poor its 7am im the only one awake and i have no way to get there but since i went to bed at around 1am ive had this terrible pain in my stomach area im a girl but its no where near my period im not pregnant the pain is in the uterus/intestines area and goes from the front to the back mostly on the right its not so bad hat im crying but more so because i know the movement of crying will just hurt more it is bad enough that moving at all hurts very badly and i now cant sleep the pain is now also going up my spine and my right thigh and right lower arm should i be worried or go back to bed and let it pass
  since youve had this pain for six hours it seems rather unusual any other signs of illness like fever or anything
  pain on the right lower abdo front to back    hello appendicitis
  i dont think so i feel nauseous but im pretty sure its due to the pain ive been having diabetic like symptoms for a few months now but i havent done anything as i literally cant afford it if i could die ill go to the hospial but if not ill handle it at home
  go to the hospital    i fucking hate america for having people pay for emergencies what a shit country
  my boyfriend has had that and gad his apendix removed he said if it was that i would be screaming and sobbing in pain im just unable to do much but like if i had to get up amd work or clean i could probably manage be it very slow and painful
  i live in canada but i still cant afford the cab/medication because seeing the doctor is free people go for everything and the er wait is hours upon hours i have no personal doctor and am on a multiple year long waiting list walk ins turn you away at the door    i have had similar pain in the same spot a few select days earlier in the past two months and it passed in a day or so but it was never this bad
update for more info but its tmi   it hurts when i use the bathroom in any way not in a uti kinda way but more like a sharp pain in my lower right a sharp pulling in my lower right back i had slight diarrhea and the pain is fading a bit but i find it very unlikely that this amount of pain is due to needing to poo i had one gulp of iced tea and almost vomited but jeld back because o have a fear of vomit     for the past month or so i have had recurring symptoms but im too poor to do anything about them they include shaking blurry eyesight and fatigue my finger and toe tips go numb at times and i bruise very easy     i was suposed to be ovulating two days ago and thought the pain im having now could jyst be that when it started but i think its passed that in the pain threshold it seems to be passing a bit but ive been lying in bed im unsure if i should wait it out or tell someone my boyfriend and gis friend are asleep in the living room but got high last night so theyll be too out of it to do much
  do you have friends that can help you you need to go to the hospital immediately
  yup sounds a bit like it
  my boyfriend woke up and simply told me just relax idk what to do     i have no friends or anyone who can help in any way the pain seems to be fading a bit but i havent moved in a while should i try explain to my boyfriend that its worse than he thinks or just listen to him and go back to bed
  can you call your parents please dump your idiot boyfriend
  my dad lives very far away so no even if i had someone to drive me theres no point i cant aford even the medication they would give me if it was my apendix my only option is to wait it out     my boyfriend isnt bad hes just had his apendix out and said that if it was that id be screaming and crying in pain as of now im just laying in bed
  its insane that in civilized countries you still dont have free health care
  im in canada free health care yes but not medication or any of the like hospital waits are 10 hours even at the er i am in probably one of the smallest cities in canada
  well if its 10 hours why are you wasting time laying around and posting on 4chan youre going to be here bitching tomorrow about your tummy when if you had just gone now youd be done with it and know whats wrong
dating girl for a few months  see her texting one day and i ask her who it is  she tells me its an ex  tell her thats not really cool but i trust her so whatever  tells me its no problem and they barely talk  2 months later  see her texting and constantly checking her phone as if waiting for a response  she does this for hours constantly texting and waiting around her phone  figure shes just chatting up a friend  does it again the next day  notice she hides or closes her phone when i get near  ask her what is going on and who she is texting like mad  find out its an ex bf  says she doesnt want to bother me with her problems so she went to talk to him  ive told her numerous times to communicate her problems with me but she says i barely acknowledge anything when she does  she tells me shes blocked and deleted him but has been depressed even more than usual because of him    well lads this doesnt sound good does it 99 percent chance she hasnt cheated as we spend every day together but it feels ridiculous to be talking to someone and be so upset over him the trust has been shattered now do i give her another chance here everything ekse has been great except for times where she clams up due to depression and doesnt want to talk
  leave her it doesnt even matter if she was considering cheating or anything you cant possibly trust her after that
  bro dump her and run shes gonna cuck you one day or another might as well end the relationship without you looking like a cuckold to all your friends
  she doesnt sound like a trustworthy individual tomorrow is the time to break up with her
  thats lowkey emotional cheating plus we all know women emotionally cheat before they physically cheat just dump her and move on if shes confiding her problems to an ex and not you thats a red flag ya dummy
  your roastie gf is more than likely cheating on you  leave her asap
  leaving her is a bit obvious looking at it from the outside get it over with quick dont convince yourself its fine
  the roastie more than likely used you as an emotional and perhaps financial crutch after her breakup with her ex  but now she regretted it and wants to go back to him get the fuck away from this mess and be more careful next time
  thats a normie none issue be grateful you have a gf you normals are never happy some of us have real issues go back to facebook or normie land
calmly pack her stuff and leave it at her parents leave her    shes emotionally cheating its a matter of when not if she eventually commits a physical infidelity shell always keep you paranoid about this its no way to live    dump her and move on
its over just break up now you have no chance of saving this one
how many of you know about cannabis for pain management   i just got a severe injury and reading online it takes a few months to recover from this but the pain is so bad i need some way to manage it  im on advil x2 a day now but its not that effective   it takes me 510 minutes to get out of bed in the morning because how bad the pain is getting   i live in constant pain
yes it is good for pain you can get a type that doesnt make you high either without thc i think but takes away the pain
  cbd     i was thinking of trying indica only but cbd sounds like what im looking for  im trying to talk to a doc about this tomorrow so ill pick up some cbd oil later    fuck i hope this works because i dont want to feel any pain   if this works its a miracle drug  advil doesnt seem to work that well
  any previous experiences with cannabis  what sort of access do you have to cannabis just herb and edibles or can you get hash oil  are you ok with being stoned or do you not want to feel high at all  look for something that has less thc than cbd if you can get 201 cbdthc oil thats in mct or coconut oil that would be a good place to start  cannabis has many compounds and for most purposes works best with the full spectrum think of a symphony different instruments are more dominate in different songs just takes a little of fine tuning
  it can help but its not a complete replacement for perscription pain pills  in my experience with having gallstones cannabis edibles enable you to take much less pain killers    if you can get yourself a medical card     pic related a batch of green dragon that i just finished
  im in a legal county  this pain is fucking killing me  just woke up to grab another advil for the morning     going to pick up some cbd in the morning   i have no idea if it will work for this type of pain
  look for something with cbn in it cbn is pretty heavy and makes you sleepy
is living in a van a viable way to live  what are good ways to make money while living and traveling in a van
  financially its shit due to depreciation ive looked at doing it before and shared house is cheaper and way more luxurious if youre in the uk houseboats seem much better for ful time living although ive never done either
  for cheap housing my first option to investigate would be house hacking
  mm its not for cheap living its for the travelling and seeing shit and stuff
  ah ok yeah that sounds good hope it goes well for you
  it can be done     assume that you have the van purchased already     you need some cash to give you some cushion for various expenses or in case of an emergency   like any way of life you have to possess a way of generating income that means having a skill trade or doing manual labor     i knew guy years ago that supposedly traveled from various music festivals selling crystals to fartsniffing hippies the problem is that you have to believe what youre selling like any salesman this is just one example but it gives you an idea of the mindset youre dealing with     which brings up the point of security city life is dangerous and this is a fact and you need to take precautions and however you choose to do this is up to you     additionally you gotta think about where youre going to park the van to sleep cook food and to establish a temporary base some people say you can still park at walmart but you need to check with the store management first from what ive been told theyre sympathetic you can also purchase cheap food and other supplies from walmart if you desire     i suggest purchasing a membership to a 24hour gym that is franchised around the country that way you can go take showers there and park if need be     anything is possible with the cash to do it   but i would still suggest not going on the adventure alone for various safety and psychological reasons    whatever you may do good luck
  i see  ill have a bit of savings before hand probably to last up to a year of fundamental needs  for work i could get jobs doing whatever online or stop in a city for awhile and get some shitty mcdonalds job and save up for a few more months of travel then repeat when it runs out  i have guns for security  and ill be going with my wife  thanks for the advice
what are some signs of interest that a girl is attracted to you
when you ask her out on a date and she says yes
  i have been with girls that accept going to a date with me that doesnt had feelings for me
  hard to tell even if you can put your dick in them you dont know for sure
  how does she react when you flirt with her
im a chick and i cant even tell you maybe if she tries to interact with you a lot i dunno were hard to decipher desu
  this is a bad example    how does she react when you flirt with her  she obviously like the attention even mens like the attention isnt a good sign      tell me about somebody you like    tell me about the person that came to your mind when i said that phrase how you react when you are around that person
she does what the anime grill in your op image does while looking at you
  you can always tell when youre not a fucking wallflower   see how she acts when you take the room see how she reacts when she fights back   you can always tell
  they wont tell you only on rare occasions will a grill try to give you a hint     they will always expect you to ask and put yourself in the line lazy cunts
  i can see you didnt watch the show
  ive seen it i just dont remember that part
              a girl in college give me countless of signs    touches flips twirls strokes or fusses with her hair or brushes it across her forehead or behind her ears  prolonged eye contact or a sideways glance  looks down when eye contact is made even better if she also smiles  looks at you looks away quickly looks back looks away again etc  widened glistening eyes and slightly raised eyebrows  dilated pupils  lowered eyelids  her eyes move from your eyes to your lips or lower to your chest and back up  you catch her staring at you  smiles at you  touches you in any way places her hand on your arm chest thigh grabs your hand etc  accidentally touches/bumps into you  playfully punches or hits you  asks personal questions about you ie your name where you live  asks if you have a girlfriend or mentions your girlfriend even if you dont have one  laughs enthusiastically and/or loudly at your jokes even if they are not that funny ie im funny but im not that funny  giggles  compliments you or says she likes something about you  reinitiates conversations when there is silence  initiates any kind of conversation  moves into your vicinity  finds any excuse to talk to you or be near you  leans into you in conversation  rests her head on her hands framing her face  body ie feet and shoulders directly faces you even if her face is not  sits with her legs crossed with knee/foot pointing directly at you even if her face is not  blows smoke at you/in your direction  repeatedly crosses and uncrosses her legs  dangles shoe from foot while sitting  absence of crossed arms  crossed legs when standing up  licks her lips  bites her lower lip  applies chapstick or lipstick  1/2
              chews on a pen finger or any other object  sucks in her lips  fidgets with a piece of clothing or item  strokes bottle stem of wine glass or other cylindrical object  rubs/strokes/touches herself anywhere  adjusts/straightens clothing to look better or perfect  moves clothes to show you skin ie lifts her skirt or lets her sleeve fall over her shoulder  crosses her legs so you have a good view of her thigh ie the thigh is on display facing you  thrusts out tits or ass or perks up  exposes underside of wrists  exposes her palms  tilts head to the side exposing neck  lowers her head and looks up at you  blushes  stumbles on her words or talks quickly or alternatively lost for words  trips up or stumbles in a nervous or caughtoffguard way sometimes even slightly as a body movement hiccup her eyes may also hiccup  says your name in conversation  mimics your talking style pronunciation exclamation inflection etc and repeats words or phrases that youve said  mirrors your body language  buys or gives you something  tells you that youre attractive/hot/cute/handsome  tells you that youre a player or accuses you of having many girlfriends or hookups  gives you her number  gives you shit    i invete her to go out and she say no who the hell understand that    2/2
  she obviously like the attention even mens like the attention isnt a good sign  what i mean is if she ignores you if you flirt with her thats obviously a bad sign
  the only way to know is to ask her out
  it seems like he did
    she give at least 20 signs in that pasta and she say no that she isnt interested in me
  i did    she say no    this is exactly why im insecure as fuck
  reinitiates conversations when there is silence    what do you guys usually talk about
  sorry for missing that does she flirt with other guys maybe she just likes male attention
    these are all very valid signs if interest i wouldnt know since ive never experienced those but they seen valid     perhaps she wants you to pursue her keep asking her and get on your hands and knees     personally i dont care enough to pursue any women because of outright laziness and insecurity/trust issues
  perhaps she wants you to pursue her  but op already asked her out either she just wants male attention or is playing hard to get
  so try again bitches aint shit dont let one rejection ruin your stride
there are none
    why be insecure you found out that she doesnt like you that means youre now free to stop thinking about it and move on    i know this is like the hardest thing to get over when youre younger and when youve got oneitis but trust me there are plenty of girls who are rough approximations of the one that rejected you
  does she flirt with other guys  i have never seen her flirting with somebody else
  then maybe shes playing hard to get
  not even the best luxury suite in the world had a better feeling than sleeping in your comfy house    i dont wanna move on i like this girl i wanna try harder i wanna make her fall in love i just dont know how
  try again with the same girl or with other girls
flirts with me  touches me  starts convos with me hobbies future family  always says hi extremely enthusiastically good banter between us  casually mentions she has an ldr bf  explain this you fucking shitposters
  she is obviously what we would call a thot
  a churchthot  goes every sunday  wont say oh my gd
she is just a thot
  long distance relationships are a joke    we are animals her brains doesnt even proceed that that guy even exist as a real person relationships are mean to be both sexual and emotional in front of a computer or a phone you cant fill skin hunger or the affection of a hug    see the point she doesnt have a boyfriend what are you waiting
  leave asuka alone
  that doesnt make her any morally superior to the average thot
  she has a boyfriend but due to circumstances they cant see each other as much as they would like to if your partner went on a trip for work would you instantly start cheating on them
  maybe she was into the guy next to you
  haha nice try   not op but i asked her out and she said yes but she stated she doesnt have feelings for me   wahahahaha
  holy fuck haahahha
  when she is swallowing your cum and saying thank you daddyafterward thats a pretty good sign that she doesnt hate you
  i must concur i apperictae the obvious clues
  this and only this
just broke up with gf and i feel like the reason is because i reasoned against her too much basically she wanted me to apologize and take full responsibility for something that damaged our relationship when in fact we both were responsible for the damage she adamantly wanted me to apologize for all of it plus some other stuff that werent even relevant or true instead of taking it like a man i tried to debate that somethings werent all my fault i feel like that was the dumb move was it am i supposed to just let my gf walk all over me christ i feel so inexperienced
  your story is kinda vauge its hard to tell whos right
  give specifics
    heres the condensed version  she blindsides me  completely lose my spaghetti bcz 1st big break up  cries outside her apt  she calls the cop on me  months later she wants to get back  i do too  she wants me to apologize for behaving so emotionally   i dont understand why she cant sympathize from my perspective  i know i behaved emotional during an extremely emotional time but she wants complete full apology from me  she acts like she take no responsibility on her part for blindsiding me  idk if these details help
    maybe she just cant date someone emotional like me so shes demanding an apology to make it seem like ive changed for her help me out here
  it still depends man what did she blindside you with and how did you react did you yell at her hit her
  blindside as in we need to talk its over i cant emphasize how short and surprising it was like literally carpet pulled out under fuck no im not a brainlet and never got verbal or physical i definitely expressed my emotions extremely openly but i mean no harm why would she even try to initiate in getting back with me if im harmful idk i feel like i failed a test shouldve just apologized even if it wasnt 100 my fault
  thinkingjpg  did she fuck a guy after she dumped you why did she say she broke up with you
  no you arent stupid its actually really hard to bow down and apologize for everything especially when you have some sort of grounds to be upset  im a pushover in my relationship and apologize for almost everything now my partner does very occasionally when hes 100 in the wrong  it takes a large toll on you and i feel worthless constantly especially when its rarely returned  really fucks up your self esteem
  no dude if you didnt yell at her or get physical she had no reason to call the cops if she doesnt care or try to sympathize with how you feel she doesnt value the relationship please dont blame yourself for having emotions blame your girl for being unwilling to put in the effort to make things right between you two
  yeah she had a hand in making you feel incredibly stressed out
  no were not fucking animals cheating on one another cheating/rebounding is unpatrician  i dont know why hence blindside its all a blur desu    its really fucking hard for me to bow like i bow to no one but now am thinking maybe i shouldve i didnt bcz id be lying to myself and to her and who knows what road itll lead to if i keep bowing
  did you not leave after she told you to leave multiple times when she broke up with you
  get physical   ok she tried to return to her apt in the middle of our heated convo and i reflexively grab her wrist she told me to let go and i immediately did and apologized on the spot for grabbing is that physical it was rude af for her to just leave like that in the middle of convo but also know its wrong to get physical with a girl idk thats the most physical it got i just reached for her hand but didnt even have time to move it before she said let go
  i think thats fine but then again im not a pussy ass bitch
  no i didnt and this is my fault youre right its that shes making our fight seem like its all about this part and nothing else mattered  i never asked her to apologize i forgive whatever she did but shes making it seem like its 100 my fault
  let me indulge you with an old saying my friend do you want to be right or do you want a happy home you stood up for what you thought was best so kudos to you but if the relationship mattered to you then as a man only your girl can walk over you and no one else people should stop misinterpreting trp
  god damn it i failed the test didnt i should just let gf satisfy her emotions and bow this one time
  not a pussy ass bitch  yeah on 4chan that sounds highly credible anon /btard
  please share more of this perspective i feel like this is the right step to take to move onto the next level
  slow down there son its alright you passed with flying colors although as for the relationship it really depends as i dont know the extent of your relationship in full and would not like to know without being consented to if she meant a lot and was supportive all the way caring and compassionate and stayed by your side in the roughest of times you then shes a definite keeper from what i read it sounds like you guys have plenty of unearthed issues and it is leaning towards the negative personally ive been there before and if youre as stubborn as i am then youll want to be hurt another 35 times before you come to your senses to quote anime believe in the me that believes in you
  what do you mean come to your senses
  shes a definite keeper but i think id also have to let her walk all over me a lot down the road sigh
  since shes a keeper do all you can for her dont let anyone sway your opinion but also make sure no matter what relationship comes your way you are first before others even your girl and refer back to right vs happy home yo know when you should let her walk over you unfortunately men dont win against women so this logic will sound hypocritical      it doesnt work out i cant stress enough that you must prepare for it of it ever comes to it let your emotions emerge in private and not in her face    no matter what focus on yourself dont put her on a pedestal but keep her close at heart and mind as a relationship is the basis of dedication  one last thing dont open up to her about any negative or distressing things often or at all if it can be helped avoid that as some people want to know who you are today rather than what led to you becoming who you are today
    this is also me op  if you seek to be right you will do everything in your power to be right regardless of the consequences if you are in a relationship and want it to last you need to make personal sacrifices like being correct granted if it is downright disagreeable or unreasonable/debased then stand your ground but some things that stress women out that are really trivial should be endured at least to reduce the possible chaos to ensue have good judgment and know how to read your partners emotions body languages and the status of the relationship communication is key to everything and always ask if anything troubles you or her
  i think apologizing this time is well worth putting my dignity aside if anything i want to put the pedestal on her sometimes lol no she really likes me and i appreciate her i guess some fights are better to lose than win
  i can tell ok ill apologize because its not worth it really ill keep right vs happy home in mind tbh my dad does this too with my mom
  dignity and pride are one thing happiness is another keep at it man and look towards the best of things be persistent and be true to yourself youre still young simon and have a lot more to go for you it isnt stupid to lose fights on purpose but avoid them from becoming accidents go get your nia simon
  were done i apologized but for some reason still couldnt meet in the middle no regret
  what a weak and passive bitch you are being you know why it feels like a test because it is shes testing you to see if you are strong enough to stand up to her bullshit she will not submit to you if you cant stand your ground or control your emotions i want you to think long and hard about something guy she left you you were hurt then she called the fucking cops on you unless you gave her a left hook there is no reason for that to be happening and shows a complete lack of compassion for you and disrespect now she wants you to apologise fuck that do not put up with this kind of crap from anyone especially the one you see yourself loving this is pathetic
  its not actually a test its fundamental irreconcilable difference in personality ive tried to compromise because we both truly liked each other in the end she refused to give an inch trust me shes not evil like youre making it out to be everyones different
  we both truly liked each other  im sure she likes you so much she cant stand to be with you  in the end she refused to give an inch   because she doesnt respect you  trust me shes not evil like youre making it out to be everyones different    i never said evil but shes definitely a cruel bitch for breaking your heart then trying to get you arrested you want advice look for a woman that will cares about your well being and that treats you better than a fucking hobo they exist
  you are most likely fucked because if you dont stand your ground she will subconsciously lose respect for you and that will be worse than simply breaking up right now
  because she doesnt respect you  dont think thats it my guess is she simply dont realize how extremely off base her calling the cops on me is shes not paranoid but thats kind of the direction were going here as you can tell were both extreme i dont think she realizes how extreme she also is therefore blamed everything on me    this isnt about respect or whatever macho pack leader thing dude
  girls emotionally break up with you long before you ever figure it out     so get used to being blindsided
  youre making excuses for her dude wake the fuck up her behavior is completely out of line and you shouldnt give her a second chance you deserve a relationship that is healthy and based on respect and compassion if you want to be happy not based on extremes
  im woke if i wasnt id be crying atm instead of analyzing it all we were both of out line but in the end she only sees me out of line i guess she doesnt sympathize with me crying so openly or understand im just being emotional but pose no actual threat of fucking course ive tried to reach middle ground no regret after trying
  it is clearly about respect friendo and it has nothing to do with machoism its evolutionary psychology you are in for a joyful ride if you dont understand how it works every single woman does that and not a single one is coscious about it
  listen theres nothing wrong with crying it makes you human you havent done anything wrong but keep the tears to yourself and not out in front of your girl theres 7 billion people on the planet you only need to find 1 good one you can do better than this
  this guy is right too
  i know what you mean but thats not the case here after we cooled down we still have mutual respect just like in the beginning if she didnt respect me we wouldnt have dated to begin with nor would she tried to get back together
  she acts like she take no responsibility on her part for blindsiding me  red flag just run
  instead of taking it like a man i tried to debate that somethings werent all my fault  if you know youre in the right just keep to it pretending youre wrong when you know youre not is not being a man its being retarded
flirts with me   touching  always bantering with each other  does not do it at all or to the same level with others    casually says she has an ldr boyfriend  says she dated friends previously  says she doesnt care that her boyfriend has girl friends that he hangs alone with and vice versa  what the fuck why is she doing this this is the second time a girl has acted like this in the past 5 days
so who will stay in a girls mind and heart more a guy who helps her with alot of stuff or a guy who makes her laugh
the one who knocked her up son
  the guy with money and visible abs
guy who makes her laugh
  guy who makes her laugh
  and what if shes not a thot
  then it doesnt matter she will have low standards
  being able to make a girl laugh is generally the best thing you can do to make her fall for you its better than money strength and wealth by far but its also the thing you cant really work on you either have it or you dont
22m     lets say im out with my girl and some random dude approaches and starts being all friendly   at what point can i infer hes trying to hit on my girlfriend and at what point can i infer shes into it      i was out at the bar and some dude comes up talking about how the bartender is racist or some shit story of course a minute later hes like you care if i play pool with your girlfriend and shes just sitting there smiling next thing i know shes down to walk away from me to play pool with some dude    is this whack or am i insecure
  i would be insecure af too but the best thing to do in that scenario is like sure dude wanna play pool with this guy gf    then walk away and talk to other girls check in on your gf in like 30 minutes    its sketchy and hes obviously trying to get with her but showing jealousy is the worst card to play in any sitch like this
lmao  first of all dont go to bars they are always full of stupid people  secondly if a dude tried that shit with me i would just laugh and be like tell you what how about i play you instead while she watches or if i didnt feel like playing and i didnt like the way she was acting i would just say we were actually just leaving fuck that shit    also if she acts like that a lot i would just dump her
  you are pathetic of you let the scenario you just described happen also what the fuck are you doing hanging out in bars nothing good can happen there
this was a shittest and you lost the guy was obviously making a move and she either went for it or wants you to know she has options    either way you shouldve sorted out your business
  i always thought video games are bad influences but now im sure i wonder if avoiding video games has ever done anything good for me
  you pass an shit test by not being reactuve and not caring
  either way you shouldve sorted out your business  specifically what would that entail    you could do   tell you what how about i play you instead while she watches  but if you suck at pool like i do then youll also fail the shit test and have to deal with the guy ribbing on you definitely worse than leaving the decision to the girl
   lets say im out with my girl and some random dude approaches and starts being all friendly   at what point can i infer hes trying to hit on my girlfriend  when you establish that she doesnt know the guy either
  if you really want to play that game prepare for   every man is trying to interest your girl  she is into all of them to some degree  youre winning as long as her interest in you exceeds her interest in them  you accomplish that by being better than other men and by never needing to recoup a loss
i have recently found out that i fit into the category of being a degenerate how the fuck do i stop
  stop having sex with strangers and repent
  pretty much
  you mean stop fornicating  just because you know them doesnt make it right
be me    today working with head chief    been doing paninis the way he told me and told me it was goodi work at a cafe    sees me cutting a paninis and wrapping it proceeds to say    thats wrong annon      wtfjpg    tell him ive been doing it his way all along    mfw he says he has to re teach me and yells      mfw i cant say anything or else he will tell the owner    what do i like this job and dont want him to get under my skin
  wtf just roll with it do you wanna keep your job or not when youre head chef then you can call the shots
  you are a cook a sandwich maker at that doesnt sounds like you actually make anything point is you are paid to do things the way they want it done now shut the fuck up and go make me a sandwich    zupas
fair enough
  thats how restaurants are you need to have thick skin and learn to shut up and listen dont worry though restaurants are way too desperate for workers to fire them you can only really get fired if you no call no show or violate some health code
alright this is it hopefully my last thread about my beta insecurities  ill make it quick    first ever gf3months  didnt know what to do at the beginning also was/still am insecure about the relationship etc  and i just read this        this was amazing and helped me a lot     but there is one small thing im still after reading this kind of insecure about    her ex still texts her  very eary in the relationship first or second day i beleve she asked me if i was ok with him texting her i said okay  info about her ex they had a long distance for i think a year and she visited him muliple times did eversthing exept have sex  she broke up with him because he was an ashole and didnt tell her stuff like that he did drugs or something along those lines  they broke up somewere in april  he still texts her to this day  and she finds it anoying  she doest want to block him because she is too nice of a person to do that but she doenst want him texting her  but she also replys im guessing small things like haha yea but i have no information about that    1 what do you guys think about the text in the link  2 what should i do about her ex texting her  im sure they had a great time when they were togeather and all that but   i dont want that  also im not worried that she is going to cheat or anything    thanks for helping hope i wont have to make another thread
  he still texts her to this day  and she finds it anoying  she doest want to block him because she is too nice of a person    ask her what she is gaining from still texting with him  straight up what is the point of texting with your ex    dont play games be strict    and the text you linked is pretty okay it reads like a feverdream someone had  it starts slowly but escalates quickly and gives a solution at the end  wouldnt take it too serious maybe 1 or 2 things are practical but take that text with a side of salt
  thanks for taking time to reply really i appreciate that a lot    mind sharing your thoughts on what will/or should happen if i talk with her about that    also what are some of the unpractial things
  fucking christ when will you kids learn just fucking leave just read everything you wrote completely outside your perspective imagine your someone else because all im seeing as an outsider is a bunch a bullshit youre deciding to deal with that you dont have to your entire life revolves around some wet hole youve attached a bullshit story to shes definitely gonna fuck that guy again with the next 35 years probably 36 months shes clearly immature and thrives off conflict the way to deal with your beta mind set isnt to condition yourself out of jealousy when your girlfriend wants to fuck other people if your alpha there wouldnt be jealousy because she wouldnt be doing that shit im not saying be jealous and shout and scream at her to change her im saying pack up and leave because shes not worth your time and thats what it alpha means its not about dominance fuck fuck games its a simple awareness of your worth and decisive intention on how you choose to live your life
    example  you can find out what else turns her on and she opens to you in ways she has never opened herself with any guy why do you think women always come back to me always the options out their is so poor she has to come back to the confident sexually aggressive guy the guy where she cannot do what she does to other guys she knows she cannot get away with 90 she does with other guys with him she knows he has options if she does    that reads like its from an eroticnovel  the practical stuff is  be confident in your self worth   you can focus on having a great time with your girlfriend    i think the whole article only shows one niche situation  in reality there are so many different options that this situation can go any other way  you say you dont like her meeting guys  she says okay and you dont get jealous  problem solved  i know easy example but still    what will/or should happen if i talk with her about that  idk you or your girlfriend can you rationalize with her well    yes she will give you a proper answer  depending on what she will say it will get better or worse  i just want to be friendly  you dont need to be friendly with your ex if he is annoying you  i still like/love him  well good luck with that anon    no she will say its non of your business and will get angry
  you forgot that huge ass clap and spanking hard     it worked with mine
hey so heres the situation   i have been taking testosterone since 2012 for gender transitioning and my periods stopped pretty quickly from late 2015early 2016 i missed those injections after a rough time in my life and the bleeding recommenced and just hasnt really stopped since if i counted all the odd days that there was no blood then it would probably equal about 26 days     ive decreased the amount of time between injections  been put on the pill which makes my life a living hell since the bleeding becomes heavier and i had cramps so bad i couldnt sleep or generally function for months   i had the mirena put in during august this year which didnt decrease the bleeding and again caused so much cramping it was removed a few days ago because it was being rejected by my body and trying to escape   still bleeding and even heavier than before   the next option unless the bleeding miraculously stops is to try endometrial ablation or try the pill again  has anyone had or know someone to have had this surgery its daunting to read that despite having the surgery i could still get light bleeding   is there any other suggestion whether surgical or not     im tired of this i keep saying im at my witts end but willing to hear advice if there is any
did you go to your endocrinologist both the pill and lorena have oestrogen in it so maybe that messed up with your testosterone stress also messes with bleeding    but to be honest i have no idea what i am saying so good luck bro
  ever actually wanting to become a man  what the fuck why do women want to downgrade
  id downgrade anytime if it gives me the confidence to pee while standing up
  i will try asking there too      honestly i havent had an endo since 2014 when i moved state all i could really get since was a gp in a clinic aimed more towards the lgbt crowd ill look into that and hope there are better options since its been a few years       i suppose since i actually want to be a man and back then it didnt seem like men were sooooo evil      this person is onto something
why do this to your body
  youre purposefully damaging your body and wondering why it isnt behaving the way you expected what did you think would happen
  how so
the only solution is the sweet embrace of death
  you are female youre trying to become a man with hormones that your body doesnt want you can try everything in the world and if you are finally successful then in the end you will still never be a man
well its not like we didnt tell you so get off 4chan and get to a professional youre dealing with the literal unknown yeah in case you werent really made aware you guys are the guinea pigs on this with any luck youll make it into a science journal somewhere    anyway you need someone with the tools to help on this advice is only going to go so far a professionals opinion will be more valuable surely
  alright so i suppose i should go end my life then because that would be better than not trying    oh god how i wish that i could just take a magical fairy pill and my female organs would just disappear i half expected some idiotic posts like this one
  bruh just dress and act manly  youre fucking up your body heavily
  very aware and yes im still going to the medical professionals wasnt really planning to stop that i came here to see if anyone had any other ideas or experience in this rare situation looks like theres not much advice out there
  been there done that didnt exactly win at the masculine feature genetics treatment has helped with that and if that is determined to be my own downfall then ill have to live with that
so basically ive been in love with my best friend for almost 2 years now and i was friendzoned a year ago when i spilled the beans    we didnt fall apart and stayed friends do you think it would be a good idea to ask her again 1 year later or it may damage our friendship completely
  did she hint she likes you now
this was like 15 years ago but  8th grade lock in  im showing off dance moves  fucking fat pos but still got moves  the girl i had a crush on got 3 years comes up to me and says she wants to talk  oh fuck oh shit oh fuck oh shit  blurt out the first thing that comes to mind  end up yelling no right in her face  she runs away crying  i just stand there  figure after a half hour i should see whats up  her friends stop me from seeing her  dont you think youve done enough harm  that woman is a lesbian now  woops
you were a kid and they do stupid shit like that this one story is not enough to get an idea of whether you might be autistic
hey /adv/  im going away for 6 months to a school type of setting you americans dont have this its like a thing you can do when you graduate the equivalent of highschool all the way up to about 25 not college btw  how do i start socializing with people i have anxiety and am on the autism spectrum but im determined to go as i need to improve my life i have barely been outside in the past 6 months so this is my big chance
  selfactualization work hard to achieve your dreams no matter how goofy and far off they seem a lot of anxiety comes from insecurity with yourself
  thanks

  what country are you from what do you learn in this school
  scandinavia too paranoid to say which one  its usually a time for people to figure out their career path these type of schools are all over the country and the subjects are extremely varied and fun from school to school each school usually have 57 main subjects before you start you pick one and that subject is going to be your major focus  some have music production game development animation sports meditation even political discourse martial arts of all kinds and all kinds of crazy fun stuff as a main subject and 80 of your time will be spent learning all about that while 20 are for less important side subjects which can also be interesting graffiti design history and so on can be sidesubjects for example usually these sidesubjects can also be a minimized version of a mainsubject
i am very unhappy with the way i look and i feel that it restricts me from getting what i want and functioning in society but the only ways i can think of changing it are plastic surgery which i cant afford or want what do i do
  pictures like this make me fucking diamonds    dont get plastic surgery
dont get plastic surgery thats for pussies        watch the videos on this guys channel he explains what makes people attractive and how to make yourself more attractive without surgery depending on your age it could take a year or two but the end result is definitely worth it
i am 18 years old and there is a 14 year old who is into me shes mature looking devolved like a normal teenager however what kinda maturity distance would there be between us would it be possible to have a healthy relationship or is she to young to maintain that we already talked about sex being out of the question until shes older
i am 18 years old and there is a 14 year old  stop right now
stop seeking out middle schoolers
i was in this position and i was the younger female and let me just say for the sake of the both of you dont do it thats gonna fuck with her and you for the rest of your lives
    nothing illegal about it shes like any other girl my age both of us in highschool still i just dont know if she is mentally able to have a healthy relationship
  what was your experience like and why didnt it work out do you think less of him now    was he even 18 or older
  mind explaining how
  meant to say developed not devolved
  my experience was awful im disgusted that he would date me when i was practically just a child a high school freshman and he was a college freshman under the excuse that i was mature i wasnt mature no 14 year old is mature enough to go out with a legal adult it didnt work out because i had no idea how relationships worked and we fought almost every day because of me not knowing how to control my emotions and him stringing me along probably because he was just lonely this went on for a year and whenever i look back on it i regret it completely even if nothing sexual ever happened i cringe all the time and if i had a chance i would wipe it all from my memory
  shes a sweet girl with a lot of positive qualities even though she is 14 what makes her just a child i literally just turned 18 and knew her as a friend when i was 17 dont assume im just some grown adult like your college freshman boyfriend
  my best friend had a similar situation he was a senior she was a sophomore it was a 3 year difference but its might be the same if your birthdays are close they started dating 4 years ago and theyre still happily together today in a small studio with a dog theyre certain theyre getting married too im super jealous at how successful their relationship has been honestly     but you also have to consider how her family would feel about you you could lie and tell them youre 17 and your birthday is around the corner or you just turned 18 or just dont mention it and hope they dont ask its a lot to consider but i say go for it but be careful when it comes to sex
  shes 14 shes a child dude shes nowhere near an adult and shes sure as fuck not ready for a relationship positive qualities or not trust me she is not mature enough to handle a relationship whatsoever shes straight out of middle school have you ever seen middle school relationships theyre fuckin disasters because the kids have no idea what theyre doing every 14 year old i have ever known has objectively been shit at relationships just dont do it
i was 19 and had a 15 year old gf we were both in highschool and nothing sexual ever happened because i knew it was wrong and i wanted a gf i didnt understand why it was odd but i cringe whenever i think about it just stop dont do it
    shes never had a real relationship either is this bound to end in a firey disaster
  is she recently 14nor turning 15 soon
  this is a hopeful situation but it seems unlikely for me and this girl id want to make it work if it was possible but the other anons seem to think otherwise
  her birthday was around 3 months ago
  dude just try and see how it goes theres no harm done in just trying but you will always wonder what could have been if you dont     not like itll be a waste of time youll at least get the experience and learn a little more what you look for in a woman since youre still young yourself
  oh then yeah thats gonna be a no go cap keep her close but head back to the drawing board
  i dont think its 100 going to end up a fuckin disaster but it most likely will because it sounds like she has 0 relationship experience and 0 idea what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior in a relationships and youre about to graduate soon so thats going to be creepy to outsiders youre going to be going through a lot of changes and so is she its just not going to work out save yourself and her the embarrassment in the future
    ill balance out these ideas to the best of my abilities maybe do some gay promise shit where we say well start dating later or something
  is it possible for her to grow and adapt or something i feel like if im her first boyfriend shed be more willing to stick with me through the tough times
  she should grow and adapt on her own give her a few years dude young teenagers have reeeeaaallllyyyy bad judgement and high school from my experience is when you change the most in the least amount of time wait until shes at least a junior or senior or something
  sounds like way more trouble than its worth ive noticed she has problems showing affection and expressing emotions ill keep her close as a friend till shes older or just drop her altogether     she seemed more mature for her age but i guess that was me being hopeful or something
  she/he is really mature is often just an excuse and they really arent that mature at all more mature than their peers in some ways sure as mature as you probably not
she/he is really mature
stop being a creepy pedophile faggot anon
    you sure got me
  dont listen to those homosexuals youre based and lolipilled
  successful relationships come when both parties are mature adults not when neither is
  kids romanticize male adults  dont encourage this in a romantic or sexual way  be her pseudo big brother be her friend these are fine options    we already talked about sex being out of the question until shes older  it is fucking disturbing that you are even talking about it  she is not your girlfriend knock that shit out of your head  she is just a girl who likes you dont pervert that because you cant get a girlfriend your own age
  its not only about the mental difference also a practical one do you really as an adult want to be dealing with her parents for permission on when and if you see her what you do    at that age she does not want a relationship she wants to play at having relationships hold hands twice and then break up with you that being the extent of emotional depth she is comfortable handling you want a steady relationship where you are practically on the road towards engagement you are not a match no matter how nice and perky her boobs are
i met my girlfriend when i was 18 and she was 15 which is legal in europe so we could fuck right away so it was basically the same and were still together now aged 21 and 18 so id say just go with it it might turn out well
  its not a big deal society puts a lot of pressure on us because everyone is jealous you get to date a hot prime 14 year old and they cant the maturity gap will close as you get older its really no big deal    listen to the naysayers they never have any good reasons just a mot of anger
   because it sounds like she has 0 relationship experience and 0 idea what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior in a relationships    fuck my girlfriend is almost 19 and never had a relationship either i do feel like her emotions control her too much because of her age and inexperience sometimes but it is tolerable im 25 and shes my first girlfriend too
first post in the thread liking 14 year olds isnt pedophile they are not grown ups but they definitely arent children  also there isnt nothing wrong with it op it just depends on how you make it work 3 year difference is nothing
  14 is legal in italy because highschool junior/senior relationships are a thing
got wasted last night with some friends i only see every so often long story short i ended up getting to second base with one of my female friends we would probably have fucked too but i was too drunk for it i dont think its ruined our friendship or anything cos we all acted normal the next day other than some joking but im still feeling shitty over it ended up in the situation cos we stayed over somewhere and had to share a bed she broke up with her boyfriend a couple of months ago but still sees him and while im not his friend and havent seen him in at least 6 months weve chatted a fair few times in the past and got on pretty well even though me and her are both single the idea of getting with someone i knows ex doesnt sit well with me feels like a scummy thing to do am i overthinking this or am i right in feeling bad always feel paranoid and sad when hungover so need a reality check
oh it was my cousin also if that makes any difference
  not op obviously
bump
  am i overthinking this  yes it seems like neither you or your friend were in a relationship and it seems like shes also fine with things so no harm no foul i remember making out with one of my friends when we were drinking and both of us thought it was weird in the morning we just agreed it was strange and laughed it off
wait what why come you did this with your cousin very gross
how long will it take for me to be able to be with someone else physically just got broken up with by the man i thought was the one we still talk and i think it was just cause hes so depressed and i overreacted a bit when we were arguing about something trivial     im just hurting myself more cause i keep fighting to be with him i want to move on but the idea of being with anyone else literally makes me vomit tried just sleeping with him but the lack of kissing and him refusing to tell me whether he still loves me or not really fucked me up worse i cant do it too painful
last time i dated a girl was 10 years ago i havent really given a shit about dating since then no interest in actively seeking a relationship and i never met any interesting women during that time im at a point where ive regained my interest but dating is so fucking different from how it was 10 years ago what advice do you have for someone who may as well have woke up from a 10 year coma when it comes to dating
january 2017  leave my boyfriend of four years after an old friend of mine weve known each other since elementary confess feelings for each other   september 2017  sign up for college a bit late aged 24  develop feelings for an older guy in my class in his 30s  try to ignore them out of a sense of loyalty to my boyfriend   ultimately break up with him march of this year because my feelings for my classmate are so strong  we reach the present  i have fallen in love with  for the first time  a girl a female coworker   the feelings are mutual   planning to spend a week with my boyfriend this christmas at which point ill tell him the news    the past two years have really made me feel like a bad person i have never cheated in a relationship just to be clear on this but i have been called many more bad names during 2017 and 2018 than i ever expected i would not just from my exes but their friends and families as well    i am an emotionally stable person i have no mental issues to speak of am i a bad person or is what i have done okay because ive been honest and avoided infidelity
  sounds like youre struggling with the settling period of relationships and getting hooked on the high of meeting new people its tough to stick out a long term relationship what youre doing here is not exactly okay because youre ultimately hurting people based on momentary feelings just because you have them doesnt mean you need to act on them    youre mistaking love for attraction even if the emotion is in part based on personality you need to focus on your studies if you cant function without wanting to leave for the next big catch
  this is bait right youre a horror story guys tell each other about women
  you might have been called exaggerations but you are certainly a flighty person which isnt an admirable quality no     the opposite of you is the person who can keep their emotions in check they are what people call steadfast your brain is more like one jenga block shoving other jenga blocks out of the way
roasties gonna roast
  is what i have done okay because ive been honest and avoided infidelity  i commend you for this but the broader pattern is one of instability and difficulty committing to someone longterm while i hesitate to call you a bad person in light of this one point of restraint i would certainly describe you as an unreliable partner
  its been a weird couple of years i never thought i would do anything like this either    im only going for an associates degree so ill graduate this may                ah yeah it feels like im almost not in control here whenever i fall in love with a new person i lose my feelings for my current partner and cant imagine being with them anymore
  i hope i never wind up with anyone like you
  thats pretty cold i cant blame you though
  im not saying it to be hateful to you its legitimately one of my biggest fears imagine falling in love with someone being with them for years and them leaving you because they found somebody else the thought of that happening to me makes me want to throw up
  im in a minority hon dont worry too much none of my former girl friends would ever do anything like what i did a lot of my friends stopped being friends with me after the first time i jumped tracks at the beginning of last year and after doing that two more times none of my old friends are with me at all literally not a single person was on my side or made excuses for me
  i guess that makes me feel a little better there is a lot of misinformation about women here and its nice to have some of it cleared up this gets parroted a lot on here but i hope you see a therapist im not sure if you have anything that could qualify as an issue they could fix but i dont think it would hurt to try
  dont ever get into another relationship again you are whore dont kid yourself or anyone else and pretend youre not you might actually like being a prostitute you should try it so you can get paid for being a dumb useless cunt
  this
  do you have a throwaway email anon have some advice for you but it requires me to confide some personal stuff
  jmb175459gmailcom
  beta male
  its true she just sent me a scat porn gif
    stories like that are the reason i have trust issues  thank you op
  im sorry  for what its worth ive developed a bad enough reputation i live in a small town that i doubt i can pull any more stunts like this
  based anon
    youre not a bad person just fickle as fuck you enjoy the feeling for falling in love so much that youre incapable of long term commitment you grow bored in a relationship and start to miss that excitement of early romance acknowledge this and dont even bother trying to develop a relationship stick to casual affairs and make sure your partners know that theres no future with you if everyone is in the same page from the beginning theres no harm in it
you sound a lot like my ex gf she did the same to me  best tip i can give you is to be clear to everyone involved let them know how you are and what your past is dont ignore people or try to dodge them coverse theyre adults they should be able to handle it
  i dont see the problem youre literally doing what people tell cheaters they should do which is if you develop feelings for/want to fuck someone else do the right thing and break up first    youre not doing anything wrong by being true to how you feel would it have been better to stay with someone when you dont really love them anymore for what
  i am an emotionally stable person  maybe but you are not honest with yourself about your emotionally capricious nature and that capriciousness is dragging other people in     you should be single for awhile and date and fuck around
  youre a walking piece of shit
did your first boyfriend confess first or did you like him for a while and what about the third guy and the girl i think you like the chase and what you cant have and then get excited once you have it but then it dies because it is lust and not love    just date around but dont commit to someone so fast someone else said you like the high st the beginning which means you arent ready or havent met someone you really click with
  i have been the one to confess and begin the relationship in all four cases
  sounds like you need to be single for a while take the time for yourself first you have a lot to think about and to find out about yourself that you wont find when youre in a relationship  shell wait for you and youll wait for her if its really meant to be
  i have been the one to confess and begin the relationship in all four cases    oh noop you really hurt my soul    get approached by nice and quirky girl  have a lot of fun and she is very loyal  breaks up with me out of nowhere and tells me she doesnt love me anymore
  you sound like an ex of mine and other peoples in this thread it seems she would break up with me for a day like once every two months later found out she was cheating she didnt think she was because we technically werent together its not just about the etiquette of dating but giving the fuck about the people you have in front of you    i dont mean to offend but rather put things into perspective    you sound sexually frustrated and unstable in relationships its not wrong knowing you dont want long relationships but try to be upfront about it with your partners if you dont know what you want in relationships think about figuring that out before hurting people who might invest in you    i have projected way too much already but i think my points stand figure your stuff out the rest should fall in place    protip  if you have any noteable hurtful experiences in your past you should check with a psychologist for personality disorders
im in a relationship with a girl and i expected that i might have to potentially deal with overprotective parents or siblings what i did not expect was for her friend to be the overprotective force in my way this dude has already threatened to kill me if i do anything to hurt her but i dont want to hurt her ever how do i get him to back off and just trust me
you earn trust  you make it seem like you wanna pump and dump  no wonder the dude is on your case
  just dont give him a reason to become unduly angry and also start carrying personal protectionany threat to life or limb should be taken seriously
find out i have borderline/bpd  feel like because of this i might as well be deliberately antisocial  go out of my way to ignore others and act rude if i have to  it really just makes me hate myself more but at least i dont pester everyone else    what do  do ya feel similarily
  feel  so you intuit that you should behave this way not based on any comprehensible logic    all bpd means is you have an emotionally unstable personality what this means if that you should probably protect yourself from unecessary triggers and make an active effort to behave with civility and kindness you know unless you prefer being mentally disordered
  bpd is a social death sentence
i have also just been recently diagnosed with bpd i basically do very reckless stuff because i feel worthless when i feel abandoned by someone i love i also start really intense relationships with people and end up ignoring them at times because i go into seclusion which is what im doing right now by going to a scummy dive bar and drinking myself into oblivion ive also been doing more crazy stuff than usual like trying to find harder drugs when im drunk like cocaine or having unprotected sex with pretty much anyone that shows interest i basically throw myself into a chaotic state and the people around me are noticing also when ive had arguments with people that i love very dearly i go into panic mode and punish myself by burning cigarettes on my arm or just generally getting so fucked up that i wake up the next day feeling like a bag of bones in a way
i find myself stewing in my mental illness
about 5 years ago i worked at burger king where i met this older chick  about 10years older than i am her and i were good friends there and still continue to talk even though she moved ive always found her attractive and have always wanted to tell her that do you anons think
im sick of this worldand im sick of my life i just want it all to end so i can finally stop being miserable what is the most effective cheapest and discrete suicide method     inb4 old age  i dont want to live that long
  whats got you down anon
  im never going to be loved i am never going to succeed in any career field i have nothing to live for nothing there is no point to me continuing to live im going to die anyways so i might as well die young rather than live out a miserable life
  are you even trying whats the last thing no matter how minor that you did all the way to completion in what state is your room
  i cleaned my kitchen today im pretty proud of that i dont have a room
  im not sure why you care about what way is the cheapest or most discrete since youre not gonna be around anyway for the aftermath its not like you can spend that extra money after you are dead
  because i dont have a lot of money and i need to hide this from my siblings who i live with
  he wants advice and all he gets is people shitposting    charcoal bathroom
b
    youre worthy of being loved shit can be hard sometimes but remember to love yourself first you posted an eva pic in your op sometimes i like to watch this when i get down    
  honestly i prefer the eoe ending
  oh so youre considerate
  thanks
hello guys and girls about 3 months ago my girlfriend broke up with me and i went thorugh really tough shit for 2 times i had been working out previous to the break up so time has passed and now i look the enst i ever did and feeing like a million bucks there is one thing i really want to fuck a close friend of hers who is in her squad btw we all graduated fromt he same highs school and im 19 so you get an idea i texted her friend the chick i want to fuck and she brought up meeting but told me she needs to tell my ex about us meeting because it might be weird what do you think  i am over my ex but her friend just makes me bite my hand like leonardo dicaprio in wold of the wolfstreet donypu think this is possible  the friend is a bit of a slut and i know she fucked 2 dudes at the same night at the graduation trip should i try my chance or is it too trash and rejection is certain help me
be me having in college  have weekly toke and fuck session with my fuckbuddy  shes on the pill so we decide to go raw  shit was cash  after ten or twenty minutes of fucking she decides to switch from missionary to reverse cowgirl  lean backward as she leans away from me  suddenly experience a sharp pain on dick  pull out and see alot of blood   frenulum is torn a bit profuse bleeding from that area  we both freak out and i leave with some cotton balls on my dick  make a fifteen minute walk back to my dorm room  clean blood off dick and apply antibacterial cream  this was three days ago at this exact moment in time tell it to me straight anons will i be able to keep my foreskin and have sex again
shit was cash     commit suicide
  ok
cats lick their wounds for whatever reason and everybody likes cats so i think the best thing to do would be to lick it
  you know if that heals wrong youre fucked right go to a doctor you retard
hahah you tore youre banjo string
i had phimosis up until i was 17 years old at 15 i saw a doctor he wanted me to get circumcised but instead i spent a good two years stretching it everyday until i could fully expose the head then an additional five years just to make my penis stand up straight i still get some irritation but girls like the fact they can see a reflection of themselves on my penis its like a baby penis    in other words youll be fine if you really get issues go to your doctor and get some cream    blood not worried about stds
  well im not sure how it would heal right theres like a small flap of skin on the tip of my penis but the foreskin is still secure    im sure we are both clean i tested after fucking her weeks ago clean as a whistle
how do you cut yourself down there what the fuck did she have a razor in her pussy
  the shaft skin gets pulled too hard and it snaps the banjo string
  lurk more
so theres this girl i chat with in class every now and then turns out we have a lot of common interests more than anyone ive met at uni so far     i want to ask her out before the semester is over if shes not interested in me thats cool but i also dont want to miss out on a potentially good friend     should i start things more friendly like ask her to coffee/hang out instead of date then try to build a friendship and see where things go or is it better just to be upfront and ask her out    im also debating if its even feasible to be friends if i have some feelings for her
  ask her out none of that trying to be friends just to get closer to her type shit if she says no then move on
  but i wouldnt be friends to just get closer to her   i genuinely want to hang out with her more even as completely platonic friends dont get me wrong a relationship would be cool but if shes not interested i plan to set my feelings aside entirely    it is just that with an acquaintance you cant ask them out get rejected then ask to be friends
  but if shes not interested i plan to set my feelings aside entirely  lmao i sincerely doubt that will happen but cross that bridge when you get to it my dude   also ask her out for coffee shell get that youre interested in her and coffee is a good lowpressure first date
  yeah i guess a coffee date is a good middle ground thanks for the assist
yesterday i tried to have sex with a girl and she wouldnt expand her vagina so my penis could fit  she said she wasnt nervous but after foreplay i could fit just one finger trying to fit two hurt her  what can i do next time i try it so that this doesnt happen should i do something or is the burden on her
  ask her faggot
talk to her google vaginismus find out if she has it take things slowly spend way more time on foreplay make sure shes comfortable
  ask what      i googled vaginismus and i believe its related to psychological reasons  i am afraid shes nervous because she knows me for only 3 weeks and she may be uncomfortable yet
  i believe its related to psychological reasons  good  i am afraid shes nervous because she knows me for only 3 weeks and she may be uncomfortable yet  then work on making her comfortable and give her time
  good  good as in good luck nigga
  wouldnt expand her vagina  thats not a thing unless the girl dose kegels all the time and has really abnormal vaginal control its not something she has control over
  she sounds nervous   try a lot of foreplay eating out etc if you cant get 2/3 fingers in then she aint ready for the dick if you make a habit of getting her really wet first then shell always be down to fuck
  nah man good that he actually read the wikipedia article on it its a pretty common issue for new couples and not that hard to fix it just takes patience
  yeah i could notice how foreplay definitely improved the size  but i could only fit one finger which really annoyed me because i got the blue balls
silly question  would alcohol help to make the girl less nervous i dont mean gettung her drunk but having a few drinks
i know this sounds really fucking stupid but i really dont want to get older im 20 birthday is in april my life fucking sucks i was sheltered from danger as a child so i didnt really grow im very low iq and suck at academics failing college dont have a job dont know how to get one dont have a girlfriend and never had sex i cant really imagine myself having a girlfriend in general i dont want to see what my life will lead up to i dont i really fucking dont want to know where i will be in 10 20 or whatever years give me the confidence to kill my self please i dont want to know i dont want to know
  hahaha this is awesome
  fuck you
either go full jordan peterson and clean your room or just kys those are basically your options
  hey anon its you from 18 years from now one of our coworkers died recently from a heart attack because he was a diabetic obese were probably headed that way too in a few years if we dont change our shit right fucking now if only youd listened to me all those years ago we wouldnt be in this rut turn it around now anon please for us
  go full jordan peterson  what the fuck do you mean
  clean your room bucko
fuck this board i need help just like the rest of you so what the fuck
  bro its a slow board and you posted in the middle of the day on a monday most of the people you would want to hear advice from are at work just chill out for a bit and wait
  your right this really is a slow moving board my bad then
  also do you really want advice on how to end yourself it seems like youve got at least 1020 years to turn your shit around before any hope of building a family of your own fully evaporates that is a lot of time to sort your shit out even /diy/ could tackle it in that time frame
  the only person on /diy/ who doesnt have his shit together is dinotendies
  id appreciate anything you could give me
whoops look like you posted on the wrong board the pathetic blogposting attentionwhore board is 
  fuck you man
read litcore books and meditate 15 minutes each night
bump
die of a heart attack and hope an eccentric japanese man resurrects you as one of the living dead
  10 20 years from now you could be laughing at how stupid and overlydramatic you were being as a silly 20 year old kid just move on and deal with shit one thing at a time    also dont listen to these jordan peterson faggots youre just gonna end up becoming one of these guys who runs like a epic feminist gets btfo using logic and reason youtube channel
im not sure what advice to expect but fuck it    a friend of mine is probably depressed hes given up trying to hide it now im at his house right now and were just sitting in the dark listening to depressing ass music i have no idea how to help him out of this out right now or in the future but he was acting like himself earlier should i hang out with him more show him that theres things to enjoy about existing i have a feeling that he might just want to go home and sit in the dark while were out
  take him on walks even if its overcast where you are bring him healthy food and encourage him to drink water those three things are usually the reason why people begin down the road to depression    its important to note that depressed people lack the ability to know what they need to do for themselves if he cant ask him self for the right things he wont be able to ask you either this is where you just show up and do things of course you can ask and respect his answers but do not expect him to be capable of asking for what he needs
  thats helpful as fuck thank you anon
is it a reasonable preference that your first kiss with a gf be without anyone else around

  no kissing is a fucking spectator sport you should put that on payperview

how would it be possible to get a guaranteed 300usd within 6 hours prefferably online but offline is ok as well without any prior inventory or skills learning skills or gaining inventory is fine too
  you better be willing to suck a few dicks if you have no experience in anything wanting 30000 bucks in 6 hours
  id do that but how do you find johns who would be willing to pay money in the age of cheap internet hookups are relatively clean so you dont walk into work the next day with herpes on your face and can be trusted to be discrete since you want to run for office one day
  borrow it  either to friends or a business
  pretty sure people who run for office dont suck dicks for money
  no they do it as part of their initiation into a secret society but that would still be a sucky no pun intended thing to have come back to haunt you
          this isnt op
  this isnt leddit who cares who asks which question you op you probably suck dicks for free
  you could look up jobs on sites like freelancer or airtasker try your luck there    competitive but you may get lucky
girls what do you think of my outfit
/soc/ is that way   or /b/ if youre trolling

how weird is it to message someone i broke up with years ago is it normal to to at least apoligize   is there a particular way to do it  i just feel like id look like a retard if i did
what do you want to say if you just want to apologize for how it ended or how you behaved while ending it theres no better way than to just say it  sorry for messaging you out of the blue like that but i just wanted to say i regret how it ended specifically how i behaved when it did it was wrong of me and i feel bad about it  something along these lines  i just feel like id look like a retard if i did  why theres nothing wrong with it take your time to formulate your apology well dont make it a wall of text but just something well thought out that gets to the point no one has ever felt bad with an apology unless they feel its not genuine
dont do it
  thats pretty much what id say theres nothing unique to what happened but in general i dont really know how to interact on social media type settings without feeling like im doing something socially frowned upon moreso since im not really familiar with a lot of people who i would be interacting with online if i used social media things more often
i fucked up my veins so i cant give plasma/blood nothing to really sell to anyone i only want to ask someone to borrow as a last resort    please give suggestions

hi guys listen im like 90 sure my friends girl is fucking this other guy who she says shes just friends with i really want to tell him but at the same time im afraid im wrong and i dont want to ruin his trust in me so could someone message him  kestiepoo on instagram and tell him to watch his girl that she might be cheating on him
fucking hell this idea is much worse than just telling him youre suspicious delete this quick
dont tell him until youre certain ideally with proof you can show him
  bro you just fucked up know she is gonna know one of her boyfriends friends is posting about her on this website and they are going to oust you have fun with the repercussions dumbass
nut up and tell your bro or fuckin shut up and mind your own damn business
  this kioken x20
what category of crime does withholding someones belongings fall under theft    my ex wouldnt let me break up with him so he locked my things away in his room and refused to give them back unless i talk things out with him i didnt want to and i demanded my things back and he said no i broke into tears and told him thats abusive and he said no its not and that im a crybaby i eventually got my stuff back by giving into his demands but i feel traumatized by the incident
if you got the items back then it wasnt theft this wouldnt hold up in any court
  shutup whore your dumb choices put you in that position stop blaming others and start blaming yourself stupid bitch do you even know what a crime is
  malicious mischief though most cops will try to talk you out of prosecuting
  if you wouldve called the cops on him when he had your stuff hed be going away for up to a year for possession of stolen property not sure what can be done now fuck his best friend to get back at him i guess
      im not trying to take him to court or punish him i just want him to understand that this is a severely messed up thing to do to someone i just wanted to have a reference because he says theres nothing wrong with what he did
please be a troll thread why the hell are you in this relationship
  it says ex for a reason after i got out of the house i blocked him on everything and im filing a restraining order because this isnt the first time hes withheld my items and he also calls me 3050 times a day to interrogate me and has come to my house unannounced i didnt know he was this crazy because he seemed normal at first
how does one differentiate between just being weird and having a personality disorder  the more i read on it the more i wonder if these arent just like those personality horoscopes that are vague enough for anyone to selfinsert subconsciously but there are a few more specific traits mentioned that i relate to very strongly    ive had suspicions for a while with problems socialising getting work done and burning bridges irrationally especially this year  at the same time i know im a lazy person in general and most of this could just be explained as not putting in enough effort i dont want to make an excuse for what could simply boil down to being a lazy asshole
you see a mental health professional and get diagnosed
ive gotten in a habit of hanging out at the bar at my college alone i know this isnt ideal but what should i do
what do you see as not ideal about this
  shouldnt i be social and not drink alone
  if you feel like it im still working up the courage to do it but from what i understand when youre flying solo youre supposed to sit up at the bar    id rather just go with a coworker
  yeah im sitting up at the bar posting on 4channel it just seems strange because i ditched my class to come do this i already finished all the work
  just take a sip and stop fubbing someone might assume you need small talk
  how are you anon
how to stop caring what people think of you i know this site might not be the best place to ask because most people here are insecure niggers anyway but perhaps you have good advice on that
start seeing the bad things in other people put them in bad positions to you like oh man hes fucking ugly as fuck shes super stupid i bet hes not even washing himself properly and keep these things in mind when anything happens thats making u mad    when walking in public dont look at other people look straight through them and walk by ignore any human in your surrounding thats not necessary to interact with     stark clearing your skin before you go to bed make sure ur body language isnt telling weak bitch upfront and stand straight watch the way u put ur feet dont look insecure    dont talk too much dont give more information than necessary and most importantly dont overreact to anything
signed up as a test subject for a study involving sodium benzoate as a treatment for schizophrenia  also a porn addict  want to use clincard i get my payments on for chaturbate tokens  launder it to the online hooker cam whore through paypal  is this traceable will the doctors office see my transaction they handle loading money and i can see my transaction list online    good idea or bad idea
thaaaank youuuu bigguy4u9666 )))    u r fgt
  just transfer all of it to your personal bank account i have no idea how a clincard works but if they do banking then they are subject to banking regulations why would they give you what i assume is a prepaid payment card instead of a check or wire transfer are you in the third world like the us where the poor do not use banks
  i have to confess that i do not understand a single thing in your post
how do you guys feel about plastic surgery is it ok if its not overdone
  i personally think people should accept themselves as they are unless they have a straight up deformity theres always someone who will accept you and find you attractive
  they will all end up looking like igor and grichka in their old age
  of course but you should ask yourself who you want to attract if you look like you like weed  you gonna attract open minded chicks if you look and dress like a business person  you gonna attract chicks who are out on money if you look like a nerd  you gonna attract chicks who are into gaming if look like a metal goth one  you gonna attract goth chicks if you look like a sad boi  you gonna attract tumblr chicks     its all about looks of course but the way you look is giving you a ticket for each one category of people dress the way your interests are and you will find someone who fits you promise
  this is more about dress code than physical appearance
  that girls father is a billionaire obviously any plastic surgery she gets will be on point unless you have the millions to afford only the best surgeons you shouldnt do it even then one bad decision from you or the surgeon can fuck everything up
its only hiding the truth and the genetics that matter cant be fixed  too bad people are too stupid and lazy to breed the problem out
improving symmetry seems fine to me though
  breed the problem out  not everyone is totally superficial its not that theyre too stupid its that they dont all see a problem where you see one girl in ops pic with a different mind may have ended up loving her original face maybe if she hadnt grown up in hollywood it would be different
  if you look like a sad boi  you gonna attract tumblr chicks    wow fuck you for calling us out
    its called genetic engineering you illiterate plebs you wont have to breed anything out
  before a normal person  after thot 255446774445
  my nose kind of looks like hers in the before pic so i want to get a nose job but guys are always telling me i dont need it do you just not care as much about having a small tiny nose as we do
  i care about what your pussy looks like more then your nose as long as your nose doesnt get in your way when blowing me then its all good save your money
  i always hear people say guys dont care what your pussy looks like as long as they get to fuck it why cant you faggots be consistent with what you do and dont like
  also its more than not then
  id rather have a person that looks unique than another thot with a nose job they all look the same
  what makes a pussy attractive
i dont like it it doesnt make people more beautiful it just makes them more plain looking your appearance projects your personality genetics etc plus you get issues of certain features no longer suiting the rest of you and/or being very obviously modified etc  to each their own people can do what they like and i dont look down on them as a person for it but i definitely dont think id be compatible with anyone whod had plastic surgery it suggests a degree of selfconsciousness and discontent that i just dont vibe with
  is this one of those things where you dont want your girl looking generically attractive because you dont want other people looking at her and if shes unique you can trick her and yourself into thinking you love her more because you love how special she looks and only you would love such a unique looking girl like its a territorial thing
  no its literally because plastic surgery thots all look the fucking same and i dont even have tastes that align with those standards
  so you want a special looking girl so you wont ever have to worry about her leaving you for chad got it
  no i want a person that looks attractive to me according to my standards is that so hard to understand i dont give a shit about competition
  you sound like a virgin
  le virgin comeback  you should worry more about being a fucking brainlet than about your nose
  my point is not everyone the same standards
  more about  than about    your grammar is still shit see me after class
    perfectly okay with it had a nosejob done 2 years ago and never regretted it its such an awesome feeling to have gotten rid of the only physical flaw that ever bothered me and now i got modeltier looks    fat reductions are a waste though imo thats what /fit/ness is for
  i can tell you what makes it not attractive to me i dont like the wings the large flaps ill put my dick in it but im not licking a wingy pussy
  its okay no one wants your ugly dick near their pussy or in their mouth either
    forgot to add do it for yourself not because x said x would look good on you or better or whatever
  im not a native english speaker you stupid thot how many languages do you speak
  lol ok kid you couldnt be more wrong im sorry if i hurt your feelings with the truth life can be cruel dont hate the player baby hate the game
  filthy esls everywhere these days
  stay salty idiot
  dicks are ugly though you rarely find a pretty dick i dont know why you think you can judge pussies when most girls dont think your dick is anything a thing of beauty that they actually enjoy in their mouth only pussy because they dont have to look at it dont ever confuse women doing something because its expected of them with them actually enjoying themselves only gay men love big ugly dicks
  blah blah i can see youre a woman look here is reality for you im a guy so there for i do get to judge pussy and i can promise you i have been told many many many times i have a attractive dick im not a narcissist or some fuckin chad  but i have had a lot of pussy and i can tell you a ugly pussy is a ugly pussy if you have a ugly pussy then im not licking it sorry if your little mind cant take that get over it your pussy aint special k
  t ugly dick narcissist who wishes he were chad    therefore    im not a narcissist    lol    or some fuckin chad    now this i believe
  i have been told many many many times i have a attractive dick    he thinks they were being sincere
  lol pick apart what i said into little segments that out of context losses its meaning typically done when no good response can be made nice try kid
  loses    lol  kid    cringe    why are dicklets like this
  lol cant take that a guy tells the truth and knows for fact that its true what he is told image a world where people have to believe it cant be true to deal with their pathetic lifes aww so sad
  spell check yeah cause i may have spelled it wrong makes the meaning go away kids today are real idiots
itt seething landwhale argues with angry manlet  now kiss
  imagine    a world where dicklets arent allowed to use the internet to hook up with another poor thot who has to pretend to like his ugly dick because of societal pressure and the 1000 iq retard actually believes it she probably laughs behind your back with all her stacey friends at your ugly dick and you
  thinks he knows what girls like and think better than other girls  he doesnt know that girls constantly talk about how ugly they think dicks are  doesnt know girls lie to guys they like and pretend to find them attractive     fucking pathetic
  ill gladly put the looks of my dick against yours and let b/ decide 
  implying    is this the part where we pretend women exist on the internet so the beta dicklet can pretend hes interacting with a vagina for once
  projecting a lot i can see what happened to you and why your like this poor little man had his feelings hurt
  consider the possibility that youre a lesbian anon i say this with love   either that or you need to find a guy youre actually into sucking dick is fucking amazing if you actually like who its attached to my boyfriends dick is legit wonky in more ways than one ways hes been very selfconscious about in the past but i love every inch of it  dont harshly judge dick in retaliation to some anon harshly judging pussy
  this your girl is never going to tell you she thinks your dick and balls are nasty because she doesnt want to hurt your feelings dicks are gross end of story
  t gay thot        is it too early for your na gay dick threads
  thinks that the guy doesnt know women and how women always think they are smarter then men irl girl you would beg me to fuck you and i probably wouldnt cause youre a angry little bitch when she doesnt get what she wants did daddy touch you  be honest
  no dicks are attractive    they are all ugly    period
  are you fucking dumb you only like his dick because you are in love with him your nasty ass would probably suck on his toes and get off too you wouldnt think its beautiful or aesthetically pleasing if you werent
  then you are a dike end of story
  thats not how you greentext brainlet dicklet probably a manlet too judging by your napoleon complex
  doesnt know how to green text    even more pathetic
  you only like his dick because you are in love with him  yeah thats exactly what i said
  just admit youre too fat to get any so youre pretending you hate dicks  its okay just lose weight and maybe read a few books so you become more intelligent
  t gay thot    i dont know why you lot even larp you sound like a dyke every time anyway       so that makes two brainlets in this thread so far
  lol telling me what do to on 4chin wow get off your computer you spend way to much time here fo real
  if you dont think dicks are attractive youre a dyke    lol if thats true all women are lesbians    we like the way they feel not the way they look you fucking mongoloid
  so that makes two brainlets in this thread so far  youre the brainlet for somehow not comprehending what i was spelling out
  youre lucky women dont have to be smart
  she is still going    when does na wake up
  i love my boyfriends dick too because its his dick and i love him but its still objectively ugly as are all other dicks
any woman in this thread that says that every dick ever is ugly then guess what  youre a muff diver you like da pussy so be a lesz and stfo and leave the guys alone cause all you are is a turd in the punchbowl
wait do people actually think women like the way dicks look what kind of virgin dimension did i just walk into
  we can tell its you dicklet by the string of illiteracy you spew every time you post embarrassing desu
  i wasnt arguing whether dicks were ugly i was arguing against the retarded concept that women collectively hte giving blowjobs and just pretend to because women are so feeble minded that theyll routinely rape themselves and say they love it because society
  that was never the argument please get your ugly dick bf to pay for proper schooling one of these days when you arent sucking his big ugly mandingo dick
  oh christ are you a feminist  that explains your seething anger
then by definition in this thread from every woman all ducks are ugly and they pretend to like them and suck them because they have to  and im the retard here  seems to me then that all women are liars interesting
  that was never the argument      most girls dont think your dick is anything a thing of beauty that they actually enjoy in their mouth only pussy because they dont have to look at it dont ever confuse women doing something because its expected of them with them actually enjoying themselves
  dont insult women you lesbians    is that tumblr i smell
  oh christ are you a feminist  fuck no feminists are the ones pushing this retarded notion that women are eternal victims and that men are horrible and unnecessary fuck that noise give me the goddamn d
  yeah you cant read and dont even have a basic level of comprehension thanks for pointing it out again
  i love the look of mine
  argue that women arent victims  incorrectly perceived as insulting a minority group  accused of being tumblr  i dont think you know what tumblr is
most girls dont think your dick is anything a thing of beauty that they actually enjoy in their mouth only pussy because they dont have to look at it dont ever confuse women doing something because its expected of them with them actually enjoying themselves  yep all women lie thanks to all the women in this thread confirming what all guys all ready know women are natural liars and will lie to get what they want thanks bitches
  women do plenty of things because of societal pressure though so do men this is just a fact of life     there are plenty of big ugly dicks out there for you to enjoy anon dont worry
  ok well i also love my boyfriend and love sucking his dick i was just arguing that dicks are ugly purely from an aesthetic standpoint
  then please explain the true meaning
  t tumblr
  pussies are pretty gross too desu but what can you do
  women do plenty of things because of societal pressure though  not sucking dick all day long maybe some dicks maybe some women but certainly not most women and certainly not all dicks
  its funnier at this point not to
women  smart  pick one  love when women freely admit they lie on purpose and think their pussies are good and should be on a pedestal to be admired
why is there so much rage itt
  no dicks are ugly but we like how they feel and usually love who theyre attached to so we pretend to find them attractive but we suck them because we want to whats so hard to understand
  then enjoy me continuing to think youre a retard who got caught then whatever floats your boat friend
  notallwomen    i dont know whats more annoying feminazis or antifeminazis who want to appear special and cooler than the feminazis by basically just being sexist because they dont have to deal with actual oppression
  anon is larping as an angry female incel and everyone took the bait
  nothing as long as you accept the fact that your man feels the same about your stretched out pussy all good baby
  i dont know whats more annoying feminazis or antifeminazis who want to appear special and cooler than the feminazis by basically just being sexist because they dont have to deal with actual oppression  i have no idea what this is specifically referring to
  youre going to think that anyway thotlet
  girls think dicks are ugly and dont enjoy sucking them unless they are in love with the guy and only do so because its expected of them otherwise  no u fucking dyke i love my boyfriend and his ugly dick stupid feminists making us look bad mang  also rape is fake and gay  but no one said anything about rape  dykeee  also i cant read
dicks are ugly  no pussies are ugly    the fuck is wrong with you people theyre neither theyre just utilitarian pheromones take care of the rest if all the genitals of your preferred sex are ugly pray tell what would a pretty one look like if you cant come up with one how can it be ugly if theyre all the same level of aesthetic
  my boyfriend took my virginity and his dick is below average so im not worried about being stretched out but thanks for your concern anon
  theres nothing wrong with being a lesbian anon
  never thought id see a pick me who already had a man but was still on her bullshit
  this not bringing able to except your healthy nature body is mental illness wanting to undergo painful surgery to change your appearance for nothing but vanity is sad and shows that a person has deep self worth issues counseling would be a better option
just curious  
  uh huh your pussy is stretched to his dick after repeated fucking the pussy stretches larger you uneducated about your own pussy bitch so therefore your pussy to him doesnt feel as good anymore so you have no idea i will bet that your man would fuck another women in a heartbeat accept that he probably already has so again your pussy isnt special no matter what you want to believe hurts eh  does it matter you lie anyway so does he
    t illiterate anitfemwhale
  does my mouth get stretched out from smiling too much will i be unable to drink a glass of water when im older if i go around smiling all the time
  oh boy here comes the raging femanon
  my god you are dumb as fuck yes like the african women that you can google that stretch their mouths  ya holy shit read a book
  youre arguing with people on 4chan about dick i dont think you smile much in your life
  t ugly dick lover    too much dick gave you brain damage how sad hating your fellow woman is probably a great pickup line for the incels wanting to lose their virginity
  having a man solves all your problems and means dick is suddenly attractive    dumbass bitch
  after repeated fucking the pussy stretches larger    not who youre replying to but im a doctor and this isnt how it works intercourse does not permanently stretch the vagina regardless of frequency the vagina is basically a muscular rubber band that stretches during sex and then returns to its original shape and size afterwards childbirth is the only thing that can permanently affect it
  yes like the african women that you can google that stretch their mouths   by smiling  retard yeah if you literally tear your girl a new hole and keep it stretched out itll probably stay stretched thats not the same as picking your nose every day or two
  doctor in the house  yeah and im a brain surgeon
  some dicks are pretty
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  you can stretch your mouth by smiling ya just like people have pursued lips from never smiling usually seen in mean old ladies that think dicks are ugly but suck them anyway i read an article about that yesterday
dick
  look it up yourself if you dont believe me i dont give a shit lol
  still cant read    someday itll happen your bfs dick will still be ugly as fuck to everyone but you though that will never change sweety 
  wait a minute are dicks made of lemons maybe thats why drinking lemon juice makes cum taste better
  show me your credentials and i will consider
  only pretty dicks with lemon juice cum are accepted in this thread    dicklets out
  your wrong having sex dose permanently changes a womens pussy not as much as child birth but it dose have an effecta girl who has had sex 3 times is tighter then a girl who had sex 300 times
  this guy knows
  thats not me but why would i care if other people like my bfs dick
  you shouldnt only brainlets like that anon do
  thanks for the support ol doc there thinks that pussy doesnt conform to the dick that fucks it every day
  i heard if a woman doesnt have sex for like 6 months her pussy gets tight again so its not about how many but how long maybe
when the dick isnt ugly for once  when he got that lemon juice cum flowin    amirite laid ease
  exactly a pussy will tighten up some with kegels but a pussy thats been fucked 500 times with a dick thats 7 by 6 is going to feel the same as a pussy that has taken a 5by 5 dick the same amount of times point is whatever dick is fucking that pussy in time it will feel wide and not as tight end of fucking story these sad bitches on here cant except that their pussy is not in any way special and they cant take that they are born and bred to believe their pussy should be on a pedestal and a special gift and guys dicks are all ugly but they will degrade themselves to suck it because they have to then will lie to the man and tell him his dick is the best why again do we trust anything a woman says when they freely admit to being liars and hate the way your dick looks funny aint it 
  maybe her pussys not getting wider but your dick is being squashed thinner
this fucking thread
  i thought about that but science would tell me that my erections are constant so my girth would be constant as well so therefore i stretch da pussy
seems the women have realized how full of shit they really are and cant defend what they said my work here is done i bid all a good day even you liying bitches
  innocent plastic surgery thread somehow becomes an argument over the objective aesthetic value of dicks  this board has more larping than /biz/ and more crying than /r9k/ its like a train accident in text form
  my only point was to get the women to admit they lie to their men about how they really feel about his dick they wanted to argue that its ok to do but want to believe that their pussy is so beautiful and special and should be given away to only the deserving women are full of bs and i love to make them realize it its a guilty pleasure because they really believe they are smarter then men that we dont know they are liying and we lie back to them in the same way
  seek help
im pretty open minded towards minor cosmetic surgery probably because im so unhappy with how i look myself but i cant be bothered spending that kind of cash on looks but i can understand people who have the money do it    on the other hand i got really shocked when i learned that 1520 of 1828 girls in my country had tit jobs performed on them like jesus i thought it was like 3
  lol if you are ugly just deal with it loser you are not allowed to be pretty  i hate your mindset people should be able to do whatever they want
how do i make a cv without any experience im gonna get booted out of my parents house and im still studying but i gotta pay rent somehow
  heres the redpill you dont make a decent cv for min wage jobs    they dont want people who are studying cause they know theyll get a proper job in a few years time they want people who will work there for as long as possible    basically try any shit but puprosefully undersell yourself eg do not mention youre at college if you have good school grades don mention it say youre deciding what to do at the moment i applied to about 30 places 2 interviews no job with a good cv made it look like i dropped out of hs got a job the second time its a complete joke
will i get enough money for rent with minumum wage tho
  in the uk yeah youre not going to get a decent job without a degree and studying at the same time
  google skillsbased cv
menu doesnt load when i hit escape in just cause 2 is there anything i can do to fix this i have a lenovo legion y720

is it a good idea to become a male nurse   not good with math not terrible but dont have any natural talent for it  tried programming was shit and i dont feel anything for it  being a mechanic/hvac/tradesman is out of the question because im bad with tools and stuff plus i have small dainty hands and wrists  tried accounting/finance/business and i was just totally uninterested    ive discovered that i really like to help people and that if other people are connected to what im doing i become extremely motivated nursing involves helping people all day err day so i just thought id try my hand at it as its what i like to do anyway that being said are male nurses discrimnated against in the workplace at all are they at a disadvantage when it comes to getting jobs compared to their fairer counterparts
this is actually a good career path healthcare is always in need and high paying
  nurses cant do math anyways so youll fit in
  male nurse  can you lift a 200lb floppy weight if yes the female nurses will love you
  true  robots can replace humans at quite a lot of things yet they aint replacing human empathy at least in the near future
  i lift and have been lifting for a great while so yes
  its not as great as you think youll have to deal with a lot of shitty people most will never even be nor feel grateful for what you do for them and sometimes youll have to deal with the most gross and horrifying kind of shit you can imagine from handling severe burns victims to cleaning a grumpy oldmans ass who just shat himself if you think youve got what it takes to go through all of that on an daily basis without receiving a single thank you or anything else other than disdain and resentment from 80 of the people youll deal with then by all means go with it
being a mechanic/hvac/tradesman is out of the question because im bad with tools and stuff plus i have small dainty hands and wrists    what kind of lame excuse is this you learn how to get good with tools and your physicality doesnt matter there is use for all body shapes its all about willing to learn and put the work in i dont get why you would give up on the idea so easily
  the male nurses that i know of either worked as bouncers  security and/or competed in mma either amateur or even pro everyone loves them too it of course helps that they are genuinely friendly guys      exactly
  not him but maybe because you have to have a real specific mindset to become a mechanic or a plumber or whatever else not everyone wants to do it even if the money can be good for most people its actually both boring and confusing
    we had 3 male nurses in the clinic i spent 6 weeks during an internship at and none were discriminated or whathaveyou    imo youll need to find out if the emotional aspects of the job wont get to you and wear you down fast thats what happened to me thought medicine would be a dream come true and today 2 patients histories still haunt me
  i forgot to add it might actually be easier to get a job compared with other careers since youll have to do practices/internships in real places and you you do a good job or leave a good impression there then chances are theyll call you back to offer you a job  lastly male nurses arent discriminated against or at least that i know som people outside the job might call you a ragging faggot and lol a male nurse he must be gay kind of shit but to my and my family experiences in hospitals male nurses are kinder and more hard working than female nurses and thus much more appreciated
  thats fine but all he said is that hes not good with tools and his hands are small and thats a ridiculous excuse to not give a career a serious consideration
can women nearing 30 wear cropped tops if you saw this would you find it pathetic even if she was in shape
  hmm i dont know is it attractive yes but i wouldnt want to date a woman who dresses like that regardless of age it just means shes trying to show off her body and be sexy in public which would be an indicator she might be promiscuous    i dont like when women wear shorts so short that their ass is falling out the bottom either
  yeah its totally fine
  fpbp
  makes me want to run my hands up there
  id see the person who made this as a beta incel or maybe trying to control heir gf    there some women who are like 45 and could still wear that
    lol these guys always find a way to blame their insecurities on anyone but themselves    wear whatever you want  own it  who cares what people think
ive seen 50 year old asian women who honestly look 25 wearing school girl outfits ive seen men wearing banana hammocks at the beach ive even seen a ton of 20yearold thots wearing those revealing tanktops with no bra on at university everyone could see their tits nipples were flying    ive come to the realization that the clothes you wear dont really matter except for select occasions just wear what you want
  trashy for any age and despite for any women over like 25 i have some cropped hoodies and i just wear an undershirt with them im in great shape but dont like looking like im trying to be a young slut im 28
dude youre so gay   mature women are better in every way they stay getting good at 30
  this people can do what they want similarly you are free to engage with them or not engage with them      fuck off pseudofreud people are allowed to like or dislike whatever they want for whatever reasons they want
    lol apparently not only you can be right what an overreaction whew 
  id say the overreaction here was someone calling another guy insecure because he said he wouldnt date women who dress a certain way
  sure fatty

what hope is there for a person so terrified of others this is bullshit
  why are you terrified of others
  i dont know i should have no reason to be but opening up getting out there i can do it but i cant immerse myself in this business of intimacy as well as i like i put a premium on what others think of me i think     i want to not care but its the first thing i do when i get out of bed i dont want to impose myself on others and i dont want them to expect anything from me i just wanna be left alone but not really im selfish but i wanna love if im not making any sense its only because im trying to fight this posturing im still keeping up

best tips for a beginner trying to learn piano
  just push them keys till they sound good
the difference between shit piano players and good piano players    shit player    plays the entire song from beginning to end over and over again  ends the practice session unsure if any progress has actually been made  stops practicing altogether after getting bored of song without mastering it    good player    plays just one measure with one hand slowly over and over again until its perfect  plays the measure at full speed until its perfect  adds the other hand  adds another measure plays both measures over and over again until they are perfect  makes consistent measurable progress gradually moving from the beginning of the song to the end knows that even if the practice session ends after only five minutes they are now one measure closer to being able to play the entire song perfectly
piano is for fags
  adult learner here get a teacher dont try to wing it or youll pick up all kinds of bad habits if you are serious try to get an acoustic instrument or ateast a digital with weighed keys lastly    is partly right without the autistic condescension focus on hard measures rather than playing everything in one go    happy playing
any recommended keyboards my dad threw out my old yamaha when i was away a few years back still pissed he fucking did the act didnt even sell it just threw it out it was still in good condition too
  label the keys on a cheaper piano or keyboard and try and memorize them by sound and placement on the board also trebel on the right bass on the left
  good players play hands together from the beginning im not sure you studied any piano pedagogy this method of practicing wont work without taking into account of difficulty of the piece and maintaining motivation over time definitely not required to play at tempo before moving on to the next section bar by bar is a strange recommendation and unnecessary     actual tip find a syllabus and stick to a schedule focus on technique through scales and arpeggios find an experienced teacher if possible or someone to see if you are going to injure yourself playing practice sight reading easy pieces and challenge yourself with slightly difficult repertoire  get an 88 key weighted keyboard digital
any tips for someone who is picking up the bad habit of playing by ear im trying to learn to sightread and all i do is memorize the song and play
  rcm instructor here    work on fingering this is so much more important than people think  do scales  focus on tempo get a metronome  fucking take it slow learn the intricacies of every single piece and every single note dont get ahead of yourself  learning theory can help  practice like a motherfucker  dont start off playing by ear too much because youre gonna develop bad habits and fuck up your technique  learn to sight read effectively
  what does sight read mean and what are scales sorry im a complete beginner
  sight reading basically involves playing new pieces by only looking at the notes without any previous practice dont worry too much about it at your level but definetly start practicing with easy pieces    scales are in very simple terms a set of practice chords usually involving you to run your hands up and down the piano it gets more complicated with arpeggios and triads but you dont need to worry about those yet it helps you to build a foundation when it comes to hand eye coordination fingering and general familiarity with the piano i would suggest doing them every practice session you can probably find some beginner scales/tutorials online     if you dont have basic theory knowledge down i would search up some piano tutorials on youtube or find a teacher once you get going and understand the basics piano can easily be learned on your own but its always better to get some kind of teacher to guide you through and tell you what youre doing right or wrong     similar to working out and lifting weights you need to get the technique down before you go for the really heavy stuff or youre gonna fuck yourself in the long term
get a piano teacher
  not that anon but the best piano student i know taught me to go measure by measure this semester for my piano piece its a good method
maybe not the best tutor for this since i learned informally/self taught    tabs    if you have an ear for it you can hear the exact timing of the key strokes and then duplicate it so long as you know which key to press you will know when to press it    learn sheet music i never did lol i never hear debate about it but in my opinion tabs are better sheet music is in a easy to read yet compact format  which is easier than humbling through a giant book the con is learning another thing now maybe i just had a bad band director idk     if youre just curious its best to buy like an 100 electric keyboard learn the input manual to get the sound you want then go with it i suppose if youre not interested later its not a big loss out of your pocket or giving the holidays you can gift it to someone     as for songs im not big on traditional stuff for teaching camptown races mary had a little lamb etc pick a song you like  it may be challenging but you will be engaged more and want to learn instead of it feeling like a grind    hope it helps dude
how do you full time workers stay sane i spend 8 hours at work  2 hours travel time when i get home i have only 3 hours to myself im in my 20s but i know this will decrease dramatically when i am older and get more involved with my partner     inb4 find a new job i am good at my job but yes i dont enjoy it all the hobbies i enjoy i am not good enough to make money from its just a depressing way to live
nnnneckity neck yourself before you wreck yourself
get a job working 12 hour shifts three days a week then you have four days off and you can stack those shifts differently and end up with a stretch of days off without using any vacation days i work as rn and get a 56 day stretch of time off every other week and havent had to use a vacation day in months if i did choose to use just two or three of my vacation days in a row and stack a few extra work days at the front end it could give me almost two weeks off straight
  same position here also in my 20s the only difference is that i only work 5 hours a day and also go to college for 5 hours a day so thats 10 what i do is    trim the bullshit  theres a lot of shit you do that you dont need to do in my case this was video games but also a little bit of anime i can keep it up by just watching 23 shows per season that i can get caught up on on the weekends  get minor social interactions dealt with in work  another time sink is retarded people texting you needing you to do shit ive found that it is okay to pick up your phone for 5 minutes at work every now and then to deal with these people so that it doesnt pile up for you at home  plan ahead  plan ahead know what you want to do when you get home and do it this should always be on your life schedules are the key to success and as long as you are not autistic this wont ruin the experience of doing what you love you are planning not to make your life predictable but to make your joy more time efficient
  is there any job that youd enjoy if you dont like computers or writing software not sure what to say senpai
  get a job thats closer turn that two hours into 30 minutes and youll see a surprisingly dramatic quality of life increase
  i think the 2 hours of travel time are huge op sure 2 hours is not anything out of the ordinary many employees do it but honestly the biggest waste of your valuable time is having to drive 2 fucking hours everyday to get to work and to get home again thats 2 hours every single day you could spend doing productive/fun stuff in your leisure time i know it because i also used to have a job which took roughly 2 hours of travel time per day    i think one of the most important aspects of a quality job is actually having a job thats fairly close to your home so my advice to you would be to stay on the lookout for jobs that are closer to your home trust me it makes a massive difference
in my 20s i did 10hours and 2 hours commute  i liked my job  i went home played games read some and then nutted in my gf before bed repeat  i enjoyed it
  complaining about going home every day you could spend 3 months out at sea every 3 months and then on top of it have a 24 hour shift once a week its all about your own perspective and attitude
  same here i work in a big company in the major town of the country kind of office job quite good at it it pays ok but i dont like beeing on a chair every day and check internet  i feel like a waste of time     i live at 60 miles away from my work so 1 hour and a half everymorning     i leave at 630 am and get home by 630 or 7pm     when i have the chance to get dinner ready by the fiancé i can smoke my joint at 0800 pm then we just lurk 2 or 3 hours till 23  2330 then go to sleep     annnnnnd repeat all that shit all days     i wanted to do a formation in car mechanic because i fucking love car  but ill have to do 2 or 3 years to fully know how goes a car and how to fix it  i can do the maintenance of a car  but i can do all the major things      i am good with weed plant so just planning to open a business here  or formation in car mechanic i dunno      good luck anon
is there such a thing as being afraid of happiness because it doesnt make any sense to me why would anyone be afraid of being happy  same goes with fear of success some say there are people afraid to succeed in their endeavors  how do these things work    picture unrelated to try and grab your attention
  asking those questions like you do in the very specific way that you do i can immediately tell that you are asking this rhetorically you have the answer     but sure ill play along tldr what goes up must come down and what is always down doesnt fall
  you are asking this rhetorically you have the answer  honestly speaking im not that is why i made this thread in the first place    what goes up must come down and what is always down doesnt fall  so youre saying that fear of failure causes these feelings
  fear of failure and fear of success are two sides of the same coin basically uncertainty the unknown whats behind that hill over there i have a cozy place right here i dontt need or want to know
feel like killing myself every sunday night/monday morning i cant get another job so i need to go in or my parents will throw me out  im stuck and depressed
ive been having anxiety for a while now everyday i turn the wifi off really late at night becouse i think its bad for me and other stuff sometimes my head hurts or feels heavy i arleady went to the docter and my blood test is all normal and the pee and poo test are fine i thought i had something really bad but its been three months soo i guess i have nothing serious
deficiencies in vit d b12 and iron could cause this    you can pretty easily get too much iron so unless you are a menstrating female skip the iron     dehydration can cause headaches     start by drinking more water get a good multi vitamin and then add in some d3 and b12 try that for a week and see if things improve
how do i steal my friends girlfriend no i dont care about morals or his feelings
doing something like this to prove to yourself that you dont care about morals or feelings is the primary indicator that everything you do is driven by emotion and feeling
  you probably dont     but assuming shes attracted to you and confides in you emotionally and is also having problems with him you may have a way in     impossible to help you with absolutely no details
no i dont care about morals or his feelings    then dont call him your friend
  you shouldnt any woman who would throw your friend away to get with you is worth less than the dirt on your shoes and will do the same to you ive been on both sides i stole my best friends girlfriend and she dumped me for another friend it almost destroyed our friendship and im glad it turned out the way it did because i value the years of friendship ive had with him infinitely more than the couple months with that trash    dont care about morals or his feelings  i severely doubt this if hes your friend and thats probably your dick talking otherwise stop being friends with him and move on
    bros before ho
im still living with my parents unemployed and in debt because of stupid choices made earlier on in my life went undiagnosed with bipolar depression anxiety and literal autism     i want to make something of myself and get off this shitberg and make it to land but i dont know where to start
  are you getting treatment for bipolar etc
yes sorry if i forgot to clarify its all being treated now a clinic in the city helps with therapy and that its why im able to ask what can i do to fix this rather than keep lamenting stupid decisions
without going into too much detail i freelance with a company that pays us per the job report filed if we file 75 reports in one month we get a bonus     what ive been doing lately and this is what i worry may be unethical is that if i finish 75 reports in one month thus earning the bonus i start to work on my next reports but not file them so ive completed reports but not filed them waiting for the first of the month i file around 5 on the 1st getting me much closer to that magic 75 it would be more honest to file the reports as soon as i complete them but less beneficial to me as i contractor do you think this is unethical or am i just taking fair advantage of their payment system
  it sounds unethical but at the same time it sounds fine if anything the extra productivitys a boost on your employers end too
is it really possible for a relationship to be 50/50    will there always be one person who is more into the other one
who the fuck do you think is gonna spring up with an objective answer on this    ops relationship with dick is 5050
  its just a question relax
  its more about whos dominant rather than attraction
ive run into an issue in my relationship that i see no solution to   were married since 4 years dating since 6   were both in our late 20s and we have a baby     how do you deal with issues that are unsolveable in a mature way   lets say theres topics that you have talked about in a calm and open way that are important for you/your family/ your relationship when talking about them your spouse seems to understand whats the issue why it is a problem and you both seek and agree to a solution yet time shows that those solutions dont stick and the same old issues return like a boomerang youve tried 101 different ways to adress the problem yet it persists it frustrates you but youre also not willing to chew the hole thing trough again coming up with yet another solution that wont really change anything in the long run getting your hopes up and so on basically adressing it repeatedly wouldnt improve anything yet it definitely impacts your mood that its back again   i feel stuck i cant say im annoyed because of xyz because that would inevitably lead to yet another talk about the issue   i cant say its nothing because its obvious that im frustrated and annoyed   i dont want to hide how i feel act all fake and put on a cheerfull mask   i dont want to lie and say that something else is ruining my mood   ive tried its xyz but i dont want to discuss it anymore which  unsurprisingly led us to doing exactly that     how do actual adults handle this
ive kept the issue general on purpose since its multiple things that have the same dynamic in our relationship and i dont want to discuss the specific issues in detail but rather find a way to deal with such problems in different situations     thanks adv
by fucking letting it go and then committing to the decision to let it go     the other person also has to understand/internalize this and make some of effort to improve    you have to recognize this and reward the behavior when it does happen positive reinforcement even if they still fuck up every now and then you point it out but dont beat them over the head with it if they get testy or react badly understand that they might just be in a bad mood/having a bad day  remind them that there was a consensus that the both of you reached and that you do in fact appreciate all the progress that theyve made    its give and take you need to try your best not to make it into something personal and recognize that they have made conscious efforts to modify their behavior because you have expressed that it affects you in a negative way at the same time you also have to accept in some way that they are who they are someone can bend or adjust to some extent if they want to but they cannot become a totally different person what seems totally reasonable and absolutely right to you might be outrageous for someone else barring universal stuff like murder is wrong    i mean its not really clear what youre talking about leaving dirty socks on the floor is not exactly on the same tier as molesting your daughter for example
  i imagine its dealt with by some combination of ignoring the problem bottling up anger redirecting anger lying frustration hopelessness this is part of the reason why marriages are hard and often fail the price you pay for the opportunity to raise a family and build a life together
  i agree with you 100 and in cases where its possible thats how i handle it     but lets take one example issue to clarify  im not ok with certaing things in our sex life its not huge things just small adjustments that would make sex a lot more enjoyable and in return make me want sex more for me i have explained praised showed used every method i could think of yet its still the same every time and whenever it happens again it makes me feel like he doesnt give a shit i told him that i love sleeping with him and that our sex life is very important to me and that id want to keep enjoying sex with him for many more years but for that to happen he needs to also be considerate of my needs im so tired of trying over and over its frustrating and frankly makes me not want to sleep with him anymore why should i want to have sex with him if i already know that it wont be enjoyable for me solely because he cant be bothered to atleast try   and i dont feel like i can just let it go im not ok with letting him use my body and i get nothing out of it i want sex to be good for both of us and i dont think thats asking for too much
try counseling
  how do i fix my extremely vague description
  weve considered that but ive asked my therapist if she thinks it would help and she said that they wont be able to tell us anything we dont already know so idk
  have you ever wondered about that air of bitterness and mild resentment which seems to follow most couples around this is it this is the real world
  that was on purpose as my second post states
  i havent given up the hope that theres a solution  yet   maybe im just not being realistic
as long as you are both not cheating and both put your baby first you are good women who will do these two things are very hard to find be grateful you have such a good wife
you learn to live with the fact that your partner and by extension all people will do some things that you dont like you can learn to cope however you want but you cant change people not really welcome to adulthood
  i feel like youre heavily overthinking the fact that your partner doesnt care enough to make you nut which is easy to do especially if its been long running issue  just get a good vibe to use while yall fuck  it will make things easier on both parties
so im a good looking guy id say in the top 20 i have goals i have passions i make decent money im considered lower middle class but desu i make enough to live on my own comfortably here in south oregon have a nice car etc    ive got a problem i dont hit on women unless im either drunk or very buzzed but i get hit on a decent amount at clubs when i go but these arent the kind of women im looking for and when they do hit on me like last week i got hit on by a pretty good looking milf i dont follow through i dont like to do one night stands possible stds only get sex one night and not multiple nights and my weird loyalty ive inherited from my parents    the advice i need is how do i overcome this how can i push myself through practice to spot the kind of woman that will be loyal good looking and bear my children kind of buzzing so try to be nice fellas
  lets say you are being 100 honest and have a perfect sence of self perspective    you need to find a girl that has her shit together and is out living her life  the girl thats solo camping because she loves waterfalls thats who you want to find and ask out   i get a really strong feeling that youre issue is overlooking whats right in front of you perhaps your standard of beauty is unrealistic or perhaps even just so high that youre passing up some amazing opportunities     avoid meeting women at places where people just go to meet people those are magnets for people you dont want to invest your time in    seek out opportunities to do things you love that involve other people    are you into kayaking join a club or take a few classes and become even better
  lets say you are being 100 honest and have a perfect sence of self perspective  to the best of my ability i am anon    you need to find a girl that has her shit together and is out living her life  not to be debbie downer but those are the girls that are taken at least it seems that way    the girl thats solo camping because she loves waterfalls thats who you want to find and ask out   i get a really strong feeling that youre issue is overlooking whats right in front of you perhaps your standard of beauty is unrealistic or perhaps even just so high that youre passing up some amazing opportunities   i dont believe so i have decent standards it just seems like that most women dont have their shit together theyre either single moms druggies taken or ugly not exaggerating kek    avoid meeting women at places where people just go to meet people those are magnets for people you dont want to invest your time in  i know this and i appreciate you telling me it i think maybe i go to clubs because i know women will open up more and actually approach me instead of giving too subtle signs like in general public im going to stop going to clubs though thank you    seek out opportunities to do things you love that involve other people  many of the things i do are not popular at all in this area but ill do what i can to spread out have a couple of ideas but nothing has come to fruition yet    are you into kayaking join a club or take a few classes and become even better  im not but thank you for the ideas i really do appreciate it
  how can i push myself through practice to spot the kind of woman that will be loyal good looking and bear my children  this is tough for everyone its hard to judge a persons character if youve only known them for a short period of time    you need to get to know these women on a deeper level try meeting women through activities such as volunteering clubs church or class youre more likely to have things in common with the women there
  this is tough for everyone its hard to judge a persons character if youve only known them for a short period of time  aye and i hate wasting my time probably going to have to with how it looks like so far    you need to get to know these women on a deeper level try meeting women through activities such as volunteering clubs church or class youre more likely to have things in common with the women there  church was something i was really thinking about im not religious but i understand the necessity of religion in society maybe in the morning ill go this time
  youre not wrong but this is easier said than done    the girl thats solo camping because she loves waterfalls thats who you want to find and ask out   how do i find her and say we run into each other both solo camping in the woods i do this well its not really appropriate to socialize besides a hello even asking where they are going might be off putting    are you into kayaking join a club or take a few classes and become even better  whats hard is these places are filled with dudes i did a hiking group for people in their 20s and 30s and it was all guys and they were all tools the only girls were this one older lady who didnt even fit the age range but came anyway and the trip leader whos husband was the weirdest one there  im glad i did it to socialize but i would have had more fun by myself
how do we deal with flirty girls in the workplace without being acccused for sexual harassment
uncompromising adherence to the mike pence rule
  if you seriously believe you are walking on glass when talking to women you pass way too much time on 4chan and are on your way to become a creepy psycho
  roastie pls
  im probably the flirtiest person in my workplace lol the secret is to not take anything in life seriously
  yeah all those wall street brokers and financiers are spending tons of time on 4chan and thats why they think theyre walking on eggshells
  then its because you are naturally stupid
  this men who think they got flagged for no reason are just completely dense to how fucking disgusting theyre being 9 times of 10 if a woman escalates her complaints of your behavior to hr is because you are so over the top creepy shes seriously staring to get scared     most women put up with an insane amount of harassment before reporting it if you got reported chances are you are completely oblivious to how fucked up youre acting and need to stay off /r9k/ the way they talk about women isnt remotely normal anon
  the problem with metoo isnt that people want to sexual harass women its that accusations  guilt because of it  bitter women exist and people arent putting up with the liability  cry about how men are evil all you want it doesnt change that bitter women will lie to fuck men over and men arent going to put up with it  just because youre a male feminist rapist doesnt mean all men are stop projecting and strawmanning people that disagree with you
        actual concrete go from 2 to 10 causes other than revenge are false memories or mental illness some of those false rape allegations were submitted by men    stop being an emotional snowflake and look at the facts or dont pretend other people to take a tantrum throwing babby seriously
  that doesnt count social media accusations and other forms of public accusations which are what im actually talking about you absolute retard  people lose their jobs because bitter women fuck them over and lie it happens no matter how much you deny it and call me names  btw you arent fooling anyone just like how john lennon preached peace and love because of the guilt he felt for beating his wife creeps gropers and rapists like you do the same with feminist shit
  and to add they ruin peoples names kavanaugh is still seen as a rapist  but he in the supreme court  and people call him a rapist because of bullshit accusations and tried to ruin every other aspect of his life because of it including coaching basketball
  you make it sound like it happens a lot and a woman can very easily get anyone fired with a false accusation
so do people think theyre gonna get fired for complimenting a womans haircut or something only if youre masturbating when you do it
  its always the exceptions these fucking assholes go for so lets look for those few cases where a woman raped a man or falsely accused a guy and forget that its a big fucking problem or lets blame the woman for being a slut to get ahead and not the system in place that makes that necessary to feel dirty after sleeping with some ugly manipulator like weinstein i have to admit the way many men have reacted to metoo says a lot it says that they have also raped or feel guilty about their sexual misconduct
  i have to admit the way many men have reacted to metoo says a lot it says that they have also raped or feel guilty about their sexual misconduct  imagine being this mentally ill
    that doesnt count social media accusations and other forms of public accusations which are what im actually talking about you     the survey found almost 19 per cent of women have been sexually harassed at work but yet just one in five reported the behaviour        it also revealed almost 22 per cent of women aged between 51 and 65 who had been harassed said they didnt make a complaint because they were worried about their job security    this is the reality but keep your head well deep in the sand    being a slut isnt a mental ilness and had nothing to do with the causes on wikipedia if you think they accused and forgot you are oversimplyfing a very dangerous problem    i can picture you pushing the keys with rage and its not very flattering  you are too far gone  bye
  nah but people like you vehemently state that false accusations never ever happen      ignored my post where i pointed out how thise statistics didnt disprove my point yeah of course rapists exist you emotional retard i never said otherwise  my only issue is that people like you are so hysterical about this shit that you blindly believe any women when it is possible they are lying   my issue is that people like you will forgoe due process because believewimmen  i would never say a woman deserved it you piece of shit you faggots cant argue without lying and putting words in my mouth  fix the rape kit problem if you want to deal with rape dont try and make it so men cant defend themselves against accusations
  ad hominems dont help your case even a little bit
  that doesnt disprove my point you retard  i never said women dont get raped or assaulted i said metoo is about making accusations  proof through the use of social media lynchmobs
  nobody ever said that why are you lying are all /r9k/ basement dwelling incels like you liars and stupid
  nobody says it here but thats what metoo is all about believewomen literally means you have to believe womens accusations im done arguing
  you literally accused men of sexual assault because they reacted negatively to metoo thats not a rational argument worth debating
  people like you are so hysterical about this shit  you dont know me and what i believe and you make continual assumptions about me you arent rational at all and are deflecting from the problem
  why get so worked up if it isnt true the problem is it is true
  incels are like women but even dumber and more hysterical you cannot reason with him he is immune to facts
  its actually always been like that the twatter movement just made it worse rape claims are enough to destroy an innocent mans life and thats happening a lot ever since too for denialists and hysterical feminists        what a way to argue your point i wonder whos stupid here      most women put up with an insane amount of harassment before reporting it  i got reported to hr by a chick because i called her a girl
  your point was never made i posted statistics and actual work dynamics you keep yelling bullshit but i dont see any proof   the screen shots you cherry pick on incelsme are worthless   you live in a reality you and another bunch of virgins are imaging    no one belives all women as rape allegations are sorted in court but emphatazing with someone who tells you has been raped its the first natural thing to do 90 of times you are speaking with someone who has been raped    if you seriously think women throw rape accusations at random through metoo the statistics would show it as accused men would go on and report it   theres nothing that point to men being target of bitter women as a social phenomenon    i only see you emotionally overreacting  the fact you wrote in caps after my observation about your rage was funny
  stop making shit up you have never had a job and you havent left the basement after high school
   i got reported to hr by a chick because i called her a girl    wow thats it you actually proved it all with your personal experience
  easy you keep your mouth shut they get flirty dont fall into the trap you be polite and then excuse yourself and get back to work
  i really think these guys have something to hide why else get completely furious about this
  this was meant for you  
    i have personal experience thats what i wanted to add to the conversation women go ballistic for various reasons girl being a ridiculous and banal one the most common ones are disgust jealousy and fear and desu none of these emotions have any place at work no matter what they are triggered by     these issues have only become a thing ever since women started being part of the working force before that sexual harassment was limited to other areas now we have it there too and have to restrict and censor ourselves just in order to not trigger some thin skinned women
  what an awful shitpost that is please literally neck yourself your life is worthless even as shitposter
  ad hominem    the argument wasnt about where men got so retarded it was about debunking op claim you are the only one deflecting    nice mix of cherry picking 1 case which already is in the 2 to 10 stats and personal experience
  where some men got retarded before you sperg
  the only one going ballistic here is you you are literally foaming at the mouth hysterical
  cherry picking this is one of many cases of false rape accusations one of the most famous ones are just the recent ones of kavanaugh    you are the only one deflecting  is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character motive or other attribute of the person making the argument or persons associated with the argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself  your statement  if you seriously believe you are walking on glass when talking to women you pass way too much time on 4chan and are on your way to become a creepy psycho    besides that you are still arguing based ad hominem please learn how to argue and dont come back before you manage that
      i even posted it before if you intend to shitpost at least try harder
talking to a woman at work about work like     hows the report going   lets go for a team lunch  good work karen    okay     talking to them differently than you would any male employees like youre at a bar or live action tinder    not okay    how dumb can people be to not understand this if you dont harass people theres no problem you work in an office with cctv witnesses communicate through email it is hard to even get falsely accused in that environment
  dont you see your cognitive dissonance you keep bringing up kavanaugh yet he got confirmed and the accusations ended up inconclusive yet according to you kavanaugh should have been convicted because you said false rape charges always work
  your point about brookers is still blantly false but you seem unable to understand this isnt the point so  no one outside of 4chan and incels forums really think that about women  fact is if you end up believing that about women you probably spend way too much time on 4chan     many cases of false rape accusations one of the most famous ones are just the recent ones of kavanaugh    still in the 2 to 10  when these number will sky rocket and be proven to be sky rocketing because of bitter women youll have a chance to say something concrate  but the fact you cherrypicked and used a personal experience makes clear you are unable to argue so even if facts and logics were by your side you would probably end up looking silly anyway    
  this     its really simple but many guys cant deal with it because they like it the way it used to be where they were free to tell dirty jokes that made women uncomfortable and grab or pat their asses
  yet according to you kavanaugh should have been convicted because you said false rape charges always work  ive never said that and you continue to argue based on fallacies     you cant damage control this anymore kiddo stop posting you already look like a fool dont make it worse
    you cant damage control this anymore kiddo stop posting you already look like a fool dont make it worse    you responding like this to an argument makes me wonder why would even anyone ever take you seriously
  incels like him are like elliot dumb entitled angry and completely delusional
  i havent said anything about brookers    no one outside of 4chan and incels forums really think that about women  thats what you tell yourself to justify that all these concepts are just made up by a bunch of misguided sad fellows kek    fact is if you end up believing that about women you probably spend way too much time on 4chan   fact based on what you assume and claim a lot without providing credible data    still in the 2 to 10  where do you get these numbers from and 2 people dont make 2 you cant even do simple math lmao    when these number will sky rocket and be proven to be sky rocketing because of bitter women youll have a chance to say something concrate  you pull these numbers out of your ass anything you have said so far is utterly wrong based on fallacies and just claims without you even trying to distance your opinion from it you are just blatant liar    but the fact you cherrypicked and used a personal experience makes clear you are unable to argue so even if facts and logics were by your side you would probably end up looking silly anyway  logical fallacies again its like you cant stop arguing like a 12 year old just because your feminist friends are gullible to your pseudo intellectual shit doesnt mean it works on all faggots on 4chan    learn how to argue and have a conversation like a grown up nobody will listen to your crap if you continue to insist on fallacious arguments
  lol no prob anon he was trolling        where do you get these numbers from and 2 people dont make 2 you cant even do simple math lmao    you said it right my friend lmao lmao
  i mean the bloomberg article captured by ops image is quite literally about wall street executives  its creating a sense of walking on eggshells said david bahnsen a former managing director at morgan stanley whos now an independent adviser overseeing more than 15 billion  so its a bit strange for you to write it off as the rantings of mere 4chan incels creepy psychos or the naturally stupid
    so its a bit strange for you to write it off as the rantings of mere 4chan incels creepy psychos or the naturally stupid    thats true but we are on 4chan and those ideas do spread here right since op browse 4chan keeping browsing would  at falling even deeper into the rabbit hole   thats the prospective i was writing from but i do realize my answer describing them as naturally stupid was unncessary and childish tho
  since op browse 4chan keeping browsing would  at falling even deeper into the rabbit hole   causal fallacy reading mein kampf or das kapital doesnt make you either a nazi or a commi
  true but this situation is different i dont think its too much of an hazard to think op is falling into it given what he wrote and the pic he uploaded right
  dont flirt back or be all that receptive when they talk to you
  also since flirting in the workplace is frown upon and qualifies as sexual harassment you can theoretically report them for it    theoretically since people dont take femaleonmale or maleonmale misconduct seriously  t grew up with horrifically abusive mom and sisters and not even the police take my claims seriously
  the essence of the female thought is mental illness    their brains are just wired differently because estrogen
  and incels are like women but worse
  theres might be a tendency due to various factors one of them being this site which pushes a certain idea/agenda sure but you cant say with absolute certainty that hes falling into your rabbit hole or whatever just that it might have influence on him    and nevertheless ops question is legit as any other question and wanting to avoid complicated and harmful scenarios is perfectly fine
  report them for harassment
should i tell her how i feel i know it wont matter cause im moving states in a few months so whatever     i just need to stop thinking about her 24/7 holidays are coming and i know shell be on my mind the whole time given how much free time ill have    am i being a fag /adv/
  if your feelings are strong for her do it because you might regret later
  lol yes  been there thot friendzoned me  i kept misreading her friendzone for interest and she had to tell me off 2 or 3 times over a 2 year period   good times
  this  although i got friendzoned and stuff in the end i got real closure cause i tried
      thanks bros if i see her tomorrow ill try to tell her     ill keep you updated
  no problem anon good luck
ive been dating this girl for over a year and its been great but ive been feeling more and more that i dont really love her when im with her sometimes feel nice and warm inside but other times im just counting down the minutes until she leaves its like i feel like running away and i really cant pin down why
    do you think about her when youre busy is the idea of her being out of your life something that upsets you
  honestly i dont know i feel like i be lost without her but at the same time i cant imagine staying with her forever
  ask yourself why is it that you love her less and less different life goals she stops putting in the effort to get along with you
i met this girl online she seemed pretty cool and she seemed like a solid 8/10 from her pictures we have similar interests but im kind of worried that ive been catfished she seems to agree with everything i say and spams me whenever i leave there are also major inconsistencies in what she says she told me that she had a cat that she loved i told her that i dont really like cats they have sharp claws im terrified of one of them mauling me in my sleep then almost immediately after i said that she said that she hated cats as well even though she has a cat also she never wants to facetime or anything she gives excuses like i have to do something today or its my aunts birthday today whenever she does facetime she never shows her face and just points the phone at the wall     what should i do is this person some 54year old dude in his basement or something
yeah bro youre getting catfished
make her take a picture with a time stamp op rule 101 on the internet anon you cant be that dumb
post one of the pictures ill tell you if its real or fake
reverse image search
just ask for a random pic that people wouldnt normal post for her to send a pic of her touching her ear
  wait if you do indeed use facetime to talk to her arent you able to hear her voice i mean thats a pretty good giveaway
  this  for some reasons catfishes love mentioning how they love animals i guess people are more likely to think you are a kind person if you love animals
  even then you cant be sure catfishers pay models to do that shit
 here are some things to help guide you    1 if you have images try reverse image searching them on google or another website    2 simply ask to go into a voice call for them    3 you can ask to go on cam or facetime or something        here are some things to note     do not push people online if they dont want to do something dont force them but if she begins to try to avoid it too much you may wanna call things off or similar     voice changers dont work they have a certain sound to them that make them sound fake so yeah     sometimes users flip images or crop them to bypass reverse image search if so you may wanna require a webcam time together     she should be able to talk while on cam     hope this helps anon be careful out there
guys what do i do if one of my friends has been increasingly flirting with me for the past couple of weeks but she has a bf    we talk and hang out all the damn time at work and its always so nice but i dont know what to make of the past few weeks
is there any girl problems questions curiosities or tips i can help any of you guys with im bored  drunk i just want to help someone lets gossip lol
theres literally a thread where guys go to ask girls questions what makes you so special that you need your own thread
  omg rly i dont use 4chan at all so i have dont have a clue where this thread is link me babe thanks so much  sorry bout tht x
  how to obtain sex
is there any girl problems questions curiosities or tips i can help any of you guys with    i happen to be an asexual gender neutral aegyptosaurus from the mesozoic era how can you not just acknowledge that we are also included in the bunch of randoms you just adressed as guys i thought girls were supposed to be smart and sensitive
  the more unattainable you are the more we want you idk why us girls are like this but it sucks once u show u need us or signs of clinginess the game is over 
  this post is for anyone who considers themself a guy sry for not being specific     loll ur funny tho x
  i can go so much into detail about this you practically got to do the opposite of what you would normally do when you like someone       for a quick smash pick away at her self esteem its psychology she will begin to feel unworthy of you not good enough she will want to prove herself that she infact can have you to claim her self esteem back no promisises she will stay around after though
  this is retarded advice and onlyl dumb hoes are like this
  only works on insecure dumb whores
  looks like ur not the onlyl dumb hoe then     loll jk but y u mad girls are going to get so mad about this  deny it but its the truth most girls dont even know they are doing it but it happens to all of us
  nah have you heard of ppl want what they cant have it works trust me
  there is a girl that works at a grocery store in town that i find very attractive the girl not the store  is there any way to start a conversation with her that wont come off as super creepy like the rest of this board i either have high functioning autism or crippling social anxiety so anything i come up with just seems like it would be forced and unpleasant for both parties
  aw this is so cute   i would go through her line if shes a cashier its kind of their job to be nice to customers  make small talk so i dont think that would be creepy in any way  she would be the one starting the convo thats perfect for someone with anxiety or autism     now keeping the conversation flowing is the hard part with both of those mental illnesses hmm
  also f this doesnt work for you you could take the pussy route like i would her receipt will have her name on it or look at her name tag search her name on facebook and the town name to narrow it down you guys might have a mutual friend depending how small the town is  bam you got a excuse to message her about the friend you two have in common
  no youre just a dumb hoe     lllloser
why do you think that because you have a vagina that you can speak for your entire gender i sure as shit cant speak for every male as the personality type variation among males is gigantic the same can be said for women as well the ask the opposite gender threads and threads like these serve no purpose other than to delude impressionable people into thinking in general instead of treating their relationships with other people as they should be unique
  if you think it doesnt imply to you then youre bitter why     beecause youre one of those girls that sit  cry over their douche bag boyfriend that treats you like shit bc youre to stupid to understand what keeps you around     bet im talking to 1 of those girls that get online spamming all guys r the sameeeee     its the truth behind the whole why do girls only date assholes stigma
  im speaking on behalf of my own perspective as a female if that makes sense its rly not that deep im just bored  like giving advice to others i never said im speaking for every female tho so idk where you pulled that from im giving my advice tips and tricks from a girls perspective of what works kjghkgdjkgn
  a girl i like had an emotional affair with me  i told the boyfriend that we kissed once drunk which isnt the whole story but still bad of me to tell him  how do i smooth things over with her
  a girls perspective of what works you know because im a girl lol maybe i shouldnt have included gender thought it would be helpful to men that need help with girl problems that i could maybe help with but ur triggered  ooooooooo no u soft ass bch
theres a girl that ive been planning to have sex with but i dont know how to be smooth and lead her on with words last time i tried with another girl i was too direct any advice
  big yikes    shes in the wrong here dont feel otherwise telling her boyfriend you probably didnt think over too well though i dont see it benefiting you in anyway by telling him this because it is obvious it wouldve caused tension between you and the girl if shes not talking to you i dont think she wants to be with you or things with you two wouldnt need smothing out rn because it was simply wrong of her i could see how telling the boyfriend seemed like it had benefits at the time you probably hoped she would end up with you if what her and her boyfriend had was ruined i think they will end up fixing it  he will make it entirely impossible for her to talk to you so its pointless to smooth things over its not your fault though
  nice projection there cupcake
  shes stupid af thats why/
  you missed the entire point of what anon stated ya bimbo
    thanks ive only ever spoken a couple of sentences to her about her job and her tattoo and dont know how to segway that into anything else the facebook thing sounds super creepy to me and i dont use any social media aside from snapchat anyways do people really message strangers out of the blue like that
  youre thinking to much have you kissed yet   i havent fucked tons of guys or anything but a kiss has always led the way i dont think its so much about the talking   i dont feel like ive ever been led into sex with words theres not any magical words that lead to sex
    where did i say im speaking for the entire gender thoughsometimes a guy might just want to ask a girl what she thinks ofc its not going to be based on what every other girl thinks  i never stated that you guys are reaching  twisting just because i didnt put a disclaimer for you sensitive babies
  i was very drunk and felt pity for him i apologized because i didnt want a bad mood in the bar he already knew we had been flirting he said its alright after all nothing happened any my drunk self went yeah about that    thing is i still see her regularly and need to interact with her before that whole thing we left off at her picking him over me and in the same breath telling me shes not sure about this decision but its better than no decision then we were cool  i need to maintain at least neutral preferably positive relations with her because shes helping me with a subject im really struggling with
  the more unattainable you are the more we want you    we    stupid bitch
  all you can do is be nice towards her she shouldnt act as if its your fault what happened babe its not your rly ur responsibility to fix things with her she put you in that situation  i am sorry youre going through this just be nice to her if that doesnt work shes just bitter  not worth it if shes help in you in a subject i would think things didnt end up to bad xx
  youre sensitive     yes i personally believe this is how girls work stop being sensitive as fkk loll
  lol sis its fine idk why ppl are getting mad desu you never said you were speaking for all of us and nothing is stopping other girls from speaking up or giving their two cents if they disagree w/ something u say sooo
  itt dude pretending to be a girl trying to troll poor horny teenagers
  you spent youre time scrolling through this thread nit picking for that so you better feel achieved u dirty little whore lmao whos rly the dumb bch its all luv tho
  gud 1 i do sound like it tho ngl lol
  yeah youre probably right i texted her and basically we kept apologizing back and forward between me not keeping my mouth shut and her dragging me into her emotional uncertainties  gonna talk to her in person for the first time since then today

  u stupid autistic cow loll    i stated my opinion therefore used my fucking belief whats so hard to understand ur so offended
autistic cow has left the chat
  look cunt you used we and you a ditzy bitch dont speak for all females kys tranny
this is like a bot gone rogue
  youre so dumb      i used we in a way to explain my theory if a fucking pastor uses we to explain his religious beliefs on how he believes god created man or if a scientist explains his theory about our existence  uses the word we to explain his theory on how we came about are you going to go pulling your whole dont speak for the female genderrr shenanigans lol ur funny
my gf of 4 years broke up with me two weeks ago because she wanted to explore without having to cheat on me and wanted to be honest with me    she told me about a couple days ago that shes had sex with other guys but theyre not the same as me she likes my personality better and she even told me that even though she was the one that wanted and initiated the sex that its just sex and she doesnt think she can find someone quite like me    my ex gf probably thinks she can talk to these men and get me whenever she wants because we love each other a lot and while i do love her im really on the fence about taking her back if it comes to it its just the act of forsaking our relationship just for sex and how it came so easily i can honestly say that it really scarred our relationship and i dont see her the same way anymore    even though i told her i still would and i still love her she just seems like a ho to me now even though i have to think of her like that i just dont know if i should take her back cause trust me anons i really love this girl and she loves me she just wants to explore for now and trust me i feel really stupid for even thinking of taking her back    so as a woman do you think itd be acceptable if i decided to take her back she didnt leave me for anyone specific just sex with other people but what do you think
some people do not believe love is anything more then a chemical response in the brain that happens after having sex with someone they think its the pheromones and other things related to the senses and memories that create the right doses that make people do or say crazy things such as doing something unselfish this is due to the goats atheists the jews love to employ you see if people dont believe what they are experiencing is love then they are less likely to do crazy things and keep the status quo of their slavery in check do you know why it is important if you are planning a long term relationship with someone to wait awhile before fucking them ive given many excuses relating to compatibility but the fact is that most people will hurry up and get the fucking over with out of being scared and insecure scared over the teasing their friends will do if you didnt fuck her within 5 minutes scared that someone else will do it if you dont the girls definitely give every reason for this to be a concern with their slutty bullshit too they will call a man a fag if they do not immediately stick their dick in them when they get horny because we gave in to their every whim as if they were smarter then us or somehow special how many men have heard a woman call someone else a fag because she likes him and expects a different thing from her then just sticking it in when she gets horny hes not being a fag your being a coward and a slut be more clear with him or fuck off and stop destroying things like chivalry seriously you want to repair your own cars go ahead until then shut up about being mistreated if your going to insist it only happens to women you have encouraged everyone to be dogs youve taught men that no actually means yes and that if they cant fuck you right away they have future with you then you all find reasons to whine when things arent going right all of you need to pay others for sex and stay out of relationships
ive seen real slut bags hang around a man and play coy and hard to get just to call them a fag when they get confused and walk away when all the girl wanted was a good fucking what is worse they convince themselves and the man they want more so drama spirals out of control women like these should not bother with anything that is not a male prostitute you are running this country and this world go bother the black men because i disown you and all you want is dick and those muh dicks are more then ready to give it to you
they seriously have the goddamn balls to whine and complain about everything from here to the sun but when it comes to getting that one thing they want when all they have to say is something like  i want you to their face they lose all respect from real people how dare you pretend like you have any heart or bravery when you go around destroying other peoples bullshit because you were unable to step up and say what you wanted in the first place go fuck yourselves
let us not forget all the whore bags that will hang onto a man for his dick but keep looking for upgrades that have money and better jobs they will flirt with and get into the heads of a poor person making them develop ugh feelings for them too just to go and fuck someone else that has jew money for a woman to pretend as if she were somehow better then a man is more then i can handle sometimes you are ruiners of masculinity your pursuit of money like the gold diggers you complain others to be as if having money makes someone masculine the bitches do not know what they want and the jews castrated us so now everyone is fucking each other and getting themselves into trouble and the fucking kikes are laughing their way to the fucking bank while it happens
in other words  think of jfk the jews have taken away everything that ever mattered to the people who matter the most this war is about 2 things loyalty and royalty there fucking is none without dead kikes anymore there is no such thing as a family as long as the kikes exist they did everything to destroy the families of the world why the fuck do they think they deserve to have any themselves my money my bank account is the torture an death of anything israeli
this advice comes from that famous jewish saying do the smart thing right not the moral thing the legalish thing and if youve got a good lawyer well anything is legal so anything can be smart heh /shrug
women such as that actually probably since they rely on other mens money and their vagina to get it wont be loyal to anyone who marries them they have shown their true colors their motivation in life is dick and money if they want to fix the female empowerment they broke they need to become whores and be honest with themselves time for them to earn that money i mean its not as if anyone is going to be sure that the baby is theirs anyways who the fuck wants to spend all that money on a kid that isnt theirs that what fucking losers do also they arent allowed to breed anything not their color anymore too much meting in this american pot of ours dont need more problem child halfbreeds too bad they only wanted the 2 things and not the third power time for those lazy slutty bitches who depend on everyone elses money for rides and housing and getting high to actually earn it their bodies are typical nothing special their pussy works just like anyone elses theyre prettiness hardly matters since they are ugly as any demon ive ever seen inside plus those drugs will have them looking whoa soon enough im saving all you fellows from pretzel knot thoughts in your heads and your hearts from spending any energy on females not worth it the only thing they have proven themselves good for is fucking those babies could end up just as worthless as them so probably not worth any investment if your a beta with a lot of money this is definitely the time for you you spend all that time trying to look good and get money because your pheremons dont do the same thing for them they wont ever truly be happy with you so you may as well get as many as you can for yourselves to be happy
if women actually wanted men to be more about them they would spend more time trying to make sure of it instead what they do is invest in better clothes and makeup and stories that make them feel more attractive so they can have more or better options they no longer get to complain when a man wants more then 1 wife they flutter around unsure of themselves or what they want doing everything they can to distract us with their sex and their complaints how the fuck are men not suppose to flirt or hit on you when you do everything to make yourselves sexy a boss already has so much bullshit on his plate because of the jews and their laws now he has to watch his thoughts and words because you stupid whores cant stop trying to validate yourselves using men to do it then you call us dogs and pigs as an excuse to hate us and keep doing it you want to solve work related issues concerning harassment well how about you just separate the men and the women then you cant stop the sluts from doing it and trying to get promotions from it and you cant stop the men when they get so horny they have to do it so why bother if they truly gave a shit they wouldnt keep doing it /shrug whats more is the jew made sure to hire only the best looking for tv broadcasts so we all expect our women to look perfect make sure you give special thanks to all those ladies that used sex with men as their empowerment goal
when the blood gets going how they look ends up mattering the least in the end the amount of time spent fucking a partner or significant other is miniscule its what they are able to do for you and make you feel when you are not fucking that matters the most if your man is unhappy because he has to deal with these kinds of whores in his office the best thing you can do to help with the stress and make the home more positive is the little things like his favorite meal hell thank you for it believe me
when you think of all that time and energy they spend when they can just get a dildo with a warm towel wrapped around it or something you question just how smart or mature they actually are next time you hear a woman tell you that they are smarter then men just remember that shit
i dont mean to sound like an incel but why do attractive people almost never date people who are just as attractive as they are i always see a girl who like an 8/10 date a guy whose a 5 or a 6 and vice versa  is it a selfesteem issue
because looks arent everything
because many attractive people can get with other attractive people but then eventually realize that many are miserable and shallow so then they settle for someone tolerable over someone attractive    looks are guaranteed to fade but someone youre compatible with on a deeper level is gonna last much longer
it could be a number of reasons man physical attraction is very subjective too
  holy shit would shove my black cock in her mouth / 10
  why do rich people sometimes wear shitty shoes because they get to pick and thats what they pick the reason you think having a hot chick is everything is because you were never meant to have one
not op but theres this really hot girl who only dates weird nerdy dudes im a 758/10 and i dont have much trouble getting girls so one day i just asked for her number  turns out she already had a boyfriend weird nerdy dude but she was willing to cheat on him at the drop of a hat  what the fuck is her problem she has bpd and shit btw
  what the fuck is her problem she has bpd    lol there you go
  carrie anne moss is hot as fuck
more like an smv thing a man will always try to date a woman 23 points higher in the looks scale he will be happier overall and have more intense orgasms when he fucks her and good looking women are usually sweeter to people    women prefer men 23 points lower in the looks department for ltrs for a bit less initial mate competition over his resources but during ovulation she might want her equal or better    good looking masculine guys tend to make terrible boyfriends and providers which isnt what women are interested in outside the ovulation window
  do people with bpd just do shit like this i dont really understand the condition very well
  people with bpd are walking devils     the only way to beat them is to be even shittier to them before they fuck you up
  bpd women have zero self esteem or sense of self so they will fuck almost anybody and do anything just to feel alive    i lost my virginity to an 8/10 that was boyfriendless and batshit insane with bpd even had the crazy eyes    trust me when i say this    a beautiful woman who is also single or friendless will be a complete raging psycho
  i dont that chick counts if shes willing to cheat on weird boy with a an allegedly better looking guy
        please dont talk about things as if you know anything about them then sperg out shit as facts when theyre just speculation    bpd doesnt make you a shitty person being a shitty person that happens to have bpd makes you a shitty person    my girlfriend has bpd shes never cheated on me
  either way he got his dick licked hypergamy comes with the territory of women anyway
  please dont talk about things as if you know anything about them then sperg out shit as facts when theyre just speculation  dude its time to leave denial    bpd doesnt make you a shitty person  yes it does they all inevitably commit suicide after fully awakening to how vile their existence is     my girlfriend has bpd shes never cheated on me  i dont think shes ever cheated on me
  my girlfriend has bpd shes never cheated on me    bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
  because attractive people have options and will date the lesser attractive person because they have traits they enjoy more than their physical traits less attractive people dont have that freedom
  good looking women are usually sweeter to people  youre talking out of your ass
because in hollywood jew land the jew producer makes the 8/10 hottie marry his hook nose ugly jew son if they want to keep being a star in movieschristine aguallara is a perfect examplelook at what she had a baby with
  /thread    also dont forget that women evolved to be pretty while men evolved to be the best
  it creates balance attractive people are generally high maintenance     two attractive people end up neglecting each other    however sometimes its a power insecurity thing if you date an ugly the chance of them fetting hit on is low so them cheating is low    attractive people get hit in all the fuckin time its depressing to watch your so turn down guy after guy in front if you  i dated this girl that looked like shikira for a while she was also very wealthy dumped her after a few weeks because her beauty sucked the fun out of everyday life
  beautiful rated women typically have greater agreeableness and conscientiousness for others
  everyone finds different shit attractive i might pick a 7/10 redhead instead of a 10/10 brunette because redheads make my dick diamonds    or a really hot girl could have a terrible sense of style she might look great the one time you see her but otherwise i have to deal with her dressing like a 1940s librarian start layering in shit like compatibility and personality and youve got your answer
  they are crazy and that never gets better and never responds to treatment they cant help it whatsoever and you must remember you can not fix other people     they can be good people but that doesnt matter because they are toxic run
  citation needed
  everyone finds different shit attractive i might pick a 7/10 redhead instead of a 10/10 brunette because redheads make my dick diamonds    if that was true then conditioning and beauty standards wouldnt exist what men found attractive 20 years ago isnt what men find attractive today right
  styles change but im going to call complete and total bullshit on attractiveness being 100 a social construct does it make your penis work does it make your ladybits tingle then you like it    and being honest styles are hella cyclical so yeah 20 years ago 1998 which i was alive and horny during plenty of shit was popular and attractive i liked chokers then i like chokers now i didnt like high waisted shorts in the 80s/90s i dont like them now
  because theres very low chances of 2 extremely attractive people getting into a relationship and low chances of either of them committing to a relationship its usually always a friends with benefits thing
  im a pretty attractive dude and i typically date girls most guys would describe as a 5 or 6 its not even that i see them like that i am really attracted to the no makeup average girl next door type i just find it super modest and humble and those girls tend to give a lot more because they arent concerned so much with their looks it also does honestly feel good knowing youre the hotter one in the relationship you really dont get that self esteem boost dating someone as or more attractive than you also in addition to being more wholesome and giving less attractive people are more likely to see you as a catch and wont leave you for someone else as easily
  who knows maybe youre the guy hes cucking
  attractive women go for guys with money attractive guys settle for average women
  attractive people have more power in a relationship  they like to stand out in social settings and they get a mood boost from hearing he doesnt deserve you haha
probably because you cant apply your subjective opinion on someones physical attractiveness and assign them some arbitrary point value   ive seen no shortage of decent looking guys dragging around an absolutely nasty slampig  the man is likely as attractive as the woman
it might depend where you live here i always see guys who i think are much more attractive than myself with fat chicks the balance is very much in the womans favor here but at a previous college i went to the student body was 60 women and even i could get very attractive women
  1998  yep   not hot anymore
  is it a selfesteem issue  sort of   relationships are based on leverage its what people mean when they say its a give and take    usually someone is getting bested in the looks department but maybe they have money
  a hot girl will date a less attractive guy because hes safe and wont cheat her on the other hand will with a hotter guy    /thread
  if that was true then conditioning and beauty standards wouldnt exist  only dumb johns fall for this  a real man has independent tastes
  youre missing the bigger picture   she may go after a guy thats less attractive than her but he has to have something else of value     a hot woman isnt going to date a guy below her league unless he has something to give     and thats when it comes back around to control/leverage
  to maintain a subtle level of dominance in the relationship
  ah my first fap     really though besides fuzzy cable porn
  oh you poor dumb bastard
  its because theyre inundated with a ton of options everyone wants to show off and get with them after a while the purely pretty people get samey and they realize that personality matters more    i remember watching an interview with some famous female celebrity i forget who it was but the interviewer had the audacity to ask with all your money all your fame and being as attractive as you are why did you marry someone so well lets be honest someone so ugly  to which her only reply was he makes me laugh
  have you considered its because youre attracted to girls and not guys    speaking as a faggot i always wondered why all these good looking guys went for uggo girls until a friend pointed out that the girls look hot to them
faggot fires gay desires
      dated a hot puertorican girl 7/10 who had adhd i was beta as fuck reason why she dated me
  could also be that most dudes think its gay to put on moisturizer
how do i come to terms with not being the best and not being able to have everything i know its extremely narcissistic but this is a huge problem for me i just feel cucked in comparison to absolutely everyone
i dont know anon ive failed at everything in life and theres not a single thing ive achieved from my perspective you should be happy with whatever successes youre gathered so far there are people who have none and will never amount to anything
  were not all going to be rock stars or celebrities your worth as a person is not defined by anothers no matter what someone elses life appears to be may seem they have it all but happiness is fickle even people that have it all still feel the same way you do it can be a good thing or bad some have used those feelings to create great shit others have been drove to madness you understand 
i have been out of work for the past 8 months being a neet and traveling and having fun but now i need to get a job and my own place i have no money or skills besides some manufacturing experience and customer service stuff and it seems like there are no viable jobs for me anywhere i dont know what to do since i live in a place thats super expensive so it feels like getting a job here is a waste of time since i cant afford a place all i have is a car that could become a liability at any moment how do i get out of this hole
bros is it sad nigga hours yet  when i was young i was an autistic lil shit who couldnt socialize but as i grew up i struck gold with one friend who got me out of my shell soon my circle of friends was growing and all was well nothing would split us you know how it goes    but after graduation the only friend who really stuck around was the one one i made in senior year all my other dudes slowly stopped talking over the summer i even made a group chat for a certain section of dudes but lately its just been me posting stuff in hopes theyd at least go online    what the fuck do i do
im 23 and only retained two friends from high school its just what happens youll get new friends
  i appreciate your blunt honesty sometimes the dude who stuck around and i will shitpost in what was once a busy group chat but is now a dm with an audience and theyll go online and not say anything this makes just makes me feel like my high school experience with them was empty    theres one dude who opted out of group chats i cant afford to lose this guy hes the only one to have been with me since elementary i should talk to him more to hopefully maintain the friendship
i have no friends from high school and im very glad of that i cant wait to leave the town too i think you might be overrating your old relationships because youre lonely
  why are you glad you dont have friends from high school i mean im not saying its wrong just wondering
  i wouldnt recommend anyone move to where im from i consider it a densely populated social desert theres no culture poor education bad medical practices and so on    the first people i was ever with due to circumstance were my family i care for their wellbeing and i truly love many of them but a single volatile patriarch can destroy that to pieces    the next group of people i was with with due to circumstances are people from public school these friendships formed because we lived in the same area and were mandated by the state to go to youngadult daycare high school was very fun at times and i respect the people i went to school with but it wasnt the ideal situation i wouldnt mind hanging out with those people again but i wouldnt want to set foot in that place again or any public high school really people who willingly go to the average high school to work for decades must be a different breed than me because i just wouldnt be capable of that    the majority of people from high school who i looked up to went to college and left town those who i didnt look up to fucked up and are still here i stayed in touch with those who stuck around but they were honestly a fucking handful that my real adult friends wouldnt tolerate for two seconds
  thats pretty interesting i can almost relate to that last part     im from a literal desert in the middle of bumfuck nowhere and the only schools around in reasonable distance were tiny overpriced private christian schools so my options with friends were limited with only 20 people per class    now theyre all going in radically different paths one went to some fancy college and joined some activism group another went to washington skipped college started working retail and smoking weed and apparently lost a lot weight although i fear thats because he might not be eating well i was actually supposed to meet up with him near thanksgiving but family issues occurred    do you guys think its worth it to still consider them friends if they dont communicate
  if you feel really close to them its always worth saying happy birthday or merry christmas to let them know they arent forgetten dont do it via facebook facebook is a sad place

i started to develop multiple stretch marks over my body and im not entirely sure why i havent had any sudden weight growth/loss    they started to develop on my biceps/armpits hips thighs and recently ive got some nasty ones on my abdomen but i cant figure out why i used to weight lift so sure i put some of it down to that and my diets never been that good so maybe thats a contributing factor but to have as many as i do when im within a healthy bmi doesnt make much sense is there any other way i can be gaining them or is it just shitty genetics even though nobody else in my family has them using biooil on mine which doesnt seem to be doing much to make them less vicious 21 m    pic related but not me
  lack of nutrients i got em because i lacked omega 3 and 6 its that simple understand where your lacking bro
  this happened to my friend he ended up getting a sleeve tattoo to cover them up dont be like him
 i have some on my gut that look pretty bad its bad diet mostly
stretch marks normally occur because your skin cant compensate fast enough for added muscle/fat some people get them from puberty or steroid use     if youre worried then see a dermatologist
  just dont worry about it i think almost everyone has them im a girl and i have them on my hips and boobs and it wouldnt bother me at all if a guy had them
  that doesnt look good op
stretch marks basically happen when skin cant keep up its growth with muscles/fat/height its kind of weird for it to happen with your muscles which are good muscles but nothing gigantic but maybe youve been scrawny as shit i dont know  it could be a diet thing but either way id consult a dermatologist asap if i were you its not normal for an adult who hasnt gained weight quickly    sure so do i horizontal ones on my back but its out of place for a fully grown adult who hasnt gained weight theyre nothing dangerous in and of themselves but they are aesthetically displeasing and op could prevent new ones from emerging if he can identify the problem quickly
yes they can happen from added muscle but also from a thyroid problem or a connective tissue disorder where there are defects in the collagen ive known people with a ctd who were slim and didnt grow yet got them because of that
  dont do juice
talk to your physician might be serious of might notonly doctor knows for sure
my boyfriend is a fucking slob ive avoided dealing with this because we live separately so its only my problem once a week but its a huge disappointment every time i visit and a moldy bottle of old eggnog on the counter is still in the same spot as last week still untouched its a huge disappointment when i try to help him with his dishes and there are squirming maggots in his sink ive tried talking to him about it so many times and he says he needs to do better but hes not making progress weve been dating for two years im also slowly realizing i want to live with a romantic partner someday even if he were willing to move into my place i would be miserable because i would have to clean up after him all the time     should i give up on him every time i think about dumping him i get really sad hes a great caring supportive dude
intervention time
  if its a big issue for you now then its going to be a deal breaker with you when you live together maggots in the sink is just straight disgusting and i thought that was shit i only hear about in a third world country   sometimes people need to hit rock bottom before they change directions for the better keep that in mind when you try to deal with his problem
  my boyfriend is a slob too maybe worse than yours hes like a hoarder or something pizza boxes and beer cans piled up to the ceiling a thick layer of garbage on the floor old food left out to rot random cigarette butts and roaches all over the place i love him though and ive come to terms with the fact that if we ever get married i will definitely be cleaning up after him all the time    just know he wont change i want you to imagine that hes going to be like this forever and that despite his best efforts to change and do better he never will not for long at least would you be ok with that could you overlook it and still be happy living with someone like that be honest with yourself if yes stay with him if not leave him
  ive broken up with a girl because she has no feasible life skills     looking for a partner not someone to babysit    sit him down and set him straight take pictures to show him or videos evidence of any sort show him whats wrong and offer to help him fix it if he refuses or doesnt show an interest move on
  this op    sit his ass down and grill him tell him you love him but you cant take it and he needs to change    if he doesnt change after a serious face convo then fucking bounce
  yeah he already admitted there was a problem after the maggots in the sink incident where i almost dumped him     but now that theres been a subsequent eggnog on the counter incident im probably going to lose hope     followup question how am i going to deal with the next couple years of life given that i also have no friends and family how do become happy now that total isolation is a given do i start playing visual novels
    how the fuck do you people tolerate this this is absolutely a breakuppable offense theyre lazy and sloppy and just plain dirty   how do you continue to date a child like that youre not their girlfriends youre mommies they can fuck   disgusting
    your boyfriends are pathetic disgusting manchildren and your standards are extremely low if you tolerate bullshit like that
  im the other girl not op my boyfriends mom died when he was a kid and honestly ive come to realize that i do fulfil that role for him in many ways i take care of him when hes sick clean up after him cook for him comfort him when hes had a bad day etc i try to give him the unconditional love and support that hes been missing
im this guy    sounds like the deeper problem isnt that you want to let him go its that you feel like you have no one to turn to after the fact     it is hard to make friends as an adult but not impossible i suggest you start focusing on that a bit work friends are a good first step christmas work party    saying yes to any and all things you get invited to is a good first step too you never know if anyone there is a potential friend unless you go     that all being said i still like to give people a fair go so if the eggnog incident is on parr with the sink maggots incident then yeah maybe you leaving him over this reason will kick him into gear
  i do that to my partner too if im sick they look after me if they are so do i were a team of equals there are strengths and weaknesses between the two of us but we try never to be unequal   the issue here is reciprocity   your he does not reciprocate he seemingly cannot he is not my father he is not my mother we are two fighters with hands clasped together against the fucking world    i dont mean to be hateful theres enough hate going around but there still should be a questioning of what we think is status quo is what you have the best that you can i wouldnt be happy in that
  play tokimeki girls side
  he takes care of me in other ways i suffer from anxiety and other mental illness and he provides me with a sense of comfort and security nobody else would be able to put up with me the way he has and taking care of him is how i show my appreciation
    done and done gonna go to every event im invited to and play tokimeki girls side this is a goodass helpful thread
  i understand what youre feeling and shit who am i to undermine a relationship im just an internet nobody  but my sister is the same way she breaks her back looking after this scum bag she calls a boyfriend not saying your guy is scum he makes her feel good and she is his new mommy i really hate it    i hate to throw stones i never like to criticize how other people feel but if you were paralyzed tomorrow would he take care of you would he feed you change your diaper   thats the love i want
  hes kind of gross so what live with it its such a petty thing to leave him over
dump him gtfo with this attention whoring
hey girls guy here i used to be a total slob like ops dude but managed to turn my shit around the thing about it is men have a higher tolerance for mess and they dont really understand that its a problem unless they are conditioned over time to see it i was with my ex for four years and she bitched about me constantly for stuff like this i remember thinking that it really wasnt a big deal and she was nagging for no good reason but over time i began to have higher standards of cleanliness and was better able to recognize when the place needed cleaning and organizing the problem is that he is used to it and doesnt see the problem    the answer is simple but it creates tension and takes time it isnt easy you have to set a standard if you move in together keep the house clean from the moment you move in and if he leaves a mess doesnt clean up you have to nag and bitch every single time until he anticipates it im sorry but there is no other way it sucks and you are going to fight but over time hell get so tired of arguing that he will become more attentive me and my ex have been apart for almost two years now but the habits she instilled in me still remain and i keep my house clean now its like my eyes evolved to see filth better or something    i wish there was a better way but thats the best advice i can give
  that sounds miserable im not going to housetrain a grown man im just going to dump him i love him so much im gathering his stuff into a box and its making me cry but if he cant pull his head out of his ass and figure out that growing mold in his kitchen every week is a bad idea he shouldnt be dating someone my life partner is not going to be the person who has several serious discussions with me about a problem but doesnt get off their ass and fix it
  this guy speaks the truth i was kinda in the same boat not to the extreme as ops bf but messy enough to disgust clean freaks    i married a woman that eventually made me change my habits i still like to have some mess on my own for my own sake that much perfection on keeping everything as clean as posible stress me out but is nothing like i used to be
  break up
  im not going to housetrain a grown man  you could just give him an ultimatum
  hey you do you i know its a pain in the ass to try and train an adult that should already know better but im just telling you what worked for me    maybe if you are lucky he will do a total 180 and change his ways but i guarantee that unless you ride his ass he will fall back into old habits i realize how ridiculous that is and i apologize on behalf of my entire sex
disgusting not only how people live like this but that its not a deal breaker for bringing girls over  im a man and wouldnt hang out with another male friend if they were like this i dont have time to associate with trash
    good to know ill make sure to ghost guys right away if their home looks like this and look for someone selftrained and selfaware then
  theres more issues here than you even realize  you dont know what youre getting into itll only get worse from here   get out while you can
can you ever learn to love something about someone that youve always disliked in the past in this specific case its tattoos ive always hated them on girls unless theyre really small and tucked away somewhere you dont see them all the time    but im crushing on this girl right now who is pretty much my ideal all with the exception that she has a half sleeve and half of her leg covered at least that i can see she may have more on her body    am i doomed here is she just going to cover up her body in shitty palellograms and flower art or can i grow to love it    pic semirelated not her but close in terms of tats
is anyone else a total social outcast at work outside of it i have a healthy circle of friends im in a relationship and ive been socially okay at other jobs at this one though im a total outcast and ive only been there for two months i go to all the work social events plus talk to people when i can but im generally quiet and get my head down to work     how should i get over this i feel totally selfconscious for 40 hours of the week
bump for interest
/b/ i have a problem so while i was on my phone with my gf last night she asked me if i ever wanted to do a threesome with a guy or girl and i said no and then she started sounding really disappointed and went silent on me for a bit    should i be concerned i admit i used to want to do one but i love her so much and dont want to think about another guy being inside of her should i bring this up to her eventually im not sure if shell understand     pic related i guess
forgot i originally posted this on /b/ before i deleted so apologies guys
  yes redflag    time to bail
  but i cant lose her i really cant afford to lose her shes too important 
  no this is where you are absolutely wrong    you either cut your losses now or watch your life fucking implode when this shit happens later you are not compatible with her she has expressed that she wants a different type of a relationship than you this is what we call a deal breaker    if i could impress one single thing about women to the men of adv its this when women vocalize such desires they are dead serious she will not be satisfied until shes fuckig multiple men regardless if you are involved or eve know about said ither men she told you her game plan and youre a fucking fool to think its anything less than that    i doubt youll do anything because you sound suck on this person just dont be surprised when im right    ps i speak from experience
  haciendo el amor a la misma vez tú te toca te toca bebé no te pasa nada vuélvete loca lolocaloca y tu novio te trata mal él no te controla no no no no
  shes on pedestal  oh boy now youre into it
  well thats a gut punch damn this didnt just pop into her head but shes been discussing perhaps even planned with someone already and shes supposed to bring you around to the idea    i doubt its a girl op
  is it not worth trying to convince her otherwise weve talked about doing so much in our future together its just that she has this really kinky side to her thats really enjoyable for the most part but im just really scared well end up doing stuff like that and then never go back
  then never go back  you cannot put that back in the box op just cannot
  ive known shes wanted to do this stuff for a while cause i asked her her kinks ive implied before that i wouldnt be ok with it but yesterday i was pretty blunt and she sounded so disappointed
  lets say that you love football lets say i didnt want you to participate in said football you would think about it all the time and eventually go play some football with whoever is willing to play    you cannot make desires disappear they arent logical    its time to turn off the motor and get out if the relationship car she wants to go left and you want to go straight    i wish you a great day
  shes wanted to do this stuff for a while  what stuff and for how long    if you knew the whole time and thought shed change her mind well she didnt and she wont
  shes wanted to do stuff like dp before she told me this really early in our relationship like weve only been dating for months now we barely get to fuck cause she has like no freedom at all outside of her house
  slighlty different angle here i brought up to my wife the hotwife fantasy she shot it down not a day goes by that i dont think about it though     for me i wish i could just forget about this fantasy all together but like mentioned above its got its hooks in me     in the end i just have to remember its nit the end of the world and just a fantasy thatll go unfulfilled so maybe there is hope for you op definitly talk this out with her make sure she understands why exactly your against it good luck
im like really fucking scared now lol besides this everything is going so well and im the happiest ive ever been im going to try and convince her out of it but if it doesnt work well then ill dump her and you guys get to say i told you so
  thank you bro
  i had this conversation with my girl once as well  gf ask for threesome   told her if only with another girl   she tells me what if i like the other girl better  told her it would be the same with another guy   she drop the idea and never brought it up
op you better bail give her a call tell her that you dont feel like youre on the same page and end the relationship right then and there youll thank yourself in the long run
  its time to turn off the motor and get out if the relationship car  the relationship car  holy fuck this is the most autistic analogy ive ever read on this site
  the difference here is that youre a male women wont and dont have to make these concessions because they can find 10 guys instantly for these sexual urges if she wants a three some its about one of the reddest fucking flags you can get on multiple levels move on or have fun playing backseat in a relationship to a woman who not only is an unapologetic whore expressed no misgivings asked you directly seemed disappointed but probably tacitly understands you and your relationship as weak felt she was able to ask you this sexual fixation is on multiple guys  and dont think for a second if it was a two girl threesome it would stay that way it would be transactional  and is unsatisfied by your own relationship
  you dont even speak spanish properly
  lol youre just too stupid to understand
my girlfriend and i havent tried to fuck each other in over a month and i dont really care weve been together for 25 years lived together for 2 i beat off about 2x per week the guilt fucks with me sometimes that im not as attracted to her as i used to be even though physically she hasnt changed too much am i shitty for staying with her or is there a remedy to this
stop watching porn stop looking at other women you find attractive use your horniness to view your woman in a new light and find her beauty again
  can go either way depends if you really want to be with her or not its part your choice and other part is hers
stop fapping and yeah looking at other women its all in yr head or just leave
  have you been stressed out/busy lately does she ever give you signs of wanting to fuck that you ignore this type of thing doesnt come suddenly and feeling guilt for not being attracted to her shows something else might be going on i would say that its probably just in your head but this clearly isnt the full story
post gets deleted cuz forgot to upload file  rage  make another quick one  was summoned to a site of furry tards with short temper  lately they found out the owner is a pedo  they are too retarded to do anything so they rage on the site and get banned only to come back and get banned again  go to 4chan  tell anons to help a fellow anon  site is wolfing pedo is wolfkodi  anons u got 2 options  work together and find proof to take pedo down furrytards will help you  bend over and fuck the site so furry tards can be free  u choose anons  if post gets gnomedmp4 spread the word  go on the crussade anons spread my word  let our autism triumph  wear the flags with my name    mook
i dont know who i want to be can one change    the default me doesnt care about life just lives another day i am a habitual loudmouth i get angry easily and can snap without a moments notice im admittedly cringy selfish self loathing self deprecating when asked family and friends state that my good aspect is being genuinely funny and comfortable in general when i want to be    meanwhile the people i personally admire are strong silent yet witty types in the few occasions where theyre heard speaking their mind theyre on point and immediately convincing the very definition of cool without flaunting it  how could i kill old habits and become a person i could be proud of of changing a personality of over 26 years is even possible hell to start with it feels like i have to go into solitude from anyone whos had any contact with me before because they already expect the person i am now and will constantly remind me that i cant change
noone
last bump
honestly what changed me you type everything that i am and act like is trying to self reflect and have the drive to change i take adhd meds and this helped tremendously in changing how i was a cringy loud mouth i still have anger issues but i try to control them with better coping mechanisms it is very hard but if you really want to change you have to put in the work
wierd video i found  
saged reply    get the fuck out  this isnt /r9k/
  announcing a sage is a bannable offense
is the pocky kiss cringe or cute
  wtf is a pocky kiss
  cute if youre an anime but unbearably cringe if youre someone who watches anime
undeniably cute
  cute and cringe are often synonymous if you  your girlfriend enjoy it then its cute but if anyone has to witness you two being cute we would cringe romance is a willingness to make a fool out of yourself
  like that one scene from lady and the tramp where they eat the same noodle and kiss except with a pocky
  if she just happened to be eating a pocky and you did this spontaneously it would probably be cute    if you plan this out and execute it because you saw it in an anime or something it is deeply painfully cringe
  this op   everything lovely dovey in others people eyes is cringe but what matters is if your gf likes it or not
5ft 3in or shorter  cute but not hot  shy and humble  smart and funny  caring   never wants kids    why does this woman not exist
  i do but im probably not smart or cute
she does exist but she doesnt want to date you
  because if she does shes after men who do a bit more than whine about their issue on 4chan
actually my new gf feels good
you ever look in the mirror
      why does everyone assume im a 4/10 loser
   3in or shorter   but not hot   and humble   and funny      wants kids  i know about ten women who fit ll but 12 of these and i barely even leave my house
  why do you assume youre not
  why does everyone assume im a 4/10 loser  youre asking for love advice on 4chan
  because you whine    to get what you desire become what you desire desires
  there exist plenty theyre just all with chad
sounds like a spot on description of my gf there is hope out there op
  where do i find them
they exist but theyre mostly chinese and their families will hate you and everyone will think of you as a lesser man for having settled for a chink
  me but i want kids two handsome little sons whom ill feed dino chicken nuggets but being 5 ft even in afraid ill breed manlets and after having an unexpected pregnancy end in a miscarriage im pretty scared ill be a horrible mom now and that i mustve done somwthing on accident to kill it
  how come people still say this whether its serious or not you dont find specific types of women anywhere you go by in your life and hope that you meet a suitable girl for you you cant just go somewhere where girls your type magically appear at most you can try to meet as many people as you can so that you raise your chances of meeting someone who you like
  my boyfriend is probably in the top 5 most beta male ive ever known but i think hes adorable and funny hes extremely loyal and i was his first he believes in one partner for life abd only making love hes a neet that plays vidya all day hes 58 not even my first incel bf im just attracted to them because half the time theyre good guys and very sweet just lonely the rest very controlling bitter salty 24/7 and so insecure i couldnt do abything without his say for fear a chad stole me away
bump
  not wanting kids is a huge red flag
  of what
  of not wanting to have a family
  but shouldnt some people recognize they should never be parents
caring  never wants kids  kind of mutually exclusive women who are caring usually want someone to care for and playing mommy for their boyfriends doesnt count
  are you only interested in a genetic fuck up for a partner
  can confirm i play mommy for my bf and it does boost fill the void properly to clarify its not a ddlg thing i wouldnt say he just loves him some snuggles and affection i do most cleaning i do all the cooking i work and sometimes he does talk little sometimes its cute sometimes i feel like i want to mind a new male thats actually a good mate for a family
  someone who recognises they shouldnt be a parent isnt exactly a better prospective partner than someone who doesnt recognise they shouldnt be a parent in both scenarios the person has fundamental flaws that make them unsuitable to be a parent and those flaws can equally impact their ability to have a healthy relationship
  what do you mean i just meant some women are not mom material at all
  not necessarily if a women recognizes she cant handle a screaming crying infant that needs her 24/7 365 she can still maintain a healthy relationship with an adult man who doesnt require that much care
  women who arent mom material are nearly universally not relationship material
  not wanting children can also be indicative of things like a lack of patience lack of empathy and selfishness just because you recognise that you shouldnt be a parent doesnt mean that those traits go away
  but the levels of those things needed to care for a child and a husband are hugely different
  give me an example i wanted so my partner should too but i see nothing wrong with a woman who can admit she cant handle a child
  women who dont want kids usually end up changing their minds later on
  she died last week
be me  senior in high school transferred halfway through between sophomore and junior year across state  start dating girl around march 2018 shes fun to be around etc  personal life and friends get in the way eventually gets bad enough causing multiple suicides within my own group  become really upset ex dumps me over text for being a little clingy after all of that just so i get a feeling of security after i lost a lot of people i cared about  other circumstances go into play i get injured as fuck and medically dead for a few minutes trying to protect her from someone that was going to hurt her because of me as a threat  go back to school after a month and a half of physical therapy for this year try to make amends before court case in fear of arrest  cold shouldered  court case comes i get off basically free as a witness  try again to be friends cold shouldered and pushed away like she wanted nothing to do with me  start talking to her friend group without bad intent later taking note of how selfcentered she is as time goes on  eventually get integrated by proxy invite people out on my own accord rather than whenever the group decides they want to do something  ex only cares about what people can give her makes comments like once its my problem its everyones problem unironically  best friend doesnt like her volunteers information without any prodding on whats going on  i start getting feelings for best friend debating on how much i want to ruin her before the year ends considering ill never see her again  have until jan 1st before personal life catches up with me again might not be so lucky this time around    i need a second opinion outside of my trusted group of people what should i do how should i handle this
my parents are good parents but not exactly good people my therapists said my anxieties and low selfesteem stem from my upbringing even my intrusive thoughts sound like how my father complains 24/7   my childhood wasnt bad it was good even but my older sibling took the brunt of their anger which has led to her hating me i cant blame her i barely left the house so they had nothing to complain about me their view on the world has also almost cost me my dream career i spent months preparing for  confronted them about it and they told me to accept who they are i do but interacting with them has a noticeable effect on my anxiety when im away from them i feel better so much better  what should i do continue to be with them for their sake or cut them off
be on your own but you dont have to completely cut them off occasional visits should be fine they are your parents after all you still seem to care about them
  this    im in the same boat op i moved out of state   i visit on holidays and thats good enough for everyone
i am a chemical engineer student i have friends family but im pretty lost in life i am studying something that i dont really know if i like it when i really like something i know that i can be the best at it and work in continuated hours but its hard to find that my main problem is that i like knowledge and so on that i like many things politics economics laws history i feel interested in physics any help
any help    focus on working for money and hobbies for fulfillment when modern science was young many successful scientists were gentlemen of leisure who used their wealth to fund their interests you need money first     you also need to finish a degree to get that out of the way and expand your resume chemistry beats the shit out of gender studies     stop thinking you need to like what you do and consider the long game you need to like some of what you do but work comes with the territory learn to attack challenges for their own sake because you need to build selfmastery do that and the world is your oyster
  first of all dont listen to any of us you dont know us and we dont know you everyone has unique passions and life experiences and ways of thinking its your life and your own choice    what i can tell you with absolute confidence is that passions arent found theyre developed when i first started cooking i sucked at it and really it was something that i just wanted to get over and done with as fast as possible but after months i fell in love with it its not what i do for a living either you can have passions that are just hobbies and something you do to relax after work    to find what you want to do its equal parts deep introspection and also just trying things out to see what sticks i thought i would enjoy it and web design but i was terrible at it and i hated it and wanted to kill myself but at least i knew it wasnt meant for me    also i gotta completely disagree with what the other anon said i mean yes obviously you need to get paid but you should absolutely love 100 of what youre doing living the best possible life as a human being is to have a job that doesnt feel like a job at all if youre making money but youre miserable then youre still miserable being a starving artist or whatever on the other extreme also isnt good either you do need to find a balance between living your dream and paying your bills    like i said its up to you and at the end of the day loving what you do and getting paid for it is better than just one or the other
  take this guy with a grain of salt my dad loves what he does hes works in hvac he does side jobs just for fun and the extra money goes to fund his hobbies sometimes you can love what you do i did i loved being in the military and that was my career for years
young autist here i was reflecting on the strange time of my life when an older female compatriot of poor social standing invited me to fengshui her apartment but instead got me drunk and made out with me before i threw up having not drunk before as bizarre as the experience and the quasirelationship that followed was im still bummed out that it didnt result in sexual intercourse of any kind   that scenario was peculiar to that breed of crazy woman so its probably not going to happen again but is there another situation in which i can find myself partaking in a casual encounter with a drunken older woman how do i know which women are available and how do i lead into inviting her over to my place or me her place
good stuff 
can i get a sociopath gf death stares are a okay with me be as intense as you want 
so ive just gotten out of my shitty village school with pretty good finals result which ive earned and really good grades that ive gotten mostly not as much for being actually good as for not being as horrible as the other village mucks which enabled me to get in a top tier school in the biggest city in my part of the country and everything is going pretty good besides that im failing maths and this year its still basic level but since im in extended maths class its going to be on some crazy shit next year my problem is that i learn and execute maths very slowly and on top of that ive got the craziest teacher in the school who does stuff like giving way less than enough of time on tests to show us life isnt fair and that well never have enough time thus should teach ourselves to be enormously quick is there anything i can do any way to improve besides cramming at home spending like 10 hours with exercises and 4 hours sleeping within a dobe which i already do with no results
im interested in talking to this girl but dont want to date her i just want to get experience with talking to girls any advice what do i start with saying i want to come off as a chad and one day become one pls help    pic unrelated
ok guys im in a rough spot  talking with my cousin female on whatsapp  she keeps saying i should come visit or that we should go on holiday together  she even said we should share beds  now shes asking me what i think of her getting nipple piercings    is she dropping hints or is this strange but accectable familial behaviour
  if you wanna bone then bone  if you dont tell her that you aint interested
  i feel like it would be too awkward to say im not interested especially if this is a coincidence
  sounds like friend zone lock asks these personal questions of someone she doesnt mind asking because you are too good of a friend to her to try to use the info to seduce her    sorry bud after a year or two and she doesnt have a guy she might make you a friend with benefits
  stop trying to bone your cousin you weirdo
  we started talking only last week but i get what you mean      im not
  doesnt sound like  to me offering sharing beds/coming to visit dont make sense with only a week of talking sounds to me like your cousin is thirsty in which case i would shut that shit right down
i dropped out of collage as a freshman and bummed around working/mooching i just got a rich girl pregnant she is gainfully employed and we will be getting married on the 10th i am 26     i am in the national guard as a 68w and i want to go to medschool but it looks like i need a four year degree to go to the two schools that are near me     my stats   i got a 31 on the act when i was 17   the army taught me how to care about stupid stuff  ive been told that im good at my job  i am apparently too stupid to know how to prevent a pregnancy   i have a md friend who hooks me up with a high dose of adderall and i have a waver from my unit to use it     my plan get a 4 year degree in two or three years and go to med school using the national guards absurdly generous med student program which will pay me tuition 1000 bucks a month for whatever i wantbooks and possibly partial rent in exchange for staying in the guard for seven years as a doctor     the guard and my soon to be wife will float me through the undergrad stuff    i think i would function better if i did the work online that way i dont need to be around zoomers     is this possible i understand that organic chemistry has labs and such
i had a similar situation to ops but it turned out that she was just a pathological flirt if shes talking to any guy for a few days shell start saying that kinda stuff for the attention
advice needed i have hpv i had a wart 4 months ago had it treated and it hasnt come back yet i read in my universitys health science library that while hpv isnt curable most cases clear up within 12 years is this the common experience for most people im comfortable telling any girl i meet that i have it but it would be a lot easier if i can tell her a year from now that my body has most likely cleared it unless my immune system is compromised
no advice for op but fyi to everyone else theres a vaccine for the most common forms of hpv some countries with nonretarded health systems provide it for free for young people even if its not free 300usd is a small price to pay to not get bloody anal warts    hpv causes cervical cancer and throat cancer dont take the chance  go look into getting vaccinated    t just got my last shot   good feeling to know im mostly safe
  op here i had gotten all my shots as well it doesnt fully protect you
i had tiny genital warts once 3 years ago they came back one week after they were frozen but after the second time they never came back freezing best way to deal with them dont bother any other method except maybe the homeopathic l2papi substance which is probably a good cure for this 
  pretty much everybody who is sexually active has hpv    as long as she is vaccinated she wont get the dangerous forms so dont worry about it
  nasty
  yeah after a year or two the warts stop popping up as frequently unless youre compromised by stress still consider getting the hpv vacciene since there are various strains and some are the leading cause of cervical cancer
  its the truth whether you like it or not 80 of sexually active adults have it and yes even those who you cant see anything on their genitals can be carriers and still potentially infect
      you sure youre not talking about herpes
2 year long tumultuous relationship with boyfriend lots of toxic drunk fighting  he broke up with me twice along the way once after 6 months because he planned to go to grad school far away  talked it out and stayed together  other time was this past august because he was losing feelings after a year of long distance  he came right back in less than a week  i decide after a month of consideration to go ahead with the plans to move in with him that we had made since the start of the ldr    flash forward to now  been here a month havent had sex since moving in  had a drunk fight where he got really worked up and essentially yelled at me all night  i lock myself in my room with the water jug because im extremely drunk and will be hungover in the morning  bangs on the door all night so i let him in he yells at me for taking the water from him and i go to sleep in the car but before i leave he pours the jug out over me  when we talk about it a day or so later he doesnt apologize because he saw it as me purposefully taking a resource that he would need even though he could use the sink says he wasnt that drunk  we agree to not drink together or get that drunk again  happy times again but i completely dont trust him and think this relationship has no future  lease is up for renewal for next year rent is lower  i sign it so that he can get the reduced rent but tell him honestly im unsure about the future
    part 2 of my post since it didnt fit    so what do i do how do you even break up with someone in this situation i keep looking for reasons to break up with him nicely without putting a lot of blame on him and i think its mostly that we just value trust differently i love him more than any previous relationship but theres too much toxic shit here for me to ever marry this man i used to think he was perfect but now i really just want out right now were both just kind of like codependent room mates who occasionally kiss were great room mates and probably would have been amazing friends but this has gone too far it feels like pic related
  bump for advice
  i keep looking for reasons to break up with him nicely without putting a lot of blame on him and i think its mostly that we just value trust differently  be upfront preferably when yall are sober do not blame him im sure youve screwed up somewhere on your part too and just dont see it but you kind of do since you said its differences in value trust  tbh you disgust me by still kissing him and leading him on i actually feel sorry for the guy
  i should look for a place first before thinking about breaking up though right
  i guess your survival is more important than the relationship and he should get that do you not put any blame on yourself for the relationship ending
  i take full blame there really isnt a day that goes by that i feel like a piece of shit for the pain i caused its my fault him and i arent together anymore i was the one who selfishly took advantage of someone who actually loved me his behavior was in reaction to my terrible choices
kinda confused as to how or why you put yourself in this position op the first time someone drunkenly abuses you is the last time they ever do it to you or you leave that is what your thought process should be but it isnt possibly because of underlying issues from childhood how do you break up with him first you need a plan and a few backup plans on how you can move out and live on your own once those are figured out you need to arrange moving for your belongings and then tell him youre breaking up also your whole martyr schtick is complete bullshit and you really need some hardcore therapy    everythings my fault he did nothing wrong  then why the fuck are you posting about the abuse youve suffered and how you want out you obviously cant bear the responsibility of blaming someone else for things that have happened its safer and more comfortable for you to take all the blame and that is sick
  i dont know enough details but in general if one of the two involved cant compromise then its not meant to be you sound like this is already over so just end it with leading him on as least as possible given your living arrangement and dont be too hard on yourself it takes two to tango not all your fault
  this is not me lol      i mean im trying to not blame either side really which is why i said i was looking for reasons that arent blamey theres no point in that other than to make a clean narrative which can really go either way a relationship not working out is just a relationship not working out because of a mismatch between both people when people break up both are to blame but the concept of blaming is pointless     i think we both have faults you know like im nervous and thats a lot to put up with hearing me doubt our future when were happy and we have to make plans was devastating to him i felt awful about it because it hurt him but i felt it was more important to tell him the truth this is where we branch off because he thinks its more important to avoid conflict and keep the peace in the relationship so thats why i say we have different values when it comes to the truth     and like the example i gave from the fight i was being very bitchy when we were heading home that was bad and i should have known better because hes predisposed to have those emotional swings when hes drunk i was also being messy and not thinking does that mean that his actions were ok no but im not some saint here either       the thing is weve had this pattern over the past two years of these drunken fights it gets really scary and ive cut down on drinking and avoid it but were in our 20s so its hard to not socialize with his friends without it and he was bothered in the past with my distance from his friend group so its an area that im working on but this is the first time its gotten physical and thats why it shook me up water is nothing obviously but to me it was a sign that hes breaking the barrier between yelling and being angry to actually doing something to me about it thats why im having this thread asking what to do because its a major red flag to me
be me  be 14  live in some dying country  go to school  its friday  hope that some stupid shit doesnt happen  walk in to physics class  some girls and chads talking  i hear that 9/1 qt314s stepbrother got nudes from some random 6/10 thot from our school  i join the convo  9/10 qt314 somehow gets those photos  we get disgusted  its some thot with a hairy vagina and small fat bobs  we get mental aids  delete the pics  the thot walks by  shes crying  someone snitched  its math class  its almost over  one of the workers at school kicks open the door  says you know that police did a session at school about crimes right  we all shit our pants  says well you just did one fucko  shit  get away with it anyway  9/10 qt314 and 3 chads talk with the worker  ladiesandgentlemenwegothimmp3  mfw 9/10 qt314 is going to get killed by her parents  mfw we did a crime  mfw we will get killed by our teacher  mfw my day got ruined    dont do crime kids
  underage b
i recently got a new job which means i have a lot of stuff to add to my resume and i thought it may be a good time to just do a new one entirely as now im not under pressure as i use latex to write my resume basically a programming language i can literally do anything and so i was aiming at creating a nonstandard resume that looked very attractive looking for templates i found the code for pic related im not that guy and i think it fits the bill but i am just looking for a second opinion to see if it is not too much and by that i mean if you were hiring and saw this what would you be most likely to think    a wow this looks very nice the person behind it clearly works harder than normal  b wow why did he add all of this stuff its just too much weird
  a
b it comes across as a tryhard as if you try to focus on the looks of the resume to try to compensate for shortcomings of its content for most positions and most employers the only thing that matters is the content
  yeah i can see that but what if the content of my resume has no shortcomings would you still see it as bad instead of as a cherry on top
  i certainly would not see it as a positive i might even think that you are insulting me by trying to impress me with such things which i know are simple to implement
  i see what do you think is too much i personally really like the idea of the sidebar do you hate the sidebar entirely or perhaps just the diagrams and why
how do i know if im bothering my gf or not
  ask her
  asked her but she skipped the question  now she went to sleep because she has headache  is she cheating on me
look at her face
    your 2d gf cant be actually bothered  and yes shes cheating on you with countless other anons who have her as their waifu
  the only way to be sure is if you lather all her underwear in lemon mayonnaise while she sleeps
  im not talking about my waifu but about my japanese girlfriend
  you dont have a japanesse girlfriend  why are you lying anon
  i do have one
is she cheating on me or not
  you mean yukichan right now shes busy eating my big american hotdog youll have to wait
why do people not give advice
  maybe shes isnt but because youre acting insecure she might leave you in the future
  dodges the question  suddenly has to go to sleep  yeah you were bothering her
  this plus giving vague answers does not deserve advice she may or may not be bothered by you
  post number here ill ask her
i asked out a girl ive known for a year my intent was to go as friends so later maybe we can have a true relationship since i know neither of us is ready for one at the time i sperged out she misunderstood and told me she isnt ready for a relationship with anyone and wont be in the near future i still like her and we are still friends and she sais she is willing to go out as just friends did i blow it guys can i still salvage this or will she forever remain guarded against me now im giving her a break from me till after finals she stresses alot about studying so maybe once they are over ill try seeing her again any helpful advice preferably from femanons or guys in successful relationships on how to continue with this
  she doesnt like you romantically you can be her friend and thats it
fuck other bitches
  i dont think women like men who pretend to be their friends only to swoop down like a vulture to reveal his true intentions when she is emotionally vulnerable
  i dont know i really didnt want a relationship right now but i would like one with her eventually do you think staying friends with her while dating others will help me be with her sounds pretty womanly to use jealousy to manipulate a partner i figured ill stay her friend and continue to court her until she graduates though that admittedly sounds extremely beta
  im not pretending we are friends she was the one who pushed for friendship with me too i guess she just attracted me a bit further than she hoped i am ok with staying her friend if she doesnt feel ready to go another step i just need to get her to trust me i honestly had no intention of getting us into any comitted relationships
all you can do now is give her space act normally dunno your exact situation and how you guys do things but maybe let her initiate or go out in groups to make her feel comfortable even after finals id say still try to check if shes ready and if shes showing signs of interest before deciding to make a move
  also forgot to mention im a femanon and the stuff i suggest is what would make me comfortable in that situation
  thanks man i definitely wont be making a move anytime soon we are both young and neither of us has any dating experience i will give her space then see if she wants to see each other as mere friends in the company of others too preferably i am of the belief that romantic relations should grow naturally out of friendly relations with the opposite sex hell id say despite being quite naturally unemotional person most of my longterm friendships with guys almost border on romantic
  np that is a pretty good way to go my first relationship wasnt with someone i knew for a very long time beforehand and among the people i became good friends with nothing ever came from it i still feel like i missed something from that even if i have moved on to find something else with someone all the best
there is nothing wrong in wanting to be friends first it helps you figure out if she is a good match or not now if she is not ready then its ultimatum time whether youre together or she gtfo
  classic friendzone stick to relationships that are romantic and mutual
my career is from 7am to about 2pm i mostly literally jerk off the rest of that time or play chess my friend pretty much handed me the job and i have held it down 9 months im 25 but looking to make more money with all of the free time i have i have always been pretty directionless and most of my friends dont talk to me anymore for reasons i dont really understand i feel more isolated and would just like the fill the time up with some kind of work i could do with flexible hours
bumping for ideas
possibly a bakery for early hours or maybe newspaper delivery to keep or get in shape     alternatively you could work at a restaurant or pub that is open later
  also telemarketing
i know a lot of guys that went that route for selfimprovement  its fine but do try to balance it youre 25 you can make new friends at a pub or something but please dont just shut yourself away from other people
i would like to preface my responses with some thoughts i was always something of a misfit and its my folly that i am softhearted i have been here for nearly a decade sifting through the virulent banter which can be funny at times has its place but the fact you anons answered my question in earnest means a lot to me i always wanted to thank the community of anons whom enlightened me with the spectrum of humanity depraved and predacious yet brotherly and kind      being a paperboy may indeed work     last time i did sales i drank myself under the table i worked as a laborer and saw death and took deep breaths of asbestos and it paled in comparison to harassing people     its one of my hopes to meet people in a different line of work i appreciate the advice i tried using that app meetup but it was never close to me or to my interest enough i am painfully afraid of meeting people and hope to change that
  drive for uber/lyft/postmates also whats your rating
  my area has put a hold on tlc licenses i was going to originally do this until the legislation was passed     1900
  you sound like one of the few decent people around here im a woman we arent all that bad    
i messaged a girl in regards to an activity of my choice for today at 3pm she unfortunately failed to respond at all no yes no no no nothing shes also in the dd group im in but i feel it wasnt appropriate to bring it up before during or post mortem the session     what should i do
  move on shes not interested in dd nerds girls date up and youre sideways at best
  compared to everyone else around im unironically am
  there are people outside of your immediate circle of friends interestingly enough
  i know of her friends as well fm theyre no better
  well i mean shes still not interested
  it seems like shes pegged your garbage attitude from across the room if your responses are anything to go off of    no response is one of two things rejection or relegation to being replied to a later time/not at all/when you come out with something besides a proposition for a date we cant do anything about either    in fact heres a novelty idea from the gift shoppe why not ask your friends whats up and if shes mentioned you or anything
  well excuse me for being a bit sour
send out an offer to do x  they dont respond    its a no theres nothing else to look into move on and forget you asked her dont bring it up thatll only make things worse
  youre allowed to feel let down but you had no claim on her and obviously are some kind of autism to misread signs badly enough to not even get a response out of her but its not our fault that we cant tell you what you want to hear
  i often look at messages while doing something else and completely forget to respond
  dont bring it up   nah he should bring it up in message form      op send her another message that says she must not be interested and that youll talk to her some other time    its an easy resolution that shows you arent some loser with too much time on your hands and theres no awkward ass drama if you run into each other or you want to hit her up some other time sometimes chicks actually get back to you after you do that anyway because if theres one thing they like to do its waste peoples time especially if they naturally present it as limited
  dont waste your time op move on
    forget about her she is not interested its just as easy as that op
i have want to know where all of my childhood friends are these days but almost none of them have social media that i can find especially the ones that i loved most does anyone have any clue as to how i am to find these people pic related its the highschool i went to
  alcatraz high class of 06
  thats how it felt like
  want to know my bad
ask your friends if their friends know  this is assuming they want to be contacted  if they dont have social media i suspect they do not
  almost everyone can be found online possible exception  women who have married and changed their name    first just google their name and see what comes up    then try whitepagescom it helps if you can narrow it down to a state or age group
  people may not want to be contacted life goes on and we moved on if you didnt then that is just another reason not to reconnect with you social media is an extension of your personal life not a separate thing it is for people you interact with irl not for creepy stalker loner weirdos this place is for those
what should i have done differently    set up a date through a dating app with a japanese chick  hang out for like 8 hours  go back to her place she decides she isnt too happy about it  she takes forever in the bath i decide to join her  literally spends an hour in the shower   i understand now why her skin is blemishfree  get out and hop in bed and it is like 130 amat this point   she starts working out   then says she wants to go to sleep and tells me to not even touch her loses it with body contact   i decided to just take an uber home spoiler60/spoiler  today our messages were totally normal and shes acting like were dating all of a sudden
  sounds like she is interested in you but trying to keep you off of touching her some girls and ill go ahead and assume that being japanese she has that kind of strict mentality too want to make sure their man cares about them before he cares for their body and so that could be what shes doing with you but thats just my assumption i dont know your situation as good as you do im just a stranger on the internet
sounds like shes keeping you as a rebound in case it doesnt work out with chad
  she was too polite to tell you to leave its not that she does not want to date her rather she wants to do it at a slower pace eight hours is a lot no matter how soulmatey you both thought you were a date should end a first date should not end at either of your residences slow the hell down take her minigolfing or to some other innocent datey activity like that and have the goddamn date end at some fucking point
  go back to her place she decides she isnt too happy about it    why the fuck did you not immediately thank her for a great evening and simply leave at this point the fuck is wrong with you mate    im baffled at how you could identify the vibe at this moment yet not have enough whereabouts to realise you werent welcome in her home you sound like a fucking entitled psycho
    youre probably right
i have an unfair and shitty reputation with family and old friends not even sure how to fix my relationship with them because its filled with ingenuine politeness and passive aggressive comments pretty sure others know what im talking about and have experienced this type of behavior tried to confront them and get them to open up about it but they just deny knowing what im talking about getting tired of it and thinking about scalping them out of my life and moving away    its really fucking annoying and the stuffiness is getting to me they make me feel guilty for not going to gatherings recently family must stick together kind of attitude and i just dont want to be around them anymore its not one thing that has happened to cause this its mostly just gossip and interpreting what i say or do the wrong way even swallowed my pride and apologized to one of them for whatever ive done wrong to cause them not to like me i dunno     anyone have a similar experience with petty people who seem to look for offense or just dont like you for whatever reason that has nothing to do with doing anything wrong to them
also can someone criticize the hell out of how i write im not sure if im good at expressing myself clearly or im just confusing
  im pretty sure everyone has people in their family like that its annoying as fuck but eventually you just have to learn not to let it get to you hopefully you have at least a couple relatives that you actually enjoy being with so try to spend time with them at family events and just dont let the pettiness from the others get under your skin
  it really depends would you rather be closer than you are now with them    or do you want distance and respect because youre feeling crowded
  id like to have a better relationship and be better friends and a good family member but i also dont want to change myself so much that i start resenting it and no longer feel like myself anymore they wont take the time to understand me and in a way i hate that they can be quite shallow and live in their own little world filled with self help books and ironic hypocrisy thats what bothers me about them but most people are like this and it can get quite frustrating with how sensitive and judgmental they let themselves be     if they dont understand something its either stupid or just weird if i make a slightly crude joke or curse it ruffles them or makes them uncomfortable i let my niece watch jaws for the first time at the age of 7 she had so many questions and normally was afraid of going in the water for a while i got a lot of shit because of that but i tried explaining to them that i watched jaws at her age and it was scary but a great learning experience looking back on it weird example i know but if you can get the idea of the type of people im talking about maybe youll see why its a bit difficult   because of acts like this or me jumping from job to job i got this reputation of being the irresponsible idiot friend or family member very conservative type of people not pepe conservative just in their own world type of conservative     people are so damn uptight in general these days its starting to make me go insane because i dont know what the rules of engagement are with other people anymore     im either considered stupid rude mean or just off putting for reasons i fined very tame
    to be fair jaws at 7 is weird    it sounds like youre just experiencing a fundamental personality incompatibility with them also this is very telling      im either considered stupid rude mean or just off putting for reasons i fined very tame    in a relationship of any kind those things are codefined by both parties as they interact    your definition of those things alone is good for exactly that being alone you dont sound stupid but you probably are rude to them or things they find important how can you expect reciprocity    youll probably be happier just finding people with better personality compatibility honestly even if you found someone with a thicker skin doesnt mean youd get along with them any better just note theyre your family wish them well but if this is who you are it doesnt make sense breaking yourself in 2 to get along with them especially if doing so isnt taking on some kind of useful burden
  i dont know i understand i shouldnt have to change for others there are some people who are like me but people like my family love them theres some kind of charisma im missing or my timing is off but these things have always been a stupid blind spot for me for years ive tried to figure out what im fundamentally doing wrong but it always seems to be something different or im just not smart enough to see the patterns of how im changing and im just shooting wildly into the dark hoping something hits no one will be honest with me and i fear its because they think it would be rude and hurt my feelings     some of them are more succesful than i am and ive always found it difficult to move as fast as everyone else in life old friends were always moving from one interest to the next and i always felt like i was on the sidelines watching or trying to keep up maybe i am stupid or something im not sure of fucking sucks even my own family thinks im a loser or whatever someone wants to call it     i enjoy myself and my openness to life just havent figured out how to monetize it i guess
a close friend of mine apparently has spontaneously driven out of state his girlfriend and mother have involved the police and are tracking his phone    i dont know any of the details which puts me in a tricky spot do you think it would be worth attempting to contact him or will i just possibly make things worse
  he left for a reason if you know why thatd be great   i dont really know whats wrong or right
umm i wouldnt get in contact with him unless tot want to become a suspect and possibly go to court and be witness if he messages you
dont mean to scare you but a friend left like that to kill himself in another state
  or others
  send him a quick text asking how hes holding up and say that if he wants to talk youll keep it between you and him  whether or not you is up to you of course
if it were me id call him    is it right or wrong i couldnt say all i know is that id feel bad if i didnt at least try    it probably wont go through but worth a shot
not sure what i should major in im a couple years out of high school attended community college on again off again and have been a talented but apathetic student since high school smart but lazy haha lol memes i have a couple gen ed classes done but starting next term ill be starting to do classes relevant to my major im currently doing computer science so next term will be the beginning of a comp sci sequence calc sequence and physics sequence thing is i dont really know if i want to be a code monkey my whole career since recently i was happy with that choice but when i decided i should branch out from making hobby games i realized no other forms of programming interest me especially webdev ive been thinking about going to law school since i think id like being a lawyer good thing about law school is admission doesnt require a certain field you just need a bachelors to get in so my tentative plan is to just do a degree in computer science and by the end if i still dont have a passion for it just segue into law school would it be a bad idea spending the next 4 years doing a degree in a field im pretty confident i dont want to work in i guess the alternative is like a degree in economics i just really dont want some meme degree thats a common prelaw one but with no real industry skills like history or political science im just worried ill burn out of cs classes because its hard for me to get motivation and passion for something that i dont have a long term goal for tuition for next term is due in a couple days so i pretty much need to make a decision soon or else ill start being inefficient with my time/money/class schedule

have i fucked up this 1/2     meet girl when walking my dog about 2 months ago   shes cute we start meeting more often to walk our dogs   we start chatting online as well   were both the same age late 30s so were not fucking kids   go out to the beach together with the dogs movies both in theater and at my place   feels like things are moving nicely   go out this weekend with her dinner and drinks   the night ends   were sitting in her car shes about to drop me off she insisted in taking her car cause it was cold and i actually live next to the place we went so i had no need to pick mine up   go for that kiss   at first she gives in couple more kisses and tongue   she panics says its going too fast   we talk a bit about going slow   quick goodbye kiss   next morning meet up for dog walking   shes happy to see me but not eager to kiss   walk the dogs talk a bit go back home   she messages me saying she was thinking about those kisses that she likes me but only as a friend   probe a bit more to find out where i fucked up   she says she felt uncomfortable with me touching her this fast   tune changes from liking you as a friend to lets take it slow and see how it goes   i think to myself this is going nowhere i fucked up   invites me to go to the beach with the dogs like if nothing had happened   i say yeah sure lets just push through this awkward phase   go to the beach she gets a lot more touchy removing sand from my face and hair laying down next to me stuff like that   return from the beach   she asks me if im ok   be honest and tell her i have to think about the whole situation   still says she doesnt want to lose me hugs and holds my hand   go home and think that this is still going nowhere but fucking mixed signals are still giving me hope   talk later that night   she says she got scared when i kissed here cause it was so unexpected   she still wants to hang out repeats that we should take it slow    cont
  2/2     spend the next day just shooting the shit via text with her sending me bikini pics   keeps on going like the weekend never happened    what the fuck am i supposed to do i know she got baggage from previous relationships and i fucking moved too fast from barely touching her to sticking my tongue down her throat i really really like her can i still salvage this or have i gained a ticket to the friend zone
go slow take it very easy dont rush things have a lot of time having fun go on dates lots of eye contact and flirting    you did fuck up but you can recover i think
  yeah thats sort of what im aiming for like i say we still talk a lot a bit more flirting going on i was just afraid i came as too pushy and id get cut off i really like her and i can see shes making a genuine effort to get closer to me but part of me is afraid shes just leading me on and this will eventually go nowhere     plus im overthinking it because of what she said about how her last few relationships started up really strong and wild and i just didnt had that effect on her     guess ill have to play the long game then
  late 30s so were not fucking kids  wat late teens more like    wanting you for just a friend or puppy walking buddy doesnt mean you did anything wrong it means after the kiss she knows anything more is off the table shes just not feeling it doesnt mean you are a bad guy or unlovable it means despite your fantasy of coaxing her into a relationship but it isnt happening
  youre fucked mah nigga the bitchs not feeling something but try to hope so     slowly  love is motherfuckin faaast
  see thats why its driving me fucking nuts when she dropped the friend talk on me i was pretty blunt and said that theres no point in forcing stuff if there isnt any spark if she didnt feel anything there was nothing i could really do to change that so yeah we could try to be friends but she was very quick in dismissing that nothing would ever happen and thats when the take it slow and see where it goes came from and ive told her time and time again that its ok if you dont feel anything just let me know so i can move on and yet its still the same answer take it slowly
  then just keep taking it slow dont initiate anything and keep doing the same things youve been doing not all relationships form the same way
      he trys to take ot further than friendship  she dismisses it and says it goes too fast and wants to be friends because she likes him  he says then he doesnt want to waste time and move on  she backpaddles and sends mixed signals  he approached again  she slows the pace down again  he starts to doubt her intentions again    this keeps turning right round baby right round like a record baby right round    anon decide if you want to keep a friend or if you want to look for a partner you keep putting her in positions where she feels she has to do stuff she isnt comfortable with but knows that if she doesnt do those things you will leave her
  maybe you should do the famous  oh hey look this is my new girlfriend in front of her   later you text her and tell her  maybe it was too fast for you       if she dont asnwer or if shes sad then the bitch was maybe in love     if she say nothing and dont give a shit you didnt lose time with her and have a friend indeed     i cant stand people that hesitate how would you hesitate for this 
  ive told her i dont mind if we keep just being friends i like her enough for that im not giving her an ultimatum and i wont just pack my shit up and leave if she says no so i really dont get why she just doesnt come clean and say nothing will ever happen and save us both the heartache and trouble hope is a fucking bitch      sure cause all i have to do is snap my fingers and find another girl im way past those kind of stupid mind games
  i cant believe you are nearly 40 and doing this shit    stop seeing her every day and going out all the fucking time goddamn just reading this you are all over her everyday for two months you are moving too fast youre like a high pressure car salesman    if she wants you she has to call and ask
  then why the fuck you post here  we are not psychologist youre in yo 30s right  so why dont you go to her place a tell her face to face what you really want and really feel  no youre just lurking on a board to confort yourself      what you want me to say  the bitch is complexe and want to take time  why dont she go for a long distance relation ship then     i dont fucking understand people these days 
should i kill myself
the answer is always yes
depends on the situation
  in what circumstances should i not kill myself at this height
  why the fuck 61 is wrong height
  t manlet
what the fuck is the uss average height if 6 foot 1 is suicide material im italian and 5 foot 10 178 cm and perfectly average
  iirc its 59
  im 51
    why are you guys so dumb its 5 ft 61 inches
  oops i misread  suicide it is
  lmao
  how can you people be so fucking shallow 4chan is the worst place to ask for these type of things here the looks are regarded way more than irl ironically normies are less shallow when it comes to this    i dont think you are stupid enough so im not gonna explain why you shouldnt care   either you are a toddler or human giraffe is fine
  fuck you
  that is one gigantic dick underwear shopping must be a pain  my condolences
its not a big deal to some women i dated a guy that was my height im taller than 51 though he was the love of my life and also amazing in bed he was insecure about his height though and sometimes other guys would that seemed interested in me would tease him by saying okay little guy honestly it was more of a problem for him than it was for me
  why did you break up with him
  he was highly religious missions etc  i wasnt willing to go that route he sure loved fucking me before marriage though
  post revenge pics
  nah i still love him even though i will never see him again he was pretty handsome
  christcucks  the absolute state
  see im not all that good looking ive been told im somewhere in the average to below average range
  he wouldve been considered attractive but not everyone would agree i guessbut i loved his scruff his jawline fingers and flaring nostrils i admit i thought he was attractive right away but his sense of humor and romantic nature made me fall completely
  he was really small in general skinny nerdglasses too smart
    do you think you would get back together with him if he gave up or at least toned down the religion
  no when its over there is no going back i used to dream about him coming to visit me for a night and then leaving in the morning thats sort of what my relationship was like with him he was always possessed by other things and never really presentexcept when he looked at me ive never been looked at like that before or since love written all over his face even my friends saw it
no please dont
  probably not you only get one life and killing yourself because you wish things were better makes zero sense deep misery call it depression if you want often makes people blind to the things that are going right and to the possibility for positive change    heck at least something will change so its worth staying around for the entertainment you can live to see scientific breakthroughs wars changes in culture you could break free from the things that have you down and just aim towards what actually makes you happy a lot is possible in time so throwing out all of your time seems illogical to me    now philosophically there are plenty of arguments for suicide you can probably read about them
about 5 years ago i worked at burger king where i met this older chick  about 10years older than i am her and i were good friends there and still continue to talk even though she moved ive always found her attractive and have always wanted to tell her that do you anons think
  i think therefore i am
would you move out with your gf/bf if youve only known each other and have dated for only a month    i had two friends who did this i was the mutual friend who set them up they jumped ship and abandoned all friends in general what do you think of a situation like this
  id probably say youre a very good wingman   other than that if theyre both consenting adults who cares
  typical
  if your advice is who cares why bother posting in the first place     op id say it depends on your situation if both of you are absolutely certain youre willing to stick things out for the long run sure go for it   but if you feel the slightest bit of friction or you visit her place and she turns s out to be a slob then i wouldnt you should also find out how much she brings in on average to gauge what yall can afford
i keep seeing my ex i dont know why but whenever i see her my heart rate increases its been 4 years and ive had relationships within this time   she cheated on me but i generally dont give a shit about it anymore its just the fact that i feel weak whenever shes in my presence maybe because she cheated on me but i just wanted to say this to get advice and get it off chest
  same here its been 2 years since i broke up over her cheating but everytime i see her my heart drops like a stone
in society what percentage of people is perfect and what percentage is not  perfection in the sense of looks
what there no perfect looking people my guy
  so it doesnt really matter to be a failure
i got bronchitis of course i live in america and cant afford a doctors visit  what can i do to make this go away faster
this guy makes a lot of interesting content    joy happiness love these things are not dependent on wealth status vaginas its about human connections honesty sacrifice trust    
  i cant stand this type of shit it makes me feel like such a shallow asshole i feel like i been ungrateful my whole life
  whoa youre really hard on urself i had the same i felt shame but you know aint nothing wrong with feeling a bit of shame every now and then feeling shame is better than not feeling anything imo who knows if you manage to sit in that shame for a while perhaps the emotion develops into something else
  right it just makes all the things i worry about feel so petty fighting with my wife not being able to afford my car getting serviced i do wonder why i cant let myself be happy when someone who has a disability like that is my life is pretty damn good even if it has its problems
  i dont understand fully how those things are negatives for you in and of themselves but ait my aim was and is simply to share something that made me feel less of a robot
thank you for posting this she is so sweet i may have cried
love you for posting this anon 3
be put on salary   work is going to close doors for two weeks in december  boss planning on not paying me those two weeks     can she legally jew me this way nj if the state law matters what can i do i work for a small company but she lives in a mansion
bump
can you not use holiday pay to get paid those two weeks    inb4 i dont have holiday pay
  is the pic related
check your work contract depends on what that says
  i had 1 week of vacation which i used now the office will close        pic semirelated i have to put down a lot of pitbulls at work        doesnt mention it however it does say my yearly salary but factoring out those days being unpaid essentially i could never possibly earn what is on paper even if i applied vacation days to mandatory off time
  then the contract is violated and you have a legal case
  how solid because im essentially fired the minute my boss would get wind if me doing anything about it
  employer retaliation is also against the law retain a lawyer already if you have a good one you can get her mandated to pay your court costs
  i had 1 week of vacation which i used  well youre basically in a tough shit sort of situation     but factoring out those days being unpaid essentially i could never possibly earn what is on paper even if i applied vacation days to mandatory off time  what do you mean by this
  hed still be unemployed and depending on the industry he works in it may be impossible for him to get another job because people talk lawyering up and suing isnt always the best option and this is coming from a lawyer
  salary is stated at 50k a year    i get one week of vacation however there will be two weeks off for holidays which she is going to deduct from my pay thus it is mathmatically impossible for me to make my stated salary
  which she is going to deduct from my pay  why would she deduct from your pay
wait if youre on salary then why would missing two weeks of work effect your pay
  because shes cheap and believes she can she already deducted thanksgiving pay after closing the office 2 days    like i said she has been altering my pay for holidays i didnt choose and has stated she plans not to pay    this is the first time ive been salaried my impression was that you make the same regardless of these kinds of days off
  forget about contracts and loopholes and benefits and all that socialist crap work is an exchange of services for money there are no moral obligations beyond that for either party i suggest you find an employer who needs your services
go speak with her explain that salary means you are paid consistently over time some weeks you work more without recieiving ot and some weeks you work less     explain nicely that by dec 31 you expect to be paid your full 50000 as per your contract     i dont know what other benifits you are getting but you might do better as an hourly employee because then you get overtime
  how is religion relevant
  you are in us there exists something called furlough so you are most likely fucked  f r e e d o m  im not from us so that furlough might require renegotiating contract  you can go to reddits r/legaladvice and get some more informed comments
yes or no she has amazing tits but her face is like a 56/10 im 21 and still a virgin and dont know if i should lose it with a tinder butterface thot what do bros
  checked   smash and run anon  hit it from behind
  what about her titties
yes fucking retard
  but her face its not the prettiest but then again not the ugliest
  find a girl you like and who likes you will make it way better
21 in 2 weeks  no license rural area its almost a necessity only have my permit  no vehicle  no education  no job i already looked for work i was doing some programming where the government would subsidize the employer heavily for hiring me no dice  one friend left gone to college 100s of kilometers away  currently living with parents  no cellphone fairly useful in my area  parents are lower middle class  ask parents for guidance/help with anything get ignored  even if i go to college next year i have no way of getting there due to lack of transportation    im feeling extremely overwhelmed mainly due to the fact that i feel as if i have no control over my life i understand that i am responsible for all of the above but this is really dragging me down deep i feel like im about to hit rock bottom  im currently combing over my thoughts and the one thing that stands out during this ordeal is the lack of support with the exception of basic needs which i am grateful for  i really dont feel like i can hold on for much longer i feel very alone and like im in a dark place  dear lord i feel like a retard posting about this
  sorry youre in this spot lets try not to dwell on how or why you got here     remember you do have control over your life take it one step at a time looking at that list a license seems like a good place to start a cellphone is also a necessity in todays society so you can probably get one at your local welfare office    these things might seem small but a cellphone and the ability to drive legally are worth a lot those would be major assets    once youve completed everything on the list you can address with minimal help from others start formulating a plan on how to get real assistance from someone i think you might need to move but when a poor person moves they expose themselves to a lot of dangers so dont rush in
  also dont feel stupid and definitely dont an hero having socioeconomic problems sucks because its like odds are stacked against you but it also means that life can be heaven by comparison if you overcome said problems optimism not about all things is going to be a necessary for your survival    you dont want to die man fuck that whack shit
    thanks my man i know youre mostly right on this i think i need to write down some optimistic/positive things that i can overlook when i feel particularly crummy  as simple as a checklist sounds i hope that might help in keeping me on track i tend to ponder about every aspect of my life in a negative light    theres just some days where i feel like im floored and nothing really seems to snap me out of it
  without harping on my situation i relate to yours a lot i figure its better to feel like a shit sandwich with a license and a cellphone than a shit sandwich without    when the weather is nice or when i finally get to see one of my friends i try to make the most of moments like that    my plan is to go into a private career training program since these are very timely by comparison to public ones federal student loans will pay for it entirely that seems like what you need to do    the minimum wage in my state is going way up so it might be possible to live barebones off minimum wage and attend college    i think a lot about how isolated i am and wonder if ill ever feel okay again which you might relate to i just assume the answer is probably yes so long as i answer when duty calls and then try to get some sleep
    you do live in a country with welfare and student aid right a lot of this advice from an american perspective
    im not american but i live in this wintery hellhole known as americas hat so yeah everything youve said should will more than likely apply im also considered aboriginal and have my status basically meaning the government will give me a break on taxes and whatnot ive also been on ei or ui as its called in the us and they might fund a course up to 2 years    its quite endearing how you can manage to stay optimistic when the odds may very well be against you maybe i should at the very least learn some selfdiscipline and regain control of my mental being or at the very least become ignorantly optimistic if that even makes sense  anyway i wish you the best of luck in your endeavors
  dude at 21 i was sleeping rough broke as fuck toes hanging out the end of my shoes broke no friends no family no job no home no girlfriend not even a dog to keep me company i had to steal to feed myself im now 28 good job renting a nice place with an angel of a girlfriend hang tight my man life is weird and sometimes downright shit but it usually works out apply yourself to something you might be surprised what you can accomplish
  damn i cant imagine being in such a state i guess what i consider my rock bottom is a bit less bottomy than i had thought glad you found your way through rough times i hope i find my path as well  i havent really applied myself to much of anything even if i wanted to i would have no idea what to focus my interest on maybe its about time i searched for some interesting and productive hobbies
  yeah ive had to turn to the state for help and ive seen cases where guys were eating out of the damned trash and then turned it all the way around to good again like pilar of the community good    i think people in the hole learn about why they choose to live rather than die or waste away so they learn what matters to them in life then once out of the hole everything else looks like easy mode by comparison
  except not falling into a pit again that is challenging
  i came here looking for advice too im in a similar situation and have been since i was 16 im 28 now and ive never been able to hold down a job that paid well enough to move out whenever i get savings i blow them on court fees or healthcare for fuckups just find a job keep working and avoid accidents i guess
im really depressed /adv/ i keep getting used or keep attracting girls with toxic habits/traits and im getting more and more tired and disappointed because i genuinely just want to find somebody that will want something serious with me    be like 8 months ago  meet qt314 via friends  start going out sort of usually just to lunch outside of campus  sometimes wed meet at my apartment and just cuddle up and watch movies/make out  everytime i asked her to go somewhere outside of campus shed say yeah and then cancel the day we were supposed to meet  cut things off with her and just try to forget      new grill    chiiling at party   qt mexican chick that ive been crushing on for a bit comes up to me and starts chatting with me  im super awkward when in parties when sober especially with people i dont know  she takes my hand and we go to an isolated place  get the hint  start making out and shit  she starts rubbing my dick and shit and i have to tell her that im not like that that i need time with people to do that  she thinks is cute and tells me she wants to go out with me  tells me she doesnt have a man  take her by the hand and start dancing with her  wake up yesterday after a hangover  notice she dropped me a message and it says that she lied when she said she didnt have a bf  ohgodnojpg  says she still wants to go out with me and that she genuinely likes me    im not a very social person since all i really care about is my studies and hanging out with my close friends     how can i restore my hope how can i attract girls who genuinely want something serious
    allright    women are attracted to guys that do something with their lives finding a girl that likes you for you is actually very hard because girls have very different preferences over men    so dont go expecting to find a girl just like that live your life and stop waiting for love to be happy chance are much higher that way than constantly worrying about finding a girl    finding a girlfriend is just more luck than anything else
  is not that im genuinely expecting to find the love of my life or true happiness with someone     i honestly just stay in my lane and get happy by doing things i enjoy video games/photoshop editing/ volunteer at dog shelters    i just get sad/disappointed from people raising my hopes and leading me on to just end up crushing me with something maybe i should just blow girls off and just be single
sometimes it doesnt suck so bad i would think if you had a girl that got paid to get some i would probably try to be her agent/pimp and not worry about doing it with other girls cause in the end likely her or maybe 1 or 2 others would be fucked and cuddled by me for a nice comfortable nights sleep before heading off to work or not the next day /shrug just saying if youve got the time money and options dont count it out just because a few kids will laugh at you god i hope the next generation is better then usplease
there are people in life who do things for a living they would rather not discuss in public a lot of times they struggle to find relationships because of it sometimes the work is a part time thing that turns into a longer term thing because there wasnt anyone else there for them but their coworkers or boss or employee who all have either a personal or financial reason for wanting to keep them around for some of them they would probably enjoy someone who has enough idle time to do things like involve themselves in other fictional worlds it provides a reason to have in jokes or intimate moments that other people will never be able to share they say it is chemistry and for most that is correct it is all about the way a person can make you feel sometimes they get out sooner rather then later depending on how you handle the situation if not who better to act as a wingman in outgoing situations also there is the fact that some people are secretive for the right reasons some for the wrong and just because someone gets paid to do something doesnt mean you havent been fooled in other relationships as far as what they do as a hobby or their other jobs as well my point is that if its late enough in life for you to look for people dont be that picky sometimes surprises can be pleasant even if the shock wasnt at first dont throw it away or return it just yet
for some women late in life might depend on their dependencies could be as early as 15 or 22 or 32 that depends on the situation usually more then anything some of those young girls either cant or dont want to get out of their situation because well nobody is their to show them a way out or take their idiot selfs out of the situation by force if they are too young who cares if you get screwed over it your still a badass for doing it some people are expecting pure virgins or  well its frikkin 2018 pre post for some apocalypse if your over the age of 19 the likely hood of that happening grows slimmer by the day usually heh
how do you deal with a psychotic roommate    he complains a lot about dishes not being done but is himself the only one who leaves dishes in the sink to prove this i did every dish in the sink a week ago for the next week i ate nothing but cup noodles and microwave ramen with plastic forks i didnt use a single dish and the sink filled up    earlier today he wrote directly on the front of our refrigerator learn to do your own dishes or move the fuck out i went to wash it off and its in permanent marker    id rather not try confronting this guy directly because hes a grumpy motherfucker and a junkie no telling what hed do    what do i do to get him out of here
lmao dude that sounds like ocd on roids in a nutshell
move out or just stand up for yourself mate but fuck thats funny
  no definitely confront him but first put every item thats in the sink in individual gallon ziplock bags and number them then have a plastic vial and swab while wearing rubber gloves insist that you will be sending every dish to have a dna test done    i see your crazy and raise you insane
  yeah chase him around asking for his sample
any questions for an actual person thats about to end it all
  whats the method youre going to use
how long has it been since you had dinner with your parents
what do you think awaits you in the hereafter annon
  why do you wanna do it man   life has 50 shitty moments 50 happy moments if all what you have been going through recently is shit then rejoice a bunch of happiness coming your way lucky you
  not op but im also considering ending it all soon what youre saying is patently false there is never a guarantee that life will get better
  there is never a guarantee that it wont get worse but by ending your life the only thing youre doing is you are making sure that it wont get any better does that make sense sorry my english is bad  how old are you
  kekd hard  i can imagine norm macdonald reading out that shit
  dont die life gets better happy  dont die life gets worse/stays same suffer  die life would have gotten better dont care lol  die life would have gotten worse/stayed same dont care lol    statistically dying is the best way to end suffering
  but the happiness is so worth it once you have it there are always more options you just have to try
  do it then cunt and stop fucking wasting our time on here
i need some honest advice right here people    i have been seeing this girl for about four weeks now things are always great we get along so well laugh all the time the sex is fucking insane and it just feels right she is kind of messed up in her head always being really silly but i kind of love it  thing is when we started seeing each other she was in a relationship and kind of still is she is relatively young and i am the second man she has slept with  she told her boyfriend that she was at my place and that we cuddled and kissed we had fucked about three times when she told him that he then decided to break up with her  she tells me she wants him back and that she wants to try to make it all work still she will hang out with me about three or four times a week and fuck her body is out of this world when she has clothes on she doesnt really look like such a hotty but once shes undressed i get a fucking hardon just by looking at her  since she still isnt really done with her boyfriend every time we have sex she will stop and start crying im very empathetic and will stop as well last time she pushed me away turned away from me and started crying but i just shoved my dick in her and continued fucking her gently after two minutes or so it felt wrong so i stopped we start talking and cuddling and after like an hour we are fucking again  still no cumming for me during sex once she let me masturbate to her and i tricked her into finishing me off    her boyfriend seems like an 80 iq person to me and she tends to talk shit about him with me laughing about me and stuff sending me screenshots of their conversation but still after a beautiful evening she will tell me she wants to try to make thing work with him it kind of frustrates confuses and annoys me by now from the things she told me he seems to be a really bad boyfriend so im aiming at being funny conversational and dominant in bed
  if she is cucking her current boyfriend nothing will stop her from cucking you as well in due time do not have relationships with unfaithful women who cant settle on a lover
  she knows she has you with her body you are her slave now
  about him and stuff  screenshots of their conversations    i feel like im really really falling for her i have never had such feelings in my entire life she is gorgeous but not perfect im even imaging marrying her everything fits together so perfectly and i know she loves it aswell but something is tearing her apart    one major turn down is that she has contact to a lot of dudes like maybe five or something via text in her head its nothing but conversation but a lot of people including me really dont like that shit    so i need to know what you think about the situation im pretty certain her boyfriend will not want to come back together with her but should i give her the time to get it sorted out will she tend to cheat on me as well in case we get together or should i just keep pushing and pushing and fucking her every second day any general input    thank you very much my boys
  she is 17 and it was her first boyfriend isnt it an option that she just slipped into it because she really liked me      she told me my dick was twice the size of her boyfriend i think i am the one in control  but yeah i kinda drive her around a lot do you think i should not act like a good boyfriend but like an ignorant asshole instead
  this situation is fucked up you can dream all you want you should still be able to walk away if this situation doesnt fit you    the only way a man make a woman his is by showing her how to behave tell her to fucking cut ties with her ex tell her shes yours or she can gtfo
  if she really liked you unequivocally she would have left her ex this girl will cheat on you
  well if she would i would break up with her wouldnt it still be great to try it      thank you i will think about doing that
  yeah while you worry about this that 80 iq guy is getting his dicked sucked if anything hes smarter than you
  no they havent even met in like almost two months
there are millions of guides out there but i want your tips anons   im 23 she is 22 things are going amazing between us and i think she is ready for us to take it next level  i dont think she is a virgin i didnt bring that up yet but i will tell her that i am one   anyway what would you have changed first time doing it  will i suck really bad even if i watch some amateur/real porn and shit  good positions   should i shave my pen15 and my balls all the way or just trim them   and of course tips to make her feel good
  will i suck really bad even if i watch some amateur/real porn and shit  yes ignore everythingyou think porn taught you  good positions   cowgirl is supreme  should i shave my pen15 and my balls all the way or just trim them   shave your balls and your dick itself the rest us a matter of personal taste  and of course tips to make her feel good  real sex is 80 foreplay communicate touch her tiddies
you should never start a sentence with the word and
  not true by the way
  right here talk to her the best catchall tip i can give is literally to just touch her all over with various pressures and intensities and get her feedback i had one girlfriend who would physically recoil if i did anything but softly embrace my current girlfriend bless her heart will let me practically draw on her and will do so on me with nails biting all that good fun stuff the irony first girl had whipped around the block by the time she got me but my girlfriend and i are each the others second sexual partner    you have g o t to talk to the girl even if you take some guidelines shes got final say and shell be the best source on what she likes how where and when
  ignore everything you think porn taught you  everyone says this but why if i watch some kind of amateur scene that is not primarily for entertainment but just for naughtiness wont that resemble sex        oh was just about to say that english isnt my first language anyway thanks for the tip i guess       like if its vanilla stuff i can do it then ask her if she likes it but when its kinky stuff like a slap on the butt should i ask her first lol or just go with light spank and see how she reacts   spanking was just the first thing that came to mind  what are examples of talking to her like how when
  some kind of amateur scene that is not primarily for entertainment but just for naughtiness  it is not that its for entertainment
  when its kinky stuff should i ask her first  yes also dont bother trying to get into kinky shit the first time odds are you wont even have time for that
  starting with light touch/play and dialing up intensity slowly is good these are also good discussions to have prior to sex if either of you can just shoot the shit on sex its also a good idea to try something out and ask if they liked it afterward    no matter what you do the right idea is to get her feedback on it if you wanted to play with spanking for instance just give her some light smacks and tease at it see her reaction to the spanking and the prospect of more and harder spanking
  i can imagine asking her how does this feel you like this should i stop can get annoying am i wrong should i relay more on her reactions rather than these questions
  dont ever ask this kind of questions you have to catch the cue
  well everyone has been saying communication is the key im so confused now _
  fap first so you dont bust as soon as you get in her missionary or her on top are both good ask her what she likes
move your pelvis in circles in and out can get boring
  how many times did you do you guys do it on your first time how many condoms should i have on me   no lube is necessary right
    how many times did you guys do it on your first time  just once but theres been days we fuck like 3 times or more  how many condoms should i have on me  bring two or three youll only need one but better be over prepared  no lube is necessary right  lube shouldnt be necessary but again bring it all girls are different some get very wet others not so much just buy a cheap water based lube from walmart
    bumping this question  dont ever ask this kind of questions do you like that you have to catch the cue  well everyone has been saying communication is the key im so confused now _
  yes ask her all those questions but dont ask in a way that make her think that you dont know what youre doingask her in a seductive voice tone
    bumping this  just be seductive about it also after sex talk about it ask what parts she liked which ones she didnt
  o well im a girl so only once because i was bleeding all over after the first time but if shes not a virgin you wont have to worry about it you can go as many times as you and her feel upto it use a new condom each time and wipe off in between to make sure you dont actually get sperm in her dont stress out over this to much youll have fun just talk with her if she knows its your first time and you have a good relationship already shell be understanding if you ask her questions i would bring at least 3 or 4 condoms even if you dont use them all items good to be prepared
if shes a virgin marry her     marrying your virgin waifu is the most sexy thing you can do for the first time   heehehe    no seriously
anyway what would you have changed first time doing it  nothing really maybe played some music in the background   will i suck really bad even if i watch some amateur/real porn and shit  you wont if shes opened up to you and vice versa and she understands you youll be ok dont listen to porn make sure you remember that the vagina is on the bottom feel it out when youre down there with your member use it to play with her clit a bit  good positions   dont try anything except missionary and her on top at first then explore trying other things together through communication  should i shave my pen15 and my balls all the way or just trim them   trim them  and of course tips to make her feel good  alternate between going fast and slow if you have been beating your meat to porn for years youll likely last long which is good play with her clit a lot during its your best friend eat her out and finger her
    thats what i thought thanks
  i am not sure if she is a virgin or not i didnt tell her i am a virgin but she may sense it idk but i want to tell her i feel like it will make sense to tell her at the heat of the moment right as we start but if the conversation is brought up naturally any other time i wont lie or anything   thats the best course of action right      100 of the replies are recommending missionary and cowgirl interesting   any tips for eating a girl out/fingering her
   any tips for eating her out/ fingering her  use your whole tongue dont use the tip of your tongue lick her clit like a ice cream cone
  yah i would definitely tell her before you guess do it you dont have to make it a huge point or anything just that way she knows and will be understanding if you ask her questions about what she likes you definitely definitely need to find out if she is a virgin tho sex is somewhat painful for girls the first time and if she is youll want to go really slowly and tell her to let you know if she needs you to stop or hold still for a second or anything like that also if shes a virgin put a towel on the bed because when you pop her cherry she will bleed some
  well im sure she will open up once i tell her that its my first time i dont imagine her withholding that kind of information and its kinda weird to ask   babe this is my first time just talk to me and let me know if i am doing something wrong or uncomfortable have you done this before     idk the last question feel out of place and i think she will just share her thoughts if she wants to let me know /
  well if i last enough for it to be boring i will call it a success anon
  you should feel comfortable enough to ask if its not mentioned if your to uncomfortable to even talk about it openly with her then your probably not ready to have sex in the first place you a grown man its nothing to be squeamish about just have a discussion with her she might be weirded out if you spring it on her at the last second that your a virgin you should try to talk with her about it
not op but how would i go about stds and stuff like that if i didnt want to use a condom
  how would i go about stds and stuff like that if i didnt want to use a condom  if you plan on not using them you should also plan on getting stds if you go a time or two without then you should normally be good but its entirely dependent on who you are fucking and how well you trust them
  were both virgins
  doesnt matter you dont know her medical situation and she doesnt know yours you probably arent going to get syphilis or hiv or anything like that but you can still fuck this up
  should probably get myself tested beforehand shouldnt i is there any kind of diy test or do i need to go to a doctor
  there might be home tests but nothing diy that is worthwhile if condoms are that repulsive to you i would say just go raw worst case scenario is you ruin your dick or get her pregnant no big deal
  no big deal  planning on marrying her desu so it kinda is plus shes literally a legal loli and i dont think she could actually have a safe pregnancy she also has depression so i think getting an abortion could be devastating on her idk how high the odds are here but id rather not risk anything if possible
  yeah he was being sarcastic you fucking weirdo how old are you put a fucking condom on retard
  19 her 22 i since its gonna be our first time we wanted to do without condom
  bro its your first time it will feel great regardless dont be fucking stupid youre 22 how are you that dumb
  i mean one needs to be very unlucky for something to happen no
dont take care of myself because of depression  depressed because i dont take care of myself  how do i get out of this cycle
therapy or medication works for some people you can do that or try to help yourself by working out or self care but i suggest the science way
baby steps write down a goal and aim for that
my girlfriend of over a year and half has been very mad with me for reference im 22 shes 20   i occasionally hang out with my ex from sophomore year of hs because were still friends we broke up just because we had no feelings for eachother gf found out i didnt realize it was a problem and now shes giving me the me or her ultimatum     what do
  break up with her thats my soild advice
  why though i just cant put the reason why into words
  in your situation its not a bad thing because it was just a hs relationship and you didnt have feelings left for her but you have fucked up by not telling your girlfriend thats usually a big red flag and youre lucky she hasnt left you immideately   talk to her explain how it is tell her that you fucked up and apologize if she doesnt understand leave it to her to actually leave you if she does it shows that she doesnt care about you but just wants to control your life
  she found out because i told her i was going to the most recent time i know i messed up and i was trying to explain everything to her but she was having none of it no matter how much i apologized
  well what do you think m8 its your relationship i can see how shed been upset especially if youve been hanging out with this girl 1 on 1 but i also think the ultimatum was an annoying way for her to handle it and if you start taking orders from your girlfriend now she will treat you like a doormat youre 22 you dont really need to invite someone into your life just to boss you around    if you dont want to break up maybe you could work out an arrangement where you dont cut your ex out of your life and stop being friends with her but you dont hang out alone with her 1 on 1 but if your girlfriend wont be reasonable and have a conversation about it then call her bluff
  yeah pretty much this
i would say of course you are a million times more important to me than her and i would happily never see her again now i know it is upsetting you however i dont do ultimatums theyre not part of a healthy relationship if you had just spoken to me about your feelings that would have been great and we could have dealt with it like adults but seems youre more interested in having a hissy fit and being a child so its best that we break up
  lol this is terrible advice it will not go over well at all its not coming from the right place anon has never talked to a girl confirmed
  im actually a married mother of 2 i just cant stand ultimatums
lol brb whats the big deal just gonna hang with my ex
  i cant stand them either      i told her i wont hang out with her anymore and that i wont start conversation with my ex my girlfriend just wants me to block her and all communication       im 22 and i dated her my sophomore year of high school we were just kids and shes in a commited relationship now
  if your girlfriend makes you choose between her or your friend always choose your friend not only did you just lose a friend but you just let your girlfriend know that she has dominion over who you interact with
i need legal help    live in las vegas nv    tried to take my gfs cousins funko pop collection as a gag gift for christmas  her and her other cousins went along with it  dudes dad finds out  dudes dad makes us return it all and has us on camera walking up his driveway handing it to him  dudes dad wants to file a police report that we stole a bunch of his 25 year old sons toys  cousins rat on me cuz im not necessarily part of the family    what do i do can he make a report with nothing missing i did not have intent to sell/keep these items was going to just rewrap them as a gift cuz her cousins an asshole and doesnt even live there anymore ty

  go to him by yourself and apologize for doing something stupid your best legal advice isnt legal advice at all
what are some healithier beneficial hobbies/addictions that i can replace gaming with i feel like im wasting my life here and i want to improve
  the gym
the gym or pick up an instrument guitar is pretty easy and its fun some kind of outdoors activity will do you some good too hiking or biking or something cooking can be fun too as can baking woodshop aint half bad either or pick up a shitty car/motorcycle and make a project out of it fix it up and all that can either sell it or use it afterwards
yellow im an accounting major and i just received and offer from a solid firm the problem is that i lied on the application that i wasnt fired from walmart about a year ago i did put that i left and since then i got another job i was wondering if the background check would be able to find out that i was actually fired and more horribly the actual reason should i be worried
  they will never know
  also id like to add that there was a background check for the job after walmart which i also lied on but it was for sears so maybe they have shitty background checks i think im tripping because im a poorfag
  are you the guy who was fired for cumming in a cake
  received and offer from a solid firm  then they dont care about your employment history also stop telling people about your employment history also learn the difference between an and and they are for different things
  unless the walmart firing involved major theft or fraud they wouldnt care even if they did somehow find out
  just go with it op you already lied only thing worse than a liar is someone that cant keep their lies in order  also people like to land good jobs all the time if its bugging you that you lied than learn your lesson and dont lie next time but dont flip flop on this one especially since its good for you and doesnt really matter
  they will never know youre safe the only way they have to know is social media purge it and if they have a personal connection with someone there
  if you cant hold down a job at walmart or sears i doubt you can hold one down at a firm so you might as well decline their offer
  oh my god u people are so smart thanks
companies usually only confirm a former employees dates of employment and nothing else to be safe from lawsuits
its a fucking grocery slave job they wont give a shit even if they do find out you were fired
  the background check it to make sure you didnt have an arrest for embezzlement
24yo  in the military cause no job not us  had to stop studying to pay bills  rough time at work  probably fired in 2 years    dont know what to do dont know what i like dont really feel like i have energy right now im kind of drained the whole time
  i would give so much shit to that stupid kid for wasting a perfectly good pizza  god i hate children
  this picture is upsetting
  i highly doubt the kid wanted to drop it why else would they be crying
ive been trying to be productive and do school work all day but its so hard when i cant think of anything else besides death im in too much of a weak mental state to do my work i just dont have the motivation or emotion to do anything right now     what should i do anonkun what hobbies/coping methods do you do when youre like this to try and make you smile or keep going
  playing video games with friends is fun for me or going out with them i guess when i am with them i am having a lot of fun and dont feels sad
well anon to do work i believe setting up a reward system that encourages you to work hard so you can get a satisfaction such as going out with your friends or playing videogames by the end of the week/day basically kind of like what dog owners do to train doggos to do certain tricks and such gotta trick the brain man     sorry if this comes as annoying or unpleasant dont answer if you dont want to but  do you know why youre sad im just trying to see if people have similar experiences as mine maybe the way i solved my personal probles could help you too
  you should fail your classes drop out not get a job end up on the street see how miserable it is then work your way back to uni with an understanding of the consequences of being a depressed little shit who doesnt wanna do anything under your belt
hello /adv/    i met a girl at my local library a month ago ive never been in a relationship before im 26 btw im very excited because i really thought id be forever alone lol so back to the topic everything was going fine until a few days ago she had to leave the country because her family lives elsewhere and she will pass holidays with them shell be back the next year    so weve been texting each other these past few days but ive noticed that our interactions are slowly becoming less and less as the days go by i notice that itll be kinda hard to try and keep mutual interest by the end of the month      im a bit sad about this because i thought i had finally met an amazing girl but we are not a couple yet and this 1 month that shell be not here i feel this will die out      has anyone been in a similar position before how did it turn out      i dont think theres much i can do about it to be honest so i guess im kinda venting right now
you asked her out right  if not do it when she comes back
i was in a ldr with a swede while i lived in la     it can work you should really talk everyday not text but actual voice remind yourself that theres a human on the other side and if you guys are serious then always have a date planned when youre going to see each other again next that was the most important part for me     something else we did  and know this was back when snapchat was brand new we sent snaps to each other every day just random stuff and it felt nice like you were a part of her life
    weve already been dating for 1 month before she left so yes weve already gone on quite a few dates by now the thing is i feel distance is really bringing everything down
    yeah it used to be like this until a few days ago we stopped texting each other and i hate to be the one to text first should i just keep texting her all the time or just let it be and see what she does about it
so my sister might have cancer has two lumps in pelvic area and breast area     she is hysterical right now no results from doctors yet she has been noticing symptoms for months and theyve recently got more severe accompanied with the lumps she is afraid she is about to die     how do i comfort her ive tried a few things so far but she still seems quite affected     im a guy btw if that means anything
just be there for her anon
    remind her that not all lumps are malignant or aggressive and it might be something less severe remind her that cancer treatment today has a decent survival rate especially if shes otherwise healthy remind her that you will support her through whatever treatment she needs and will be there for her remind her that freaking out before proper diagnosis wont help any and all you can do now is wait until you know more
look into the keto diet it starves and shrinks tumors google the shit out of it
    this anon     dont give false hope but honesty this isnt 1980 where cancer was a death sentence medicine has progressed a lot and there are a lot of effective treatments likewise a lot of lumps are non malignant     my roommate is currently in remission and basically kept drinking most days hed honestly feel worse from the benders hed have than the chemo
  feel around to see if you find the lumps
  do not tell her that it is probably nothing right now the best thing for her is to prepare for the possibility of it being cancer and the possibility of it being bad the possibility of her dying much sooner than expected it is healthy to face your own mortality it will not damage her sooner or later she will process it and be different for it do not tell her not to worry let her process it and face it
  i had a lump right by my crotch so i talked to my dermatologist and she said they were just inflamed lymph nodes and i needed to wash my privates more but it was basically harmless i would still see a doctor if i were you though op
ive always had pretty low self esteem because of emotional abuse as a child been divorced and remarried now have three kids     i just installed tinder for an experiment and i am getting way more matches from very attractive women than i would have imagined    is this a fucking ruse iust have a virus ony phone
  tinder baits you hard in the beginning puts you on ultra high visibility keep your expectations low until you actually meet with one of these girls until you meet them you will encounter some combination of ghosting being stood up girls only looking for attention/confidence boost after a few days your profile will be at a normal visibility and you will match far less frequently unless you have great photos so yeah stay modest and keep expectations low the app wants you to feel good using it such that you continue to do so
dont read too much into it op    a it is matching what you put down and what they put down unless you put dealing with my low self esteem and divorce under your interests the site isnt taking that into account the website just sees 2 people who like x and raise the match a bit     b those women are literally receiving 100s of messages every week    c tinder is where people go to hook up although some real relationships do come from there most people just want a quick lay if that is what you are after then by all means go for it but if you want a real relationship you are better off using another site
from what i understand about this kink/perversion everyone has one just like a vice even if it seems really boring like doggy or missionary from a psychological perspective the roles are usually determined by things like power or influence the dominator type usually grew up with little power or choice in their life the dominated will usually be someone with heavy burdens of responsibility when people are able to be intimate with each other they find their inhibitions loosened and feel more free to explore things they might not have otherwise if there is trust with the partner you can get them to agree to it the trust is usually related to you not being a selfish lover btw unless your kink is that kind of behavior too many think nowadays that is how sex is done so they havent actually explored others its just what they know like having only a few beers to choose from they havent tasted their favorite yet so this can hurt more then help most partners it is also unfortunate for a lot of women in positions of power sex has become nowadays far more about comfort and relaxation then what it used to be survival its become far more enjoyable because of that and weve taken huge advantage of that to our detriment weve neglected a lot of important things in our societys i say unfortunate for them because its hard enough to get to the top without seeming submissive they fear that if they were to let it be known that during certain moments of their lives they might prefer for other people to take the wheel/control that may never get that wheel back stupid planet cant even do the 1 thing destroying yourselves right got to go and make people feel uncomfortable just for taking a shower and shit i bet probably have tons of hidden cameras and jokes in peoples bathrooms or public washing places just to jack off to or make fun of them god i hate people
anyone got honest ideas how to design my new apartment its very small around 27sqm in total  cant really decide what and where to put stuff in my bed/livingroom
  get yourself one of these for the living room/ bedroom to divide up the room also looking up small bedroom designs might help
  i think its not really a living room basically id go nuts being in there with someone unless i was from nyc or hong kong    you could probably invite someone over for conversation and sex but actually living together is uh a tenuous prospect maybe someone you can share a bed with like a girlfriend or a child could stand it but im not sure
  as for yourself you could try  wallmounted tv  minimalist entertainment console  very luxury futon  murphy bed  standard desk  minimalist desk chair  tall storage cabinet and shelves  foldout table and chairs specifically for tiny apartments not the kind for entertainment expos or whatever
  will take that into consideration but the room might be too small for that      im going to be living alone in this apartment until i get a job after university not the social guy anyway might have a friend over but nothing more      will look out for these thanks
do girls really care about dick size do most girls just lie to insecure guys or do most really dont yes i am a young male virgin
why are there so many of these threads all of the sudden
im a guy with a skinny 45 inch dick i had one gf from 1722 and since we broke up two months ago i tried to learn how to date/seduce ive dated eight women in two months and slept with four of them so far     its entirely irrelevant unless youre an extreme outlier micropenis apparently its super common for men to be afraid of women seeing their flaccid penis due to the size thing best thing i can tell you and definitely the best advice is to just rock it my dick flaccid is legit like 15 inches my dick hard is like 45 dont talk about size dont tell ladies youre small if you go soft dont apologize fake it until you make it a strong confident stable man is not going to be anxious about his penis size     i like to get the gal turned on with lots of teasing and foreplay then go down on her until she orgasms then we do sex in whatever position i want and its a good experience for everyone they get to orgasm then we get to have sex which they dont usually orgasm from i orgasm its a good time all four women continued to come back to me none of them commented on my dick at all currently still sleeping with all four     im no sex master or anything two of the four girls i actually went soft and couldnt penetrate missionary so i had them ride me instead still called me amazing still interested still chasing me     just pretend like you arent insecure at a if you are its gonna be fine
  same here my dick is about 4 inches and is perched above my balls when flaccid truth is ive o ly ever been with three girls but i want you to take these three facts away  1 ive made all cum with my tongue and 2 with my dick  2 all consider my sex to be amazing 2 if which say im the best theyve ever had   3 all three gave had bigger   im not saying there arnt women wholl not like ur size or that women might not prefer something bigger im telling you with skill and confidence you have a lot more going for you than u think  ps im often depressed about the size of my dick but i keep on striving every orgasm quells my sadness a little more
how many girls go after midgets and dwarves how often do you see a six foot tall woman with a five foot tall man why arent dildos two inches long stick a finger up your ass now stick a dildo up your ass the dildo feels better     holy fucking shit its called reality you dumb fucks people dont find people with down syndrome or weak ass dudes to reproduce with people want the best mate  the population as a whole grows stronger over time all women without filters gossip about dick size they all talk down on tiny dicks and thats used to keep that dude down forever seriously if you have a small dick a circle of people will make fun of it forever this isnt like haha your 1999 car sucks this is reality the sooner everyone admits the truth the sooner we can move on if you are under six feet you shouldnt be having sex your offspring are not going to compete well and will be bullied they will also have zero confidence there are retarded fuckiny deadbeats with big dicks and women beg for them if you have never had a women beg for you its because you arent seen as a good partner you will know by probably even early puberty if there is no female interest its because your body isnt one people want your only hope is making money and finding a gold digger that will still be delusion though blame the allies hitler was right all along eugenics is the answer
  if a girl fucks you then disposes of you its because she didnt enjoy the sex if you were any good and not just temporary validation she would be begging for more
girl here i was actually thinking about this recently if a girl says size matters they are either a fucking cave down there or they just dont know any better i have been with 4 guys that happened to have different dicks only one of them had a curvy dick the rest were either straight pretty long big head or thin youd say the longest ones were the best but they were actually the worst it hurts its painful blowjobs are impossible sex is just not enjoyable having a head too big is just kinda ugly the curvy one still thick length above average i think is just incredibly perfect and it makes me feel better than doing it on my ownz you try telling a man that his shorter dick even though its still above average makes you feel better though i think what matters for real is the thickness and the curve dildos arent just fucking straight sticks for a reason
unless you have a microdick then probably not dick size isnt as obvious to girls and theyre not actually geniuses who can make a measurement from inspecting your dick unless theyre whores who fetishize it to the point of having rulers around
  femanom remember anon huge cock hurts women irl so being too big is shitty being too skinny ofc isnt great and being 4 in or lower is shitty but 5 it 6 inches is imo ideal all pussies vary and im 5ft even and not uhhh too deep so i dont like huge guys at all my current nd is maybe 55 6 at the most and hes perfect length at his deepest thrust his tip hits my cervix and it feels good but if he were any bigger than its just be painful think of it like this the cervix is a steel door that likes to be knocked on big dicks are battering rams ofc girth matters too now do i mean 4 fingers width across fuck now big ouchies pussies stretch which feels good yes but have you heard of ripping and tearing big ouchies its why you go slow at first hes about 3 fingers across and it took a good 2 weeks of sex twice a day to adjust to his size hes perfect imo and to him he says hes small and not proud of his cock at all its all about perspective
in my experience about 20 of girls really care a whole lot and the rest hardly care at all
girls who really discuss that in depth are no different from guys who judge women based on what good lays they are    i know 4chan turns you into a misanthrope but dont be a naive parroting misanthrope there are plenty of people out there that still see it as indecent to judge other people in such ways if you think im full of shit well you have some shitty friends
i never bought any of that size matters crap until my junior year in college i lived in the dorms with two roommates david and john david was a pretty ordinary looking guy kinda quiet  but john was tall lean muscular and according to him anyway was hung like a bull he used to joke about it a lot  even around my girlfriend amy amy was a sophomore and was petite shy and somewhat quiet i didnt like it when john would make his big dick comments and jokes around amy but she told me she didnt pay any attention to him and truth be told she really couldnt stand john    i have a 55 dick and with amy being so petite it always seemed to do the trick i was only the third guy shed ever been with and only her second boyfriend  maybe my guard was just down but who knows    anyway one friday night amy and i were hanging out in my dorm room drinking smoking some weed and watching tv david and john had both gone home for the weekend  or so we thought at about 1am amy and i were pretty toasted by then john walked in hed ended up hanging out with some of his friends off campus and had decided to just drive home in the morning since his parents only lived about an hour and a half away    he could see that amy and i were both pretty hammered he grabbed a beer and sat down and we smoked somem more weed with him amy was pretty drunk and started giving john  john seemed to get a kick out of it and i could see him kinda flirting with amy then i noticed and hoped that amy wouldnt that john wasnt wearing any underwear    but amy started massaging my dick through my jeans and being so ed up i just laid my head back and enjoyed it  i couldnt believe she was doing that right in front of john i heard john get up to pass amy the joint we were smoking and i heard her gasp long and deep and she suddenly stopped stroking my dick
  nice essay bud
size only matters if you have a micropenis or a dick like an arizona green tea can    i promise that whether or not you eat pussy is gonna be her biggest worry/deal breaker
  well that story went nowhere
  i opened my eyes and saw john standing righ tin front of amy with a huge ing bulge in his pants  just inches from her face the room was so quiet you could have heard a pin drop    he just stood there and i could feel her hand tremble and hear her breathing quicken when she slowly looked up at him almost in awe and respect i could feel my heart start to pound in my chest then she softly whispered ohhhhhhhhhhh as she gingerly reached up to brush her finger tips across that massive knot in his pants when she touched it it throbbed   i could see it throb thorugh his pants  amy just gasped again and looked up at him    what john asked her and just kinda laughed amy did not laugh instead she softly asked can i see it john stopped laughing looked at her very seriously and told her to take it out amy never even hesitated  or looked back at me for an ok  just just obeyed him and began to open his jeans i coudl see her nipples rock hard under her tshirt and i could tell she was practically panting    she opened his jeans and his big thick dick just fell outand he had not been kidding that cock was strong thick heavy and muscular the head was a big purple mushroom that sat on top of the thickest shaft id ever seen he was semihard and was huge compared to me amy just gasped and kept whispering ohmygodohmygodohmygod when she wrapped her hand around it her brow just knotted in disbelief and she almost laughed at how thick he was  her fingers couldnt even touch    john just stood there watching my girlfriend worship his magnificent cock slowly shaking her head in disbelief she twofisted him  one hand next to the otherand there was still a few inches left  and he was getting rock hard too    amy smiled and patted the couch next to her and john sat down his cock standing straight up honestly he had to be almost 10 judging from the size of amys hand i opened my pants and took my own cock out

i sometimes feel like i dont have enough girth for my length hearing how girth is more important than length all the time is giving me a complex about it
le huge dicks hurt meme  it might hurt you but you love it you lieing little bitches will kill for a good beating of your pussy once you grow up    the reason they say tiny dicks are good or perfect its because they choosed its owner imagine them saying  yeaaa i love muh boifriend and hes just purrfect but his dick is too smol  they never say that that means they choosed like shit which they do 99 of time because women are retarded and the roles are switched     ask women who was woed by men who weas seduced like a proper woman they will love the dick of their boyfriend and not bullshit how it hurts them    fuck stupi little lieing bitches seriously i feel sorry for guys eating up their bullshit and then face reality
  i think youre in the wrong thread youre looking for the do girls really care about functional illiteracy thread
not really as long as youre able to hit the right spots youre golden although some women aesthetically prefer bigger dicks and feeling more full    im a chick if that helps
  from all the porn ive watched some girls can take a 8 inch dick to the hilt others cant from personal experience with my average 65 inches give or take dick same thing some will complain about it being too deep especially doggy or legs above head others will let me pound away and even back up on it to the balls and beg for more    girth definitely gonna be painful and cause some stretching or even tearing if youre more than 7 inches in circumference as well ffs my wrists are 7 inches around
i care more about how hard and fast he can fuck sex is a full body experience at least it should be too much focus on the penis itself i think detracts from the experience
  fake it till you make it  this first time with my longestterm gf i was super nervous and insecure i was only rocking a semi boner and i had to do the ol feed it in and hope it gets 100 hard when i start pumping her trick and it still never got all the way there she fucking loved it and we only broke up because i tried to kill myself at my parents house while she was on her way over she still fucked me after that as a booty call for a couple years every few months too     oh and i also pointed out that i was having trouble that first time and she legit said she didnt notice/didnt care and enjoyed herself weird
  girth definitely gonna be painful and cause some stretching or even tearing if youre more than 7 inches in circumference as well ffs my wrists are 7 inches around    hardly anyone is that thick most guys are worried about being too thin im 55 around and thats my biggest anxiety
    55 inches is average dude even bigger guys usually top out around 6inches girth if research is to be taken seriously youre working with what almost every other guy is working with in the dick department if thats the case which means you should probably focus on something else in your life who cares how big it is if she cums she cums
  you type like a schizophrenic
  im aware and that hasnt happened
  the size of the toll matters far less than the skill with which it is employed
how do i keep a relationship together when im extremely insecure and needy
  you dont  these traits are universally unattractive
  you just gotta live op get out there a do stuff youll find yourself and stop being such a pain to be around sometimes its really just a you thing
  but i have a gf 2 actually because im afraid of losing my first gf and being alone again
    copious amounts of honesty and communication
  you are a garbage person i hope they both dump your ass asap and youll be alone forever
guidelines  before you post check the faq  try to keep questions concise use paragraph breaks  edition    faq  what do girls/guys think about any trait such as looks physical or personality traits virginity penis traits or lack of dating experience  do most/any girls/guys like an insecurity over the above  there is no one answer preferences differ and worrying about some complex only ever makes things worse in fact worries like complexes are very often the real problem    im shy and afraid of people/rejection  get over it by practicing and exposing yourself to it bit by bit step by step you cant rely on some magic moment or activity to instantly change you    i like someone what do i do  how can i tell if someone likes me  ask them out signs of attraction are basically meaningless    where do i meet people for dating/friendship  anywhere outside or online above all leave your comfort zone    someone did something insignificant what does it mean  nothing significant youre overthinking it    xyz happened interpret this for me  were not in their head we dont know    someone has made it super clear theyre no longer interested in me do i have a chance  no    where do i go on a first or subsequent date  pick one or more of the following lunch dinner drinks ice cream froyo movies zoo aquarium museum gallery park activity in your city    asshole questions  theres no point in trying with you guys
i will kick this off   i complement my gf all the time but she doesnt compliment me should i stop complementing her  we have been together for a month and it may seem like im needy right  dont tell me to talk to her about it best case scenario she understands yet every time she compliments me itwont feel genuine
  dont tell me to talk to her about it  so then why did you even post
  telling her about it is bad like i explained every time she compliments me it wont feel genuine and i wont feel good about it     i want to know if i should i stop complementing her or no
  you should stop having a relationship if you cant communicate
goddamnit i need to know is 45 in enough im not girthy either
  dude please comprehend its not about if i can tell her about it or not she will probably understand and change the way she acts but that is the problem every time she tells me i look nice in a shirt or something i will remember that i told her to tell me that and wont feel right
  dude i have a problem with how my girlfriend acts if i tell her how it effects me and she acts accordingly it will be all fake and definitely not because she loves me  stop posting
  its enough but you wont wow anybody with it  compensate in other areas
  the fact that she doesnt give you compliments doesnt mean that she doesnt find you attractive maybe she just doesnt know that youd like to get compliments from her because guys in general dont seem to want them or at least act like they dont want them whats wrong with communicating your desires
  some people just arent good at complimenting i myself may love a person to bits but feel awkward and unsure voicing it so i just show them my affection physically
  i just want her compliment to come from heart not just because i asked for them       i see that makes sense
why do women flirt if they are gonna get mad when the guy asks her out i mean why flirt if they dont want to get asked out what do they expect
  what do they expect  definitely not someone like you
  then why do they flirth with me your answer doesnt make sense
  the real question is do they really flirt with you or do you just misinterpret their actions
  idk how can i tell if they are truly flirting these are girls that laugh out loud at my jokes even if they are unfunny touch my arms hug me invited me to stuff wanted to go to stuff just because i was going pointed out stuff we had in common
  likely this   but some girls are naturally very flirty and its not true flirting if shes like that with everyone
  fine line between being nice and flirting
  not really that fine  does it with everyone  being nice  does it with you  flirting
  then why do they flirth with me  have you ever thought that maybe theyre not flirting with you and are just touchy like that
im confused by my boyfriends hypocrisy we play video games together and i sometimes get jealous when he casually flirts or says things like ty bae and love u bb to other people on the team especially if theyre obviously girls who are trying to flirt with him he says hes obviously being sarcastic and that im ridiculous for being jealous of people online etc     but then if i ever say gj or 3 to someone its over he gets all sulky and jealous and will say things like gj to him only huh kk have fun jerking him off/sucking his dick     so hes allowed to flirt and praise other people while playing but im not allowed to do the same thing why the double standard
  this isnt even always true im just selective about who im nice to if i really like a guy im not going to flirt like youre describing im more likely to be sort of awkward or get shy when im normally not if anything
  i mean why flirt if they dont want to get asked out what do they expect    im a dude i flirt with random people all the time even dudes im a straight dude in a long term relationship i obviously have no intention on actually acting on any of it its just funny to drop a tease here and there or make exaggerations from time to time either because i know it will get a funny reaction or maybe i just feel like the other person could use a halfjoking overexaggerated compliment    by definition flirting is to   behave as though attracted to or trying to attract someone but for amusement rather than with serious intentions    even when its there flirting in and of itself does not signal interest    on top of that the other guys are probably right and youre probably reading the signals incorrectly people can be nice with out it being a flirt or a come on
  hell end up thinking you dont like him then
  so hes allowed to flirt and praise other people while playing but im not allowed to do the same thing why the double standard    hes immature    as the dude who just posted about being flirtatious with random people his personality sounds to run a little contrary to my own but if i think hard on it on some level if i put myself in my own shoes at some of my own worst when i was being selfconscious/selfcentered mess i can somewhat understand where hes coming from    hes just being insanely immature    jealousy is a fucking irrational as hell thing it can hit you in the most odd and unreasonable of ways even when you know you have absolutely no right to feel the way you do    and even when you can acknowledge that fact which most people never do its still fucking hard to break away from    odds are hes just being a jealous dumb ass who doesnt realize hes being one not much you can do except call him out on it and not take any of that shit really    you shouldnt amend your behavior in response to his dumbassery     dont coddle him call him out its on him to address his own behavior
  can i ask how you might act differently with a girl youre sincerely interested in or do you flirt the same way with everyone
will fucking thots help me get over the fact that i ruin all my relationships with girls i actually care for
  no
what do girls think about older guys who start college late  i try to be a bit more serious about lectures and dress more nice than most  its a bit eerie when they hug the greasy ugly fatso but wont even aknowledge i exist most of the time  and no i dont have any delusions of dating im 25 already with no experience so that ship has sailed but i would at least like some casual interaction
  hell end up thinking you dont like him then    youre applying your own standards and interpretations to a broad spectrum to people who arent you    personally when a girl acts shy or awkward around me i can tell theyre being shy or awkward both of those behaviors are pretty damn obvious    it does not make me assume they dislike me nor does it make me assume they like me both of those are pretty much separate things from liking or disliking someone      can i ask how you might act differently with a girl youre sincerely interested in or do you flirt the same way with everyone    to be honest this was a lesson i had to kind of learn the hard way im kind of an intense person and at some point i realized that in some people in certain situations i was being interpreted signalling a deeper interest than there actually was and actually crossing past that line that separates a flirtation from genuine interest    i basically had to learn to tone down the frequency of my jokes turn up the joking tone and change the content to stuff thats more generic and impersonal    when im truly interested the entire body language of it all basically changes eye contact is deeper flirtatious jokes are a little more teasing more intimate attention is just paid over all    i guess thats the key word intimate     i grew up fairly isolated and when i did interact with people i just didnt know how to not be intimate while interacting with them i paid too much attention to them made things too personal made it seem like i cared beyond what i actually did and it made people feel i was paying special attention past what i actually intended i had to learn to crank things down    if youre trying to figure out how to signal interest in a specific individual id guess youd have to do the opposite and learn to crank things up
  spare me your haha incel crap im not looking for a girlfriend im just trying not to punch a wall watching my little sister cling to some cocky prick who doesnt treat her right tell me what the fuck attracts women to distant condescending shitheads do you get off on being belittled
  id be overall less smooth and less likely to lay the flirting on thickly just because it can be harder to get it right when youre hung up on trying to get a girl to like you if youve got nothing invested in it then its super easy to be charming but the minute you start having to think about it and second guessing yourself it doesnt end up being nearly so flirty
  your sister just seems immature
  opposite for me  girl i like easy  girl i am indifferent to hard
should i ask her to hang out right now  seems rushed but im so bored and lonely
  should i ask her to hang out right now    dude here chipping in    no reason not to but if you are have something more concrete than  hey wanna hang    go actually pick something you actually want to do thats out and invite her to tag along    if shes not willing to do so go out anyway not like you got much else to do and who knows maybe youll socialize and meet someone cool     ps i say this as im about to go grab a drink and shoot some pool at a bar alone
  from what i observe from such relationships the men tend to be charming and cool but nice to her at first and once the girl gets attached then his real self comes out and he starts treating her like shit but because shes attached she will continue to cling onto the hope he will act good to her again and she will blame herself rather than see that he is the problem    thats what i observe from my other female friends in particular the ones with low selfesteem hell that even happened to me for a short while but luckily i could see beyond my infatuation and see his mind games and broke it off with him completely
  what kind of mind games are we talking about here you could be at fault too you know
what age do i need to move out by to get a girlfriend im 22 and really afraid that girls will hold it against me
51  45 penis  below average face  will someone be able to love me i dont want to be alone anymore
  well good thing i love to eat
  if you dont love you nobody else will
  below average face  unless youre downright fugly i really wouldnt worry about your face you may think your face is below average but i see girls with guys whose faces i think are pretty meh/ugly all the time on campus some girls may see your face totally differently from how you see yourself   about the penis perhaps you could find someone whos open to strapons
guys my boyfriend cries a little when he cums in me but not when he wears a condom he also hugs me tighter afterwards do any of you do the same or could you think why it happens
by all accounts i am  handsome  well spoken  genuine sweetheart  lift 56 days a week  how big of a silly am i for not taking advantage of this
  love its probably very overwhelming
  pretty silly  same thing here
  i dont do that but its my understanding that its fairly common among somewhat repressed guys
  thats really sweet then    repressed in what way hes quite vanilla and had only had sex a handful of times before getting with me but hes not a prude or anything
  did it she took an hour to said she already had plans  ah well another weekend completely alone
only thread that i saw that was kinda open ended    im fucked its my bday and debating buying some coke but i gotta be up in 8 hours to drive    what do
  sleep
do it  its so fun
  meant to 
  i want to really bad      but this is the sensible thing
im gonna ask this girl out shes been a good friend for like a year now i finally got my shit together and im gonna just do it     issue its finals season shes beyond stressed shes been venting to me she is actually very busy she has no time to hang out until break     do i wait before saying anything i want to talk to her in person its so frustrating now that i know im gonna ask her i just want my answer asap but i want to do it right and i want to respect her shes stressed i dont want to add to her pile
  youre already taking a huge risk by being friends for a year without any advances   wait until after finals but be prepared for any response
  would you want to think anything about a relationship if you were sweating bullets over exams shell probably be looking for some stress relief after exams are over ask her out to some drinks then im sure shed be thrilled
  she has shown interest and i know this can get messy its why i hesitated when she started showing interest a few weeks ago she has never been in a relationship before
either gender    i have developed a strong crush on a married woman whos at least twice my age to be clear i dont want to be a homewrecker and have no intention of acting on these feelings however this woman does martial arts with me and i see her regularly i think the crush is distracting me during the classes we have together its not that the physicality of practicing with her sexually arousing her presence and her eyes especially give me this crazy feeling that makes it hard to fully focus     does anyone have any advice to deal with this kind of impossible crush i havent been this smitten with someone in a while but i dont think dwelling on it would be healthy her friendship brings a lot of joy into my life
  either overcome your hormones or avoid her
  just dudes that were raised to feel guilty about jerking off and whatnot
  not exactly the same but i was in the reverse situation 40 yo married chick i knew from a hobby we shared she never had kids and was obviously a bit immature for her age which is why she got on with a mid 20s guy so well i guess we got pretty friendly very quickly and were hanging out one on one outside of the hobby and stuff and i was starting to get the vibe that she was straying into actual flirting territory one night when we went to this place to eat and she came around and sat on the bench seat with me instead of across from me and sat close so that our hips were touching    i would have fucked her in a heart beat except for the moral issue so i distanced myself stopped being available to hang out more than occasionally took a break from the hobby saying i was burnt out on it and i think she got the hint
i think my gf is bisexual like i have a hunch closeted idk im not gonna bring it up
how the fuck are you supposed to talk to women at bars/clubs when theyre always there with either their friends or their boyfriends
if im asexual and have no interest in sex but kind of want to date someone but i would rather focus on other things like my car or my hobbies does that make me a mgtow with all the negative implications that come with it
  mgtow are openly misogynistic so probably not
i want to experience what it is like to be close or even intimate with another person some day i am ashamed for wanting this and wish i could be content with just my home and career i am nothing just a machine to work and pay my debts to society i should be grateful that i am even allowed that much
her    im willing to give us a try   i need someone that i can be myself around   you make me comfortable   i dont like you in particular   i dont feel anything for you  youre not like other guys   i dont wanna waste my time on the wrong guy     what the fuck bois am i getting cucked  i confessed expecting to get rejected and move on  were both college age if that helps
just got back from a date and i think it went well but im not 100 sure we got coffee and talked we had a lot in common and the conversation kept flowing i made her laugh a lot she was smiling the whole time and we talked about a lot of different things     the reason im unsure is because in the past ive taken girls on lunch dates and it seemed like it went well but then i got ghosted afterwards but with this girl it felt a bit more natural and like i connected with her better than the other ones i didnt have to force things    we only hung out for about an hour near the end i suggested we leave the coffee shop and hang out at her apartment but she said her roommates were there and she has to wake up early tomorrow but she let me walk her home and i gave her a hug     shes a pretty busy person and has finals coming up and she moved the date back from tomorrow to today already bc of some stuff so it may be legit im wondering though if she just wanted to let me down easy or if ill be fine because idk i havent had much luck
where do girls hang out
girls  all else being equal if your partner had a disability that meant youd have to be on top pretty much every time how would you feel would it be a deal breaker
what should i do     basically ive been having this urge lately to try and reach out to my not ex basically were in an unoffical relationship     she ghosted me in may and really ive been fine since no real thoughts but for some reason i had them pop up like 23 weeks ago      idk maybe i should try cant hurt buit probably wont do a thing
why do girlies have to so pretty
what classes do girls take in college my cs classes are uh lacking
  take some low level biology as an elective get some of that sweet nursing student booty
  going to hang out at someones place will almost always carry the implication of sex its not particularly smooth to say hey lets go back to yours after an hour long coffee date    youre fine shes busy and theres no reason to doubt that a person is busy during finals season
  thats not what i had in mind and i actually mentioned watching a movie together with her while texting her and she was open to it i only suggested it because the weather was shitty and i didnt know where else we could go     good to know i should be fine im just very self conscious i guess another good sign was she didnt use her phone at all
  forgot one question  how long should i wait to text her again or should i wait for her to text me
  i get that its not what you had in mind nothing about your post made you seem like you were trying to smash but when you say lets go back to yours and youre planning on hanging out on the couch or in their room or something there is always that question over whether or not theres a window for physical escalation    i have no doubt that her roommates were there and roommates always make bringing a date home awkward even if all youre going to do is watch a movie and spoon together just be aware that going back to someones place will always make them wonder if youre just after sex    my advice is for future dates even first dates look up the place youre going online and come up with a handful of ideas for things you can do in the surrounding area if you want to continue the date afterward
  yeah if a girl isnt into you shed probably be checking her phone constantly and wouldnt let you walk her home i have to go to this thing sorry cya and her just walking out would be more likely
  should i wait for her to text me    girls dont initiate you have to text her waiting to text her is a game and you play it at your own risk in most cases following up the next day to say you had a good time and that youd like to see her again is perfectly fine if you wait too long or wait for her to be the one to text you youll get nothing and shell be sitting at home assuming you dont want to see her again
what are some ways i can ask a girl out on a date  and what are ways i dont fuck up anything up if i when going on one 
no itexan opinions    car or truck
  yeah i guess i wasnt really thinking about the gender dynamics when i said that it was more just the only places in the area were other food places and like the school library and i figured we could just chill there and play some music or something ill try not to do that again     i believe her and dont doubt it last thing i said we should do this again sometime and she said yeah for sure before going back home       yeah we kept talking while walking back we got along really well no awkward pauses or anything and a lot of stuff in common     i dunno though there was one date i thought went well in the past who ghosted me but she left on her own and checked her phone periodically and we only had a few things in common not nearly as much as this girl the main similarity is they were both only about an hour      what to send her i already told her i had a great time at the end but i guess i could send it again keep up small talk try to set up something else id probably wait like a week or two to plan a second date if i did
  you just need to roll with it bustah
  her ghosting you means she doesnt want anything to do with you sadly   move on
  i guess i sometimes wonder if maybe something then caused it in the short term because even the day before she was talking to a coworker and mentioned how well get together
  95 chance youre fine again if she didnt like you she would have bailed as fast as she could instead of letting you walk her home and keep talking to her     the asking to go to her place remark is the only iffy one but again i think she wouldnt have let you walk her home or hug her if she was truly offended    i get it you got burnt in the past but no reason to think you fucked up from what im reading
  whichever electives teaching/nursing students take
  nigga dont overthink this shit just shoot your shot and if it turns out she wasnt into you the world keepes turning i see little reason to believe she doesnt like you but she might not if you start thinking about it too much and let your lack of self confidence show
  overthinking has always been my greatest downfall i reflect and nitpick everything i do     im pretty introverted and stay in a lot she is like this too we both are really into art stuff and literature and a lot of similar shit some times she said the exact thing i was about to say and i was like holy shit yes and vice versa lot of stuff like that going on      makes sense to me
  hey would you like to go out with me some time i know this cool little bar/restaurant in the city and their food is great    be charming conversant funny flirty
  as a guy who was ghosted as well that feeling is normal but ultimately you need to know that shes ther immature one who couldnt even be honest with you and took the easy way out you can do better
  some times she said the exact thing i was about to say and i was like holy shit yes and vice versa lot of stuff like that going on    oh yeah dude dont worry at all
  what send her    since you already got a yes on a second date youre in good shape its fine to say it again    i know i said it already but yesterday was a lot of fun ill look forward to the next one    small talk a bit the retards around here will jump on me for saying that and try to claim that texting small talk is anathema and will somehow make a girl run the other way but its just not true it takes 10 seconds to flick a message to someone and if she really had a good time and wants to see you again some small talk in between dates is a really good way to establish more rapport and build inside jokes and stuff which only improves the second date    if youre thinking next weekend then wait until about wednesday to suggest it making plans too far out can bite you in the ass just as hard as trying to make plans the day before and discovering shes already booked up
  yeah when i thought about that i realized that was one thing that wasnt really going on in the past dates different personalities too the other girls were more extroverted and normie i fucking hate this meme word but idk what else to call it
  i guess she was a few years older 26 vs 22    but yea idk just sucks i feel like alot of the reasoning was that i never responded to her advances
  probably doesnt really have much to do with extro/introversion my man sometimes you just click with a person and those times are in the minority and not the majority itd be great if you could see a pretty girl get her out on a date and then discover you click like old friends but it just doesnt work that way and at least for me its so important to have that kind of connection in a relationship i can go from 60 to 0 in about 23 seconds if ive got a thing for a girl and then she speaks and weve got nothing in common
  appreciate it i dunno about going out next weekend but i dont want to wait too long either  the small talk thing is a bit weird some people say that it bores her or takes the intrigue out of things or some shit but i dont see the harm in a little bit just to keep interest/build up the relationship in between    another thing is we went out after only like 2 days of texting it was set up pretty quick and my first suggestion was watching a movie together we were talking about this older movie we both liked not theaters and she said shed id really like that 
  dont even dwell on it anymore that makes her reason all the more retarded   put yourself out there again and youll meet someone better promise
  ive kept myself open just havent had much luck really especially since this girl made the first advances and asked me out sooo yea      but its only been 7 months soo still time
  if a girl is the type to text most of them and likes you and wants to talk to you between dates then refusing to do it because a self help book told you that texting is for women and men are supposed to be too busy and productive for texting is ridiculous    like all things you have to do it a bit carefully to avoid coming too strong or too weak dont send her 11 messages for every 1 you get back that kind of thing
  another thing is we went out after only like 2 days of texting it was set up pretty quick and my first suggestion was watching a movie together we were talking about this older movie we both liked not theaters and she said shed id really like that     dude she fucking likes you jesus christ
  i mean lemme spell it out for you    the movie suggestion implies youre hanging out at her place or yours alone watching a movie netflix and chill heard of that she was open to it    moves date back from tomorrow to today because shes actually busy and is telling the truth about having to wake up early etc if she was flaking she wouldnt have suggested another day and she would have just walked back on her own    agrees to date very early on after first talking to you    the date probably ended after an hour because you wanted to leave the coffee shop and there wasnt many other places to go besides walking around and you said the weather was shit and her room and she had roommates in wtf are you 2 going to do when theres other people in the house thatd be awk as fuck and had shit to do tomorrow so in essence you ended the date not her because you suggested to leave the coffee shop you probably could have stayed longer    constant conversation no phone checking giggly etc is very good    lets you walk her home and hug her if she thought your go back to yours remark meant sex and she wasnt into it she would most definitely not let that happenshe doesnt think youre a creeper or sex pervert     you said she was introverted meaning she may be normally kinda nervous the fact that you got an introverted girl to talk the whole time and laugh/smile/click with everything you said is very good    you are finer than fine
  lol this the last time i went on a date it felt like a job interview and she was checking instagram half the time if this guys date happened to me id be fucking ecstatic
  went on a date and the girl literally asked me   where do you see yourself in 5 years
my girlfriends mom invited me and her daughter to a dinner at a restaurant i want to bring a gift but i dont know anything about her mom i want to keep it as a surprise for my gf as well so i dont want to ask her what does your mom like  any suggestions
this guy i hurt in the past has been messaging me for 2 years intemittently after the fact i feel really awful how i treated him i basically used him as an outlet for my sadism he consented to it but he was very uncomfortable and left him we were only together a couple of months he keeps asking if ill ever talk to him again i want to make things right at least talk because we had fun talking to each other and tried to get involved in each others hobbies but im scared is there a chance he might want to get back at me he messaged me for almost 2 years straight without my responding that cant come from a bad place right
  trying too hard
girls like playing match maker right how do i ask my friend is shes got single friends without it being weird
  guy being upset over an old hag ghosting him  the state of this society
  shes 26
  girls dont like playing match maker when asked to play match maker
  yeah no shit hence the without being weird as in subtly
ladies how long does it take on average for you to orgasm from oral sex i made a girl finish 3 times in 20 minutes my first try and i wanna know if thats worth something
how to make the girl do the sex
  put it this way inb4 humblebrag  ya dun gud
  i wont lie of course id like diversity but its by no means a dealbreaker or huge hurdle personally speaking
  m8 you think its a weird ask so its going to come across as weird no matter how you try framing it also if this discourages rather than inspires you youre still doin it wrong
  he wants to heal you faggot ffs message the lad already
  truck
alright one for anyone here  id post the actual conversation but i doubt anyone can speak the language  meet this girl on tinder  conversation goes really well   had a date set for yesterday  tell her where wed meet up hours in advance  no answer   today she messages me  claims she forgot that she deleted tinder but waited for me to message her  im calling bullshit and will probably just walk away had a backup date set up anyways  but just out of interest how legit do you think the excuse is
  0 legit shes trying to get rid of you
  yeah i kinda figured
  r a p e
  every time she compliments me it wont feel genuine  thats a problem if you dont trust your partners attempts to mend an issue youve brought up theres literally no hope for solutions to any problem youre ever going to have
  i just want her compliment to come from heart not just because i asked for them  giving you compliments because you asked for them doesnt mean they dont come from the heart shed just be expressing what shes already thinking  she is your girlfriend i imagine theres something she likes about you its not like shell have to make something up  and even if if the only reason shes saying it is to please you the fact that she wants to please you is something in itself  stop being a faggot
so   ive been crushing on this girl weve consistently taken turns showing signs of interest and opening up to one another i asked her out at first but that plan fell through then weeks later she asked me out and it went very well the next week i asked her out and things went well again when she asked me out she insisted she pay her half when i asked her out i covered the bill but she said she would pay me back doesnt want to owe people     then she said in this order with some space between them that i act like a murderer and then that i act like a person of high sophistication as one would if they came from money     im still trying to gague how she feels most people i can just look at them and tell exactly what theyre thinking or a rough feeling at least shes been nothing but mystery though im pretty sure she has a rough family history i suspect abuse but she hasnt said anything about it yet
  i reached out to him there was no animosity from him and he said he forgave me a while ago i am just worried he expects a relationship for me now because he dropped several hints i told him to honestly not expect anything still healing from a break up and i want to start off as friends and get to know each other better but i hope i dont make things worse for him
femanons    i matched with a girl on tinder we chatted for a couple days and i asked her out for drinks she said yes but the other night when she was drunk she referred to it as a sort of date when i jokingly asked why it was only sort of one she said some shit about not wanting to seem too keen then she left me on read when i responded to that  im gonna snapchat her today and ask if shes still down got nothing to lose but does the above make sense to a female i figured it would be pretty reasonable to call it a date considering i met her on tinder maybe it was too platonic of a conversation i dunno man    inb4 i snapchat her and she says yeah course im still down and i realise i was just overthinking
  you seemed desperate
  well thats a relief
girls    i recently met a nice woman at work didnt talk extensively just exchanged pleasantries the next day during lunch she came up behind me and tapped me on the shoulder to get my attention to say hello is this a sign that she is at least not repulsed by me as in would you only establish a rapport of physical contact if you were at least comfortable being friends or is this just something youd do without thinking thanks in advance for any responses 
im thinking of sending this letter to my sister im 25m shes 21f on christmas eve / new years feel free to critique it     dear sis    i want to start this by telling you i have no expectations from you or want you to do anything for me other than listen all else is up to you to decide after hearing what i have written    i have never seen my feeling as a strong sibling love or even a romantic kind rather my feelings have always felt much more unnatural even for me i cant tell you what it is that i want or what my hidden emotions are only what it has done constantly i think about you and fantasize being your romantic partner every time weve gotten close physically and emotion i wanted it to never end i enjoy watching you as you get through busy work and help the rest of the family and i cant help but want you to trust me and let me care for you    since mom left i have always made it my top priority to protect and care for you with many of my proudest moments being in part me trying to please and make you proud to where i have more respect and devotion to you than i think mom and dad combined but thats part of the issue my love for you was and is too strong    many times even now i think about what im doing with myself and what would make you respect me more what you like about others about me and how i could be better to the point where when spoken to in work i sometimes get to imagine you giving me the same advice i wanted to have your attention and to be perfect in your eyes to this end i loved seeing you laugh like a gigling hynae with the hiccups so many times i wanted someone you could trust and enjoy being with but these thoughts have been more along the lines of a obsession     i dont intend on going further than this and i hope the best for you as we continue on with our lives i hope that you can still see me as your big brother and know that i will never do anything to change that     love forever and always
  hey bby want some bro dick
  thats a good way to make yourself hate christmas / new years    also your writing style is bad but mine would probably be as well if i was obsessed with somebody     take some you time nerd and reexamine yourself
  what does she look even look like if shes sub 8 its not worth this much effort and pain
  obsessors dont care about looks
guys     what do you think it means when a girl always has to initiate a relationship ive never been asked on a date in my life but if i muster he courage to ask someone i like out they would always agree cute guys too at least by my standards    i kind of am getting vibes from a coworker but i dont want to misread anything at all
  you seem standoffish and or unapproachable
  in this day and age i dont think it means anything guys are told they arent supposed to do really anything unless theyre certain the girl likes them so its not inconceivable that you live in a place where guys buy into that keep doing what youre doing
girls    how can people just past their partners sexual history if a girl im dating previously got pounded by a black bvll how the fuck is she just going to forget that experience
  maybe she didnt like it as much as sex with you
  girl friends tell me all the time that they thought i was going to be a bitch but ended up being cool all the time i dont know what i can do to help that though i laugh and joke around at work all the time but i do admittedly clam up and get really nervous around this one guy which i would figure is extremely obvious that i like him and that he isnt interested i dont fucking know
  hard isnt always better  foreplay is where its at when it comes to impressing women sexually
  dont be afraid to make the first move in this case but if he doesnt reciprocate then hes not for you guys pretty much run with any openings they can get if they like you
girls    on tinder i always see girls giving their snapchat in their bios is it cool if i add them if we dont match i dont have any issues starting a conversation just getting my foot in the door
  i do admittedly clam up and get really nervous around this one guy which i would figure is extremely obvious that i like him  he just thinks that hes creeping you out
    but she will never forget that that will always be the ill never forget the time that i hooked up with a black guy who had a 10inch dick best sex of my life    the reality is it doesnt matter how skilled i am or how good of a boyfriend i am there are things she will never forget how am i or anyone else in similar situations just suppose to look past her history
  thats a sign shes just on tinder for attention she posted her snapchat just so shell gain followers because men are stupid and will add her immediately just like youre thinking of doing she will never respond to you she just wants a big following
  who gives a shit what she remembers or doesnt remember    what matters is where she is just because youre insecure doesnt mean shes fixated on her past
  but this is why people say dont shit where you eat because we work right by each other id have to change jobs and leave town if i shot my shot and got nothing in that case that shit is embarrassing      doubt it hes a genuinely handsome guy just really dorky and we would crack some jokes with each other every once in a while so he knows im not skeeved
    im not a girl but ive had a similar issue with my gf and sensed the vibe as well as coaxing her a little about it and getting her to open up to me ask yourself if your feelings come from insecurity if you cant believe you can become as sexually compatible with her then you need to work at it work on your technique two things   1 being in love matters to them more youll be surprised at how forgetful they can get when theyre in love in ten years she wont even care  2 they might not forget but they will be yearning for you to give them good experiences to replace the bad including the break ups and ghostings
  10inch dick  best sex of her life  unless thats the only time shes ever had sex most girls wouldnt even consider that good
  i knew a girl who would joke with people even if she was about to cut them out of her life forever guys are dumb     i dunno just ask to hang out innocuous enough and means you can just pretend to be fine if he says no
      so youre saying there is absolutely nothing wrong with having serious relationships with sluts
  hes a genuinely handsome guy just really dorky  really dorky  hes definitely worried that he seems weird
  im saying youre a dumbass  and a self righteous one at that  projecting your thoughts onto other people and acting insecure about them
  how
  sluts   so hold on are we talking here about girls who repeatedly got fucked by various dicks through years or girls who had two or three partners one of whom happened to have a big dick   moreover if a girl rides cock carousel composed exclusively of tiny incel peepees is she still a slut i mean she will probably remember these fucks but for different reasons
  im saying gauge the relationship you autist if she is into you and you get her off you have to make your peace with it or find someone else because it seems to me it doesnt matter much to her and matters more to you so if you dont wanna make her happy to be with you dont be in a relationship with her take it slow ask her about it let her communicate with you and use the knowledge to your advantage
  a girl who has had sex outside of relationships including with an african bvll    so you personally would care if your gf had a wild past before you met
  she has had one that was wildish not that crazy for 2018 outside of relationships thats the other thing about women they listen to enabling shit their friends say like that you should try before you buy if youre in a relationship which leaves them vulnerable to pump and dumps it doesnt really bother me because im the best sex of her life which is why im asking if you have a little bit of insecurity i was insecure about it deep down i reckon so i communicated and found out things she liked to mog her previous partners
  but at the end of the day shes still an adult and she made the choice to do what she did you cant just make excuses for her like shes innocent
  yeah and adults get to not let the past shape their future and learn from their mistakes also theres a fine but important line between explaining a thought process and making excuses for someone
  so let me ask you this say your gf had spent her early twenties slutting around fucked more than 25 guys and was just a wild girl then she decided to take a break from that cleaned up and met you her past would be totally acceptable to you    same logic larger scale
  yep cause i did the same so what 
  ziplockun
  itd be harder but if she showed me she truly loved me and was devoted to me i could try make it work
  ok so what if she fugged 40 guys    why is that
  well itd probably have a different thought process behind it more than 25 probably means she has a history of abuse/personality disorder rather than naivete which are harder to work with not impossible but harder
why are tall girlies so much prettier
  well even if we dropped that number to 5 casual sex partners it shows that she has issues because shes fine with strangers putting their body parts in her and swapping bodily fluids that automatically shows risky behavior
  he had an older sister
  lol so how many girls have you been with
  dem legs and boons at eye level  t not into tall chicks but i can see why you would be
  boons  boobs
  2 and they were both girlfriends and we didnt have sex until we were already in a relationship
  that explains everything you have a very small world view conservative im guessing and a prude your type of person bothers me
  why because i have the willpower to not stick my dick in people i dont know because i hold myself to the same standards that i would expect from someone else    how is that wrong
  its not wrong but you judging women on how many dicks they fucked is stupid and childish you are a superficial cunt and im glad i dont know you irl i bet your perfect woman will cheat on you because she wants to know what its like to be really fucked good thats when she meets a guy like me and her world view changes so ride that high horse till the wheels fall off
  lmao a guy like me this is such bait im not even the person youre talking to and i died at this thank you so much for the laugh this morning
  defending and justifying sluts  kek i hope you get herpes on your scrotum from some infected girl who doesnt have the care to warn you about it because she only wants your dick for the night
  thanks and i hope your wife gets fucked by a room full of bbc and they send you the video mostly will happen
  i bet youd enjoy watching your wife cuck you in front of several african bvlls
what does it mean if a girl is constantly asking if youre mad at her  history of abuse   guilty conscience   do i just seem angry   some mix  i get louder when i get excited about things or talk about something im passionate about
  only while im fucking your dad in his ass while hes wearing that dress he likes so much how did you know
  nice try but my dad is gone
  uh huh and
  shes guilty of something
  who isnt
  im fucking your dad in his ass  sorry bruh but i think you might be gay it does explain why youre so obsessed with bbcs
  not me faggot cope
  its not gay i was fucking his ass how is that even close to gay  i didnt smile and i was wearning boots nice try im secure in my manhood guy
  having sex with a guy  not gay  lmao faggot
  again read above do you want m yo be gay  are you craving a good ass fucking friend  its ok to be a closet fag like you are
is it psychotic to feel spiteful towards women who dont consider me as potential bf material i dont like being relegated to the status of a lamp and looked down upon in such a way  or rather not looked at at all most women i would say at least 9/10 treat me this way    i dont even try to be nice or friendly to attractive girls anymore as i can see them instantly disregarding me sadly it appears the grade of women who do that is ever decreasing used to be only 8s but now the 7s and 6s are getting pretty uppity
  i was wearing boots while plowing some guys asshole therefore im not gay  if you were really secure in your manhood you wouldnt pitifully deny being gay or bi or whatever degenerate scum you are and just admit that you have some homo inclinations and like having sex with other men
  secure in your manhood  then why you so worried about it being smaller than somebody elses
  its not gay i was fucking his ass  this needs to be a banner
  are you trying to get me horny  you slick dog you let me see your dick
  yes it is women dont own you shit my dude aint their fault that youre not attractive
everyone around me is in a relationship and it makes me feel like garbage because ive been constantly turned down by everyone im already 20 and still a relationship less virgin while all my friends have been regularly in relationships or hook ups since 14 so women out there why am i so undesirable why does everyone else have that i seem to be missing
  is it psychotic to feel spiteful towards women who dont consider me as potential bf material  its not psychotic just immature
  im never worried about my dick size i dont have too you are though huh
  that will always be the ill never forget the time that i hooked up with a black guy who had a 10inch dick best sex of my life  not worried about my dick size  k
  wtf are you even talking about  you have a weird thing with black cock good for you go get it son ill listen to your stories 
  are you not 
  nope sure am not
  you should always judge everyone by how many partners theyve had what fucking drugs are you on do you look at a person with a criminal record and think i would let them babysit my kids    fucks sake
   for girls    in 3 hours im going to see a girl whos a good friend of a friend thing is i jsut want to fuck her tonight and thats it how do i tell her that without damaging the relationships or making her sad    also im very positive that she is into me a lot problem is i dont want a relationship just one night and then move on keep it friends maybe    what should i do aghhh
  black and white thinking go back under your rock or whatever inbred state you live in cant believe there are really people lik you out their sad shit
  but it is their fault that they have such high standards      immature how
is it an unattractive trait if a guy cares about his car too much
  yeah and adults get to not let the past shape their future and learn from their mistakes   imagine believing this people do not change who you are is engraved into the very flesh of your brain
  thats a defense used by people who think that blaming circumstances is a reliable way out of responsibility for their actions
    as a car guy i dont find that to be weird but you can take it to extremes as long as you show that you care about your car such as cleaning maintainence proper driving etc its alright if you kiss her or talk to her or shit like that its just degenerate
  nice try guy more like i live in the real world and deal with real people people that are not perfect but still are good people its people like you who profess to be so moral and proper you are a hippocrate and i know it you live a sad sheltered life never leave your prison you will have your feelings hurt lil man
  blaming people for having standards   are you being serious
  personally i think its weird to be really into cars but everyone has their interests so i understand it
i have been hanging out with this girl in my class when ever we are hanging out together with our group of friend she would intentionally sit beside me and would be flirty with me but she also flirt with other guys is she interested in a relationship or i am getting the wrong signal
  obscene standards anything above looksmatching is intensely narcissistic
  too much  if he cares so much that its a bad thing it is by definition a bad thing
anons have you ever had problems with a female boss im a chick and i had previously thought that my boss who has daughters my age really liked me all of my male bosses treat me like their little sister or their own kid i always got their humor and we have the best time together but for some reason my female boss complained about me to a higherup it was apparently about how i conduct myself despite the fact my male bosses have never had an issue with it   i started to notice that each female figure of authority ive met has been kind of bitchy and condescending going all the way back to middle school is this how most female bosses are like or am i just unlucky what have your experiences from both men and women but namely other women been like
  looks are not everything my friend your character is rotten as fuck and women can smell it either stop being a bitter narcissistic fag who thinks he deserves love and sex just because or accept your life as it is
   women can smell personality through phone screens  interesting assertion care to elaborate
  i find it hilarious youd ask that while projecting as much sarcasm as possible i wonder if the irony is lost upon you
  maybe you just conduct yourself poorly ive never had an issue with female bosses before
  dude not even a woman and yet can tell that anyone who says shit like  is a bitter and entitled clown   the grade of women   regular guys who get laid dont say shit like this mate
  bump
  how do you go about asking a girl to fuck if you are aquaintances and dont want to be in a committed relationship can you pull this off without going on dates
tfw have slight inner panic when a guy tells me im beautiful or very nice and interesting    i feel like ill inevitably disappoint them when they say that is this normal feel
  i dont see what you mean its easy to hide negative personality traits in real life let alone over tinder etc and act normally women dont care about shit personalities for reference try all the murderers/rapists eg ted bundy wife beaters chris brown hoodrats jeremy meeks psychopaths the guy from 50 shades of grey i know he isnt real but conceptually hes obviously a hottie and so on      ya and im not going to say that kind of thing to people in real life am i i couldnt think of a way to articulate the x/10 scoring i guess league would have been better than grade    you try not being bitter after a mile in my shoes im not entitled i just want a looksmatch
  no she actually egged me on and misinterpreted me asking her a question as me interrupting her my actual supervisor who had to give me the talking to thought what she said was bullshit
  you just know that you arent as beautiful or smart or whatever they say you are   but know that they dont really think so either its just something we say to make girls like us and feel better about themsleves
  i just want a looksmatch  there is no such a thing buddy leagues is a concept that doesnt universally apply to all people
  consensus decides which league someone goes in
  a likable personality counts for alot also lots of downright ugly people can find love dont let that last thing make you feel entitled but dont use it as an excuse for self defeat
  maybe she just doesnt like you then
for jeans what color teeshirt should i wear  blue eyes brown hair if that matters
  what i mean is rather that its not set in stone that all 8/10 have to date other 8/10 and 2/10 only other 2/10 and the whole rating thing is arbitrary one mans 10 is other mans 7
    whocares
    point is most girls only want the top 20 of guys yes this has been proven over and over and are happy to wait their turn and then become cat ladies
  everyone wants the top 20  everyone has a different idea of the top 20
  if a guy drinks and drives and kills someone its ok because he didnt intend to do that right kill that person wasnt his goal    so with that if a girl has lots of casual sex catches herpes without knowing it and gives it to another guy thats ok
    thnik 2 seconds about how completely stupid is this idea top 20 male get in couple and the rest is unhappy incels what do you think the world population would be after a few decades if only 20 of total population got to have sex 
  dude here  cant say ive ever really had issues with female bosses but none of them have had been older than me by enough to have kids my age so that might be part of it  on the other hand it could be some kind of weird thing about competing like when dudes compete for authority its either a respectful may the best man win type thing or a bare knuckle brawl women i think are more passive aggressive and indirect with each other
  all women want only 20 percent of male population  yet smelly junkies with mommy issues still get married and procreate   try again buddy
i was talking with this girl at school for some time and i asked if she wanted to be my gf  2 hours after receiving the message she simply replied i dont wanna date i just wanna study  2 hours  some people that dont directly know her but read the message said that she prob asked her parents and they said noshes 17yrs old  other people said that she is confused and to keep talking to her so that im still there if she changes her mind  what do you anons think i should do i fear that she maybe lied about wanting just to study so it wouldnt hurt my feelings too much but she does have great grades i need more opinions
last we talked was nov 9 on thanksgiving we wished each other happy thanksgiving ldr     are we already broken up and i just dont know it
how early is too early to mention i like butt stuff
  yes
  uh why do you have no communication ldrs can work but you must have good communication     it doesnt sound like youre in a ldr desu
  i mean im in a similar situation with a girl rn who is dual enrolled   i would suggest trying to become friends so you can get a feel for one another so you can see if shes actually worth dating
    ok thanks
  do you have any advice for this situation
  dont get attached to somebody who communicates poorly
realistically what are the most important factors to attract girls as a young guy face height muscles job connection social life skills money job independence etc     most people i see seem to lack many of these and on top of it have many bad traits    i often see being under 6ft or not having your own place as these crazy dealbreakers but in practice it seems like it doesnt matter    what should i actually be concerned about if my goal is a long term relationship with a reserved girl not looking for sluts or hookups
  you did good by reaching out if i know his mind and i might since i feel im heading down the same path if he liked you a lot then he probably still does just be very clear if a relationship is forever off the table or just not a now thing we guys need that clarity any vague or not definitive no is a maybe if i work at it situation in our mind starting over as friends is a very good idea    question for you however during all that time of him communicating with you but not getting a reply did that upset or bother you im only going on a month or so of being the texting guy with no replies but im worried im going to just bother her too much she reads my messages not blocked just no replies and ive been very forward saying i wont give up and she needs to tell me to fuck off if im being a nuisance
  from what you listed social life but in general id say its perceived confidence in the early relationship thats why you see neurotic messes with girlfriends they faked it just long enough
lately i have been approached by girls who made it clear they hate me if thats the case then why even bother talk to me 
    communication skills     what should i actually be concerned about if my goal is a long term relationship with a reserved girl    your criteria is stupid grow up
  what criteria
am i a thot for hanging out with a guy with a girlfriend in secret even if we arent technically doing anything bad i saw his gf text him while we were together and he lied about what he was doing
    a reserved girl
  youre taking it too literally i just mean someone similar to me i like spending my time painting for example and dont drink so i dont want a girl who enjoys clubbing i want a family in the future so i want a girl with similar ideas i only said reserved because i am as well but its definitely not my main or only criteria just needed a word
    i think it still reflects the fact you are approaching a relationship without an openended mind it is fine to have family projects and expect someone that shares them at some point but you also have to be realistic you dont grow a family with the first matching girl that comes by the door in the meantime a girl which you meet at a party and enjoy clubbing once in a month in their 20s can just stop a few year later and found a family with you do you understand what i mean  life is about adapting your desires to what you find rather than careful planning    now i dont want to say you cannot be picky but be picky about the relationship not the person  compatibility of desires level of communication confidence respect you could have a shitty relationship with the best girl and vice versa its important to realise that
this guy has admitted to me that he has feelings for me and wants to fuck me but he still calls me kid and kiddo all the time whats the deal
  i suppose but i still really dont like alcohol drugs casual sexetc and i assume that girls that go clubbing probably do all 3 of those which are my major dealbreakers     to be fair how many girls will completely overlook my flaws with and open mind probably none
  depends on how he says it and how old you two are
theres a girl ive known for a while she made it seemingly clear she was into me i asked her to go to dinner she said yes she then invited her friend to dinner with us so that wasnt a date     i figure she wasnt really into me next weekend we hangout with some friends and shes all over me again   we continue this dance for like a month im at the point where next time i see her im just gonna ask her out in the clearest way i can she flips at random between acting into me and not into me ive been playing this game for a month now issue is now shes seemingly too busy to hang with me at all and i want to ask her in person im kind of done with her bs but i know shes neurotic     is she just playing me for attention if you want i can list some of her unusual behavior
  what are your flaws 
  59  ocd  not muscular  live with parents22 tho so its probably acceptable  social anxiety  only a handful of friends   not very social
  if youre hanging out in secret and hes not telling his gf about it its something bad already no reason for him to feel guilty enough to lie if nothings going on
  im a girl and none of those things are dealbreakers for me youre fine
  what if i also listen to motley crue and death grips on the regular
  glass breaks
  not me    to be fair your just one girl i have no idea if others feel the same most girls seem to go after the loudest guys
  probably just having a laugh  i do weird names for people all the time girl a few years older call her miss call my dad pappy call my brother all sorts of stupid shit  the reaction is always good
  no you mean  the loudest girls go after the loudest guys
  well i hope youre right because theres a kind of awkward/shy girl i think is cute and plan to ask out soon
im not ugly and while introverted i can manage myself in social situation quite well and yet women seem to see me with apathy at best  im 25 and managed to be in a relationship only once and only because she was emotionally unstable and straved for affection   i dont know what im doing wrong but getting either rejected or ignored all the time as taken a serious toll on my self esteem and confidence i feel unwanted and i dont know the reason why  im so lonely i get more and more bitter and depressed as time passes soon it will start to show if it isnt allready the case and getting a gf will be even more difficult then  what can i do 
    ive actually had a relationship with someone that fits more or less this description some years ago only difference was he was 25 still at his parents and was a bit more social    this is perfectly fine
  im 28 and never had a gf or sex what do
  not really
  perhaps you could find someone whos open to strapons  can you imagine getting a gf only for her to suggest a strap on because your cock is too small like imagine telling a woman to poke a fleshlight up her cooch because her vagina is too loose for your dick its incredibly insulting
if i like a girl is it a good idea to ask her to help me with stuff as a way to get closer to her and earn her trust
do you believe in something like a soulmate
  no
  although im in no way a part of it hookup culture and how people nowadays love to cheat or to have open relationships led me to stop believing in soulmates
when it comes to romantic interest is it better to be casual and just see what happens when youre getting along really great with someone new or does there need to be a certain amount of showing that youre interested in them or is that just obvious anyway    i really like this girl but shes quite recently out of a relationship and i dont want to be pushy or risk friendship when its been amazing getting to know her
  yeah more or less
  the idea of soulmates is depressing since you are statistically likely to never meet them and any person you do meet and date statistically isnt your soulmate  it also doesnt guarantee that you romantically end up with them even if you do meet them  it also cheapens the hard work people put into their own relationships and the love that has blossomed from it    so i choose not to believe in them in fact i think its rather harmful to have that belief
from my experience ive come to this conclusion when i sense even the slightest lack of enthusiasm from the girl i know its over  do you agree there is no playing hard to get if she cant make the time to see you twice she never will
  idk some friend of mine kept asking a girl out until she eventually said yes and they ended up sleeping together they are sort of friends with benefits now he says the girl never showed or shows too much enthusiasm which annoys him
how do i justify the 8000 required to get gynecomastia surgery to remove my mantits i hate these things i hate the way they poke out of my shirt i hate the way they make women disgusted by me but thats a lot of fucking money
  how the fuck does that requires surgery  i had it in one side applied some hormonal paste on it for a month and it was gone  best part is since i dont live in clapistan i paid about 5 euros for the whole thing
  hard glands have formed ive had it for a few years but only noticed it about last year
meet girl  things are going well we become good friends  start to devellop feelings for her so i ask her out  im sorry anon i just dont see you that way but youre such a nice guy youll find someone eventually im sure   cut all ties with her never speak to her again  rince and repeat dozens of time for the better half of a decade    im in my mid twenties and i cant get a girlfriend what the hell am i doing wrong 
  im 28 and have man boobs since i was like 8 years old im not even fat anymore 160 pounds 510 so they wont go away unless i get surgery
  youre such a nice guy youll find someone eventually im sure  means she likes your personality but doesnt think you are on the same level of attractiveness as she is she only wants you as a friend to hang on with or possible use
  23 weeks is about the time you should be dating after first meeting her something tells me you wait a few months or something gay like that and then you actually ask her out as if thats going to change something or something fucking gay like that   youd honestly have a significantly better chance asking her out when you actually meet her
  this guy is right despite his childish way of putting it   i have a date tonight and i only started talking to the girl on wednesday
  yeah but soulmates are not created magically  relationships are built over time
  hookers save up some money and go to nevada thailand or the netherlands and just fuck to your hearts content     afterwards youll realize sex is kind of an overrated experience then hopefully you try to find a girl interested in starting in family over sex
    well fuck me then because there is no way im dating a girl i know nothing of
is it okay for me to be jealous    my girlfriend has a pretty popular instagram about 30000 followers and she constantly has guys message her now it bothers me a little but usually not that much because they are usually creepy indian or older men but recently she said lol another guy messaged me on instagram and he was a fucking beef cake huge armstattoos tall total chad     i played it off as no big deal she blocked him and that was the end of it but now ive started thinking fuck man that guy was cute as fuck and here is me 58 out shape    should i bring up my concern to her or just act like it doesnt bother me i suppose there is nothing she can do about it but damn man i dont want beefcakes messaging her  the worst part is is that her instagram isnt some instagram thott page its ljust artsy pictures of books that she writes reviews for and she barley posts pictures of herself
  girl here i feel the same way its just that most people dont but the most important thing is to not give up
  hey man i plan on dying alone too its not as bad as it seems
  what if i told you that the purpose of going on a date is to get to know the girl   dude youre going full gay on me
after meeting my tinder date ive been the one to initiate conversations all the time i really like them i have a huge crush on them and i just wanna spend time with them and do whatever i dont mind that they said theyre not ready for a relationship they always explain why they say or act a certain way and make sure i dont feel confused and the other day the responded with i was thinking about you today but like i said i reach out to them a lot more and ive made it clear i really like them now however they said they are really stressed and lots of work on their plate and told they are very busy we hadnt had time to meet a second time yet and they called us friends is this distancing they arent that interested and im too eager did i fuck it up by being this eager
  the most important thing is to not give up    getting rejected all the time is quite depressing actually  i can see the appeal in what that guys saying 
  i can empathize with that anon but you cant deny the fact that there is a very real chance for you to meet the right girl anyway give up or dont live alone or dont im not judging you for your decision but i do encourage you to keep trying
  im not saying its the norm i just followed the signs she was interested neither of us had plans for tonight so i went for it   ive had girls where i didnt take them out for almost a month depends on their comfort but you have to make your intentions known from the beginning       you shut up you sound 14
  anyone
  i had a girl in my high school who would hug me all the time yell my name out in the halls and other random shit eventually i asked her out but then she flat out told me she was a lesbian and laughed needless to say i stopped talking to her
  lol dude you actually go out and talk to girls and ask them on dates like a normal human being woooaaahahahah d00d what are you 14 xd  dood why would i go up to a girl have a friendly conversation with her and then ask her out for coffee my duud im just going to pretend like im an innocent friendly bro for like 5 months before asking her out on a date completely out of the blue i mean what am i 14 bro
  i feel like ill inevitably disappoint them when they say that is this normal feel    nah thats low selfesteem    i used to have a similar mentality except id find ways to discredit or downplay the compliment or attention writing it off as them just being nice    deep down some part of me knew i was just doing that because the compliments discomforted me and made me feel like i was having expectations piled on top of me that i didnt think i could reach    it took me about half a decade of actively struggling to change to finally start to find the version of myself that i liked best and could function without feeling like i was a sham
  probably yeah eager can be good when its reciprocal but overeager tends to be a waving red flag bearing the letters gtfo    ps it sounds like they tried to explicitly tell you in multiple ways that while they felt favorably towards you they werent that interested to begin with but you kinda bullishly and one sidedly plowed ahead anyway    chill out stop jumping the gun
  okay i hear that so now what i chill out and stop bugging them for a while wait to hear from them or did i fuck it up too bad already
  its less that you fucked up and more that they arent particularly interested nothing you can say or do will make them change their mind on that leave it up to them to contact you but dont expect it    also you really should mention genders in this kind of thing because it absolutely makes a difference as to how ab/normal your dynamic is
  what do you think the world population would be after a few decades if only 20 of total population got to have sex   ackshually you dont need a large male population at all for obvious reasons regardless of the accuracy of the post youre replying to if only 20 of men got to have sex it doesnt necessarily follow thered be any drop in population at all
i hate my gf should i leave her
    any tips of holding long convos with women 
why is becoming a normal male so expensive why is it even more expensive to go beyond that
  just ask her  i doubt its guilty conscience though at least not one thats earned  possibly an irrational one powered by anxiety guilty people tend more towards projection in my experience eg acting accusatory being quick to anger to your perceived failings rather than taking on guilt themselves    not quite the same but i used to have irrational fears that my boyfriend was disappointed by me and now and then itd bubble over and id have a little melt down it didnt resolve until we actually sat down and talked about it and i was able to see from his perspective how baseless my worries were and things have been great ever since its one thing to have a meltdown and be reassured that that particular meltdown was unnecessary its another to address the underlying basis of all meltdowns and realise its all good   basically just addressing the elephant in the room now were both aware of it and we both know the other is aware of it so if something comes up theres no barrier to addressing it no struggle to broach the subject or dance around it
  no ones obligated to be attracted to you life doesnt owe you a girlfriend  the fact that certain people arent attracted to you is no reflection of your self worth you dont need to take it as an insult when someones not interested theres nothing to be mad about there are all kinds of reasons two people wont work together thats why finding the right person is considered so special   not everyone understands that of course and many people do act like their measure of someones attractiveness defines that persons worth but those people are just assholes and arent worth wasting your time on dont fall into the same mentality by demonising people who reject you most people dont mean any harm by it
  every time you feel bad about it assign that feeling a monetary value man id give 50 to not feel like this right now and put that money in a savings account if/when you accumulate the cost of the surgery go get it
virgin going to college here if a girl wants to sex me am i supposed to just have condoms stored for the occasion or what i have no idea how people have sex while living on campus aside from at house parties which i wont go to
  you have condoms yes its like having milk in the refrigerator for when you want to have cereal  i have no idea how people have sex while living on campus  in their rooms on the bed i assume
  /thread

why do i struggle so much to talk to old people i would say people from the age range of 40    i talk to teenagers and young adults just fine im 19 but i cant talk to old people i rent a room from a married couple and get along with the mom well somewhat but have had very few conversations with the dad their son who is gone away to his college but let me know about the room i now rent will visit and go to concerts with the dad smoke weed with him and watch movies with him even though the son has known him for less than i have    i also fail to talk to my own parents and grandparents all the time i dont really see them anymore but when i do im instantly at a loss for words
how do i converse with women like just general topics    i just lose interest in socializing or im unable to continue a conversation
  act natural  whatever that means to you   aesop rock
  just talk about what you know
  anything  ask them questions like what are your hobbies what kinds of movies do you like
i need some insight for a big fuckup i did   be me 22 yo virgin  somehow get a girlfriend  we have sex i loose the frustrations and repressed anger that i had because of this    i never told her i was a virginheres the problem    we broke up in july still talk but rarely  today she asks me if i was a virgin before meeting her  she doesnt tell me why she asked me  shes upset with me because of this  because i didnt trust her enough to tell her  she also said she feels a bit used    so the question now is how bad did i fuck up here i know i did i cant comprehend how bad i did tho i wouldnt know where to begin but looking back on it now i wish i did
you didnt fuck up at all if you had told her you were a virgin she wouldnt have fucked you you done well she sounds like a bit of a ho so go ahead and put her opinion in the trash
i preach honesty and openness in your relationships but at this point its water under the bridge you broke up why do you care anymore
who gives a fuck dont even respond to her messages or answer her calls anymore shes the past
  because i feel bad i loved her i know its over and im just a bit remorseful about it thats all
did you straight up lie to her about it or was it just not something that was brought up or were you purposefully hiding it    i dont feel like you have anything to feel guilty about if you didnt lie on the other hand maybe you should have been more open about it if you got with her specifically to lose your virginity then you should probably feel guilty     either way get over it youll be alright in the future you should be more honest
is it a good idea to drop out of college if i struggle with basic classes i dont want to waste even more of my parents money and dig myself into a deeper hole

  me me me    fucking narcissist
is being beefy a better alternative than being fancylooking in your respective opinions
  our opinions  fucksakes dude use your fucking eyes we all want to die being beefy or fancy doesnt affect us    i also have no idea why you posted what looks like jojo which is all men both beefy and fancy but you want to separate the two    heres the real and only answer you need a man will be what he wishes to be and will work toward that steadily
  the thing is not everyone wants to die what im asking is is having a fancy body better than having a fancy face
  in what context to whom as per which cultures norms  i want you guys to realize how absolutely thick these arbitrary questions are    even if we all said one is better or whatever would it matter one bit if someone you cared about more than us said otherwise  in fact further from that if we all tell you off but someone you care for gives you an answer what then    humans are individual and that means sometimes your fanciness itself is a problem not the where of the fanciness
/adv/ im such a fuck up im 26 my parents have spent so much money on me for school i graduated a 2year college program after failing out twice before and the only job i managed to land since graduating is a construction labor gig which has absolutely nothing to do with the industry my diplomas in     should i go back to school is it too late at my age am i just gonna be wasting more time and money if i go     im so fuckin lost and upset with myself
do you have an idea of what you actually want to work as  have you spoken with a education counselor yet
your start will be rough its not to late to finish school but there is no shame in working dont get discouraged after your first few failures
  kinda i wanna work in either graphic design or video production the program i graduated from had a mix of both but im pretty positive id like to work in the creative field at least perhaps in advertising      its tough to find work that i enjoy even a small amount tho im not ashamed to be working but i feel like im just spinning my wheels not really moving forward at all you know
start working on your own projects make patreon or fiverr for comissions get experience on your own continue school properly i think you went to a scam schoolm never ever go private
op im in your shoes just one step ahead of you    i graduated in 2015 with a bullshit lib arts degree fought my way tooth and nail into my field got my foot in the door at the end of 2016 and found out that i absolutely hated it    proceeded to spend the following 2 years literally just spinning my wheels at a wageslave bottom feeder retail job making 0 effort to progress myself    it was only after a massive life event/trauma this summer that i finally am going back to school going pa mid level medical and basically starting from scratch ill be taking 15 years of community college classes to get caught up before im able to even apply to a 2 year pa program    its not too late you have your destiny in your hands dive into it with all your passion and your strength stop fucking autopiloting like i did and start correcting your life immediately your future self surrounded by your future wife and kids will be so grateful that you did    do not wait start fixing your shit immediately like start today
  nah it wasnt a scam school im just a canadian so our post secondary works a little different here      how old are you tho anon i feel like the fact that i havent even really started a career yet means im fucked congrats on going back to school tho thats a big concrete step towards improving your shit
  how old are you tho anon   not that anon but oldfag and have been through similar shit    the fact that i havent even really started a career yet means im fucked  it doesnt   our society idolizes people who seem to surf the wave of success from cradle to grave without ever losing their balance but we paint a onesided and unrealistic picture of those people and their lives   id be willing to wager that every one of your favorite stories involves the protagonist undergoing severe setbacks and seemingly gameending failures its cliche but thats what makes the story substantial and meaningful and is part of why you enjoy it ever felt invigorated by a tale of uninterrupted success didnt think so    if anything you are more prepared than many because you have seen the alternatives and more of the real world you now have experience and wisdom that were absent the last time around   use these hardfought advantages to seize opportunities your younger self would have passed on you still have the capacity not only to reclaim the place you might once have taken but to actually surpass it     please dont be hard on yourself the world is hard enough take responsibility without placing blame   treat yourself like someone else you were responsible for nurture your strengths and successes learn from misjudgments and regretted decisions then forgive yourself   as long as you keep growing theres good stuff in your future
  this sounds like pretty sound advice thanks anon    what do you do for work out of curiosity
  honestly work on setting you sights on the goal if its a very simple life you may be able to have that with the work you do
  theres more that id like to do than my current situation allows though i think
online friendships dont actually exist    discuss
what advice do you need    as someone whos played world of warcraft for years i have to passionately disagree with that statement
  theyre definitely rare as fuck  whats with people constantly lying online youd think theyd be honest here but the catfish is fucking strong
  i would say they do exist but its pretty hard to make real friends online when people are usually just trying to get a big online presence like how on discord theres ranks to separate the epic gamers from the commonfolk  i have a group that started as some faggots that wanted to write play warhammer and troll people on deviantart id say were pretty good pals even if we dont talk as much as we did in the good ol days
  they do but theyre different to real life friendships most people wont be able to thrive with online friends only but thats not to say the online friends arent valuable they can be tremendously valuable and provide a deeper connection than any real life friend youll ever have it just turns out its actually also pretty important to have friends you can do relatively meaningless things with like going for a walk or drinking or just hanging out   so two different categories none more real than the other
  i meeeeaaan youre not really gonna see the true them through online no matter what
  im just hurt and i want to read opinions  i am convinced that the last person i called a friend was using me for years and they suddenly lost interest
  yeah just like friends irl
  it sucks but try to think that at least they were there and they did care at some point
  not true   they exist but whether or not they last is another factor   ive been friends with mine for over 15 years
its simple and many of you wont like it  some guy moved into the house next to mine i need to walk past his front door to get in or out  he has a 40kg pitbull a big baby according to him  its a fucking murder weapon and super aggressive  it reeks i cant keep the windows of my flat open  it constantly barks often at night and for hours  again its super dangerous  often times this monster is not leashed and when its leashed its a lot more aggressive and protective trying to reach those walking by unless one walks pressed to the wall it will reach you one of the neighbours was nearly bitten and would have been had her boyfriend not pulled her back last second    question how do i kill it i imagine poison is the way to go whats the best way to do it    inb4 talk to the manager call the cops  3rd world country nobody cares to make things worse hes the propertys managers brother  inb4 uhh dont hurt muh puppy its not his fault  suck a dick im not gonna get bitten
  carbon monoxide poisoning you said you cant open windows and its a third world country get a generator in there as a power source and gas the dog and possibly everyone else and then sue the owner after you barely escape and then retire comfortably
  learn to stop being bitch cuck and play with the doge
i hope when you go to poison it it literally rips your face off
  its a fucking murder weapon    youre a pussy anon its just a dog its not a threat to you just kick it if it tries to bite you youre probably twice its size    the owner does seem irresponsible no one should get bit but you could try asking him to keep it leashed buy him a shorter chain and dont be a confrontational asshole when you talk to him
just buy some meat poison it and throw it to the dog at night   not hard op
  shoot the dog  3rd world country nobody cares to make things worse hes the propertys managers brother  make sure to have enough ammo to take out the property manager and his brother and their families when they come at you for honor killing    alternatively take a few hard swings at the dog with an aluminum bat when it jumps at you be sure to connect every time it jumps at you then just carry around the bat whenever youre near the dog and it should respect or fear you and keep its distance from the greater predator    alternatively make friends with the dog by bribing it with high caloric dog treats it may never respect you but it will consider you a foodgiver instead of a potential interloper it might still jump at you for treats but wont attack
oh this is easy it relies on it being unleashed though and you should probably have you or a neighbor babysit the trap so you dont inadvertently poison a very stupid kid or someone elses pet    you leave a container of antifreeze out this is a common trap people use to kill cats and dogs that wander into their yard regularly
  pitbulls are the niggers of dogs carry a knife with yourself in case it tries to attack you
  theres no reason for an entire community to suffer for one dick heads animal     in the states hed be able to call animal control and since were not an aristocracy theyd tell him to put the stupid fucking thing somewhere else or at least put it on a shorter leash this is his only recourse and its stupid to judge him for taking it what if you were in this situation what if you had kids that had to walk by this thing every day on their way to school its absurd
op can you buy chocolate covered raisins in your 3rd world country unrelated to your problem just curious
  chocolate
  let it bite you  call cops   dog get put down     that easy
  this  crackers/bread/hotdogs covered in peanut butter after that  chocolate  grapes  tomatoes  all have negative effects on dogs    if you get called on it the dog got into your garbage easy excuse
  question how do i kill it i imagine poison is the way to go whats the best way to do it  dont  my neighbors have a big scary mastiff that barks at me when im walking to the gym  you know what i do  i walk on the other side of the street    its not that hard has it bitten you  and have you even talked to its owner
  i give my dog chocolate occasionally it doesnt poison him
pit bulls are banned in the uk cause they have killed a few children get a load of old tablets and stuff them into a big sausage and chuck it to the fucker that will do the trick
how do i know if im a practise girlfriend
if you cant spell practice you are probably a practice gf sorry for your loss
  mfw yanks take words and spell them wrong and blame us 100 years later
  if your bf plays fortnite watches twitch struggles with hygiene and expects sexual favors for nothing in return then youre probably a practice gf
  he doesnt play fortnite but we both play vidya otherwise none of those things i think
  this thread starts after a how to get rid of practicegfthread picks up momentum  coincidence i think not    its fun to see insecurities beeing spread over this board
  well yeah i cant ask if i dont know if the thing exists
  ask your nigga what his 5year plan is if in it there is not even a slight mention of you that means that he does not see you in his future and is thus just using you as a momentary cumrag      i expect sexual favors for nothing in return from my actual longterm willprobablymarry gf this is just normal unless you are a beta
  protip it only exists for sociopaths who happen to be manchildren  thats a pretty small group of people so i dont think it should be a real concern
  im in his five year plan but one would imagine it would be easy to lie about      ha okay thats fair from the thread it seemed to be a lot of people so i was getting pretty worried
    op if youre dating this guy then run lol
  ha no but i thought that too
  remember that were in an echo chamber and also a lot of posts here are weirdos larping or just plain bait
  i do asshole behavior girls will break up with you over and if you dont youre a beta  why do you enjoy creating incels what element of your being is broken so as to make you enjoy bringing this suffering into existence
  im in his fiveyear plan but one would imagine it would be easy to lie about  yeah it is easy to lie about but if he lies about this hell lie about everything i just think this would be the easiest way to catch him if he is not paying attention but hey i will give you the nuclear bomb    and when i say the nuclear bomb i say that my gf actually did this shit to me and if i had any ill intentions i would have been caught so one time i got really high but im not a drug person so it fucked me badly after that my girlfriend nursed me in bed all night while i talked bullshit and when i was at the peak of complete retardation she asked me if i really loved her we are still together so you can guess what happened from there    do this to your guy i can tell you that i was not using my brain at the time i was in autopilot if my gf had been a practice gf i would have probably said no lol i just like that ass or some shit
    drop the headcanon softies when you have my body my cock and my attitude what women enjoy is submitting themselves to me i dont need to put on a show for them or anything they just want my cock inside of them that badly when i tell my girlfriend to suck my dick she gets on her knees immediately because just getting to play with my dick is enough to make her happy and when i decide that this time i want to fuck her she cries of happiness    if this is not how your woman reacts to sex with you trust me that she is getting this treatment from someone else because deep down this is how women actually like to be treated all women want is a daddy to order them around so that they can be a good girl
  
  if youre gonna larp be somewhat realistic about it
  i genuinely feel sad that for some men what i describe is so far from their own experience that they conclude it must be a lie that or it is delusional women that know theyve been with guys like me dozens of times but it ended badly for them so they want to pretend it never happened and pretend that this is not how women are     either way this is sad why do you deny your own instincts
  what i love about these incel larps is how theyre nothing like what chad actually talks like
  ah i see you must be on the younger side youve met young chad yeah young chad is a bit different but you know even chad has to settle down eventually you should talk to your local older chads wife to see how things go when old chad gets back from the office
  chad doesnt know the chad meme exists because hes a turbo normie retard try harder
  chad is not cultured   oh youve been dating fake chad the guy who is attractive but literally has nothing else going on for them yeah thats not chad we call those deadbeats dont worry its not like a girl like you would ever get a chance with the real deal im talking true chad is attractive does sports but is also getting a degree in finance or economics comes from a good family and is very much in touch with culture in general
    this reply is delicious filled my appetite
  chad meme is a part of the canon now it seems
when following up on a retail or fast food service job is it better to call or to walk in and ask to speak to the manager    what times are best for doing both of these    any other useful information i should know when trying to get one of these jobs
i dont know anon ive never had a job
  calling after your apply is fine try to do it during hours the place isnt busy so if food around 2 or 3 after lunch rush if retail 11 or 12 after morning set up is done but before they have tones of shoppers in
  thanks for the information    how exactly should the call go im thinking just asking if the manager is available and then once i am speaking to them i will tell them ive put in an application for position and wanted to follow up to see if there are any questions they would have for myself
  your best bet is to simply walk in and ask to speak to the manager first thing you do obviously be like hey sorry dont mean to bother you i know how busy this place can be but if youre looking for extra staff heres my cv etc    following up is actually pointless and more often than not makes you look like a creepy weirdo just make a strong first impression i was an assistant manager and was told to tell people that we hadnt decided yet if they came in asking why they hadnt been hired yet or hadnt received a phone call or whatever    if someone came in and asked to speak to manager and was friendly and everything theyd sometimes get interviewed and hired on the spot meanwhile people who just applied online or like quietly gave me their cvs and was like oh uh uhm hi give this to your manager pls thanks bye would obviously never hear from us
  do you believe this to be the case in situations where you need to apply online    i will try and make sure to hand in applications in person from now on otherwise though thank you for the information
ive got a classic for you /adv/ whats a painless or atleast pretty close to painless way to kill myself inb4 1 800 2738255
dont fucking do it man killing yourself is the worst thing you could ever do
  are you still there
dont do it life sucks but its worth it think of all the challenges metamorphoses and love youre yet to experience if only you hold on being the best you can be in a flawed unjust world is how you touch god love ya anon donnae do it mate
  yikes you lost me at love  not op but still you know you gotta choose your words a large part of why im depressed is because i dont get any love and i dont see that changing
  if youre killing yourself out of depression or despair i agree with normies life and death are the same if you surrender to despair you are already in hell regardless of being alive it is not that someone will condemn you to hell but your walking further in like anyone else with problems like addiction or destructive personalities  i wont say never kill yourself though only for reasons like determination to prove a point defend your honor or prevent your life inconveniencing others that last one is difficult to distinguish from depression however so its important to examine your abilities closely before ending your life and prepare yourself to still have the right mind set its almost impossible that your actually incapable of contributing some how usually unless were talking late 90s severe breakdown  all that said if you have a good reason to kill yourself than you wouldnt be a bitch concerned with pain id shoot myself in the heart instead of the head so id be able to have the complete death experience pain and all
  unless access to strong opiates in which case death will be negative painless then the answer is and always will be the exit bag    next
  yikes you lost me at love  huh i wonder why youre depressed sorry mate but if youre over the age of 20 you gotta start taking some responsibility for the things that are lacking in your life some people have it shit for sure some people have it so shit that its almost hopeless theyll ever crawl out of the chasm theyve been tossed into does that mean you should give up does that mean you should turn your nose up at the word love like its some holy grail make life take the lemons back you son of a bitch
  you probably tried already but i recommend seeing a psychiatrist and trying different medications for depression only kill yourself if your depression is treatmentresistant in which case theres nothing you can do
  razors pain you   rivers are damp   acids stain you   and drugs cause cramp  guns arent lawful   nooses give   gas smells awful   you might as well live      dorothy parker
  if youre worried about pain youre not ready to go
im at my fucking wits end with my roommates    theyre rude and inconsiderate and i dont know how to handle it any longer just a few things from the past weekend alone    blast music when its not appropriate late as fuck or early as fuck  watch netflix through their speakers on their laptops when other people are trying to sleep when they could wear headphones  cook a full pork shoulder banging pots and pans at 2 am when the whole house can hear what happens in the kitchen  continually buy things for the house that are not necessities and expect everyone to chip in without clarifying if everyone was okay with it beforehand    what do
thank saint ignucius i dont live in murica
    what you mean
have you tried talking to them
  well simple solution to the last thing i didnt ask for it im not putting money towards it jackass youre a moron if youre supplementing their purchases the other stuff i mean they do live there too dude its part of living with roommates either get used to it or move out the music thing is pretty obnixious though
  i had my own aparment while i went to uni
this evening my curvy asian slut is coming over to get laid  she likes things rough including choking hair pulling super rough fingering throating and fucking and gets wet when shes made to do things she didnt want to  im looking for creative suggestions on how to use my fuckpuppet  the more creative the better and past stories of what youve done are always welcome    note pic is not her but similar shes a little skinnier and shorter
judging by another thread avoid pins in the nipples
  ugh this would be my body if only i had a flat stomach i should just get surgery already
  just stop eating so much fatty
put a collar on her and walk her around commanding her to do lewd things for you to see  handcuff her to the bed blindfold her and do lewd shit bonus points if you lick her anywhere while you have a ice cube in your mouth  buy sex candles but dont tell her theyre safe make her believe theyre regular candles   pour the wax on her and watch her squirm while shes handcuffed or on a leash when youre commanding her to be a good girl and hold still  sex candles dont hurt they have a very low melting temperature very safe and fun   write dirty things all over her and make her read them outloud to you  fuck get doggy style in front of a mirror after doing other rough stuff so her makeup is running and make her watch you fuck her      i laughed
  this would be my body if i ate more  its tempting
  you should eat more then post the results because that body is top tier
  great suggestions she loves to hate anal so ill combine the mirror doggy idea with the earlier obligatory anal suggestion to make sure we fully enjoy her facial expressions during
  let me expand on this    my sub was male but the fun still applies     invite sub over  tell sub to get undressed immediately and get on all 4s  put dog ears on him and tell him its time to play with my pup  put a vibrator in him  make him tell me who he belongs to and that hes my little slut  flip him over chain him up whip out the supplies  vibrating cock ring ice cubes cooling lube and sex candles  tell him were going to play a game  every time he makes a sound i will slap him full force across the face  put ice cube in my mouth and let it melt  lick him all over  can see him struggling not to make a sound  whip out the cooling lube   start pleasuring him with it  slap him a couple times then put the cock ring on him  rub the ice cube on him one more time then light the candle  hes visibly scared  start dripping it all over the cold parts  slap him for whimpering   after he goes a good while of not making noises but has tears in his eyes and precum dripping i have my way with him    just do the same deal reverse the sexes
i wish i had that body
  not her but you cant spot reduce if she loses weight it could just as easily disappear from her tits and ass instead of her tummy
  excellent idea i think ill have to try it out
  or just fuck more for exercise think several hours a day commit already fatty
try holding hands
  whoa now lets not get too extreme 
  yiff in hell furfag
i feel guilty for making this suggestion but depending on how intimate shes willing to get fuck her while shes laid out on her back pushing her legs back to her shoulders make strong eye contact and tell her to listen her mouth while you spit in it
  unironically this
  wwoof 
ok so i have friends for the first time in my life  what now what are typical activities friends do together
  wish i could help you bud i dont see my mates as often as id like to    honestly we usually just arrange to meet up in the town centre wander about and have some banter go mcdonalds for lunch or something and maybe play pool at a bar
  my best friend my other close friends and i do these things together    talk about politics  eat at the dining hall at his uni  play vidya  watch movies  sit around the fire pit roasting smores  tease our younger friend  go hiking  go to taco mac for wings  watch hockey  practice jiu jitsu  listen to music  talk about our girlfriends  smoke cigars/cigarettes  pet dogs  help each other with car troubles  go to hockey games  ghost hunt like retards    we also get drunk somewhat frequently and do any of the above while drunk banter also plays a big role in our relationship we do it almost constantly im a diagnosed sperg and those guys have helped me come out of my shell get over some of my fears and get a qt gf be good to your friends anon
    fuck me this makes me so anxious its so much easier to talk in person than text i wish i wasnt the one organizing this  ok so how do you talk to eachother a groupchat facebook messenger
  yeah we have a group chat that we arrange meetups on outside of arranging meetups we dont talk much outside irl because were not active on social media or anything plus we just like good old fashioned irl hijinks
  well these people are also my coworkers so we see each other at least a few days a week i live in a really historic town so there is a lot to see   ill probably ask some of them tomorrow
what is the best way to test whether or not someone is susceptible to see the future i have a friend who has told me about their experiences and how they would wake up and know something like they have a knife in their backpack and other things her family was involved in a lot of cult shit but i dont think that is related so what is the best way to go about it i made this post on x but the board is pretty shit right now
bump
we can all see the future it happens all the time you just treat it like normal     like if you set a bunch of dominos you push the first one and theyre all falling before it even happens you know the last one will fall you have perceived seconds into the future   when you drive a car you dont crash even down the highway thats because speed limits are set based on how quick we can react and how well we see the future if a child walks in front of your car you hit the brakes because in the future youll hit him and kill him so youve jumped timelines by using your willpower in the present to modify the future   you know youll starve in the winter unless you save your crops from the summer so you make storehouses  wind up a clock real well and you know itll still be ticking 3 months from now   you are aware you will die one day   and so on    so seeing the future is one of those mystical traits about our braincells we dont fully understand weve come to understand that temporal brain activity happens during our sleep women get more nightmares when theyre pregnant as a lifesaving measure they dream about very bad timelines so they can use their willpower to avoid them when theyre awake and so on but we dont understand it better afaik just something about dreams really puts you in touch with your perception of the future like when youre eyes are out of focus and just for a moment they pop into focus and you can see visually very clearly like that     clairvoyants are thus people who are exceptionally able to predict the future you might know them as really good investors ceos engineers and so on because these jobs depend greatly on a sense of clairvoyance these jobs are also exclusivebyforce because people without any clairvoyance like women and certain racial minorities tend to be much worse at these jobs
what racial minorities
  i dont want to get into a racist discussion but there are people who lack the dna/genes that gives them a strong clairvoyant mind women have a weaker sense of the future in general and certain minorities do too you can see it when the person is a bad investor even if they try if they cant make good choices even when the consequences are obvious cant raise kids well or gather resources and so on     im not talking about unintelligent people thats another cause for these dysfunctions specifically there are people who are weaker at perceiving future events     another way this is explained is cause and effect some people have a weak sense of cause and effect this causes them to vote for bad government policies  not because theyre bad people or uneducated but because they cant perceive the future even if its obvious it really requires a mystical spark of clairvoyance to do these things     another example is repeat offenders in jail casting aside psychos and aggressive people some people dont understand the consequence they simply cant perceive that crime means arrest means jail means no freedom to a normal person like you and i well avoid crime so easily and naturally because we know that well end up in jail if we dont we can perceive down this timeline so you get this small group of people with an exceptionally low cognizance in the future who end up in jail over and over because they cant see the obvious future
sorry i left for like 20 mins but what can you do in the way of testing it also you seem to be talking about it in the short term they have only had visions that involve a day or so of time away from having it then it becoming relevant
bump
  im sorry but i dont know how to test it     take dmt if youre adventurous a high dose it made me perceive time differently for just a few minutes really interesting experience
  well fuck
4 years ago i started to have memory loss and immediately went to the hospital to get helpi was diagnosed as delusional and nobody ever listened to me againrecently a few months ago i have begun to develop serious symptoms like autonomic dysfunction sometimes i feel like i am suffocating it is very painful and i cannot think or speak when i have breathing difficulties the doctors are starting to realize that the only explanation is a neurological disorder of the brain and spinal cord how am i supposed to recover    for 4 years i have been arguing and arguing with family and doctors over a serious health condition which everyone claimed was a delusion i have suffered permanent spinal damage from the medical malpractice    how can i just return to normal society like this after what was done to me i will never see myself as the same as others
youre not right until you get an mri and they see damage in your brain and spine causing this dont act so smug just yet what you are describing could just be anxiety or panic attacks
  absolutely not autonomic dysfunction is a disease of the central nervous system and i have already been diagnosed with it as of now i am diagnosed with a neurological disease
  false diagnoses are entirely possible maybe they just wanted to shut your crazy ass up were you diagnosed based on symptoms you described or an image scan like an mri
  i was diagnosed using an ekg and a tilt table test
i hate every woman in my boyfriends life family or not i know its weird im trying to stop and get over myself but i just hate when he gives other women more attention than me it pisses me off i am sheltered and not from a close family so i feel like like everyone in his family is oddly close  i hate it his 22 year old male cousin still cuddles up to his 16 year old sister in her bed for example i just hate how close everyone is in his family it makes me uncomfortable guys i literally had a nightmare one night that my bf was fucking his mom  im in so much fear over it lol i think i need help pls help me i know if he finds out how crazy jealous i am of his women family members he will think im weird  leave or something i think i am fucked in the head for this i get so uncomfortable when they like touch him and stuff it makes me feel weird  when they call him hunny and the married women in the family have him over like twice a week having him do chores for them pls dont be to harsh i know this is weird why does my mind work like this
guys i literally get so bitter and jealous he can already tell i think  the way my head works when they are touching him or something my mind thinks they are doing it on purpose to show ownership  to purposely make me jealous
its not jealousy unless you want to substitute yourself into these situations    you might not be identifying your feeling correctly
  explain more please im trying to understand idk why my thinking is so screwed up for situations that are normal to others
  what kind of feeling could it be
 i can agree this is a little strange i have quite a close family but things like touching and calling each other names like hunny arent things at all    jealousy may not sound exactly right here but worries of that which your boyfriend might be doing shady things behind your back with his own family or something    either way the jealousy part does seem to be the attention part but its just such a complicated issue for some randomers on 4chan to really analyze and give a detailed and proper way to handle it    so the best you can do is relax and start to analyze things with a levelheaded mind    ask yourself are they just a happy loving connected family and im just seeing the way they treating each other as something more    anyway theyre his family he isnt going to leave you for them so no matter what attention he gives dont be too worried he would be a really messed up person to leave you for them but the best way is to just all come together happily    this is the best advice i can give its really complicated and i wish the best
  this is so well written i am sorry all my shit was jumbled together lol     my boyfriends father passed away when he was young although his parents were divorced at the time and his father was remarried his mother pushes herself on his dad side of the family as the widowed wife victim type of roll its clear to see her presents isnt very much welcomed  its not her they really invite out like i said my boyfriends dad was remarried so i could see how this would make the real widowed wife feel like it would be understandable her being there with her 23 year old son that could go by himself to the family things on his dads side if she was pushing this whole widowed wife victim roll on them constantly its very strange anyways side tracked back to the point she guilt trips him and manipulates him telling him his father told him to take care of her and just a bunch of weird non sense that makes my boyfriend drops our plans and me for whatever small thing it is that she needs him to do she depends on him very emotionally i feel like they are a lot like husband  wife i think she replaced his dad with the only thing she had left which is her son but it just makes me so uncomfortable to be around it all the time the nick names when hes 23 and the touching when i was comforting him the other day she came up and brushed his cheek like it all around gives me a bad vibe and i hate it theres so much to include in this posting
  i made a lot of typos in this presence role drop im sorry if i sound stupid i am so tired x
 one of the best things you can do is come forward with your emotions    you can speak with her one on one kindly and just explain to her you feel uncomfortable with how youre acting around him    it may also be a good idea to speak with him maybe he feels uncomfortable but like a guy does he holds it inside because he doesnt want to be kind    he may feel off by it or maybe it is how she always treated him and he wont notice just do what is best for your relationship and do a bit of nonintrusive investigating if you can just in case theres something shady going on you know    and with some of the things you said those might be valid reasons why that stuff happens youll just need to ask and talk and just find out more for your own sake in the relationship
    okay this is some more specific shit    a steprelative isnt really a woman family member the same way his two oppositesex cousins are    it sounds like you might have some concerns that bear further review but you cant handle them effectively if you dont calm the fuck down like  said and cant formulate a clear thought    be cool and pay attention some things are probably just the differences between you and you need to use your judgement with reasoning about what actually isnt a problem and what might reasonably be a problem
i use to be like you    hell break your heart and youll learn how to be more accepting of female/male platonic relationships just for the sake of keeping the person you love around
  this is so sad i sometimes feel not as loved as his family is  its never a problem ive had in relationships before i really dont know how to handle it i hate when i get dropped for them i hate how they constantly call him  need him my relationship feels so sabotaged by his own family
 you should sincerely share the feelings you have with him dont hide the feelings but also do take care and prepare for what may come out of it     be strong girl
  thanks so much x     i think he knows i dont think its normal ive explained to him how maybe i just come from a different family where not everyone is so close ya know like my mom never touched on my brother or anything or emotionally relayed on him i think he understands but not fully because my abnormal is his normal if it was a make it break i feel he would definitely drop me  not the lovey dovey act with his other family members thanks for your encouragement x
 good to hear just keep it up and do what your heart tells you and use the advice provided to help    bye anon 
  sounds like you have some abandonment issues wheres your dad    take up some hobbies see a psychologist and perhaps study a bit of the core principles of buddhism like creating more space in between thoughts and not attaching your emotions to thoughts
  youre jealous over your boyfriends mom and aunts and shit calling him honey and touching him get a fucking grip youre fucked in the head youre absolutely right    i get jealous too but over my boyfriends female friends not his family he has a twin sister hes close to and it doesnt even cross my mind to feel jealous thats some next level fuckery
itt emotionally stunted 4chaners who didnt have moms that called them by affectionate pet names and think terms like honey and dear are reserved for romantic couplings    the only name i can think of that would be sort of weird and inappropriate is if she were calling him babe or baby otherwise get the fuck over it
  nah i personally dont feel its a normal relationship thats the problem im dealing with trying to find out if these emotions are invalid or valid  if valid i need to get to the bottom of what causes them so i can fix it     i am from a state that gets poked fun at a lot for being incest ridden  ive personally have not ever met a family where the members are this close but who knows maybe im crazy im just trying to solve this thanks for your input xx
  theres also a lot i didnt mention theres far much more to this his mother is very jealous also my boyfriend has told me things like she will guilt trip him and make him feel bad for being around me to much so he ends up doing something with her instead like ofc this is where it begins to cause issues because now im also getting jealous because thats putting me in competition with someone for my boyfriends time along with the fucking baby talk i cant stand  the touching  shit when im touching him its weird vibes i feel weird around it
  his family is affectionate with him and yours wasnt with you so you feel uncomfortable but being affectionate with your family in the way youre describing is healthy and normal this is a personal issue i suggest you look into therapy to deal with the attachment issues you clearly have stemming from your emotionally invalidating childhood
also to add to all of this she wont even let my bf leave the state he lives in because she will throw a huge fit crying and all begging him not to  telling him he cant go it feels like my boyfriend has a wife its pathetic i have to be in competition with his mother and family  i have to fight for him with them
some men have whats the word for a kept girl like not married but has like her own card and shit a few mistresss that live in penthouses and they dont really let them go anywhere they cant keep these beautiful girls from sleeping around because a that was never part of the deal and b youve got a wife kids and other girls so if you cant stop them from sleeping around  well lets be honest if your a rich fuck living in a penthouse you probably deserve to hear this from someone fucking one of your open relationship side pieces sometimes they really like the idea of some idiot or brave minimum wage or criminal or thief running up there to get things a bit dirty and make it interesting like they are really eager and find it worth the trouble they might have to deal with later like losing their job or something that kind of commitment for a quick lay sometimes is all they need to feel like they are still worth all that money you spend on them and never really pay attention to otherwise
cool story bro
hey you can call me what you will but i just happen to speak the truth and shine a light on situations most people will not talk about dont shoot the messenger for saying the things other people are thinking but arent brave enough to say if my words happen to enlighten a few people along the way then my actual job will have been done and i can pleasantly say have a nice day 
how do i find myself im 20 years old and my whole life ive just floated through life by changing myself to get people to accept me i no longer seek acceptance i want to find out who i am and define my own personality how can i go about this
what are your values
  damn thats me you took my feelings and put it into words im gonna check in on this thread to see what you come up with in the meantime good luck anon
  ask yourself simple questions    what do i like to do  what are some interests/hobbies that i might like/are interesting  what are some goals for my future graduading/getting promoted at work  why do my friends like me  what are some things i do different from person to person that i cant explain
get an education you will be able to better identify what interests you in life    i never understood why people expect life to just slap them in the face with what their personal meaning is you have to figure that out for yourself get out experience life live a little try not to overthink things    the issue is people think they can just sit and think about what they like in life and that is enough you need to physically experience things to realize what you like you might think you like something but until youre actually doing it you can never truly know
  never change yourself to fit in    try reading some philosophy   start with the classics and move upward be careful about material starting in the late 1800s to the early 1900s because very bad people got involved in what they refer to as social science
  find your fight song the soundtrack of your life will help you define yourself in the context of the world around you
  never change yourself to fit in  but dont take that to mean that you should never change     if who you are is a collection of authentic expressions youre already halfway there because changing for the better starts with a stable base of who you are as a person thats why i asked about your values if you dont know what that means its why you dont fit in youre busy keeping up with what other people want which is a fallacy since you should be achieving your own desires whereas if you cant even answer you lack the capacity to even know what an authentic expression is and you need to start there    what is an authentic expression well go on /pol/ 999/1000 posts are just garbage theyre people who obviously dont believe what theyre saying the 1/1000 posts that make your hairs stand up those are the actual stormfags those are the people we will need to confront in the street with guns if they decide to act as tough as they talk and they are a force the other 999 are their cheerleaders and are similarly equipped to cheerleaders and since they have innie dicks and dress like traps irl you cant tell stormfront is actually tough and hard to kill and they have modern strats
  truth to self and those around me transparency and authenticity are important to me im not so religious i dont necessarily believe in a god but i do believe in a higher power im all about unity and working together to solve problems love wisdom inner peace are some others    i like to play video games a lot but theyre getting shittier so im weening myself off of them to focus on other hobbies like creating/listening to music im working on my bachelors scam i one day plan to own my business but im contemplating ideas still i really dont know why my friends like me to be honest ive always been the weirdest dude im any of my friend groups like a sore thumb personality wise they think im funny i guess    how do you suppose an education helps me find myself im in my junior year at university and i cant stand it it could be the zoomer in me but college drains my soul force im the type who prefers to learn hands on rather than through a lecture i couldnt imagine how it helps me find myself    got any personal recs    i have plenty of these i love music    well i feel that i have a stable base of core values that ive followed since childhood i didnt necessarily change my core self to fit in but i adopted a mask with different friend groups i can adapt to anybody i meet by analyzing their speech looks expressions i always went through life adapting to new friend groups to fit in and not look like an outcast inside ive always felt different from these friend groups i always just played the part and showed up they were decent friends but that didnt stop me from feeling disconnected anyways this has occurred all throughout my life and now i fee like its done damage to my sense of self i want to regain myself
  i consciously started talking less that was the first step

the girl who i thought had loved me is a pathological liar and sociopath ive noticed some of her lies and found out she sent nudes to a friend she doesnt know that i know and no i wont post em do i bail out now knowing shes incapable of love or emotion or stay in to escape being a virgin incel  pic related
hit it and quit it
    no urgency to loose virginity  look elsewhere the world is vast there are many girls which would suit you better
  mever stick your dick into crazy
  should i give a sociopath more leverage over me by having sex with her  what a fucking idiot
  shes already fucked half the people i know might as well get in on the action
  the reason you dont have an actually decent romantic partner is because youre pathetic

im naturally motivated but like think of the consequences of not doing it you could get bad grades and shit and then start small just focus on the outline maybe give yourself time limits spend fifteen minutes working on something specific and then maybe take a five minute break also get off your phone removing distractions so theres nothing to do but the project is important
  just do it get started dont overthink it at first  first you should be writing anything down so you have something to hand in at least and by doing this you should eventually get into the flow of writing  remember that no one is a good writer in the first draft you can edit later and the right words will probably come to you after a while  good luck
if youre easily distracted use a pomoro timer just research it if u dont know
be me  hadnt had a gf  virgin    i lack experience in this field how do i tell if a girl is really into me or is she just being friendly and kind  happened to me once  one girl was interested in me  tfw realized it 4 months ago  tfw i was dumb enough and thought she is just being friendly  i dont want this to happen again
  correction  tfw realized it 4 months late
how do you know she was into you  im not trying to undermine your confidence but i have to ask
should i tell my cousin i have a crush on her
  if you are in the northern us no  if you are in the southern us yes  adjust as applicable for your countrys rednecks
  first show her your penis then ask
  yes
a few hours ago i called the police about my boyfriend who was threatening to kill himself they said they would call me back its been 5 hours since that and he isnt replying to my texts should i call the police again and see if he was alright or not
1st mistake never call the police on someone threatening to kill themselves they are not trained to deal with a situation like this and will likely make it worse
  is there something keeping you from going over to check on him maybe bring a close friend along does he have roomates or family you can call to check on him
  theyll threaten that they will kill him if he kills himself
  a few hours ago i called the police about my boyfriend who was threatening to kill himself    why i hope to god youre not american    holy shit yes phone the police back use them to try and contact your boyfriend
  uh no they just arrest the suicidal guy and take him to a hospital
    it kinda depends on how competent the cop is there are the types that guffaw and blow off the training for this kind of stuff because they think its a waste of time
  uh no they just arrest the suicidal guy and take him to a hospital    thats what he said cops do not have the training for that half the time they go in guns drawn
  what would you do
    psychologist here this statement is 100 false literally the exact opposite is true    you should always call 911 if someone is threatening suicide and the police are well trained to address this situation
to answer your question keep calling the specific police department until they give you an answer
  i dont really want to get into my personal experience but you are not correct and are full of shit
    lol ok buddy     literally any psychologist or social worker will tell you that if you are with someone and they say theyre suicidal you need to take them to a hospital right away and if youre not with them like ops case you call 911 right away     but hey just disregard thousands of people who study mental health for a living and decades of history because of one silly story of yours
  i called the veterans crisis line cause i hadnt slept in three days they asked me if i had suicidal thoughts then plan then intent i told them i had thoughts i was depressed but had no plan and no intention of actually killing g my self they called the police on me anyways 45 mins later nine members of swat kicked down my door and threatened to kill me if i resisted or made sudden moves they stripped searched me and took me in handcoves to the local er where i was stripped searched again i never resisted and never made any threats to myself or others i simply had mild passing thoughts of suicide my psychiatrist and therapist knew about them   so fuck you fuck the police fuck doctors fuck the va and fuck the system
  fellow psych here you beat me to it shakes fist politely
  sounds like a shit situation but one anecdotal incidence isnt enough to debunk an entire field of scientific study sorry you went through that
  bitch do you not realize why most people become police officers in the first place protip its not to serve and protect
    well im sorry but thats an extremely unusual case that police department fucked up big time it sounds like the va told them you had a gun and were a danger to yourself or others     thats not how that are supposed to handle it    but in most cases the police and emt show up and take the person to the hospital which can save lives
  it isnt one i later talked to my dr at the va this happens all the time at least to vets fuck i was an 88m for christs sake not even a combat arms mos
  see    
  everyone supports the troops while theyre away killing and getting killed by brown people in the middle east yet when they get home theyre treated as half a step up from a school shooter the entire system is fucked anon and im sorry you had to go through that
  this cops arent perfect but its best to call them in this situation    i dont really want to call you a retarded for your personal unconfirmed anectdote but you are a retard    call the police again hope for the best but prepare for the worst and if it is the worst please be okay its normal after a suicide for loved ones to blame themselves but its not your fault best of luck op
  thanks
  get off your ass and go over there you fucking idiot call the police if you want them to kill him before he kills himself
    sounds like typical va bullshit    im sorry man but in their defense they get a lot of armed veterans who are willing to shoot people before blowing their own head off so the va treats every suicide call like that     again im sorry but many police are properly trained for a suicide call
  thats like  one of the only things you ever see police used for in tv and movies thousands of people kill themselves every year holy fuck police are retarded
  yeah i get that but i was calling about having a problem with my headache medication i was taking and was told to call them as i had just started it they shouldnt have been called at all next time well next time it might be different
  psychologists are fucking retarded narcissists who use their patients to do therapy on themselves all they do is keep asking questions and try to trap people in their own heads so they can feel like they caught a fish i was looking for jobs but its all chef stuff i want to work with my hands but not that why not um because im not good with urgent situations i need something more simple and laid back why is that um because thats the way it is do you get anxious literally right after somebody said something dressed them out yes i do take these pills    fucking useless fucks these people are so fucked they get this superiority complex where they go oh i read the book so i know everythint then they refuse to adapt or provide actual solutions every single thing these people say was spoon fed to then by their professors because they are incapable of analyzing a situation on the spot and providing anything but a canned response     most people experiencing mental illness are people who are experiencing true problems but due to the complexity and chaos of the world they are forced to just suppress their stress or anger none of this gay shit happened until society became this sociopath paradise it is today remember all those movies about redemption and shit people making sacrifices to held somebody down on their luck zero of that shit happens today parents are more focused on tv than their kids  zero psychopath psychologists would ever point out this shit because they are fucking retarded whats great is just browsing these sites a few days a week seeing actual raw human thoughts would probly help these fucktards come up with real solutions  real solutions dont make money though weekly appointments and meds do
    you sure sound mad    just fyi all a good shrink really does is listen to the client     dont like it then stop coming every week
  every vet i ever met was a fucking psychopath absolutely selfish psychopaths who did their service for themselves probably because they realized they wouldnt be seen as badass after high school ended know one dude who is 30 and still goes up to people like im more better than you another dude joined literally to kill niggers amazing how somebody who was abused and steals to support their heroin habit isnt excused neither are bullied school shooters everyone despite their circumstance is forced to deal with their shit or they fail magically  douchebag marines  all people who have the same personality  all people who wanted to satisfy their ego all people who just wanted to dominate others   they find out nobody gives a fuck instead of dominating muslims their dumb ass friends died literally for oil and then people whose narcissism is fueled by a license to kill come back and nobody cares so they do their best to cause as much trouble as they can these arent fucking heros  thats just a key part of your propaganda game  like you said yes  everyone always uses the troops to push their agenda then they dont give a fuck same with you fuck these murderer faggots they need a cage not sympathy
  lol youve met some shit vets i was a truck driver i never fired my gun in anger most people outside my friends family and the government dont know i served most people i know did it for the gi bill same as me
  every vet i ever met was a fucking psychopath  confirmation bias  like me
  the idea of education and psychotherapy are actually flawless what youre complaining about is human incompetence you can blame every system in existence for not being good enough but at the end of the day its mostly the incompetent human operators including you who make social hardship
  also therapy actually saves the lives of people who are psychotic drugaddicted victimized or suicidally depressed if someone is in a clinical setting bitching about some existential shit that is just an issue every human faces then theyre lucky to get any direct reply to it at all
  also mental illness is an accurate and correct term for people who suffer from psychiatric disorders if you dont think problems like hallucinating or doing drugs until you die are maladies then you are mistaken
  im having suicide ideation and cant talk about it with my therapist for fear of being locked in a loony bin for 72 hours and permanently having that on my record    what a world
are tall women unattractive what do you think of tall women 510 
    since when is 510 tall    and yeah tall woman are hot
  both women must be tall to be a successful professional model i think that speaks for itself
jesus christ black women are so sexy
  im 510 dated more girls exactly my height than anything else i find tall girls attractive and taller than me is definitely not a deal breaker ive also dated girls shorter than me and i find there are drawbacks but im alright with them its mostly things like needing to bend significantly to kiss and such  being too tall will thin your dating pool but its usually still manageable
61 here tallest ill accept dating is 51 and i dont consider women taller than 53 as women anymore
  im 178cm and i had an ex that was 185  she couldnt wear high heels but thats it
  i have a crush on a 6ft tall girl right now     t 511 manlet    its not the height that makes you unattractive its that you wont date down in height and limit yourself severely
51011 girl here   theres been times where i just cry while looking at my limbs and curlling up so tight in a ball hoping id fuse together   i know people say im not that tall   but i feel so unnatural  walking around in crowds feels like im walking around a middleschool   people give me mean looks all the time and i dont even know what i did wrong   if i do get a guys attention its mostly from his fetish and while i have no problem with it id prefer if they liked me for me
i just like women desu tall women short women chubby women skinny women if i like your face and personality whatever im 62 though so 510 doesnt seem so bad to me
i like short girls it seems like 52 to 54 is pretty much the perfect height for me and im just under 511 it has nothing to do with tall girls being unattractive its just that i like fulfilling the masculine role and being bigger than her helps me do that i once dated a very feminine girl who was pretty much exactly my height and it was honestly just physically a little bit awkward
i know most girls want a bf taller than them so id feel bad about that but tall girls arent directly unattractive
tall girls are the prettiest i love the fact i dont have to tilt my head to look them in the eyes and their lovely long legs
  64 dude here    fuck yeah tall women are attractive i dont date women shorter than 58 just wish there were more of them    nothing like the look on the face of a tall girl the first time she goes out with you in heels and youre still looking down on her you will hit it that night
  over 510  i am lanklet from europe 190cm 63 and i dont consider smol girls as dating prospects i want tall girl so i dont have to bend down to pick her up    tbh female attractivity isnt tied to her height its all about body proportions boobs waist hips face hair and so on also even completely flat girls can be sexy 3
  my gf used to think this way   it just takes times sadly we both got numbers that would be better off on the other   shes your height im 56 not a fetish thing not sure how a height fetish works shes just perfect to me     sucks that you get mean looks though
  i literally wouldnt even bother trying with a girl taller than me because most would turn me down
  im 511 and id say probably 59 would be my ideal height for a gril obviously ill take anything i can get lol but i wouldnt want her to be much taller than me unless shes got something really special going on
  obviously ill take anything i can get  this is really what it boils down to i dont and wouldnt believe a girl my height or above is really attracted to me  t 60
just fuck a man at that point
  are you retarded    first of all 511 is not a manlet and second plenty of 6 women will date shorter men    she probably doesnt like you because you lack any confidence
  its definitely a minus if shes as tall as me or taller im 18 meters fuck your imperial units bullshit convert it yourself but its by no means a deal breaker    if i do get a guys attention its mostly from his fetish and while i have no problem with it id prefer if they liked me for me  i think youre overestimating the fetish factor for being tall its not like with obese girls who get attention mostly by self titled chubby chasers
  if they are skinny to medium and have ok face then i think theyvare hot however as a 57 men i find them intimidating 
  why do you have to seek anecdotal evidence on 4chan to answer this question when you could easily look at the numerous large scale studies showing men prefer short women
so im married and i dont want to have sex anymore i had a misscarage and my husband was happy about it did not want another kid wanted me to abort it before i had the misscarage i dont want to separate because we have other kids and it would ruin their childhoods but i also cant bring myself to want to let him touch me anymore i was thinking about just telling him i dont care if he sleeps with other women
  i think if it were me id tell him id rather not have sex with him and that he should have sex with other women instead  but the better thing would probably be to tell him how you feel and that hed understand and want to make it right so that youd want him to touch you again
  useless whore let your stupid hubby have fun with your ass or get him some scorts
  he wont he doesnt care about me trying to tell him that wont help matters he wont care or understand or change if i had the financial means to leave and support my kids well on my own i would but thats not an option even if i did try to explain i dont think there is any way i could ever love him again when he has made it so clear he doesnt love me or our children
you gotta work that shit out or your kids are gonna be all kinds of fucked up
  i cant force him to love me or our kids im doing the best i can
  okay so its a matter of just getting by then i think i support your suggestion to tell him to fuck other women tell him you need some time after the miscarriage and then just hope hell never ask when youre over it sorry about the miscarriage btw
  thank you i think ill take your advice i dont really see anything else to do at this point i feel so fucking sad and depressed the only reason i havent killed myself is because of my kids
separating would yes mentally harm your kids but staying together will cause a more caustic environment for the children
  you dingnut if they your kids ever learn that their dad has been infidel what message does that send to them logically they will assume that you have done the same
  if i left id literally have to go live in a shelter with them i dont have a lot of money and no family or friends we dont fight or anything he just ignores us i know it will be hurtful to them but its better then being homeless     i dont think they will find out they are very young ill be saving money to be able to leave before they are old enough to know about sex or infidelity
why does he ignore you guys i mean clearly he liked you enough at one point to marry you and make some babbies so wtf happened between then and now that he apparently wants nothing to do with you anymore also you two still fug so the spark or whatever cant be totally dead for him right
  he dosent like our kids is what happened we had them he cant stand them was uninvolved with our first baby then 2 years later we had the second and after that he just blatantly says he hates kids cant stand them he has nothing to do with them and now ignores me to because he resents me for having the i havent liked sex since our second child was born but still did it in the hope that things would get better now that he told me he wanted me to kill our unborn baby and then was happy when i lost it from stress the thought of having sex with him gives me such bad anxiety i feel like ill have a panic attack im still nice to him make and serserve him meals clean the house wash his clothes do anything else he asks of me i just really dont want to have sex anymore i keep the babies out of his hair and try to play with them a lot so they still feel loved and cared for but it kills me that i gave them a father who hates them i had no idea he felt this way when we married he said he wanted a family but now that he has one he cabt stand it im scared hell divorce me and ill be a broke single mom and my kids lives will be even worse i work early mornings while the kids are still sleeping but barely make over minimum wage i dont have anyone to watch them to get a second job and i dont want to stick them in daycare it would cost as much money as id be making
    i think your only option is couples counseling it could save the marriage sometimes churchs offer it for free     good luck     im married with a kid i love my wife and our kid but i would be fucking pissed if my wife got pregnant again i made it very clear to her i only want one kid so she has the iud
  you sound like a typical asshole guy like your sperm shooting cock isnt just as responsible for the pregnancy as she is if you dont want another kid that badly go get snipped
    i was going to and she offered to get an iud    if she didnt offer to use birth control i was 100 going to get a vasectomy     our kid was planned and ive been a great dad and husband i just dont want any more and cooperated 100 with my wife to coordinate all this i sure am a real asshole
  you just said you would be pissed at her if she did get pregnant do you would blame her for her iud messing up you can try to backtrack but you still sound like an ass to me any man who gets pissed at a woman over a baby he helped to make is an ass it would not be just her fault and it is wrong that you would blame her glad you a good dad to the kid you do have you should rethink how you would react to an unplanned pregnancy though being upset or even considering terminating if shes open to that is fine saying youd be pissed at her or blame her isnt just my opinion
    well maybe i should have explained better its not like im cumming in my wife and going bitch you better not get pregnant    we discussed it after baby 1 was born i said with absolute certainty i did not want another and she said that was fine i told her i was gonna get snipped so she said i did not need to she would get a copper iud    so if she did get pregnant that would mean she took it out and did not tell me as in tricking me into another kid so thats why i would be angry
    also did not say at her just pissed because i dont want another so pissed at the situation     try not to project so hard op
  the way you worded it sounded really idk aggressive like you bossed her around or that its only your choice as to how many kids you guys want also the fucking pissed sounds mean i think i understand what you ment tho now that you explained more you know iuds arent 100 effective tho it would not necessarily be her going behind your back i got pregnant with our second child with an iud i had only had the thing in for 6 week when i missed my period and wound up being pregnant again i think they are more effective when they have been in longer
  he just blatantly says he hates kids  assuming youre telling the truth and not exaggerating ie he says the kids are too stressful for me right now and you interpret it as him hating them staying together will not be good for the kids mental healthif youre single despite the decrease in many metrics of quality of life there is at least a chance they can find someone to act as a caring father figure whereas if you stay they will always be around someone who wishes they didnt exist on the balance they still have better chances away from him  you probably live in a country with at least some kind of public assistanceuse your internet connection to look that up ie types and amounts of welfare qualifications for it and where to apply and prepare your options if you do end up divorcing    i should also stress that i dont mean to invalidate whatever youve gone through however it is a fact that some women men too although usually theyre more direct and dont have a need for this will make up stories like this to justify emotions they already had theres an additional mental incentive if you feel trapped in your marriage
  i got pregnant despite an iud they have something like a 51 failure rate she didnt have to lie for it to happen 1 in every 100200 is still a decent chance
    but wouldnt you still get upset when he actually goes for it with other women be honest
    the copper one is pretty damn effective     but in any case i wouldnt be at all angry with my wife if it was there and by some miracle she got pregnant not her fault at all but just upset about the situation     i would likely seek an abortion
  no hitter her literally says he fucking hates them i fucking hate kids every time they cry i cant stand children if they make a mess he isnt mean to them he doesnt say that to them just to me about them he pretty much just ignores them except to vent his annoyance at me im not going to leave now with no money and go live in a shelter with them im going to save up and get out as soon as i can provide a somewhat suitable home also if i can stick it out till they are in school i wont have to put them in daycare all day i have no intrest in finding another father figure for them i just would want to be single and focus on them and working i dont think ill even enjoy sex again and im not interested in taking time away from my kids to go after guys besides very very very few good men want to get with a single mom and father another mans kids its more likely id just get used and be exposing my kids to creeps
  no if it ment he didnt try to touch me anymore id be ecstatic
  so rather than a simple removable device your suggestion is that he undergoes a surgery to his genitals seems like feminine logic / lack thereof
    if things were this bad why didnt you get your tubes tied after kid 1    if hes a bad father with one it only gets worse with more i dont understand how women dont realize this
  you have the foresight of a fucking teenager but if thats how you really feel at the moment then sure go ahead and tell him just know youre damning your marriage and family unit to failure because you cant talk about things like an adult    soon as he gets back from having sex with another woman you wouldnt want to share a bed with you thats now how intimate relationships work
    im the guy who made that post      and i get what shes saying that each parent is 50 responsible for the making of a baby so a man should not resent his wife for becoming pregnant i totally agree     but i think when one person makes it very clear what their kid preference is then both parties need to stick to the plan to make sure there are no suprises no excuses if the birth control fails then you head to the clinic     like i said in my case i said honey im planning on going to get a vasectomy because im 100 certain i only want one kid and she said thats okay ill get the copper iud for a few years and you can get snipped if you still want to after i get it removed
  it wasnt this bad with only one getting your tubes tied dose not preven all pregnancy you like 30 more likely to have a tuble pregnancy that can kill you i got an iud and it failed he didnt start saying he hates them till we had the second one if i had known hed turn into such a shit father id have married someone else he always told me he wanted a family before we got married i was on the depo shot this time when i got pregnant not sure why they say the shit is so effective because its really not we wernt even having sex that often like maybe twice a month     lmao women are expected to put loads of chemicals and hormones into their body that are linked to cancer and all kinds of other health risks and abortion is far less safe and painless then a guy getting a vasectomy if a man knows 100 he dosent want kids he should take matters on himself to insure it doesnt happen thats not feminism its common sense that way he dosent wind up with children he doesnt want
  i only said that as a precaution     i have no intrest in finding another father figure for them  that doesnt have to be from a relationshipit could be a teacher a coach a family friend whatever all im saying is that there is at least a chance of it happening organically     very few good men want to get with a single mom and father another mans kids  true by all means focus on them and your own judgement is going to be the most reliable in telling when to split since only you have all the necessary information that hes not abusive is very good and in light of this information ill back up what other anons are saying about marriage counselingthere is a slight chance he may have a mental hangup which could be sorted out and something that mends your family back together is far preferable to either holding together a facade or tearing it apart     absolutely do not propose an open marriage this will not only doom chances of reconciliation involving change on his part of course but it will set an absolutely terrible example for your kids not only in itself but by greatly complicating and destabilizing your home life try to fix your marriage first and if that doesnt work then just focus on splitting dont let the marriage enter a state of undeath    ill defer to other anons on how best to approach him with the question of counseling but to help them out try to give us important things about your husbands personality like is he prone to shouting or does he close himself off when he gets angry what gets him offended what does he like about youanything
  my advice is for him to divorce you  sex is 100 apart of marriage   you relieve his cock he provides stability if you cant do that you have nothing of value to offer
    im having a really hard time believing your birth control stories     in a confidential study 40 of all women admitted they think its okay to trick a man into pregnancy by altering their birth control method you seem like that 40 because those implants are effective as fuck
  the marriage failed when he said he hates our children and decided to spend 90 of his time ignoring us i have tried to talk to him about this for the last 2 year and kissed his ass trying to get him to be happier and not dislike us so much there is nothing more i can do hes not going to change as a person because i keep talking at him he doesnt even talk back or respond to what im saying ive suggested therapy and he says no honestly staying to talk to him about it seems to make him even more short tempered with the kids and me so i just leave him be and try to do what he asks i dont sleep in the same bed as him because of our issues and he gets pissed if i wake him up when i get up at 3 for work i dont care if he sleeps around i just need him to not try to fuck me for a year or so till i can get enough money together to move out i dont use his money and i dont want anything from him im not going to go after him for child support or anything i just want to take my kids and live on our own once i have a few grand saved up but thats had to do fast because almost all my money goes towards our mortgage and bills
    have u tried talking to his parents
  oh well fuck me then you tried   but still you would be infinitely more disgusted with him if he were to actually sleep around which theres really no telling he isnt already it might sound like the logical solution but it wouldnt make anything better around the house     you say i just need him to not try and fuck me for a year like he still tries to which is confusing because you also make it sound like he hates you which is it and cant you just say no if he tries to have sex or is saying no hard for you
  he wont do counseling ive asked him two more then once our kids are only 3 and 1 they dont pick up on or understand much and ill be gone before they are old enough to he just dosent talk to us when hes pissed he doesnt really talk much anyways he works some and then games the rest of his time and has no interest in doing anything else if i force him into going to do something with me and the kids he is aggravated the whole time and makes us get done with it as soon as possible so he can go back home to his office and computer pretty much the only time he makes an effort to talk to me is if hes wanting pussy or head and i just cant take having sex with him id just as soon have him go fuck some girl at work or something and leave me alone i just need a little time so i can get money together to get out
  i cant ultra an iud the implant the thing in my fucking arm i didnt dig it out the depo shot is shitty and made me bleed all the time i still got the fucking thing but apparently got pregnant with it still idk maybe thats why i miscarried it says infant loss is a side effect if you become pregnant on it i definitely did not want to get pregnant again not eith my husband hating the kids we already have and our marriage in the toilet this pregnancy and miscarriage was the nail in its coffin you can believe what you want but i know what has actually happened
  alright then you really do have no choice unless youre absolutely certain on a timeframe of your leaving i still advise very strongly against opening your marriagewhile there is a small chance it will keep him away from you before the kids are old enough to figure out whats happening and itll be quicker than you think with the 3 year old its something which introduces a lot of extra uncertainty for numerous reasons which will make things much more difficult     for example id get extremely pissed if someone suggested an open relationship to me and he might do so tonot necessarily from a moral position but he might also interpret it as you trying to cuck him telling him otherwise wont necessarily convince him either and from what youve said he isnt the type to be open to debate  if your truly cant stand the sight of him then it is a last resort but this is something that you must absolutely not treat lightly youd be much better served learning how to say no in the meantime
  it is hard i try to be nice to him so hes less dicky to the kids hes not abusive but really unpleasant to be around if hes in a bad mood he uses me for sex and the little bit of money i bring in most of the time he just wants a blow job but other then when he wants that he just doesnt talk to me we will literally get done having sex and hell get up and leave the room and go right back to his computer no foreplay or cuddling after its been like that for over a year now its like he just gets bored with faping sometimes and so he uses me like a fleslight for a few minutes then hes done and goes back to what be was doing before if i try to be flirts or affection with him before the miscarriage hed just say hes busy and to leave his office
  that could be an addiction where he shuts everything else out can any psychfags confirm
    the guy sounds like hes burnt out no longer in love with his wife and isnt interested in parenting his kids     a marriage takes teamwork to raise the kid
  thats fucking disgusting im not sure why you would even allow a person to use your body like that have some respect for yourself
  im pretty sure if i tell him no for more then a month or so he will just start cheating on me anyways so i guess just let that happen its not that i cant stand the sight of him its that im terrified of the possibility of getting pregnant again and having sex makes me feel like i cant breath and am having a panic attack i love my kids more then anything in the world they are literally my only reason for living the thought of losing another baby or having to have an abortion would destroy me i think i might legitimacy loss my mind if it were to happen im still on depo now never stopped it from when i i misscaragied but if it failed once already i dont want to risk going threw that again
    lol of course this guy would say counseling the man is the problem so she should divorce and find her own happiness the father pays child support thats the best answer
  i do it so hell be in a good mood and be nice to the kids for a little its gotten so hard tho like i try to still do what he wants but its like i have to shut my brain off during it so i dont freak out and start crying its to hard to pretend to like it anymore i dont want him to see how much it freaks me out because it will upset him and put him in a bad mood but its gotten to hard to hide
    baming her for her husband being an asshole and expecting her to fix it wow
  almost everything i do is to try to please him for a long time i thought if i was just a better wife a better mother keep the kids quieter keep the house cleaner maybe he wouldnt be so unhappy with us maybe i could make him love me and our kids if i were just better i feel like losing that baby was a punishment because im not a good enough wife and mother i failed my kids and they are the only ones who matter to me at all
    a mans job is to provide for the wife and children emotionally and help out he doesnt do that he is the one that has failed men will aways blame women for their own shortcomings
  gotcha ive not got much to say about the sex issue its not unimportant your feelings on the matter are fully warranted and valid solving it properly requires focusing on other issues though so thats what im gonna do k    he said he wanted a family but now that he has one he cabt stand it  poking at this  will get us to the heart of it so first poke it seems there are some drastic differences between the reality of what its like to have a family and the expectations he had of what it would be like to have a family what are your thoughts there any idea what the disconnect could be
    you sound like the perfect woman and i admire your perseverance but you should be taking better care of yourself too i wish i could meet your man irl and smack the fuck out him for taking advantage of you but alas this is just /adv/     why dont you just kick his loser ass out of the house
   if i were you id save some money for when you can get away from the asshole stash as much as you can away month by month do your own thing for your own sanity cheat on him and find a good father for your kids
  yes thats totally true i think he thought hed be total 50s alpha male with perfect family hed never spent time around little kids he didnt have this huge overwhelming bond and love for them when they were born he was just like wyf annoying screaming crying shit monsters that stop me from doing what i want with my time he dosent take any joy in them like i love seeing them play and laugh he thinks its obnoxious and just wants them to be quiet and leave him alone i think its cute yo go take them to see santa he resents them for it because hed rather be at home on his computer i dont ever ask him to change diapers or help with potty training feed or dress them or anything like that anymore he would always just say i will later then not do it so i just stopped asking i thought if i dint ask him to do much hed be less annoyed by them but it doesnt seem to have worked
    terrified of getting pregnant  wont get tubes tied     the more i read your thread the more clear it becomes     you want a bunch of kids and a loving husband but you have neither the skills nor motivation to make the required money your husband makes the money hes the provider and he resents the people hes providing for    so
  i cant afford the mortgage and bills and food without him and im not perfect at all by any stretch of the imagination im not very smart im a push over i cant provide for my children by myself and i messed up their childhoods by not having better judgment when picking a husband    but i have come to realize that no matter how hard i try its not going to change his opinion of the kids or me
  do your kids and your husband a favor and kill you self so they dont have to grow with an unstable bad useless mother who cant do her only job have sex with the family provider
    this is actually very common men get a lot better with kids after age 5 but those first few years just seem like drudgery to them
    go fuck yourself degenerate
    heres the thing     i get that the guy is an uncaring snake but if hes making 80 or more of the money you really have no room to talk     heres a hypothetical lets say you switched roles would he suddenly be a happy father if he did not have to work    many men who are sole providers are so worn down from work they simply have no energy left add some kids to that and they feel like they are in hell
  would you say youve been raped at any point in your relationship ship you could have a case from what you describe your sexual encounters with him dont sound very willing at all but more like an obligation
  he only makes a dollar an hour more then i do and i work longer hours then him sometimes i dont want a bunch of kids i do want a loving husband but i dont think thats an unreasonable thing to want the two kids i have would be fine its just extremely hurtful to have your partner say hes happy you had a misscarage no i dont want another child but if i had had it i would have found a way to love and care for it its just really hurtful he dislikes our kids so much and was so happy and mean to me about it when i lost a pregnancy i can even understand him being realived that would have been fine but he was literally like o good i gucking hate kids anyways he said a bunch of stuff about kicking me in the stomach and pushing me down stairs too he would not actually do that but it was still really nasty to say hes even said he wishes i had aborted or second daughter
  should have thought about that fore he nutted in her and all that considered doesnt take the heat off him for being a cold blooded asshole that treats his wife like a sex toy
    wives telling police their husband raped them have about a zero chance of police helping     and even then it would totally fuck up her family
  the guy had a choice to get married and have a kid now it is his responsibility to provide for it this is life entitled assholes you have to take responsibility for your actions and be a fucking man not a whining little faggot
  source  it probably would but i doubt the kids hold him in any kind of regard and again she has to take care of herself to take care of him
  hes not he makes half i do work
  them not him
i dont have much advice op because youre in a real tough spot but i just want to say fuck all the unsympathetic people in this thread youre going through some legitimately tough times and youre trying your best i wish you the best
    ok    yeah if everything youve posted here is 100 true then your marriage is fucked might as well divorce when you can and youll need to come up with a job that can elevate you financially     good luck
  no its not rape hes a big guy if he wanted to force himself on me and i was really telling him no he definitely could i dont tell him no im consenting even if i really dont like it if i do really tell him no he leaves me alone hes in a worse mood then usual if i do but hes never forced me
    people are being unsympathetic because her story doesnt add up    if her story is true then hey sympathy to her but the impression im getting is     husband makes most of the money and is worn out   husband didnt want more kids after the first one and wife kept pushing for it    husband now feels trapped in screaming kid hell
  it is true i even worked full time threw both my pregnancies while he was in school he didnt get a job in his field and now we have all his student loans to pay back too and that eats up a lot of money as well if i were on my own i would have to pay that and id get a smaller house or appartment so my mortgage or rent and bills would be less i just need to save a little so i can do that
  he dose not make most of the money he works at a hardware store and only makes a dollar more an hour then i do i did not keep pushing them out i only have 2 kids he wasnt super involved with out first one but i thought it was mostly because women are better with babies most of the time he didnt get like this till we had our second one
  he was just like wyf annoying screaming crying shit monsters that stop me from doing what i want with my time  right this bit next what did he instead want to be doing with his time and how did the babbies prevent him from being able to leaving all the childcare duties up to you should translate to loads of free time for him no
  playing games on the computer and thats literally what he dose all day every day except for the 6 hours hrs at work youd think he be happy with that but hes not he still cant stand then and gets annoyed any time he hears them or they come around him
    sounds like he thought being a dad would be great but he hates the reality of it    sad
  makes sense to me she has no emotional support from him though he agreed to have another kid to make her happy marriage takes work and compromise and hes done a 180 on what he agreed to do to keep his wife happy now he only sees the glass half full thats on him shes looking for validation and deserves it really but the this isnt the place to get it lady    ive legit been in your spot and discovered my husband had an emotional affair with a new girl at work that may or may not have become physical we almost split but he was doing the exact same thing you are getting financial help from old guys i knew and dad to file for divorce and find a lawyer was the best thing i did the cost of court plus his lawyer plus future child support plus him having to find a new place plus a new loving woman plus losing kid etc became a reality and he backed out and stopped lusting after the other girl lost a lot of money while i was adamant the show some respect or id keep going through with the divorce he was still an asshole but he started being nicer to me and our baby we should have gotten counseling immediately    instead now two years later hes sober and not even interested in sex with me got a therapist to lie about me to now hes ready to divorce me still an asshole to me but therapist doesnt get to see that so to him hes doing great probably found another younger thing to lust after even if you dont want it file for divorce and custody op it might make him reconsider and attend therapy with you
  get rid of him then why is this complicated
  yeah not wanting sex seems to kill a lot of relationships it sounds like you have a good reason to be bitter though
  why the fuck would i be upset in this situation seriously how could you think so i second   id be ecstatic itd be the far easiest least complicated as well as the best option
   he wont he doesnt care about me    sounds like thats your issue senpai youll need to work that out first
you chosed the wrong person and you are willing to sacrifice your entire life and the emotional development of your kids to stick to your shit decision  suffer well
  i think its bizarre to insist that theres anything this lady can do to change the mans mind sure its her whos asking for advice so it makes sense to think in lanes of what she can do but i think its pretty obvious that if we take a step back and consider who of the two of them that actually needs to change the most  because this is very much a twoperson dilemma  its proooobably the guy when we consider who needs to make an effort we also need to consider who wants to make an effort and again here it should be pretty obvious that this lady has already been pretty fucking willing and this guy has already been pretty fucking unwilling  its awe inspiring but also naive and sad and bloody fucking cool that this lady hasnt given up yet but by all means giving up on him and focusing on how to get by on her own premise is the only thing that makes sense really
op get counseling and therapy while you are at it miscarriage is a form trauma and should be treated additionally if you want to suck it up for the kids sake then get some counseling thats the very least that your kids deserve    good luck youll need it
these things itch like a mf whenever they fucking want to and it feels amazing when you scratch but end up bleeding a little or has a tiny tiny bit of pus come out ive been putting on antibiotic ointment but idk how i got this shit does anyone know what this is or how to get rid of it please
  im going thru hell this shits so damn ugly i need a cure asap i looked all over online  im about to go to a doctor
    hahaha this reminds me of when i did dry anal and the next time i pooped it hurt like a mofo out of hell and the poop had all this white stuff and fresh and dried blood like itd formed next to a healing wound and i posted a pic of the poop on /adv/ and thats almost like you posting your nasty skin and your dic and like yeah i hope you figure it out
i dont talk to my dad and have no intention to if anyone presses me about loving thy father and how that means i should suffer a terrible relationship with him i just say he died he has a third wife or whatever which is good but he also had a son whos satisfied never speaking to him again    i tell myself stories about how im better off without him and how i have no obligation to speak to him i guess the best i can wish for him in regards to that is that he also tells himself a story which makes him feel okay about our lack of a relationship    does that make sense when i was forced to live with him i felt so terrible it was my whole life that sucked back then not just his abuse id probably just mentally dissociate if i encountered him more so than i already do    do any of you have similar experiences where you totally disconnect from a bad past but have some societal expectation or moral obligation to return to it my fathers side of the family has given up trying to contact me maybe because they think im bad for not maintaining some form of contact with my father maybe they mistakenly think i have no interest in them
  tldr  do any of you have similar experiences where you totally disconnect from a bad past but have some societal expectation or moral obligation to return to it
i stopped talking to my abusive dad when i was 11 he died when i was 16 looking back i had no regrets not that it fell on me because i was just a kid but i mean if someone has really hurt you and shows no remorse for it then honestly what is the point whats the lesson in that him being out of my life was the best thing that happened to me im convinced he made me this anxious person i am today if you need closure i suggest you get it because thats the one thing i still think about but no i dont think anyone deserves to be in their childrens lives if they didnt make an effort to be there
  if a loving father died youd grieve for him on and off for a long time if a nonloving father disappears from your life you are going to grieve in the same way
went out with girl went fine except i didnt have enough money for the movies on accidentpaid for most of it not a good look now shes avoiding me kind of talk to her since very cold     fuck man this sucks i wanna text her and ask to make up but i dont wanna seem thirsty abandon ship or try and make amends
  it was an honest mistake and shed be quite a bitch if that was the reason for being distant maybe it was something else
  thats what i thought also i should add that she caught me by surprise and asked me to meet her before the movie i was a little busy at the time and ended up being a little later than i said i was going to be also     i think it was more of those two things but i still felt like a i deserve a second chance     she was asking my colleagues if i was single how did i fuck this up this badly i was completely normal i swear
  well your date didnt go as expected but thats not a reason for it to be over play it cool dont get to overhelmed and for the love of god dont bother her with apologies just ask for another date
im currently studying in community college and i want to decide on which major to proceed with would computer engineering be a better choice if you want to learn both computer science and engineering or would computer science be a better option for software sorry if this a loaded question i am 23 and need to make a decision by 2019 and i know very little of programming currently
bump thanks

  cs has better job prospects from what i have heard engineering degrees are also good but are harder than cs
  theyre basically the same in terms of difficulty but more people have heard of cs so more people do it its not exactly an overdone field but computer engineering is less common    compsci is basically really heavy math a lot of times its even in the math department compeng will have more of a focus on hardware but will also cover software and cs will cover hardware some just not as much    in my opinion embedded software dev and cybersecurity are both enjoyable and really good in terms of longterm job prospects and for those an engineering degree would be better but computer science would also be workable what you should do is compare the classes between the two programs theyll have a lot in common post the ones that are different and think about which ones youre more interested in we can better help you make a decision    since youre in community college the most important factor is that you talk to advisors at both your current school and the school youre planning to get your bachelors from it will really suck if you go to cc for a few years and then have to retake a bunch of classes when your credits transfer as engineering for nonmajors    me i did a bachelors in eleceng and masters in compeng and work in the embedded/security space
  thank you very much ill be home soon to get it up but my chocies are osu or uk university of kentucky ill get the information soon as im driving rn
im gonna finish university at 28 years old am i too gramps    i dropped my first career because emotional problems got a second chance at life and i entered uni at 24 years
  too old for what to get a job
whats the rush
  no most of my classmates are young fresh festive fellas 2024 years i feel too old      the rush of feeling old
    who cares as long as you get a job and live a happy life thats all that matters    its not like its a race out there friend you can get a job with a degree at 28 years old right
weird situation here     this girl i used to kinda go on some dates with but havent really talked to for years just hit me up asking to borrow some money we started talking again since shes applying for a job at the company i work for and i think shes gonna get it    but i rarely loan money and its a reasonably large amount the super scumbaggy side of my brain tells me i should ask her to do something sexual for it but thats a nogo as hot as it sounds bad for my career bad for me as a human    but i think shes going to be my coworker in a matter of days and i dont know how to tell her no and not breed resentment ideas
  havent really talked to for years just hit me up asking to borrow some money  wouldnt get it from me doesnt matter male or female
  i mean weve been talking recently past here months or so and have kept in touch in and off but its not someone i see every day by any means
  its a reasonably large amount    tell her you wouldnt feel comfortable to lend so much money and that she should go to a bank and ask for a loan  it may feel bad to say no now but imagine how it would feel if you had to ask when you wanted all that money back  i dont know you and i dont know her but if you have trouble saying no id guess you would have even more trouble collecting dept
  ill also mention shes a total smokeshow and ever since i saw her in adult friend finder one day ive had fantasies about paying her for sex this isnt something i do but with her it became a weird fantasy even though there was a time i could have gotten it for free    i know that shouldnt matter here but my boner is exploding and im off to the office in just a few minutes
  its well within my means i wouldnt say its a ton but its not like shes asking for 40
start out saying something like no offense against you or please dont take this personally then onto but lending money is just something i dont do or i dont believe in lending money to friends blah blah if she cant respect your boundaries without acting like a child thats her problem not yours
my rule of thumb is i would only lend money to someone if i would also give them that money without expecting it back    so in this case i probably wouldnt if shes going to resent you for not lending her money shes a cunt and youre probably better off staying away from her anyways of course the situation shes in is also important do you know what she needs that money for and if she has anyone else she could borrow it from
if you dont want to loan it just say no or you dont have it the only thing weird about this situation is that you kinda went on some dates years ago it didnt go anywhere but youre still in contact for some reason and shes asking you for financial favors sounds like shes leveraging your sexual interest in her for her own gain i know that sounds cynical but it happens and thats what this situation looks like dont expect to get your dick sucked or anything like that if you do go through with it
    just jack of if you are needy now    if she is gonna work at the same company dont pay her for sex  its gonna backfire so hard      id say if you have to think about it and you are asking strangers on the internet its definitely not in your means and its troubling you a lot
sorry i dont loan money to anyone
  say no its that simple you can say something along the lines of im sorry but i have a rule not to loan money to friends or acquaintances it ends up being a strain on the relationship being assertive is not being an asshole if resentment grows because you didnt give someone a loan thats on them not on you
  this is good advice op
  if resentment grows because you didnt give someone a loan thats on them not on you    this so much this
  i saw her in adult friend finder  reasonably large amount  going to be my coworker in a matter of days  wait until she fails the drug test then become her pimp
just tell her all of your excess cash is in an ira and you cant take it out
  i would actually ghost someone if they just randomly popped up into my life again for money    she sounds like shes a garbage can
  if she wasnt a girl who you used to kind of go on some dates with sounds like she milked you for free meals then ghosted you would you entertain the idea when would you lend people money how much  if she isnt someone you really know or can trust dont if she is asking for money because she cant keep on top of her own costs dont  regardless of if you will work with her or not she cant hold not giving her money against you tell her you dont have the money tell her its too close to christmas or to ask her parents for money you owe her nothing i dont understand why you consider giving a woman who wasnt in you any money    dont offer to fuck her for cash dont let her offer to do anything for money she will just use it against you dont discuss it via anything that cant be recorded eg texts friends a money dont mix friends and business dont mix colleagues and money certainly dont mix
  i wont be working here much longer but yeah      she says she cant find anyone else to borrow from its for a bill that she only needs to take care of before getting a job       i actually had to drop her when we were going out we had an age difference both of our lives were tumultuous and i couldnt drive across the city to try to hook up with a 17 year old anymore this was more than 5 years ago
  tell her to fuck off
cant pee after anal  everytime me and bf engage in anal instead of vaginal i cant pee for like a day like physically cant  i can feel that i have to pee i can sit on the toilet trying for 15mins and nothing dont know what to do as boyfriend want anal but i hate not being able to pee for a day  what do
  wants
doctor time
  too embarrassed as im young and still live with my parents
  tell your boyfriend you cant pee after anal wtf how is that so hard     and before you think about his feelings know that hes grateful he could even get his penis up everytime you fuck your bodily functions are as much of a priority as his
  does it happen only after anal do you feel pressure in your bladder all the time or any pain in your urinary tract or kidneys and how old are
  patient came in who was pooing from her vagina turns out a can of hairspray was shoved up her butt and had been there so long her body was rerouting the bowel movements to the closest hole
  man what the fuck
this isnt normal and you need to see a doctor or stop having anal sex backing up urine for a month is a recipe for disaster youre going to end up with an infection or damaging your kidneys and/or bladder
  this one  just stop having anal     if this is a problem youre too young for sex
  are you fat
  that is the most bizarre medical story that i have ever heard
  yes only after anal and i dont feel any pressure or pain all the time i do get utis often though  lets just say i was born in 2000
  bmi 178 so im underweight
  ive already told him multiple times but he just keks
  withhold sex then if he doesnt agree
  he gave up porn for me so i try to do everything he wants whenever he wants
  but you cant fucking pee wtf just lay off the anal till you get to see a doctor
  okay will try to see one
is it good idea to meet my female friends friends on a ball dancing she may introduce me to one of her pretty friends who is slightly older than me i am kv and awkward when meeting more new people at the same time
  it depends   are you a good dancer  also ball dancing is fucking gayyyy
  not really good dancer most people go there to have fun with people and drink a bit ball is organized by our university and a lot of people are going to balls here in general
  bump give me advice
why do i feel so heckin uncomfortable around men  whenever im with some male i just cant help but feel super uncomfortable with the whole situation and want to leave immediatly like i literally get the urge to run why is that    is it like trust issues or do i secretly feel intimidated 
heckin    anxiety
  youre not attracted to men and anxiety
  im pretty sure that im like both into women and men but sometimes i do find men really nice to be around but like in these date situations when i dont know them long enough i feel completely awkward and get this feeling of flight 
pretty sure most women are pure spaghetti around men
  did you watch too much love story its cliché try to see them as a friend
so tell me about your father
my friend is having a really shitty time but wont let anyone help her she hasnt hung out with any of her friends in weeks now she is very busy with school but its mostly because she procrastinates and gets very little done which is unusual for her     shes in 18 credits works an 8hr a week job and decided to pledge a professional frat so she is busy too busy and she absolutely hates everything about the frat but wants it for her resume the only time she gets out of her apt is when she has pledge events next semester shes taking less credits so i hope that helps but who knows    the other night she texted me apologizing for being a terrible person when i asked about it she said nothing was bothering her she was just drunk shes trying to give everyone the impression everything is fine but it obviously isnt i dont know how to get through to her or if i should even try
  why do you even know all these details why do you make her your personal responsibility is it that you want to doink her
  she tells me shes not my personal responsibility but its been weeks and i know shes doing bad i feel bad because i have been friends with her for years and i have empathy     im going to be honest im unsure of the doinking at the end of the summer my girlfriend broke up with me i was so fucked up at the time this girl asked me like a week later if i wanted to go out with her i got pissed at her told her off and we didnt talk for a few weeks shes always been a friend and when she asked me out right after my gf dumped me i felt kinda betrayed like she was just waiting for her moment     i dont know if that has anything to do with this i guess i personally feel somewhat responsible for her current mood considering i pretty much rejected her
tell her to cut back on work school is important and sooner or later she will have to choose one or the other
  are you portuguese or russian
  thanks based accent poster
how am i supposed to be happy when you cant support yourself or have friends and family without compromising your values
your family and teachers lied to you most people arent happy in life
  i know that already i want to be happy though
  becoming happy doesnt come without extremely hard work you have to work towards doing what will make you happy otherwise youll be stuck doing something that doesnt make you happy its that simple
  either your values are wrong or your friends and family are wrong i recommend reflecting on these things and what kind of life you want to lead likely youll either discover that your ideological/philosophical/spiritual beliefs are actually destructive or youll discover that the people you surround yourself with are destructive      thats exactly why you should not seek to live like most people though one thing ive found is that as people were prone to only thinking in terms of community so when i had stupid destructive friends i felt that most people in the world were miserable manipulative struggling and untrustworthy later when i happened to stumble into a situation where i was surrounded by really good people i felt like most people were happy creative kind and worldly then when i stumbled into a situation where i was surrounded by office types i felt like most people in the world were soulless ladder climbers all these different kinds of people exist in the world you just need to seek out the right ones they will very strongly influence who you are
  your friends and family are wrong  i think this is true but its very difficult for me to make friends already and it seems only a very small minority are more interested in living a life of merit than fitting in
  without compromising your values  what are your values
  they say 20s suck for this reason early 20s are hardly adulthood thanks to economics some people grow up fast and become involved in a trade of some kind but the majority of people our age are condemned to college and figuring themslves out debt and poverty    the only way out is to either emancipate yourself from society like some monk or to buckle down and do what it takes to become financially independent and stable    if this is an emotional problem where you feel like you emotionally need to depend on other people that is differentbeing stuck with each other is kind of the human condition but thankfully in todays world there are a lot of people so if you get on your feet then youre gauranteed to meet people who make you feel happy and proud
  the only way out is to either emancipate yourself from society like some monk  i would but i want to start a family  to buckle down and do what it takes to become financially independent and stable  im an engineering student but the thought of my livelihood being dependent on someone else scares me and i feel like i dont have support system to gain the skills to gain financial independence without wagecuckery im keeping my hopes up for chainlink but i know its dumb to bank on the success of a financial asset so im trying to make sure i have a plan
  youre an engineering student but since all labor even highly skilled labor is unpredictable so your solution is to look towards digital coin instead of having a job
  what are you not good with english or something
  fuck you
  okay
